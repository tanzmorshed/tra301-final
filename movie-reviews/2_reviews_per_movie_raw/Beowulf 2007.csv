"MR_Heraclius","8","39","42","23 February 2020"," Decent movie
","It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages."
"lexo1770","8","119","156","19 March 2008"," Better than I expected
","I didn't expect a lot from 'Beowulf', for lots of reasons, most of which were to do with the casting: incorrigibly cockney Ray Winstone as a warrior from what's now southern Sweden; wacky John Malkovich as a cynical counselor; loony Crispin Glover as a flesh-rending monster, and weirdest of all, Angelina Jolie as the monster's mother...thaet waes wundorlic castyng, as the poet might have put it. Then there was the way they did the whole thing in CGI, running the risk of making it all look a bit rubbery. Finally, Robert Zemeckis is the director and my great respect for him plummeted through the floor and into the crawlspace after he presided over the insufferable 'Forrest Gump'.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a lot better than I thought it would be. I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release, but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it. This is a 'Beowulf' where the story, although different from the poem, is actually very far from shabby.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the main difference from the poem is that in the poem, there is no connection between the monster Grendel and his mother on one hand, and the dragon in the latter half of the poem on the other hand. In the film, a connection exists. Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary do a professional job of tying it all together in a satisfying Hollywood way, without betraying the basic darkness and sadness of the story; it's not like Beowulf rides off into the sunset with Wiglaf at the end. Crispin Glover is genuinely scary as the tormented and raw-boned Grendel, whose main problem is that he just can't stand the sound of people having fun, although since most of this fun consists of hairy men singing lewd songs you can see his point. Angelina Jolie's animated self spends all her on screen time walking around without any clothes on, something that apparently gave Jolie a blush when she saw a cut of the movie. (One of the more eerie things about this film is that the cartoon Angelina Jolie looks marginally more realistic than the actress herself.)<br/><br/>Despite an accent that's more Stockwell than Geatland, Ray Winstone does a fine, sombre job as the hero, although my wife thought that the animated Winstone looked more like Sean Bean. Brendan Gleeson does a splendid job in the niche he's carved for himself of Hairy Sidekick. The acting honours, or at least the animation honours, go to Robin Wright Penn (or whoever worked on her character) as the pale and melancholy queen; she has moments of subtle hesitation and sadness that struck me as a triumph of CGI acting. <br/><br/>There is much excellent smiting, some of it unfortunately toned down a little in order to keep a PG-13 rating - so we don't actually get to see Grendel biting men's heads off, just people's reactions to him doing so. Most importantly, the story is not a travesty of the original. It's thoughtful and interesting, as you'd expect from a writer of Gaiman's quality (if not from the author of 'Killing Zoe') and contains some striking meditations on the power of legend and reputation. Plus, there's a really huge kick-ass dragon. 'Beowulf' is a strange and unexpected treat."
"cdemw","8","171","265","17 November 2007"," Surprisingly Good - A 3D Treat
","When going into the theatre to see this I in two minds - it was my first 3D movie and I had heard good things, however I wasn't particularly taken by the concept or the trailers. I was unsure what to expect, however I ended up leaving the cinema extremely satisfied with the film, and tellingly, unable to stop discussing it long after the ride home.<br/><br/>Visually it is an absolute treat, Zemeckis uses 3D superbly, some of the camera angles and sequences are as great an art as the photo-realistic animation. Occasionally the odd shot appears where the impression is that it was set up solely to emphasise the 3D (e.g. starting at the end of a branch and panning out) and whilst this doesn't add to the film it is actually a pleasant reminder of the novelty of 3D.<br/><br/>There are only two areas that let Beowulf down aesthetically: the eyes and the mouth. The eyes were static throughout and it is the little details that make the difference when trying to make something as uber-realistic as this, such as the fact that the pupils didn't react to light. As for the lips - they're just not quite there yet - sometimes the speech didn't seem to be quite right.<br/><br/>The characters are expertly introduced and developed, most notably Anthony Hopkins character, Hrothgar and the tension between his wife. Grendell and his mother are wonderfully creepy and seductive, and bizarrely enough almost encourage sympathy.<br/><br/>For me the most disappointing part of the film was actually Ray Winstone as the titular character - he was fantastic when talking in a low growl, however the film really suffers when he shouts in full cockney accent. ""I will kill your monstah!"". I half expected Grendell's head to be smashed between a car and it's door. John Malkovitch is a saving grace with his none-more-sinister voice and interesting faith sub-plot.<br/><br/>The rating for this film has been hotly discussed and in my opinion I do not think it is suitable for children under the age of 12. Grendell would have truly terrified me as a child. The violence, as well as bawdiness, does not make it a family film for young children although having said that the lewd references do provide good humour and balances out the movie.<br/><br/>So, overall, this was worthy of an 8. Breathtaking animation, incredible action (especially the finale featuring an excellent dragon) and a generally brilliant cast. Beowulf throws down the gauntlet to film-makers to show what can be done with 3D and is an indication of the potential. It's not all the way there yet, but it's a damn good start."
"KenLiversausage","9","159","248","18 November 2007"," Glorious 3D treat requiring little brain engagement
","This movie is a lot of fun. In 3D. I suspect its impact will be considerably diminished in 2D, so I urge anyone who wants to see it to seek out the 3D version. There are lots of beautifully constructed tracking shots where the camera glides and swirls forward, back up and down, and trees, rocks, arrows, dragons or whatever slip past the edges of the frame, and this effect is stunning in 3D. In fact, all the action scenes are stunning in 3D, particularly the climactic battle with a top-notch, fire belching monster of a dragon.<br/><br/>The plot isn't much to write home about (although there's just a hint of a theological debate about the way Christianity has displaced the old mythic religions, which made me think for about 5 seconds). The acting is variable - Robin Wright-Penn is fine, but about as sexy as a paper cup, Hopkins is his usual reliable self, Ray Winstone is suitably heroic as the heroic, self-aggrandising Beowulf, and Crispin Glover is just brilliant as Grendel. Grendel is a lovely creation, oozing slime and blood, and wracked with pain.<br/><br/>But who cares about all that. This is not a scholarly work, it's entertainment. And my wife and I were as royally entertained as the kids surrounding us in the cinema (and we're both 40-somethings). Leave your serious head (and any timid youngsters) at home, and go and have fun."
"Astralan","7","99","155","21 November 2007"," To CGI or Not to CGI, that is the question?
","I have read Beowulf a couple of times. It's great northern European mythology, and mandatory reading when you are young in my opinion (Along with Norse, Greek and Roman Mythology as well). And though the movie wants to re-write some of the epic, you will need to separate the Hollywood version from the beautiful measure of the original works. Being a work of CGI, you will also have to allow for the flaws of pure CGI work. Very stylized and beautifully colored, it is an epic adventure that elevated Zemeckis' previous work ""The Polar Express"" to a new level. Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book, but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical. Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here, it did make me pause and wonder:<br/><br/>Why didn't Robert Zemeckis just direct this thing in real life instead of virtual?<br/><br/>With the capabilities of dropping in CGI into real life action, this telling of the story could have had so much more of an impact if the expressions were more poignant. Look what he did with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""? Zemeckis is fully capable of it. Also, to add to this, when you have CGI characters like Jacksons Gollum and King Kong to compare notes with, the modeling here just isn't up to snuff. I felt the entire movie came off like a gigantic ""cut-scene"" to a video game than a full featured animated project. I can only give this a little better than a good, hence the exclamation. I do this sadly. You really should see this in a theater, bigger than life. The dragon is excellent, the ugly v/s the beautiful is wild, the sequencing is uneven, though at the end it takes you on a great ride. Oh, and for you people that want to go see Angela Jolie nekkid? IT'S CGI!!! I've seen harder stuff on Fox networks! Seeing my wife and I saw this as a matin√©e, the crowd was on the sparse side and there was literally no kids present. I couldn't get a solid feeling from the audience though most people as they left seemed genuinely happy with their experience. I'm sure it was PG13'd because of the sequences with Angela, otherwise it would be a solid PG. I wouldn't suggest this for a kid under 8."
"wesleythomaswilliams","8","240","394","12 November 2007"," This is a cinema experience for sure!
","Just this minute got back from seeing a free preview of Beowulf and OH MY GOD! This is a cracking film and I highly recommend everyone goes to the cinema to see it (it's a cinema experience for sure!). Not only that, but it's 3D (which I wasn't aware of) or rather the all new 3D (no more red/green glasses). Everyone in the audience was given what looked like cheap-ass shades, but they did the job wonderfully and fitted snugly over my regular specs.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the plot was tight and well scripted, the voice acting was great (Ray Winstone rocks), the action was breathtaking, some of the CGI was unbelievably gorgeous and the music and incidental sound was great! The only downside for me was some of the CGI. It seemed apparent that given an unlimited budget, this movie would have looked phenomenal in every scene, but unfortunately the budget wasn't unlimited and it shows in a number of places. Nothing looks horrible, but you can tell that they had to pick and choose where to go for high detail. The movie also suffers from the age old, it's creepy because it's almost perfect.<br/><br/>As for the 3D, apart from an awesome intro, nothing seems to be done just to exploit 3D, it's all very natural and adds an amazing level of detail to the movie. The depth of vision you get is truly breathtaking in parts.<br/><br/>Quite honestly I wasn't expecting much from this movie having seen the trailer, but I was blown away. I've not been this excited leaving the cinema in a long long time!"
"mikerichards","8","280","467","13 November 2007"," Fun, handsome, but spoilt by 3D
","Pretty much everyone knows the story of Beowulf - man fights monster, monster's mum and then a dragon - but this ancient story has inspired generations of writers and academics, now it gets a shiny makeover courtesy of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary.<br/><br/>Beowulf (the man) could have been written as a cookie-cutter hero, but fortunately he's something else - fallible and not yet the hero he must become later in the movie. But (and this is really hard without spoiling the movie), the battle that turns him into a hero also leads inexorably to his undoing. That's something the two writers have brought to the millennia old text and it works perfectly to help fill in some of the gaps in the original poem and provide a back story to events. <br/><br/>A special mention also to Crispin Glover's Grendel. I wasn't particularly struck with the physical realisation of the monster, but the performance is knock out. Instead of just being a rampaging beast, Grendel is almost something to be pitied - a misshapen outcast with noisy neighbours, and his final scene is remarkably touching. Oh and if you don't understand Grendel, you clearly haven't been keeping up with your Old English classes!<br/><br/>But let's be honest, everyone watches a movie about Vikings for the action. And Beowulf delivers this in spades. Here comes my first proviso - Beowulf in the UK is getting a 12A rating, but there is no way I would take a 12 year old to see this film in all its eye-ball spearing, spine-snapping, ligament-tearing glory. This movie would get a higher rating had it been shot in real-life and it's worth considering this before packing the kids into the car. Mostly the violence is justified, but it is there and it's NOT cartoony.<br/><br/>The animation is the talking point of this movie, and its a real step on from the zombified performance of 'Polar Express'. The impression of living, breathing flesh is almost complete with the exception of strangely dead eyes - this movie is a landmark in computer imagery. The majority of the characters are stunningly rendered (Beowulf in particular) in close up, but they somehow look less convincing at a distance. Generally the men are better done than the women, with Queen Wealthow the spitting image of Julie Andrew's queen in Shrek 2.<br/><br/>So, its a violent special effects triumph - could anything be wrong?<br/><br/>Actually yes.<br/><br/>Two things. One - the accents. Oh dear god in heaven above what were they thinking - this is a treasure house of appalling voices, Irish(ish), Scottish(ish), Welsh(ish) are all thrown into the mix, but the standout horrors are Jon Malkovich's take on Danish which might have been inspired by the Muppets and Angelina Jolie dusting off her accent from 'Alexander'. <br/><br/>The second is the 3D projection. For reasons best known to studio executives we're all meant to get very excited by 3D all over again. Beowulf is one of the first movies to be released in the UK using REALD - a system familiar to anyone who has been to a Disney park in the last 20 years. The animators of Beowulf clearly had great fun working out new ways of making things jump out of the screen at the audience, but the effect becomes slightly wearisome after a minute or two. Fortunately things settle down later in the movie and the makers stop trying to show off their new technology. <br/><br/>More disappointing, the poor quality of the Polaroid glasses you have to wear make the image slightly blurry and spoilt by reflections. After years waiting for the crystal clarity of digital projection, the whole thing has been undone by a gimmick. If you have a choice, you might be better off seeing a regular 2D version.<br/><br/>A final comment, Beowulf spends part of the movie naked, bet you can't watch it and not think of Austin Powers."
"earderne","1","124","200","23 November 2007"," Missed chance, this is not the poem.
","This film has impressive special effects and would be okay as an adventure fantasy but it should not be marketed as the epic poem.Also it has been given the wrong rating and should be an R. Why all the changes? Grendel's mother was not a gold painted,nude,Barbie doll in stiletto heels.Grendel was not Hrothgar's son. Beowulf killed the witch he did not have sex with her.The dragon was not Beowulf's son and had no connection with the witch.Beowulf was not made Hrothgar's heir,nor did he marry his widow and become king of the Danes.In the poem Beowulf returned to Geatland after slaying Grendel. He remained the Geat king's best warrior,supporting him and the son who succeeded him. Only after the new king died did Beowulf become king of the Geats until his own death in later years.Also, why all the nudity in this film? This was Scandinavian northern Europe in the Dark Ages - folk would have Bean in furs and heavy woollens most of the time.The cartoon-like actors didn't help either with bland faces and expressionless eyes.<br/><br/>A far better movie 'Beowulf and Grendel' was made in 2004,filmed on location in Iceland,with an excellent cast of real actors and no CGI. The Iceland born Canadian director,Sturla Gunnarson,tried to get back to what could have been the original story that evolved over the centuries into the legend.It was gritty,made on a shoestring and had only limited cinema release,but thankfully it is available on DVD and is well worth a look.There is also an excellent companion DVD documentary called 'Wrath of Gods'which tells the incredible story of the filming of the movie, and the struggle to complete it with financial problems and the absolute hell of shooting it at the start of the Icelandic winter.<br/><br/>The new 'Beowulf' has also tried to ride on the coattails of '300', but again it suffers by not having real actors showing their courage and emotions.'300' scenes were like paintings come to life and the Spartans' impressive physiques and fighting skills were real,after hard training,with no computer enhancement.<br/><br/>An interesting point is the actor who links these three films - charismatic Gerard Butler.He was fiery yet also sensitive as King Leonidas and the earlier Beowulf and made the roles his own.<br/><br/>This 2007 film is a missed opportunity to bring the epic poem to life."
"Tinuvielas","5","87","138","13 November 2007"," A mildly amusing mix of ""Shrek"", ""300"" and computer-games
","Take a thousand year old heroic subject matter, spice it up with a dose of ¬Ñmodern"" morals such as ¬Ñmen's only weakness is women"" , add a few females according to type ¬ñ e.g. saints and whores ¬ñ and shoot this script as a CGI-mix of ¬ÑShrek"", ¬Ñ300"" and popular computer-games: The result is Robert Zemecki's version of ¬ÑBeowulf"". Works alright, the flick, as long as you don't take it seriously. However, whenever the ¬ÑShrek""-Elements dominate the scene, the film runs into problems. Queen Wealtheow for instance fatally resembles the green Oger's mom. Besides, almost all Characters have a squint that would make Christopher Lambert at his best look good. Wet hair is still a problem of computer-graphics, too. Otherwise, the film is technically well made and gives you an idea how far Ralph Bakshi might have gone with his concept of graphically alienated live-action.<br/><br/>Still, over long stretches the motion-capture-technique is too reminiscent of computer-games to be convincing, and thus one is left with the question which audience this film is aimed at. Gaming kiddies can't watch it because all the ripping and tearing is far too bloody; adult Lord-of-the-Rings-fans will miss the depth of the original poem, despite some nice touches in the script ¬ñ such as King Hrothgar talking of ¬ÑScops"" or giving out rings to his thanes in the initial sequence, or Grendel and his mother seeming to talk Anglo-Saxonish. The linguistic climax of the movie is elsewhere, anyway: King Hrothgar, embodied (well, sort of) by Anthony Hopkins, telling his followers that Beowulf ¬Ñkilled the monster and laid his mother... in her grave"". How do you translate that for synchronized versions? This sequence gets to the heart of the difference of plot between the script and the heroic poem, i.e. the introduction of the eternal female temptation as motif for the hero's curse. Not a bad idea, really, especially in view of the traditional sword-penis-symbolism that is being exploited thoroughly in this film. Unfortunately, the way they put the idea on screen is cheesy to say the least. Thus Angelina Jolie's computerized curves seem designed to lure the average movie-goer, male, mid-twenties, meager intellect (is that according to statistics?). The hero Beowulf (one can't speak of actors or characters in this film) is modeled on the Gladiator but lacks his character; the monster is a crossbreed of Ent and skinned Gollum; the jokes are laconic (example: ""How is your father? ¬ñ Dead.""). Amusing ¬ñ and once in a while appealing in a darkly beautiful manner, especially when a whiff of northern Epic or landscape transcends the CGI. In these moments one gets an inkling of what might have been done with this script. Even the final fight with the dragon is impressive. But why does the dragon have a heart, small as a cow's? Why does the coast-guard sit in front of his fire in the pouring rain? And why does the final, unbearably long shot have to be so unbearably kitsch? Shame, really. You can either have grim realism, or you can have exaggerated, bad-taste fantasy. Try to amalgamate both, and the thing falls apart."

"WriterDave","6","60","94","18 November 2007"," Chasing the Dragon
","*The following is a review of the digital 3D version showing at select theaters: <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has always been a trailblazer with film technology. He was among the first to utilize CGI in ""Death Becomes Her"" and with his adaptation of the oldest surviving epic poem in the English language, he perfects the life-like digital computer animation he first experimented with in ""The Polar Express"". Like his canon of films over the years, ""Beowulf"" is an eye-popping mixed bag of cinematic tricks.<br/><br/>The animation has come to a point where it is eerily life-like. In ""Beowulf"" every blade of grass, every tree branch, and every strand of hair has been painstakingly detailed. And while it is hard to tell the difference between the digital Angelina Jolie and the real Angelina Jolie, there's still something about the human face, the nuances of the muscular features, the emotion running beneath, that this technology will never capture. It still depicts hollow, cold clones of real human beings that could never fully replace 3D flesh and blood.<br/><br/>What makes ""Beowulf"" so entertaining is the digital 3D technology. It creates some breathtaking vistas where you feel as if the landscapes are moving through you. In some of the more horrific scenes with Grendel, you'll find yourself jumping out of your skin. Zemeckis is like a magician with this technology. He's able to bleed something out of nothing by knowing how to get the reactions he wants from his audience with just the right sound effect, camera angle, and quick-cut to complete his trick. It's often ugly, but quite breathtaking.<br/><br/>Zemeckis loses some ground when he relies too much on juvenile machismo grandstanding to further character development. Sure, I love a good death by chandelier scene or a man getting ripped in half by a monster bit as much as the next guy, but all the bawdy humor wears thin. Even lamer was the scene where Beowulf fights Grendel in the buff, which contained almost as many laugh inducing sight gags as the scene where Bart skateboarded nude through Springfield in this summer's ""The Simpsons Movie."" <br/><br/>The mixed bag of tricks and sometimes slow build-up, however, eventually lead to a totally thrilling finale where Beowulf does battle with the dragon his misdeeds begot. In 3D, it's nerve-shattering fun. As an action adventure film, it makes the mark.<br/><br/>Ultimately you realize why this story has survived over 1200 years. ""Beowulf"" makes legendary the idea of a hero's fallibility and the global consequences of the sins of the father. These are universal themes that have been sung again and again in everything from Shakespeare to this year's best film, ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead."" While the technology used to make this film may seem dated in a few years, the story will live on, and this just may be the definitive ""Beowulf"" for high school English teachers to use in their lame attempts to connect with their students. The savvier kids won't be fooled, but there's worse ways to pass the time in class."
"MovieDude1893","6","119","202","14 November 2007"," I AM (slightly let down by) BEOWULF!!!
","It seems we have a new cinematic fad coming into fashion... the genre of mythological action. It began with '300' (a film I really enjoyed), and the first that stands to benefit from 300's success is Beowulf. Beowulf is the newest film from Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis implements many of the same visual themes of his last project, the heart warming Polar Express, with varied success.<br/><br/>Beowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar (a delightfully campy Anthony Hopkins)which is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover). Help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf (Ray Winstone), who arrives with an army of 14 men and his right hand man, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson). It his his job to slay the monster. However, he must also deal with Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie). Beowulf is opposed by Unferth (John Malkovich), and has also been paying close attention to the king's wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).<br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising element of the film is its sly, wink and a nod, sense of humor. This can be viewed two ways. The first view is one of enjoyment and laughter. However, it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.<br/><br/>As expected, Beowulf is visually stunning. I'd argue it is the one category where this film bests 'Polar Express'. The 3-D photography is shockingly good. It is a film I wouldn't want to imagine in the traditional two dimension format. I strongly advise anyone who is going to see this to view the film in 3-D. Without it, the film would be borderline un enjoyable. The highlight is by far the final battle scene,which just begs you to forget the film's past misdeeds. Close, but no dice."
"macross_sd","1","131","231","24 November 2007"," A travesty of a sham of a parody of a disgrace
","Short answer: If you love the old Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, do not see this movie. You will be nauseated.<br/><br/>Longer answer: In the Dungeons and Dragons community, there is an old joke that the characters ""kill things and take their stuff."" Well, Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary managed to kill Beowulf and take his stuff. Then they proceeded to kill Hrothgar, the helm of the Shieldings and take his stuff. Then they killed Grendel and took its stuff. Then, they killed Wealtheow and took her stuff. And so on, and so forth. These two imbeciles with Underwoods (an orangutan could have come up with a more sensitive treatment of one of the seminal pieces of English literature!) completely changed the tone of the poem from a serious heroic epic to just another post-modern round of ""no more heroes"" buffoonery.<br/><br/>The literary atrocities of Messers Gaiman and Avary upon the source material are as follows: 1. The poem has been dechristianized: On the one hand, it does take out a glaring anachronism (the action of the poem takes place during the Migration Period of the AD 400s-500s, when they would still be following the traditions of the Aesir religion, but the poem was written down in a very Christianized context in England, and the anachronism does add a richness to the language) The only sop to the underpinnings of the source material come in a discussion between two urinating Danes over the relative merits of Christianity and Aesir-worship, and later when Unferth suggests praying to Christ as well as Odin, a suggestion that Hrothgar rejects out of hand (perhaps a reference to the opposite situation in the poem, where the Danes throw off Christianity for a time, hoping that the old gods will smite Grendel where the Christian ones had apparently failed).<br/><br/>2. It is implied very heavily that Beowulf was a liar and braggart in his earlier exploits, including the race with Breca: As with many of the other changes, it seems to be part of a deliberate campaign by Gaiman and Avary to strip away the heroic nature of the source material, turning Beowulf into just another trendy 21st-century flawed anti-hero.<br/><br/>3. The characters often speak with a much more modern speech pattern (see, for instance, Unferth's first confrontation with Beowulf, where he comes off as much more smarmy than in the poem) that is jarring to the ear and that often seems to lead, yet again, into Gaiman and Avary's unspoken goal of de-heroizing, de-mythologizing, and de-bunking the poem.<br/><br/>4. Beowulf does not kill Grendel's Mother: In the poem, it's reported as fact that Beowulf kills her after a ferocious struggle. Nowhere in the poem does it suggest that she seduces him and he lies about killing her. Again, it's the old song of ""everything you know is false -- there are no true heroes."" 5. Beowulf fighting in the nude: Beowulf does forswear the use of arms in fighting Grendel, but nowhere does it say that he would fight the monster in the all-together, tackle-out (with only strategically-placed objects protecting his modesty). In fighting with Grendel's Mother, it is explicitly stated that he is wearing chain-mail armor and that that saves his life. I'm giving a pass to her appearance, as it's never stated exactly what either she or Grendel actually were supposed to look like.<br/><br/>6. Hrothgar is almost explicitly stated to be Grendel's father: No, no, NO! Nowhere in the poem was any mention of Grendel's father made, least of all it being Hrothgar, whom Grendel's Mother would not have been able to have ""known"" anyway, as he was a consecrated king, and it is implied that Cain's kin could not go near signs of rightful royalty. (Cain, the first murderer, who is claimed to be the ancestor of Grendel's kind, not ""Cain,"" the not-appearing-in-the-poem whipping boy of Unferth's, that is.) 7. Hrothgar and Wealtheow have no issue, because Wealtheow will not sleep with Hrothgar due to his sleeping with Grendel's Mother, and the subsequent romantic subtext between her and Beowulf: Wrong again. Leaving behind the fact that Wealtheow probably was not as nubile in the poem as in the movie and showed no romantic interest in Beowulf whatsoever, she and Hrothgar had two sons, and as mentioned before Hrothgar had not slept with Grendel's Mother.<br/><br/>8. Hrothgar gives his kingdom over to Beowulf and then commits suicide by jumping off the tower of Heorot: At this point, I walked out of the theater and demanded my money back, as the movie had officially jumped the shark with no hopes of return.<br/><br/>In short, the movie was little more than a parody, a lampoon on a great epic."

","And I loved it. The creators of this little gem have far more potent imaginations than I and I envy them that. What a rousing movie! I picked it up in DVD to fill up an evening while my wife was away and what a pleasure it was to get engrossed in this brilliantly told tale of courage and adventure. It took me about 30 seconds to get used to the animation. It will take you longer to get used to the idea that this movie actually does a better job evoking a bygone time than the literature on which it's based. That's amazing to me. Another surprise was that Ms Jolie's much ballyhooed nude scenes were more disappointing than I had expected. I found myself more entranced with Robin Wright Penn's Wealthow who is undeservedly undervalued as an indispensable part of this film's magical weave. Ray Winstone rings more true in the lead than anyone had any right to hope for, in my opinion. And then there's Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, both adding bits of irrepressible humanity to the mix. This is in sum a thoroughly enjoyable film and I don't hesitate to recommend it, but especially to guys who will have a richer appreciation of it all than I would expect the usual woman will."
"jdkraus","1","48","80","24 November 2007"," A huge let down on all aspects of what makes an epic tale
","Beowulf is among the greatest and most well-known epic tales of Norse Mythology, but it only took me five minutes into the movie to realize that this film was not even close to as something grand. Why? To my surprise and disappointment, this movie was animated. Sure, animation isn't a big deal for a film along the lines of Shrek or Ratatouille, but not for a story like Beowulf. Beowulf is a very serious tale that covers many topics such as vengeance and forgiveness, cruelty and mercy, curses and revelations. I admit, this movie has some of those aspects, but it rather focuses on a corny, stylish animation work.<br/><br/>The action and animation itself reminded me of a teen-rated video game rather than a masterwork. However, there were a couple of scenes in the movie of which some of the up closes of the actor's face in certain scenes look real rather than animated, particularly in the scene of where Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother. I don't know if this was digitized or not, but either way, I felt like I was brought back to a normal film in these scenes versus a silly cartoon.<br/><br/>As with the story, rather than beginning with King Hrothgar murdering Grendel's father, it opens with the King having a party of drunkenness and very inappropriate nudity, particularly for an animation film. Then the party is suddenly raided by the giant Grendel. After this raid, which is quite bloody (especially for an animated film) and long ends Beowulf is finally introduced.<br/><br/>Now, the movie does not explain why Grendel keeps attacking Hrothgar. In the myth, it was because he was responsible for Grendel's father's death. There is no sign or even an implication of this. As for Grendel, well all I can say is he looks like a giant mummy from The Mummy Returns and loves to yell at the top of his lungs. I felt no pain for him, rather an urge to say, ""Shut your gull!"" I don't want to even bother in trying to explain the rest of the story. It is mainly a combination of Beowulf's two great tales smashed together in under a two hour film.<br/><br/>Since the story wasn't really developed well, the actors did not have much breathing room to really act. The monsters were evil and the good guys were heroes. Ray Winstone as Beowulf is pretty much like Gerard Butler was as King Leonardis from 300. He has a muscle-bound figure, loves to kill things, occasionally tries to be civil in politics, loves to walk around butt naked and shout drunkenly, ""I am Beowulf!"" I can't help but think of, ""This is SPARTA!"" Anthony Hopkins, as great an actor as he is, is an old, senile, drunken fool who can't stride from one chair to the next. Angelina Jolie, well, she's Angelina Jolie. She has a great body and speaks smoothly with her accent from Alexander. There's nothing worthwhile in this film, just a wasted epic that relies too much on the CGI department and has vivid images of sex and violence. I'm even more surprised that the great director Robert Zemechis of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump would direct this garbage.<br/><br/>-1/10 I wish I can get my money back."
"gengar843","9","8","10","9 June 2018"," A FANTASTIC Epic!
","Though the plot focuses on action, there is great tenderness for the Viking tradition (even if some say this is Anglo-Saxon), and it is not marred by needless updating. This alone makes a film worthy, especially these days. The lustiness and heroism of these great warriors is not muted by apologies, and one may enjoy this film as a standalone historical (or perhaps mythological) epic. In this vein, and for this genre, the film is meaty. Could it have done more? I think not, given that Lord of the Rings used a trilogy to squeeze out characterization and subplots. Beowulf on the other hand traverses at least two different stories in the two hours afforded.<br/><br/>The characters are marvelous, if somewhat familiar. A perfect respite from the wise-cracking Thor of Marvel films. Ray Winstone is the epitome of Beowulf, Anthony Hopkins does a wonderful job as King Hrothgar, Brendan Gleeson is the great sidekick, and Angelina Jolie is ravishing as Grendel's mother. Like subplots, sub-characters, such as John Malkovich's Unferth, don't get enough time, which is good, because it means you wanted more. Even Grendel (Crispin Glover) is somewhat brief. Everything seems realistic and characters act like real people, not caricatures, which seems to be the norm lately. The dialogue matches expectations, even if there is more we'd like to know.<br/><br/>The high point of the film is the extravagent NINE-MINUTE battle between Beowulf and the dragon, which in 3-D is dizzying. This is also an emotional battle, so there is extra energy to it. In CGI, there is so much more that can be done, and I like the balance director Robert Zemeckis struck between keeping it real and milking the fantasy with animation. <br/><br/>The music is rousing and fitting. I enjoyed the overture and the theme song, but I am sucker for Enya and Celtic in general, as well as Scandinavian traditional.<br/><br/>Like Alien and Independence Day, this is a film I could watch over and over. It over-delivers on its promises."
"anniecat50","1","50","84","25 November 2007"," Does anybody read REAL literature anymore?
","I was excited that now, with CGI, a great epic tale like Beowulf might be successfully made into a movie. I will keep waiting for a responsible screenwriter and director to try this again. First of all, I thought there would be more live action/acting. Since this had such a lovely cast list, I assumed they would really act. The stilted phrasing and wall to wall sexual innuendos made this one of the worst scripts I have encountered and brought to the screen. Beowulf, the great epic is full of magnificent epic poem, richly enhanced with kennings and alliteration that bring power and dignity to all of the characters. There was no dignity here. Instead, Beowulf was enveloped in shame (and given this script it was, unintentionally, the only thing they got right.) Please people,READ THE BOOK! The only thing this movie had in common with Beowulf were the names of the characters. Say no to bastard children, naked mommies of monsters, and lips that do not match up with the dialog. The only thing I got out of this was true/false test material for my British Literature students who think they can get away with watching the movie instead of reading our text."
"simonparker1990","9","174","325","15 November 2007"," Don't waste your money on the 2-D version, this has 3-D written all over it!
","I have never had the experience of seeing a 3-D movie before on the cinema, the only experience I have had with a 3-d film, only courtesy of some 3-d glasses coming free with a DVD, was Spy Kids 3-D, a movie while mildly entertaining isn't exactly the best film every to display the greatness of 3-d. So Beowulf today was my first 3-d experience, I went in expecting something good because of the 3-d, but I didn't expect the movie itself to be superb. Part of my reasoning behind this was because of the one and only experience I had had with Zemeckis and his new way of making movies. That movie was unfortunately the Polar Express, a supposedly happy tail that actually freaked me out more than most horror movies! So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3-D (more on that brilliant factor later) but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway. The motion capture isn't remotely creepy this time round and actually it seemed to make sense in some bizarre way as to why they did the movie like this. The actors surprised me big time, Ray Winstone delivering actually one of his best performances in a long while, Angelina Jolie playing the slinky seductress to perfection and Anthony Hopkins being a joy to watch on screen. Beowulf is an action packed, well written and entertaining piece of popcorn cinema. Just watch the dragon sequence near the end, every single person in my cinema was on the edges of their seat and looked in awe. The action sequences just amaze, and the dialogue sequences surprisingly really work as well. Unfortunately however if you see this movie in 2-D then you will not be experiencing Beowulf in my eyes, take off the 3-D this is a 9/10 movie, with the 3-D it gets the 10/10 rating with a blink of an eye.<br/><br/>As I've previously said the acting in the movie really caught me off guard. Ray Winston obviously is not the first actor who comes to mind when playing an ancient warrior. However when you see the movie and see the performance you understand why Winstone was cast. Sure his cockney acting at first seems a bit bizarre coming from the character, but after a while you see the subtlety of the performance and come the final half hour you realise he's quite possibly the best thing in the movie. He delivers a heartfelt and genuinely brilliant performance. Anthony Hopkins not only looks real in the movie, but he too delivers a performance truly worthy of Anthony Hopkins. Sometimes Hopkins can do a role for a sake of a role (see Mission Impossible 2), but here he seems to be having a blast as Hrothgar and he has some superb moments in the movie. Angelina Jolie plays the most interesting character of the movie, Grendell's Mother, alas she appears very briefly. But her few scenes stick firmly in memory, and her entry scene is one of the most beautifully pieces of cinema I have seen when watched in 3-D. Crispin Glover too has brief screen time as Grendell, but he delivers a heartfelt performance, in fact I felt genuine sympathy with Grendell. Glover might not be recognisable, but his performance shines through in the early scenes. John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn too deserve considerably praise, as does a brilliant cast Brendan Gleeson.<br/><br/>So as I've said the 3-D really makes the movie have a cherry on top of an already beautiful cake. After they filmmaker get over the gimmick of chucking things at the screen the 3-D is used less prominently, until any action sequences, and when the action sequences begin I doubt you will draw a single breath. Grendell's attack on a beer hall is the opening action sequence, and it is surprisingly violent for a 12a and also amazing to behold. But its the dragon sequence and late battle sequence that stick firmly in mind. I shall not spoil them, but those sequences really did make me wish that every action movie ever made from now will be in 3-D. The problem with the 3-D being so good is that the 2-D version seems like a cash in, in fact the movie relies so much on the 3-D at times that I doubt the 2-D version is worth watching. Swords pointed at screens, the camera pans through trees, the multi layered effect it gives off, in 2-d it just won't work as well, so my advice is to find a cinema that does play it in 3-d, you'll get much more for your money if you do. The storyline and film making is also extremely effective. The subtle dialogue scenes, especially the stuff between Winstone and Jolie really are some of the highlights. Also the relationship between Beowulf and his queen is touching.<br/><br/>So are their any faults? As I've mentioned the 2-D version just won't be as good, but also the movie doesn't seem like it'll be that good at the start. In fact at the beginning, for five minutes, I was expecting to be bitterly disappointed. Thankfully that little slouch at the beginning is livened up with the arrival of Grendell, and from that point onwards you will adore the movie. This is Zemeckis' best movie since Back to the Future and definitely one of my favourite films of the year. Go and watch in 3-D and pray that more movies will be made like this in the near future."
"thoroughbred2007","1","62","109","20 November 2007"," very disappointing
","To all who have seen the movie and read the book, then I am sorry. To those who didn't read the book: The writers of the film did not follow the story line at all. Beowulf was supposed to pull of Grendel's arm, not shut it in a door. Grendel's mother was supposed to have lived in a lake of fire and be an ugly hag. Beowulf was also supposed to kill her, not make a dragon child with her. Grendel's mother was only supposed to kill one man when she comes to Herot, not all of Beowulf's men. And Hrothgar never gave Beowulf his kingdom. Beowulf had his own. Beowulf, after a long, unsuccessful battle with the dragon, was supposed to have died, not having killed the dragon and Wiglaf ended up defeating it. I cannot give this movie high ratings because of its twisting of the original story, which disappointed almost everyone in that theater."
"titoesteves","10","81","156","15 November 2007"," The Myth movie has come home at last.
","Despite all you might have read, Beowulf does not appear on screen as he was in the poem which was the origin of this incredibly well designed CGI tour-De-force. This, although a shock to some, I'm sure, means little to the vast majority of viewers who either 1 - never heard of this legendary hero in the first place or 2 - would forever picture him as Christopher Lambert in the eponymous, and eminently forgettable, straight-to-DVD movie of some years ago. The truth is, this movie is a spectacle to behold: it grips you from the first scene, wrings you by the seat of your pants and absolutely knocks your socks off at every corner - at least CGI wise. It has its faults, surely, as any masterpiece, but a masterpiece it still is. Some set pieces are not as well rendered as others (the water in the ocean is a blatant example) but others are just plain outstanding and technology-defying (like the last battle of the movie, which I won't reveal here). Ray Winstone (Beowulf) is tremendously convincing, as is the generally under-rated Crispin Glover (Grendel - who, go figure, is no dragon, as other people said) - Sir Anthony Hopkins is very much royalty in his own right (King Hrothgar) and Robin Right Penn, Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich excel in the little nuances that give supporting role characters their chances at the Oscars - unfortunately, Angelina Jolie's part is both a visual treat and at the same time an auditory shame - very few lines are spoken - it seems seeing her with zero garments was understood to be enough to satisfy the teenage crowds - well, I would certainly have liked for more character development but what the hell, can't really complain. As far as anthropomorphic CGI goes all the main characters are instantly recognizable but not perfect (this is still an evolution over Zemecky's own ""The Polar Express"", mind you) and no matter how much the 3D effects try (and try they do, believe you me), they still seem like gimmicks - the first part of the movie and the cave scenes encompass the best 3D trickery on display - and this new fangled technology is truly superior to the previous red-blue glasses of yesteryear - and will probably leave you with a little less of a hangover afterward. When all is said and done, it stands out on its own merits: epic, comes to mind, and so does cutting edge. This is a movie that will sell a lot of HD hardware (be it BluRay or HD-DVD or whatever else just comes out meanwhile), and sure to be displayed in plasmas and LCD screens all over the world when this movie goes on sale. Go see it now, at theaters, in its original digital form, 3D glasses over your nose and enjoy it for what it is: pure magic."

","As far as movies go, this one has what is popular: action, adventure, sex, blood, and lots of twists that will keep you guessing what the truth is.<br/><br/>However, if you've read Beowulf (which, judging by the reviews, is a small number of people), and you appreciate the characters and hold them in a place of dignity and respect in your mind, then forget about appreciating anything about the movie. Though Beowulf is portrayed in the epic as the great leader and hero who never has done a dishonorable deed, he is, in the movie, portrayed as a liar and a deceiver. He defeats Grendel by closing his arm in a door. He never kills Grendel's mother because she seduces him and together, they beget the Dragon. How does this even make any sense? He returns to the Geats claiming to have defeated Grendel's mother and is then made king by Hrothgar. This is, of course, good for Beowulf, because he has a thing for Wealtheow, Hrothgar's wife, anyway. The kind and noble King Hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with Grendel's mother (hence the existence of Grendel) and who end up killing himself after making Beowulf king. the only noble deed that Beowulf seems to achieve (in the movie) is by severing his own arm from his body and by tearing out the dragon's heart with his bare hand (neither of which is in the book, by the way.) Funny, in the book, I don't remember the fight with the dragon leaving the cave at all...<br/><br/>We can only pray that someday someone does this epic justice and makes a decent film out of it. Until then, I give this steaming pile of movie a one... out of ten."
"animusviator","1","33","63","5 December 2007"," Simply awful
","This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies in my life.<br/><br/>First off, I have to tell you I haven't read the poem and so wasn't aware of the gross changes made to the substance of the story that I found about while reading comments here. Thus, I won't talk about the awful and treacherous rendition but more of the failings of the movie as a story separate of its source.<br/><br/>The main thing that was inconceivable for me was the so-called hero: Beowulf, hailed by many of his entourage (during the movie) as a savior, as a luminous figure with glorious achievements and high courage is in my eyes, as portrayed in the movie, again I repeat, a braggart, a liar and a cheater( since there is a difference between the two), a power-grabbing sell-out and a lecherous Don Juan in the worst sense of the word (no flashbacks to long-suffering Johnny Depp, please, they're in different classes). <br/><br/>I have so resented the mockery made of this supposed hero that I felt nothing but relief at the end of movie and was left completely cold by his death. (I think I felt more about Grendel's death, such a pitiful creature). Now, I assume, this isn't the reaction sought by the filmmakers, but this is what they got from me and I'm not the only one who left the theatre with an acute sense of disbelief.<br/><br/>The women, well what to say about them: in every scene they were present, they were seen as objects of sexual desire or were involved in romantic flirt, and moreover they seemed to revel in it, the aging Beowulf's young flame was absolutely sickening in her haste to be ""approved"" by the then king. Not one remote moment where they were more than just acting womanly the men around. Not even Angelina Jolie: I would have expected a knife through the heart for her child's murderer not a roll in the hay (well, mud from cave to be exact). <br/><br/>Sir Anthony Hopkins: the amount of respect I have for the man risked by the filmmakers through a risqu√© and needless unveiling of flesh in a drunkard romp which I bet they thought it would be funny. And also poor, poor lines, that even his talent couldn't save. I hope to see him in a new movie quite soon to drive the bitterness away. I echo the sentiment for John Malkovitch whose ambiguous, confusing character traits didn't allow him to truly expand.<br/><br/>Other things to nitpick at: the allusions to Christianity seemed out of place most of the time as I didn't understand what they could contribute to the plot (maybe atmosphere), the gory scenes that might look great on 3D, but just left me nauseated (a tip,less is sometimes more), but not when involving Beowulf's striptease nudity (I thought it was real cold up North, but go figure). <br/><br/>The last thing that topped it off and sent me in front of my computer was Wiglaf's last scene, where they finished it in true horror movie style, with the continuity of the evil character that will come back for revenge. It's not the sequel-wanting that troubles me, but what it implies of humankind: this man has been the witness of not one but two falls caused by the same mistake and he's seriously thinking that he should want a repeat of it and get a different result: that's the definition of madness. For me that was the last straw, for the cheap effect, they had forsaken the lesson and its consequences and offer no hope.<br/><br/>As for the animation, I'm not an expert but the friend I went to the movie with who is one says to tell you the animals weren't veridical, the humans' hands looked weird and some often the movements were real awkward, though the dragon was awesome.<br/><br/>That's it, ramble over,hope it helps."
"jmar1978","3","21","38","23 November 2007"," Overdone
","I saw the film in its 3-D Imax incarnation. I found certain aspects of the film appealing: at the core of the film is a psychological and moral allegory about kingship in a warrior culture committed to offensive warfare for the sake of treasure (hence, the role of Grendel's mother). As such, I don't mind the plot changes from the original poem, which in the end also simultaneously celebrates and critiques the Teutonic warrior ethos.<br/><br/>What did bother me, and what almost sent me running from the theater a few times, was the emphasis on the gaudy and garish visual effects, not to mention the overdone soundtrack. The depiction of Grendel as an anguished, pathetic simpleton upset by the noise coming from Heorot is far less effective than the original poem's presentation of him as a mysterious, undescribed evil descended from Cain. Having a completely disrobed Beowulf fight Grendel led to gratuitous comedy (one was always wondering, ""how are they going to cover it next?"") that detracted force from what should have been one of the more tense scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The graphic novel look, which was successful in ""Sin City"" and ""300,"" struck me as less effective here, perhaps because it is no longer fresh but now formula. And while some of the 3-D effects were noteworthy (the long shot to the ship across the beach early in the film, I thought, was pretty neat) the technology hasn't advanced much since ""Invaders from Mars,"" so there's often an obvious artificiality to it that I thought detracted more than it added.<br/><br/>Perhaps the words ""formulaic"" and ""artificial"" best sum up my experience of this film (along with ""loud"" and ""garish""). It had entertaining moments (some of the fight with the dragon, I admit, got me going), but in the end it was all overdone to the point of being indigestible."

","First the good parts: The 3D is spectacular in scenes like the that of the dragon flying and the digitization is good in action sequences though not in facial closeups. I liked the ground level shots of horses riding by .<br/><br/>The bad part is the story which follows the current American trend of showing that the real monsters in all situations are men. Not humans overall of course, just men, who it seems are all sex crazed, drunk, loud, violent, sexist buffoons who impose themselves on long suffering women and monsters everywhere. Yet even these Vikings who sing of rape and pillage meekly listen to the ""no means no"" lecture and cry when reminded that they were unfaithful to their wives.<br/><br/>They're momma's boys who boast of being bad when out of their playpen as Anthony Hopkins shows in arriving on screen in a diaper. Good momma Robin and bad momma Angelina have their own ways of correcting these naughty little boys. Grendel being less of a monster than the men, gets lullabies from momma Angelina while the rest of the men get impalement, evisceration, beheadings and other gruesome deaths.<br/><br/>Good momma Robin is kinder in that she only withholds sex and love from both of her husbands ensuring a long unfulfilling marriage to all parties.<br/><br/>This clearly has nothing to do with the poem or 6th century Denmark or heroic literature which this genre finds disgusting. It's really about Hollywood in the 21st century and the self centered, politically correct intolerance of other cultures and times seen through those who lived in it.<br/><br/>Excalibur by John Boorman is a much better envisioning of a heroic story while the Thirteenth Warrior is Michael Crichton's innovative take on Beowulf."
"Soul_Korruptor","4","23","43","20 November 2007"," Great Book Sh*tty Movie
","Beowulf has been my personal favorite book ever since I read it. I read it three times now. Every movie I have seen or heard of based off the book was nothing ridiculously bad but you could easily tell why they weren't in theaters and some of them were decent but nothing too exciting.<br/><br/>I was really excited last year when I heard that a Beowulf movie was actually going to be released in theaters! So the wait is over and I finally saw the movie...<br/><br/>It was nothing like I anticipated it to be. The movie shows Grendel as some sort of monster to be pitied, which the book shows him as a heartless demon without mercy. Grendel was more of an annoyance than anything in the movie with his constant whining/yelling and immature, babyish, personality.<br/><br/>Grendel's mother in the movie was mainly an animated Angelina Jolie, which again, her personality and looks were nothing like the book. The movie shows Grendel's mother and the dragon to be in some sort of league with each other. The dragon was killed years after Beowulf killed Grendel's mother, according to the book.<br/><br/>So in other words you have a great story but a sh*tty movie. The CGI animation throughout only made it even worse. The book was not based on Norse mythology, which the movie made references to Odin and Ragnarok and such, but rather based on beliefs of God. (The book was supposedly written by a Christian monk with all these references to God) I'm not saying that this entire movie should be based on the book. But I was expecting something similar to that of the 13th Warrior, which strongly reminds me of Beowulf every time I watch it. It had a dark feeling throughout, was about a culture similar to that of the vikings, and was well-written. Beowulf promises animation, annoying accents, annoying yelling/screaming, and whining. It felt like watching a child's version of Pathfinder mixed with Shrek. Beowulf is shown as a fallible character and is persuaded into a deal with Grendel's mother. I could go on and on with the mistakes of this film and how much of a disappointment it was."
"simonharpham-1","1","22","41","15 January 2008"," Deeply poor.
","The CGI in this film is good, but CGI still has a way to go if it's to replace real-life. In fact I found the CGI characterisation a little off-putting because some of the characters were clearly supposed to be based on the actors who supplied the voices but I spent the entire film wondering who they were. In this respect I found the choice of Ray Winston for the lead role of Beowulf particularly incongruous because no matter how much CGI is applied to the process of making a film as soon as I hear that voice what I actually see on the screen isn't a muscle-bound (anti-)hero but a fat cockney: Even if Ray Winston were to have a full body transplant (which is effectively what this film gives him) I'd still see a fat cockney on the screen and I'd spend the entire time wondering where he was hiding (or trying to guess who Unferth is, only to find - to my disappointment - that it's a particularly crap attempt to render John Malkovich's face).<br/><br/>I'd say more-or-less the same the 3D element of the film which, though a nice bonus, I found most effective in the film's quieter moments such as the shot along the pebble-beach with the longboat in the distance. All that flying through the air around and about Grendel failed to impress - if anything it just left me feeling dizzy and a little sick.<br/><br/>So what of the adaptation? Well it's terrible, of course, because Hollywood touched it and Hollywood just can't bear to leave any story untouched by its own mutable standards. To put it bluntly: As an adaptation of Beowulf this film is clown shoes. I'd have enjoyed it more, and it would have had more artistic integrity, if Beowulf had a painted face, stick-on nose and a fright wig: At least it would have been an honest statement of intent.<br/><br/>The nearest thing this film has to integrity (bearing in mind that Mel Gibson recently felt free enough to release a film entirely in Aramaic) is Grendel muttering some of his lines in Anglo Saxon, which would be alright were it not for the fact that no-one else in the film speaks in Anglo Saxon, so the effect of this device it to make it appear as if Grendel is speaking his own monster-language, not the same language as everyone else in the epic.<br/><br/>In summary then: This film is a terrible adaptation, with graphics that will look dated by next year, and some awful scriptwriting. Well done lads, you've penned another hit! Hollywood Ending: OTOH if you like Hollywood action movies with a D&D twist (like Eragon & LotR) then this film is for you. You'll spend your ¬£5, you'll laugh, gurn and cry your way through the film and come out the other end of the movie sausage-machine feeling replete.<br/><br/>And more fool you."
"Forever_21","4","28","55","24 January 2008"," Beautiful but Flawed
","Visually this film is stunning. More than once I had to remind myself that what I was looking at was not real actors caught on film but a CGI interpretation. It's difficult to purvey this feeling as either a negative or a positive one: on the one hand I cannot see the point in producing CGI if what the filmmaker's goal is realism of reality. CGI in film is of course appropriate when trying to achieve fantastical creatures and set pieces (which are of course inherently unrealistic) but in Beowulf each actor's face, verbal, and non-verbal performance are recreated in CGI verbatim. This I cannot fathom ¬ñ why recreate what is already there, in the flesh and far more believable? On the other hand there is a sense of true wonder when in a handful of scenes you are genuinely fooled into thinking that what you are looking at is not CGI, but live action film. You are left with no choice but to marvel at the technical and artistic achievements. However, the illusion is inevitably shattered when you begin to pick up on some of the unrealistic lighting, dodgy physics and for some reason: gesticulation (wooden puppets spring to mind). It's really hard to understand what was being attempted with this film: genuine realism (then why recreate the actors in CGI?), complete fantasy immersion (then why are some scenes so tangible?), or (as I suspect) purely an exercise in what is possible with modern CGI.<br/><br/>The pace of the story itself is about right with a good balance of character development and plot enhancement. Anthony Hopkins puts in a decent performance as Hrothgar and John Malkovich as Unferth is suitably sinister. Ray Winstone is, well, Ray (WYSIWYG) Winstone. Angelina Jolie makes a brief and scantily-clad appearance as Grendel's Mother although at times I found it very difficult understanding the dialogue between Grendel (Crispin Glover) and Grendel's Mother due to some very obscure accents. It's difficult to discredit the physical acting because although it is clear that the original actors did perform physically I suspect that much was lost in the CGI transformation.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie's biggest flaw is the story itself. I appreciate that when interpreting the written media to film some degree of poetic licence is required, but why do so many filmmakers blatantly disregard original source material unnecessarily? Beowulf does present the key protagonists, and the first half of the film is fairly accurate but the second half is wildly aloof in its interpretation of the original text.<br/><br/>That said, overall the film is beautiful and should be applauded for what has been achieved but for the time being you are left feeling that this technique of story telling should be confined to games. Incidentally, I felt the same about The Polar Express, although that film was aimed at a far less mature audience¬Öor was it?"

","The movie's OK, I think; won't go into details. The thing I wondered most about is the research done about the Danish country...or lack of same. It seems that those who did the research may have visited Denmark's neighbours Norway or Sweden and decided that that's how all Scandinavian countries look like. However, Denmark - my home country - looks nothing like what is depicted in this movie. Never has. The geography of Denmark is that of a rather flat country. We have hills, yes, but not mountains, and certainly not cliffs. Beowulf lands his ship on a beach with large cliffs in the background. Not one single place in Denmark looks like this. The same thing goes for the place of the king's hall. No place like that in Denmark. Just an interesting thought from a Danish fellah..."

","Beowulf the book is an epic poem. Beowulf the movie is an adaptation of this classic, except with extremely poorly written dialog, an abundance of tit jokes, and everything else you would expect from a Hollywood film. Secret love affair? Check. Jealous rivals? Check. Excessive imagery against Christianity? Check. Nothing quite like having someone burned by a dragon in a church after holding up a cross. Expect to see about four crosses burning in the movie, along with multiple references to the inefficiency of the religion of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>For all it's faults, Beowulf is still a good movie...for a drinking game. Just take a shot every time someone says Mead in the scene when Beowulf gets to the Mead Hall. You should be passed out rather soon and thus, you won't have to sit through the Hollywood book rape that is Beowulf!"

Every line was a rip off from the now clich√© Gerard Butler line ""THIS IS SPARTA!!!"" This movie took away everything that i loved from the poem and made it into something almost dirty it made this epic hero that stood not only the horrible monster Grendel but also his horrible mother, and then in his older days he still could beat up a dragon into something dirty. It made Beowulf seem to be a braggart perhaps it was an autobiography for Gaiman who writes all right but most of his tooting comes from his own horn. It reminded me of Troy which ruined the Iliad for exactly the same reason: none. It makes me sick to think that both of these epics are good enough to remain relevant and exciting for THOUSANDS freaking THOUSANDS of years is not good enough for Hollywood writers who have to ""improve"" the story line.<br/><br/>Mr. Gaiman the true monster in this story is you, I just hope that you have not weakened Beowulf enough because he is indeed the monster killer i am just not sure that he could survive this massacre."

","The first risk about this version of ""Beowulf"" is to see it as one of Zemeckis eccentricities. A technique used for a sort of childish game without limits. The second view discovers the purpose of the game - to propose the right essence of poem. The fluidity and dramatism of plot. The bitter flavor of confrontations. And the seed of the victory. Impressive, shocking in few scenes, it is a precise exploration of a world who becomes less familiar.

So then the geniuses try and spend the rest of your time convincing you how a bad guy is really cool. In this movie Holly Wood struggled to heap some more sex in the movie Beowulf--to the point that the plot of the movie was lost in the great effort it took the perv---er--writers to spend endless hours trying to figure out how to work all that senseless hedonism into the final product: worthless movie. Holly Wood has an incredible imagination. In the book there was no sex with monsters!!!!That dragon-mead flask came from a dragon's cave (which was of no relation to Grendal's mom or Beowulf).

"Jay_Exiomo","5","26","54","14 November 2007"," It's all about the sensory overload
","The success of ""300"" and ""Apocalypto"" no doubt have set the stage for violent setpieces set during ancient history, where visual resplendence that cater to testosterone-bearing members of the audience are preferred to a richer narrative. The latest in line is Robert Zemeckis' ""Beowulf"".<br/><br/>Ray Wintstone plays the eponymous character, who travels the high seas to answer the call of the drunk King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins): to slay the demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), who has been terrorizing the town of Heorot. Beowulf does so but incurs the wrath of the demon's mother (Angelina Jolie), who in turns seduces him into a curse that befell generations of leaders.<br/><br/>Written for the screen by fantasy novel/comic book whiz Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary (""Pulp Fiction""), the film employs the same motion-capture 3-D animation he used in ""Polar Express"". Consequently, this retelling of an Old English epic is no doubt a sensory overload. The renderings are photorealistic, and the fight scenes are exhilarating. But at the course of its length, it all becomes tiresome with its source's themes relegated to the backseat in order for Zemeckis to suit it to modern viewers.<br/><br/>The same can be said of Zack Snyder's and Mel Gibson's previously mentioned works; but whereas those films managed to keep the viewer engaged through its action scenes, ""Beowulf"" doesn't. And in all its visual splendor, ""Beowulf"" also lacks stronger characters that would elevate it to the level of the film's technical breakthroughs. It's at once exhilarating yet exhausting.<br/><br/>The climactic battle scene (which in itself is an incentive to see the movie in IMAX) punctuates a two-hour exposition that lacks a thematic depth. It's not unlike one of those extended cutscenes in RPGs that seem to go on forever and ever, making you wonder when gameplay would start again."

Grendel is straight out of Frankenstein. The CGI would've been better for Shrek IV. The hands were so poorly rendered that they became a distraction. The dragon was stolen from Dragonslayer.

","I'm a senior in high school, and we recently just finished reading the book ""Beowulf"". After we finished it, our teacher showed us this movie. Now, I had seen the movie once before, back when I was only in elementary school, and as a result I had a preconceived idea of the story of Beowulf. Reading the book, and then watching the movie, I could see that there were a myriad of differences. Some of those include Wulfgar being a very minor character in the books, as opposed to being Beowulf's best buddy, and Welthow hardly appearing at all. One of the much larger changes would be the much heavier involvement of Grendel's mother, however I understand completely as to why the director and producers decided to make these changes. Adapting an ancient epic poem to be exactly the same as the source to a modern day audience would probably see a box office flop. All the changes made sense to me to work for a theatrical film, and I really enjoyed the movie. Granted, there were some flaws in certain parts, but they all remain personal, for example I wasn't the biggest supporter of Grendel's design, but as I said, it's personal. Overall, the movie had plenty of ups, and very little downs, and I thoroughly enjoyed some of the voice acting and nods to the book. Easily recommend to anyone."
"Daggerborn","7","2","2","1 March 2008"," Beowulf the film, not the poem
","Beowulf is not the old school poem. It's a story retold like mythical tales that have different revisions. A wolf becomes a bear, a bear becomes a troll, a troll becomes a dragon, etc. It's like another take on an old story, and told from the lips of a different story teller; this is all completely fine. The story is about Beowulf's quest to kill the creature Grendel and his story after that event.<br/><br/>It doesn't sound particularly interesting but when you add in the fact that Beowulf can kill monsters with nothing but his pinky and thumb it starts sounding a lot better. If you are a big fan of medieval swords and shields tales you're going to love Beowulf. If you are big fan of blood, violence, and sexual themes, you're going to love Beowulf. The special effects and sound of Beowulf are top notch and the best technology has to offer these days.<br/><br/>Every breaking bone, every ripple in every face, and every flexing muscle look as good as CGI probably ever will at this time. Sound effects, from the clang of swords, arrows firing, water, wind, the ocean, every thing sounds great and is a treat to hear. I saw the Unrated version so I can't speak for the PG-13 one but Beowulf is a very sexually charged movie, I will tell you that. It is not for children and when I say children I mean any one under 16 years of age.<br/><br/>This movie should have been R rated from what I've seen. I can't imagine they took much out of the movie because the director's cut is only a fraction longer than the theatrical version. Now with the negative parts of this movie. The movie can be very paced to the point of silence. Some parts feel long and drawn out, I never got this feeling but I can see how some may not like this. I myself was too focused on soaking up all the lovely high-techery CGI.<br/><br/>The point is don't go into this movie expecting THE Beowulf and you'll be all right. If you think that the retelling of a story should be 100% accurate with the poem it's based on, don't even rent this. You will not be happy. If you are looking for a great epic, and an all around entertaining film, watch this. It suffers from crappy ending syndrome but is well worth the price of admission, that is if you watch it for what it is; Beowulf the film, not the poem."

","I was excited to see that a new version of Beowulf was coming out on the same weekend that I was visiting Oslo as part of an ongoing exploration of Scandinavian history. The signs were good: a promising looking cast, including Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Angelina Jolie; a good story; and an excellent precedent in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. (The two stories have much in common: Tolkein was a professor in Old and Middle English and was deeply familiar with the Beowulf poem).<br/><br/>However as soon as the film starts one realises that the whole thing looks like a teenage video game. The overall visual style could be called 'arcade-cheese'. In the original poem the characters are admittedly highly simplified, 'symbolic' figures - who do nonetheless have a basis in history. With this as a starting point it would be possible to build on the poem, as Tolkein did with the Lord of the Rings, and create credible characters with believable human characteristics. In this film, however, all the characters are cardboard cutouts. Consequently there is no real acting to speak of throughout the film.<br/><br/>The storytelling in the film lacks the keen edge of the poem. Beowulf is an epic story of heroes and monsters, told in a high style. The film fails to capture the poem's seriousness and a better telling can be found in the audio version produced by Naxos, which is a much more exciting affair: http://www.naxosaudiobooks.com/PAGES/242512.htm. It is also worth noting that the film script departs very considerably from the story in the poem. This fact didn't bother me especially, although the changes didn't add anything significant to the story. The scriptwriter showed a tabloid instinct for inventing murky sexual secrets, combined with a Disney-style sense of humour: elements that were of course totally lacking in the poem.<br/><br/>The single star is awarded for Beowulf's battle with the dragon, which was excitingly done.<br/><br/>Those of you, like me, who were expecting Lord of the Rings style quality may well be disappointed. Very disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall: visually unimpressive, bad/no acting, flat characters, weak storytelling."

Truly, every moment of this film is a computer-generated, paint-by-numbers formula-epic-drama that is not worth your time. I only went to see it because in Thailand they are allowed to buy out the box-office and it was playing in five of the eight screens in the biggest movie theatre in Chiang Mai.

","Digital ""motion capture"" Beowulf looks more like a computer game than a movie. Anthony Hopkins's Welsh voice evidently proved infectious for the rest of the cast who turn the Anglo-Saxon epic, set in 7th century Denmark, into a succession of sub Under Milk Wood accents. Ray Winstone fights various battles stark naked, his naughty bits strategically masked in many imaginative ways. Angelina Jolie plays Grendel's Mother as a nude she-devil in high heels. Her phallic tail fails to frighten the audience. Her lack of nipples is slightly more disturbing. Laughable script is perfectly matched by crashing over the top score & power ballad.

","I understand that when a piece of literature is translated into a movie that changes have to be made. Indeed, considering the source material it would be understandable why the director might make significant changes. In fact, it is my opinion that movies such as this should not be a page by page copy of the original, but should by the directors own vision and interpretation of the story. It may even by OK to add to the story to bring greater depth and complexity to the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, it doesn't matter how similar the plot is with the original poem, but how well it represents the themes of the original. Therefor, Beowulf(the movie) is probably the worst adaptation of any piece of literature ever.<br/><br/>The Beowulf of the poem and the Beowulf of the movie have little in common when it comes to their characteristics. In many ways, this movie was a betrayal of the original. in the original, Beowulf was a role model of Anglo-Saxon society, but in this version he was responsible for the dragon and doesn't kill Grendel's mom. the themes represented in this version are nowhere to be found in the original.<br/><br/>This movie is altogether not the story of Beowulf, it is a completely different movie.

","Admittedly, I only saw this movie in the 2D version, but my dislike is not based on the visual ""effects"" as much as it is on the content of the film. Also admittedly, I love Beowulf, the epic poem. It is one of the great works of Western literature. If one is to make a film of a great work of art, it seems to me one is bound to treat it with respect (note: I do not say ""awe."" Respect leaves the film maker open to creative interpretations, whereas awe prevents him from being daring and creative). Robert Zemeckis admits in his comments in the film's production notes that he doesn't even LIKE Beowulf. He claims to have been forced to read it in Old English when he was in junior high school: This comment, suggesting a highly unlikely reality, reveals much about his inability to understand or respect the subject in the first place.<br/><br/>Zemeckis has not simply failed to translate the story and characters of Beowulf into cinematic terms, he has damaged them. The King Hrothgar in this Beowulf is not the noble, sad Danish king of the original epic, a king who, like the king in Wagner's Parsifal, suffers from the symbolic ""wound that never heals"" and requires a heroic act to save him, but is instead a lustful, besotted, self-gratifying ruler of a band of thugs; in the end, he abrogates the responsibility as the original Hrothgar could never do. Queen Wealtheow, who is perhaps the most noble character in the epic (Wiglaf excepted), becomes a love object for Beowulf (whose character is here limited to the arrogant boaster that the original Beowulf only sometimes is), an absolutely absurd idea -- the sexual tension between them is a clearly modern idea that may make sense to young audiences but is completely absurd in the context of the story's culture. This Hrothgar and Wealtheow are childless, removing an important secondary plot from the original epic, because of Hrothgar's weird (and should be grotesque) philandering; this 21st century twist may ring true to some, but it destroys the characters of not only Hrothgar and Wealtheow, but also of Grendel and his mother! The whole notion of Angelina Jolie as Grendel's beastly mother puzzled me before I saw the film; of course, after seeing the ridiculously rewritten story, I understand why the ugly sea witch is now transformed into a seducer of kings. Unfortunately, this aspect so alters the thrust of the story that we no longer have Beowulf, but some other, mundane soap opera that uses the names and some elements of the Beowulf story as a weak foundation. Zemeckis excuses this major alteration of the plot by saying that we only have Beowulf's word that he killed Grendel's mother, but this comment again reveals the filmmaker's inability to read the original accurately.<br/><br/>There is so much more that is wrong with this film that I don't know where to continue. I hate the digital imaging that actually hides the acting (good or bad as it may have been). This is not like the incredible collaboration of actor and technician that we saw with Andy Sirkis's Golem in the Lord of the Rings films, but an elaborately slick animated Marvel comic book reduction. Where are the strong talents of such solid actors as Anthony Hopkins, Crispin Glover, Angelina Jolie, and Robin Wright Penn? They're buried behind the comic book. Beowulf himself is an empty, one-dimensional character and no longer the romantic hero of the original epic, who must discover the truth of his inner self over several decades and through many challenges (he's supposed to be much older when he engages in the fatal battle with the dragon at the end than he appears in the film).<br/><br/>Even the film's attempts to sound scholarly fail when Hrothgar mispronounces ""scop,"" one of the many Old English words that pepper the script, and poor Unferth mispronounces his own father's name (the Old English 'sc' should sound like the modern English 'sh'). There is just no end to the problems with this movie. At best it's mere eye candy, and not much of that, since the candy is all artificially flavored."

Imagine frodo and his look of anguish and pain and desperation because of the burden of the ring being taken away because he looks like mr conductor, and that basically is what you get.<br/><br/>Now what was done with polar express, i liked. it fit the story. this however is what destroyed the story. any cartoon character can ride a dragon and do unbelievable things, it's really nothing special. but seeing man. a real flesh and blood man kill a demon child, or a fire breathing dragon with his bare hands, that is the stuff of legends. yeah i understand that there needs to be CGI enhancement to make a human do certain things on screen, but not CGI with human enhancements. thats like an ugly woman putting on 3 inches of makeup and 10 gallons of perfume so that she looks beautiful.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Oh, and angelina jolie looked AWFUL. nude or not nude, she looked ridiculous. imagine what lara croft really looks like in tomb raider and you get the idea...<br/><br/>...okay maybe not that bad but close...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>And to make matters worse, according to the other two film goers that were in the theatre (one of whom had actually read the original story), the ending was changed...<br/><br/>This movie, to me, seemed to be desperately trying to ride on the coattails of 300. now yes, i know the script was being written in 97 and 300 (TPB) was written in 98. and regardless of which on was shot first, the point is, which one was released first. a lot can happen between here and now.<br/><br/>300 is a perfect example of what this movie could have been.<br/><br/>In the end, what the Hollywood trend seems to be following is this; let's try to copy what the real artists are doing and make our own version of it. kinda like what go-bots were to transformers. and while we are at it, let's make it so that the kids can see it too so instead of making it what it should be, lets water it down to pg13 and make more money out of it.<br/><br/>I would suggest anyone wanting to see to simply not. it isn't even worth the time to watch online."
"apocalysque","1","6","10","27 November 2014"," Worst ever
","This was absolutely the worst adaptation of any story ever in the history of man. I urge you not to waste your time on this piece of garbage. From the horrible accents to the inaccuracies in the story line, this filth takes low to a new level. I watched it for free on Netflix and STILL want my money back. The animation was pretty, but that's about the only redeeming quality of the movie. If there was an option to give a negative score, this would be the movie for it. I don't think the English language has enough negative adjectives to describe the awfulness of this movie, and I wish someone had warned me before I watched it. at no point in this movie did I feel I received any entertainment value. I award it no points and may God have mercy on your soul should you decide to watch it after reading this review."
"g-bodyl","9","6","10","27 February 2008"," A Thrilling Epic!
","This film is actually a pretty good film. I was surprised on how this film turned out to be. This is about one guy, Beowulf who apparently came from Iceland. He helps a Danish village get rid of a monster named Grendel. After Grendel is defeated, Beowulf and his comrades has to fight even a bigger foe, the mother of Grendel played by Angelina Jolie. Will she be defeated? You will just have to find out. First of all, the acting is brilliant. Ray Winstone and Brendan Gleeson were the best. Next, the music theme is memorable. The score still is flowing through my mind at the moment. Finally, the CGI is amazing. The effects made the movie even more worthwhile. The only two reasons this movie does not get a 10 because it is a little slow at the beginning and there are several major differences between the movie and the poem. BNut other than that, this film is great. I recommend this film for anybody 12 or over. This film might be a little scary for younger children. I rate this film a 9/10."
"FrankMize","2","6","10","26 November 2007"," Where is the story
","I love SciFi, and some of the CGI in this movie was good, but honestly, it wasn't great. I had the feeling I was watching a video game, as it had very little dialog. The characters are not developed. The entire story line could be told on a story board with six panels. Beowolf comes to kill a demon. Beowolf kills demon. Beowolf is seduced by demons mother. Beowolf fathers a son that grows to be a dragon. Beowolf kills dragon. Beowolf dies at the end of the battle. End of story. Yes, there was some interaction between Beowolf, the queen, the king, and his number one lieutenant, but it was minimal. I'm guessing the script for this movie was no more than 20 pages. If they would have eliminated the line 'I am Beowolf', it may have shortened it by two pages. I was looking forward to this movie, but in all honesty was very disappointed."
"admin-908","1","17","37","14 November 2007"," has the potential to be one of the biggest flops ever
","Supposedly a heroic epic, this film lands a bit short of everything it intends to accomplish. Highly sophisticated motion capture technique was supposed to bring real world actors' facial expressions to a new level in animation, but what did they achieve? Good resemblance, but nothing more. There is absolutely nothing in their faces, no pain, no anger, angst, or even genuine smiles. The film itself could have been entertaining but instead was boring from the first minute. Also, the dialogues were tremendously stupid - and please remember that we are talking here about one of the most widely studied artifacts in anglosaxon literary. Maybe, if you are willing to forget everything that was told around this film and simply take it as another animated film, you will like it - I would not bet on it, though. I am really sorry I am so negative; I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie but was disappointed in every possible way"
"clearthezone15","1","17","37","14 November 2007"," For the love of God, don't see this movie.
","Last night, I felt extremely lucky to be one of the last couple of people to be admitted into the theater to see an advance screening of Beowulf. Starting about thirty minutes into the movie, that happy feeling in the pit of my stomach gave way to a hollow emptiness that put me in one of the worst moods I've ever had walking out of a theater.<br/><br/>Let me give you some background. I was seeing this screening for some extra credit in AP English. Having read the book (which is THOUSANDS of years old, for the record), I expected a movie which...well...told that story. I was wrong. About half an hour into the movie, when everything had been going along all right, but not perfectly, the director just decided, ""you know what, I'm throwing this script out the window. It's existed for thousands of years, but I'll but that I can come up with something better within a few months!""<br/><br/>I'm sad, because tens of thousands of people without an advanced educational opportunity who haven't read the Beowulf epic will see this movie and think that that was how the story goes. This movie was such a departure from the Beowulf epic, they should've called it something else entirely. Maybe ""Riding on the momentum of '300'"".<br/><br/>Besides that debacle, it was also way too much of a cartoon, you spend at least 10 minutes looking at every possible way to block Beowulf's penis from view, and wondering WHY they decided to try and make an epic tale that first introduced the way of the hero to the world into something as bad as this.<br/><br/>Boycott this movie if you have an IQ of 80 or higher. You'll thank me later."
"hall895","4","9","17","30 November 2007"," Well, it certainly looks nice
","Here we have a film which is a triumph of animation. Unfortunately it is not a triumph of storytelling. The animation is so good, often eerily lifelike, that it is almost worth seeing the film for that reason alone. But be forewarned that in order to see all the impressive visuals you're going to have to sit through a story which fails to engage. And if you're a Beowulf purist, because I'm sure there is such a thing, be prepared to be disappointed as this film version of the story strays in very significant ways from the original text. I suppose it's understandable that the filmmakers would find it necessary to jazz up such an ancient story for a modern audience. But so many of the changes seem pointless and any attempt to liven things up seems to have failed because, at least as it is presented in this film, the story of Beowulf is a rather dull one. All the eye-catching animation can't hide the fact that this story really drags.<br/><br/>Despite the failings of the story, it must be said that there are some fine performances in this film, although seeing as the actors are not actually ""there"" on the screen, it's a whole different kind of performance than we're used to. But the king Hrothgar sure looks and sounds like Anthony Hopkins, now doesn't he? And hey, isn't that Brendan Gleeson? And Robin Wright Penn? And Angelina Jolie, only all painted up gold and with high-heeled feet? Hopkins and Gleeson and all the others do a fine job of bringing their not-quite-real versions of themselves to life. As Beowulf himself, Ray Winstone may look less like himself than the others but his performance is fine as well. And a special mention for Crispin Glover, who I am fairly certain is not in fact a giant, hideous monster in real life but who here does a good job giving some life and personality to the monster Grendel. But still, despite the impressive cast and the impressive way that cast is brought to animated life, the film really doesn't work. The story fails to take off and for much too much of the time we're left just biding time until the next admittedly visually stunning battle scene. For all the obvious effort that went into the animation you'll end up wishing a little more attention had been paid to the story itself. The story is where this movie fails."
"codyghast","1","9","17","19 November 2007"," this was horrible
","this movie was horrible. I did sort of like the fact that it had a little bit more action that the book, but it has nothing to do with the book. Beowulf did not cut off Grendel's arm he tore it off. Grendel's mother did not have sex with anyone. she tried to drown Beowulf and he cut her head off. the dragon thing was just dumb. The way Beowulf died was nothing like the book. and the way he fought the dragon and killed it was not right. i'm wondering why Hollywood has to mess up a classic story like this let alone all the other stories they killed. I will admit though the 3d imagery was pretty amazing but that doesn't make up for the story line being murdered."
"kjeldoran38","1","9","17","19 November 2007"," Hollywood Ruins Another One
","I waited for this movie to come out for two years. I was in awe at people they were using in the script. I thought for sure the movie would be great, and truly show what a great story Beowulf is.<br/><br/>The 16th comes along, I purchase my tickets and sit in the movie theater as the show starts. The animations where wonderful, Anthony Hopkins made Hrothgar a great and more dynamic character. Of course their accents sucked but I didn't care as long as the movie got better.<br/><br/>Then here comes Beowulf, the first true hero. They make him look like a jackass right from the start. My heart starts sinking. About an hour into the movie, nothing changing, the script keeps pointing out imaginary flaws in the character Beowulf, then the movie just plunges, completely flies off track that the original story was on.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie I sat in agony as I watched one the greatest literary masterpieces get butchered, again and again. Beowulf in the end did't seem to end up a hero like he should of been. The movie gave him too many flaws. It seemed he was more of a martyr.. and for nothing too. Butchered story, butchered character.<br/><br/>The only character that I truly thought they did well with, was Grendel, and the way Glover showed his plight, and made you feel Grendels pain.<br/><br/>.. but come on, this movie was not Beowulf.<br/><br/>Guess I have to wait again till I find a truly good version of Beowulf. And hopefully they read the story this time, and perhaps even John Gardners version of Grendel."
"claudio_carvalho","7","11","22","1 May 2008"," The Father's Sin
","In Denmark, A.D. 507, the realm of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is threatened by the tormented demon Grendel (Crispin Glover) that attacks the locals in their celebrations. The Danish king offers a reward for the death of the creature, attracting to Herot the brave Geet warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone) that seeks for glory. After a fierce battle, Beowulf defeats the demon and after receiving an old relic as reward, he finds his men slaughtered in the party saloon of the castle. King Hrothgar advises that the Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie) was the responsible for the bloodshed and Beowulf chases her in the lake where she lives. The creature takes the form of a seductive woman and seduces Beowulf with a promise of becoming an invincible and wealthy king if he makes love to her and gives his golden relic to her. Years later, King Beowulf feels the aftermath of his sin.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is a dark tale in an age in the beginning of the Christianity and a unique experience with the entire movie made of computer-generated image (CGI). There is no live action, but the stylization of the characters and images is amazing. In accordance with the director Robert Zemeckis, this resource allowed to make this movie with lower costs, using unusual movements of camera. There are silly moments, like for example Beowulf fighting completely naked against Grendel, or the ambiguous character of Unferth, but in the end this movie is entertaining. I only imagine how frustrating might be for actors and actresses performing in blue screen without interaction or set. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda de Beowulf"" (""The Legend of Beowulf"")"
"haterofcrap","10","5","8","23 April 2011"," A great achievement
","Usually, I don't like very much animated films, and also, all the previous adaptations of the Beowulf poem into the big screen have been horrible(Like for example, that horrible movie starring Christopher Lambert) However, this movie managed to be both interesting and enjoyable,also having incredible special effects and CGI. The story and the characters in this movie were quite interesting, and unlike the other previous ""Beowulf"" films, the main character was very well developed, with a realistic and fascinating personality.<br/><br/>I don't know why this movie gets so much hate: It is easily much better than the CGI rubbish animated films that are released every year, and even when the CGI is not so good as the CGI used in films like ""Avatar"" of James Cameron, it was still pretty good.<br/><br/>This is a underrated masterpiece, and it is a great achievement for animation in general."
"gronissimo","10","5","8","6 December 2009"," Epic!
","Oh dear, some people have found out the story is not true to the poem. Not by far, actually. So what? It's a Hollywood production all right, but this entertaining movie has plenty of strong merits going for it.<br/><br/>For instance, the fine art direction and sweet set design work in harmony with the wonderful CGI cinematography to make a brilliant gem of a picture. This animated work of art is a marvel to behold! As technology progresses, it may look slightly dated one day, but never outdated.<br/><br/>The acting is also strong, with perfectly rounded stereotypes, though none overly shallow. Especially Beowulf is a fine character: a genuine epic hero who's actually a bragging windbag who then becomes a hero. There's lots of love, lust, friendship, machismo, pride, greed, glory and opportunism going on, just as you like it! <br/><br/>The language used strikes a perfect balance between general accessibility and a genuine Old Germanic feel. There's even some dead language used by Grendel. I would not know for sure how accurate it is, but since the audience can follow it, this really adds a lot. Again, well done! Some may consider the plot a bit too typical for modern age Hollywood movies, but still the story holds up pretty well and stays interesting to the end.<br/><br/>In sum: mighty fine high-tech entertainment based on the epic poem. Sit back and enjoy the ride! All hail Beowulf! And bring on the monsters!<br/><br/>(I recommend the making-of documentary on (at least) the Bluray release, so you can see how the actors were transformed to their CGI counterparts.)"
"rlange-3","6","8","15","15 March 2008"," Not as bad as some are saying, Not as good as you hoped
","Given the power of the cast and the budget, you perhaps hope for a movie which is stunningly entertaining and in some way expands your consciousness, if only for a brief 90 minutes or so. Unfortunately you get neither, just an action movie with a rather twisted and unhistorical plot. The acting does not shine through the CGI very well. Maybe it's because I am in my 50s and did not grow up with CGI, but I keep feeling like I am watching a cartoon, which is to say the least distracting.<br/><br/>I can certainly understand that in such spectacles as the monster fight, CGI offers at least an approximation of realism. But in scenes where human interaction predominates, CGI falls far short of communicating human expression and emotion and leaves me cold.<br/><br/>There is a lot of discussion of the historical ""accuracy"" of this movie. I did a little research, and it seems that there are major gaps in the major historical document (literally, much is missing or has crumbled away), and how it should be interpreted. Given this, it seems peculiar to pan the latest rendition of a reality that causes great controversy, even among academics. I do agree that Beowulf is portrayed in a very unflattering and unfavorable light by the movie.<br/><br/>In the obvious comparison CGI movie, the 300, the producers emphasized the myth. In Beowulf, they denigrated it. Neither, by itself, is reason to reject the movie itself. But 300 sold itself as a CGI production, and exceeded expectations. Beowulf sold itself as an exceptional human drama and fell flat on its face, saved but hardly exalted by its action scenes."
"pclans2","5","8","15","12 March 2008"," Fantasy taken a step to far
","As I had not looked at the cast list for this picture I had know idea of who the actors where going to be. But as soon as I heard there voices I recognized immediately who I was dealing with Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich and Ray Winstone. All famous actors with a great body of work behind them.<br/><br/>So a question came to mind, what is actually the point of such a movie? I would rather see the real thing rather than a performance capture animation of great actors. The whole point of watching actors is the relationship we create with their characters.<br/><br/>Beowulf simply does not allow you to fall in love with the Actors because of their lack of soul. Dead eyes and facial expressions really block you from creating that relationship that is so necessary for full immersion into the movie experience. - PCL<br/><br/>I mean you can take fantasy a step to far."
"colinbarnard-1","6","8","15","7 December 2007"," What's the Point of Motion Capture?
",".....and I'm not sure about the 6-10...perhaps it's for the 3-D, which is really quite a spectacular achievement...being able to essentially move your head around in an environment and look this way and that, choosing to focus on what you will.....<br/><br/>But, the computer animation is nothing more than an all-inclusive production design, which is fine- all films have to have a unifying production design. But to paint over real actors, when they are already being used seems a terrible waste, when the technology still can't render the human form believable. They're coming closer, but the actor's main tool, his face and mouth, still have yet to be fully realized.<br/><br/>Motion capture gets the broad strokes of body movement, giving the body a sense of mass on-screen, which is why this technique looks so much better than the digital avatar that stands in for Toby McGuire in the Spiderman films. Spidy has no sense of mass when it isn't McGuire. But all the actors in Beowulf do not have realistically expressive faces, and consequently the film falls apart. Given that the plot is thin gruel, not worthy of a two-hour plus film, Zemeckis would have been better off to use the techniques employed in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" and let the real actors play around in a digital environment. The photorealism would be intact, and the actors would be allowed to bring all their chops to bear.<br/><br/>To be sure, motion capture is fine when the actors are covered in digital make-up a la Gollum, and I'm sure Ray Winstone appreciates the fitness programme that he did not have to embark on to get himself ripped for this role, but that's it! So what's the point? Filmgoers have been willingly suspending their disbelief for the sake of buying the fantasy since the original King Kong, and Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Ray Harryhausen was delivering the goods way before digital technology came about.<br/><br/>This film works only as a technological exercise. Someday they will be able to replicate an actor's facial features exactly, mimicking the skin and muscle contractions that make the human face such a magnificent tool for the performer. But until then, why not use the real thing? And none of this substitutes for telling a good story. Beowulf is a sad commentary on American films that make technique king over substance. That's why Andy Warhol isn't Rembrandt."
"rpsp1066","10","8","15","17 November 2007"," Bewowulf
","3-D has come a loooooonnnnngggg way! This may not technically be a spoiler, but don't expect the typical Hollywwod ending. Had we seen this when I was in High school 30+ years ago, having to read the book would have not been such a chore. It brings a classic tale to life in a way that has not been done before. The tone is cold , hard and raw. The monster is completely repulsive. The hero retains the most tragic characteristics of humanity. Unlike many of today's adventure tales good and evil become a bit blurred, the hero is not perfect, and the ending is not happy. Beowulf is an unnaturally strong warrior who is brave but flawed. He is a likable liar who tells tales that, despite being unbelievable, are even less bizarre than the truth. There is a realism to this that defies the modern day meaning of myth despite the monsters and demons in the story. Angelina Jolie plays the most seductive part in a film I've ever seen. This movie is a must watch!"
"C22Man","7","3","4","16 December 2013"," I will kill your Monstah!!!
","Everyone knows the story of Beowulf, one of the oldest poems ever written. So Robert Zemeckis certainly had his work cut out to make a film that was both entertaining for modern audiences and still paid tribute to its original source. Zemeckis deciding to film in Motion- Capture again, after the iffy results of The Polar Express, was another brave move. The film did have me questioning certain aspects beforehand, would the Motion-Capture work? Could it avoid becoming another typical action movie? And why Cockney hardman Ray Winstone as the Swedish hero? Making the whole thing work and pay off would be a huge achievement.<br/><br/>The follows the poem as warrior Beowulf and his men travel to Denmark to rid a kingdom of the monster Grendel. After Beowulf manages to kill the creature, he learns that its mother is still wreaking havoc and goes to her lair in order to kill her. However, once there he makes a bargain with her to become king and bare her 'son' that will have terrible aftereffects. The film deserves massive credit for managing to extend the story without diluting it, something that concerned me prior. The more time means that more characters are developed and become more interesting the longer things go along, especially Beowulf and the Queen. The things involving Grendel and his Mother are great, the older thoughtful Beowulf offers good insight into the man and the climax, with a Dragon, is superb.<br/><br/>The Motion-Capture is a main talking point and, thankfully, it is excellent. There have clearly been developments in the field as the zombie-like expressions have gone and everything is even closer to real life. The characters are brilliantly designed, for example Grendel looks truly monstrous and Beowulf himself is excellently rendered. The characters a look very lifelike and have close similarities to their actors, all except for Beowulf himself. Seeing as he is played by a burly Winstone they make him more athletic looking and he ends up resembling Sean Bean, which sounds strange but works perfectly well. <br/><br/>The details are fantastic, the scenery looks beautiful in all its snow covered glory. A lot of work clearly went into making the backdrop look authentic and it really is visually stunning at times. The use of snow and sunshine looks extremely realistic as they add to the visual spectacle. Certain visual aspects like the injuries and Beowulf's battles are really well stylised, never being too goofy and always looking very effective. <br/><br/>But could Ray Winstone succeed as Beowulf? The answer is a strong yes. In theory the Cockney Winstone shouldn't work. Yet it does, as he possesses excellent charisma and there is an understated intensity to his performance that makes things click. The Cockney accent creeps in at times, such as when he shouts 'I will kill your monstah!', but for the most part he tones it down and does sound like a tough warrior. Here is where Winstone proved that he does have some amount of versatility and he shows he do a great job at the forefront of the film. <br/><br/>The other performances are extremely good. Anthony Hopkins offers his usual hammy turn as the under pressure King, though given the tone of the film this actually works okay and he is entertaining. Brendan Gleeson gives a solid turn as Beowulf's right-hand man, John Malkovich is effective in his backing role and Robin Wright is excellent once again as the sombre queen, showing once more that she is a brilliant actress. Crispin Glover adds touches of sadness and sympathy to the monstrous Grendel. The animation on him looks great and his soft tongue reflects his brutal actions well. Angelina Jolie shows up as the beasts Mother and spends a lot of time with little clothing on. Despite her short appearance she portrays the seductive and cruel creature excellently.<br/><br/>Another hotly discussed aspect is the rating, and I agree with the general view. How the hell did this get a 12 certificate? The violence is truly brutal. We actually see Grendel ripping people in half, blood pouring out of wounds and arms being sliced clean off. Not to mention that there are a lot of sexual references and some very scary moments. Just because it isn't real-life doesn't tone it down. I do enjoy the viciousness as its ads to the films impact, but the rating is just wrong.<br/><br/>The action scenes are impressive, as I've alluded to. Beowulf's battle with Grendel is intense and has some pounding action, even if him fighting in the bluff is a bit distracting. The climax involving a dragon is excellent, containing plenty of pulsating action and edge of your set thrills. Even the drama hits the right spot, the scenes of the older Beowulf and the focus on the Queen leads to a lot of interesting moments. Elsewhere regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri delivers the goods again with another top notch score, it has the right amount of intensity and melancholy to fit the film.<br/><br/>I'm actually happy that Beowulf passed my expectations. It answered concerns over expanding the story and the idea of Ray Winstone as the man exceptionally. Some may question why the film wasn't just shot in live action, but I think that the Motion-Capture adds to the films uniqueness and does allow for many wonderful visual moments. The film itself does show that Motion-Capture can add a lot to a film instead of taking away from it. Don't be expecting a perfect adaption because it's not that type of film. The acting is excellent, the action sequences are thrilling and the visuals are truly something to behold. It is a thoroughly entertaining film."

","Reviewers rave about dolly shots impossible in live action, groundbreaking motion capture technology and previously unseen surface texture, but what's the point? Everybody goes on about how difficult it was to make this movie, and what a technical achievement it is. How come nobody ever asks why you would want your movie to look like a video game in the first place? Flames don't look one bit like flames, and the sea doesn't even come close to the real thing, let alone the wooden expressions and clumsy moves of the characters. Even the blue demon fire looks fake, no small feat given it has no counterpart in the real world. But the similarity with video games doesn't stop there. ""Beowulf"" is one long string of teenage macho fantasy dripping with blood, sweat, semen and megabytes.

It is complete junk food for your soul. That film studio should be ashamed of themselves for just making it, let alone for actually releasing it. The only way I can describe this movie and studio is like this.. it would be like relating it to a city that had a multi million dollar budget to do something great and deciding that they would spend all of their money redirecting all of the sewage to every hospital in the city and piling it up in front of the building. I hope you do not see this movie, it will leave you wondering why you did."
"JustStone","8","9","18","30 November 2007"," Beowulf is an epic of a movie as epic of a poem
","So we've all read Beowulf in school at some point, and whether you loved it or hated it I think we can all agree it was given to us to read for its historical significance. It is the definitive hero's tale that is just as importantly about its anonym...(read more)ous authorship as its classic action/adventure arch-typical story. The fact that it is author-less gives strong support it is a myth that has echoed through the ages and passed on through oral tradition. In this way Beowulf is held sacred for its straightforward and rudimentary mythology, not for having an elaborate plot.<br/><br/>The movie holds onto this logic, yet drastically improves on it, and if I seem like I am gloating, it's because I am; this movie is great. Although I strongly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D, its overall impact should serve the same in a regular theater (just not in 3D). Now it seems that there are two major arguments against the film; 1) the complete and exclusive reliance on CGI. 2) The adaptation and deviation from the poem. I can strongly say the CGI doesn't for a second take anything away from the film, and if anything it gains momentum from it. Robert Zemeckis's action sequences are breathtaking, and perfectly fitting for the epic nature of the story, and although I am in no way an advocate for entirely CGI films (""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" anyone?), it seems this time they really did get it right.<br/><br/>The adaptation from epic poem to epic film was no different, and Beowulf the film was going to need a stronger narrative backbone to work, which thankfully the script successfully gave it. The problem of course is when you have a story as prolific as Beowulf there will always be purists and literary historians that expect it to stay loyal to its origins. However what writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery had done was provide a new emotional depth and a stronger moralistic center that the original Beowulf had only hinted at. The major themes in Beowulf have always been about pride and reputation, and the ability to rise above them. These were problems Beowulf discreetly dealt with in the original poem, but in the movie everything is extremely focused around them. In doing so Gaiman and Avery deemed it necessary to change Beowulf persona from fearless hero, to flawed boaster, who although is still heroic, is now exclusively ruled by pride and recognition. This also changed the role of Beowulf three villains, who instead of being basic foes become metaphoric specters of a hero's heavy conscious. Every change made was done with delicacy and appreciation for the original tale, and I applaud Gaiman's and Avery's writing depth and ability.<br/><br/>However what is most important to note about the films CGI and deviated narrative structure is it carries on the oral tradition that supposedly birthed Beowulf in the first place. If it really is true that Beowulf was passed on orally from generation to generation as all ancient myth's had, then Gaiman and Avery script is just another addition to the extension of this tradition, and the CGI was another way of emphasizing the epic proportions that once could only be imagined through spoken word. This movie not only succeeds in doing this, but does so in gigantic strides. It is a great achievement, and a milestone in our tradition of inspired moralistic storytelling."

","Please let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this movie a 1 is because it won't let me select a negative number. I saw no redeeming qualities about this movie despite the cast (Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Brendon Gleeson, Crispin Glover, and other assorted nameless peons). The basis of the movie is of course the epic of the hero Beowulf, a worthy endeavor, if the production company would actually stick to the friggin story. The plot was hard to follow and the accents were too thick (i.e.-they were hard to understand) the fact that Sangri-La decided to use CGI was a completely idiotic move. I understand that you can't get some of the shots of the monsters without it but the whole movie?.... come on now. The script writer ought to be fired, i mean how lame can you get with the main character screaming ""I AM BEOWULF!!!"" every other breath. I can honestly say that I had high hopes for this movie based on the previews, but when it was over I couldn't help thinking ""Well, there's two hours of my life I can't get back."" In short......don't waste your money."
"antblogger","4","6","11","27 November 2007"," Regarding the Movie's Relationship to the Original
","I love the Beowulf in its original form (by which i mean the original plot-line since all I can read are translations); however, I understand why the writer changed it. In the original, Beowulf has no inner-conflict. He is supremely confident, goes into battle ready to die, and so on. He makes no moral choice except to choose glory and honor. Thus, he only faces external foes which don't make for high drama, so they had Beowulf choose the demon and glory over the queen and domesticity to have the hero make a moral choice that he'd later reap a terrible consequence. The message of the real Beowulf is the pagan emptiness, the pathos of lost glory and old age compared with the Christian hope of eternal life, of which Beowulf has no inkling.<br/><br/>Interestingly, in the story the conflict is in the narrator who is clearly a Christian of some kind whose relating this very pagan tale. His conflict between Beowulf's world and the Christian perspective in which he writes is incorporated in the story though I thought unnecessarily.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought the movie failed to create a compelling drama. It ended up being mostly smoke and noise."

","The storyline to this movie works very well, unfortunately that is the only thing that works well in this movie. This movie is designed using totally motion capture computers. This is a great feature when in movies like 300, lord of the rings, and harry potter were this technique is to enhance the human characters in that world. Too design a movie based purely on this factor makes the movie feel fake and robbing us of the human emotions that this technique can't accomplish yet. If your going to use human characters use humans to play those parts. Movies such as happy feet are different because not only are we expected to give these characters a cartoon look and feel but their all animals. Beowulf in my opinion would have been more entertaining if they would have made the movie with real people, and used the computers to enhance the film"

","Sure the action was cool but i couldn't enjoy it as i watched one of my favorite producers of all time do something i could not believe i was watching. I read this story in my English class and found it thrilling and exciting and really grew to admire the character of Beowulf a Brave hero with no desire for riches or reward but only for glory. However the Beowulf of this movie is not that Beowulf, it is a greedy coward of a man who more resembles Grendal than Beowulf. This Must be Without a doubt the worst adaptation of any story EVER. I have no problem with the movie had they called it the golden sea witch or something but leading me to believe i was going to see Beowulf is insulting. This in no way resembles the story of Beowulf other than the names, the story seemed to fallow even with slight inconsistencies during the Grendel portion and i was enjoying it but as soon as Grendel died so did my smile. First off wtf Beowulf did not screw the sea witch! HE KILLED HER! and he did not become king of that land he returned home where he became king when his king died and the kings son was unforchunantly killed he did not have a dragon for a son he was not a coward and this movie is not Beowulf if i wanted to see another movie where the ruined one of my favorite heroes i would have watched Spiderman 3 again. I am really becoming sick of this why do people go to see movies and hale them as fantastic just cus there is a bunch of fancy jumping around and fighting! Does anybody care about substance at all? To counter any who say well if you liked 300 (which this movie stupidly copied PLEASE BE ORIGINAL FOR ONCE) then why didn't you care that it was completely inaccurate too, CUS ITS HISTORY NNOT ANOTHER STORY AND HISTORY Always GETS DISTORTED HELL THE STORY THE GREEKS TOLD ABOUT THERMOPOLY Wasn't TOO FAR OFF FROM THE MOVIE CUS THE GREEKS WON AND WANTED TO LOOK COOL, but this is a story and you cant name a movie after a story and have it be a different movie! Oh and before i go what the heck was all the references to Jesus Christ? THIS IS A NORSE MYTHOLOGY STORY!!!!!!! THATS LIKE PUTTING MOHAMAD IN THE ODESSY AND THE ILLIAD (which I'm sure will arrive in movie theaters near you in 2008 as closely fallowing the story as this film)"

There is a neat enough plot, the effects are fairly spectacular. And it probably hangs together a bit better than 300.

","""I am Beowulf!"" yells Beowulf.<br/><br/>Five minutes later, he full-throats again, ""I am Beowulf!"" for those arriving late, we presume¬Ö Divebombing into a raging sea of serpents, sword slashing on bloodied sinew, warrior man-meat glistening with sev-- ""I am Beowulf!"" ‚Äì Okay dude, now you're just feeding some deep-rooted insecurity complex¬Ö <br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is the oldest known English epic poem (Anonymous author), one of the first pieces to be transcribed from its oral tradition to manuscript (somewhere between 700 and 1000 AD.) That's a pretty awesome pedigree, with a hundred modern media incarnations shouldering their claim-space, so to tackle another incarnation one needs to bring something pretty extraordinary to the table. And Robert Zemeckis's BEOWULF is definitely extraordinary ‚Äì in one sense. And definitely mediocre in all others¬Ö <br/><br/>The extraordinary aspect of this 2007 incarnation is its 3D-motion-capture method. Pioneering this ""realistic"" method on THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004), Zemeckis now hones it to breath-defying proportions. Nothing is real, but it is obviously emulating reality through sensors on actors' faces and bodies, and the zenith of ""3D-cartoon"" technology. At first, those bi-color glasses suck all the joy out of the movie-going experience; then once you get used to them, you marvel at the whizbang technique itself, even though many action passages threaten to incite ocular myasthenia; after all the 3D wonder has dissipated, you can sit back to enjoy the movie on its movie merits, but by then, you've figured out it has sacrificed most of those merits for the sake of whizbang and annoying glasses.<br/><br/>Now that was a whole lotta something for a whole lotta nothing. But I'd already paid for the parking, so I guess I was obligated¬Ö <br/><br/>In this Ye Olde English tale (set in Denmark and Sweden), lush lech King Hrothgar (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) and his reveling court are regularly terrorized by the ugliest person/creature in the world, with an oversensitive external eardrum, named Grendel (Crispin Glover, whose main dialog outbursts consist of the word ""Raaaargh!""). From across the treacherous seas (we imagine Zep's The Immigrant Song accompanying him) comes Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone) and his merry men, borne only with the desire to accrue glory in slaying Grendel. A tacit bonus prize is Hrothgar's nubile queen, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn), whom Beowulf wastes no time in showing off his pecs to.<br/><br/>In the Great Mead Hall, Hrothgar's manservant, Unferth (John Malkovich), pooh-poohs Beowulf's tall tales (causing more unnecessary proclamations from Beowulf about being Beowulf) and Hrothgar unveils a gleaming chalice as a prize for Beowulf were he to defeat Grendel. Beowulf illogically figures that to beat Grendel, he must strip naked. That, and to give the queen a no-hands ""wassup."" <br/><br/>In response to Beowulf's men roaring ribald drinking songs into the night, Grendel appears at the Mead Hall and kills almost everyone, before his arm is ripped off by a nude Beowulf with artfully-obscured genitalia. (It irks me that our society still giggles whenever male genitalia are scantily-hidden by foreground objects ‚Äì it's a juvenile practice for juvenile viewers and pulls you out of the story quite forcefully.) Beowulf's liege, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson), survives the attack, to fight and make running gags another day.<br/><br/>Grendel retreats to his dank subterranean domicile, mortally wounded; a poignant moment when we realize this ""monster"" is only a pathetic wretch with oversensitive hearing who, like many young garage bands will attest, only wanted the neighbors to ""turn down that damn noise."" His most powerful witch mother (who looks like Angelina Jolie, only hotter), cradles him in her lullaby arms sadly, at which point Grendel whispers another gratuitous ""Beowulf!"" and dies (thereby promoting the second-ugliest person in the world to first place), which sends his mother into a dragon vendetta against the man so named.<br/><br/>There are plot twists which depart from the original tale, but this movie ties all the familial threads together very intriguingly: We discover that Hrothgar had ""relations"" with the witch to spawn Grendel ‚Äì his son! When Beowulf enters the dank chamber to finish off the witch, she seduces him by simply turning up as Angelina Jolie. Years later we will discover that the dragon that firestorms Beowulf's castle and causes the sacrifice of his arm and life is, in fact, the spawn of Beowulf from his union with the witch. It's all very DAYS OF OUR LIVES and kept pretty succinct, whereas the original legend rambles on with trysts hither and thither complicating things... and that Olde English doesn't help¬Ö <br/><br/>There is minimal exploration of other themes, but they seem forced at best: Beowulf's lament of his legend growing greater than he ever was; of his age precluding him from iron-thewed battles, etc. but the movie itself knows that there is not much to itself, except its grandiloquent Things That Come At You From The Screen.<br/><br/>Though some viewers had trouble adjusting to the eyes of the characters, it all seemed quite realis-- ""I am Beowulf!"" <br/><br/>Oh, give it a rest!"

","When I watched this movie at the cinema with my mother, I was really scared because I thought this was only designed to be a movie containing violence and horror. However, about an hour after the movie ended, I began to think about it. At first, I believed that almost the entire movie included mysteries. Then, I began to focus more on the beginning of the movie. Until Beowulf arrives in Heorot, many great mysteries are introduced and to that end, I ponder why all of that is the way it is.<br/><br/>This movie truly shows the influence of family bonds and how one's willpower can break those bonds. Plus, in my opinion, there is an invisible barrier which stops you from hurting your child, an inner force that tells you something along the lines of ""You can not hurt the one who is part of you, if you do, then you are only hurting yourself."" Still, with a lot of willpower you can overcome those bonds that prevent you from causing yourself limitless emotional suffering. (Look at the confrontation between Grendel and his father towards the beginning of the movie, as well as Hrothgar's plan to get Grendel murdered and Hrothgar's suicide.) Here, I would also like to add that I truly sympathise with Grendel.<br/><br/>At that point, I would also like to mention that, to me, the movie also poses the following question: What hurts one more, physical injury or the pain of having done irreversible emotional harm to one's own family? That question is truly the deeper moral of the movie and this deeper meaning of family bonds makes me think. On that note, I wish to say that this movie is really great with its basic and deeper meaning."

Maybe one of it's many synonyms: ""Unbelievably Great"". <br/><br/>I saw the movie last night and, being in Bucharest, the only way to watch it is 2D. I was kind of disappointed that there's no IMAX 3D cinema in my country, but I went to see the movie anyway. And it was worth it. Beowulf is the best animation I've seen, and I am a big fan of this genre. It has the depth of a real life drama and the greatness of an epic poem. Some people complain it doesn't resemble so much to the original Beowulf poem. I've seen some people that even gave this movie the minimum rating just because of that. But I see it as an adaptation. It wants to be much more than an animated version of an epic story. That has been already done and undone. The story is flawless, the cameras are fantastic, and the CGI is the best of today. Comparing Beowulf to other animated movies, it has a huge advantage over them. It has real actors . It's not only the voices. The graphics are so good, you can actually see emotions on the character's faces. Their eyes show fear, courage, lust and deception. It's remarkable how you could tell by the animated hero's eyes that he's not telling the truth. <br/><br/>There is no point in saying how perfect Ray Winstone ,Sir Anthony Hopkins or any other actor in this movie plays his/hers part. They are , as always, extraordinary and this movie lets them shine.<br/><br/>The only downside of this movie is Angelina's accent, witch creep-ed me out in Alexander and now it's back to haunt me.

Since then I've read Raymond Feist, David Gemmell, Robert Jorden, Terry Goodkind - the list goes on. Each time I go to the cinema and see ""Dungeons and Dragons"" or ""Eragon"" I feel cheated, because the movie never comes close to the images I have in my head of a fantasy realm.

If you like watching the opening scenes for games like World of Warcraft or EverQuest II, then you will appreciate the beauty of this movie. At times it feels like you're looking at the real thing, most notably Angelina Jolie's face in most of her scenes or Brendan Gleeson towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 2D and was extremely impressed by it, more so for the fast heavy beats (the music is awesome) that vibrated throughout the cinema and the excellent dialog that Beowulf delivers. I went back to see it in 3D two days later because I couldn't get it out of my mind - if you're able to watch this in 3D, it is far superior to the 2D version.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of movies, almost 1 a day and I very rarely watch the same thing twice.

If anybody during claimed that Zemecki had been asleep during the making of this movie I'd believe it immediately.<br/><br/>Because ""Beowulf"" is a prime example of a dull movie. It's incredibly kitschy and presents a cruelly simplified rendering of an old myth. The so-called characters are as lively and appealing as wax figures. Others seem to made of plastic. Thus they they completely fail to evoke any emotions - or at least not the emotions desired by the filmmakers.

","I went in to see this movie with high expectations. Boy was I let down. First off, I would like to start off with a question; why was this film not given a R rating. There were scenes in this movie that made Austin Powers look tame by comparison. The only real comparison I can give to this move is an episode of King of the Hill where Bobbie's drama teacher does a reenactment of The Alamo where the heroes who fought and died there were drunk, cross-dressing, surrender-monkeys. Yes, the deviation is that bad. My biggest beef is that Beowulf is depicted as a skirt-chasing fraud who has trouble keeping it in his pants where supernatural women and other men's wives are concerned. But that is not the only serious deviation. In the epic poem Grendel was the son of Cain, not Hrothgar, and his mother was also one of Cain's kin. Beowulf did NOT have sex with Grendel's mother (who, to my understanding, was not a succubus) and did NOT father the dragon which would eventually kill him. Throw in the fact that that towards the end of the movie Beowulf is not even attempting to hide the fact that he is cheating on his wife with a girl young enough to be his granddaughter and you have ruined quite possibly the greatest hero in literature. My other point was some of the CGI characters. They look like they were ripped out of Shrek. So, to make a long story short I left the theater not just feeling disappointed but also quite angry. This sort of ""my own interpretation"" is the sort of thing I would have expected from Oliver Stone. My biggest worry is that those who have never read the poem and are unfamiliar with the story will think this is an accurate depiction of it."

The possibility for beautiful cinematography was ruined by over-done animation, leaving me feeling nauseated, and ultimately fleeing the theater. I do not look forward to the new age of animation. It was clever when Polar Express came out--now, its just annoying--film films, animate cartoons. Don't mix the two. Not that undoing animation could save Beowulf. An oozing Grendel did nothing to help this movie's case. The blatant grotesque nature is abhorring, and leaves the viewer feeling visually assaulted. This films out look on women and their historical role is not only far from entertaining, but insulting and demeaning. The romance between Beowulf and Hrothgar's young wife makes women appear to be lacking in virtue and moral capability, contributed by more subtle comments, such as the village women, and Beowulf's comrades' behaviors. Ultimately, this movie will not stand the test of time. It will slip between the cracks in the sidewalk into the sewer where it belongs."
"moosey_maniac","1","6","12","16 January 2008"," Beowulf Suckage listings
","I was overjoyed when I saw ""Beowulf"" commercials, but I was thoroughly disappointed upon seeing the film. I was hoping for a classy telling of the famous tale of Beowulf, but I was thrown into a pit of horrors known as Angelina Jolie. I found major flaws in the movie that did not tell the story even slightly like the original epic. Beowulf previously had relations with Hrothgar. He was an old friend. Hrothgar in the movie had a child with Grendel's mother (Grendel) and Beowulf had a child with her as well (Dragon) Grendel's mom is not a seductress fish-woman. Grendel's Mother was, like Grendel, a hulking troll-esquire monster, filled with rage when she learned that Beowulf had dismembered her son. In the actual story Beowulf slew Grendel by removing his arm and sending him home to his swamp where he died in his mothers arms, which angered Grendel's mother and thus lured Beowulf to the swamp. At the swamp Beowulf confronted Grendel's mother, slaying her. However, in the movie, ""Golden-Jolie"" melted Hrunting (His sword) into molten mercury using her ""Sexiness lazors"" within seconds and having babies with her. Beowulf was depicted as a lying, showboating jerk and all around unlikable. In the movie almost half of his actions we're ill intentioned or to that effect. Hrothgar in the story was a mighty king lesser than Beowulf, but still a mighty king. He was depicted as a hedonistic old lay about. In the story Grendel was a huge, Muscular and terrifying monster similar to a troll, ogre or some sort of giant. In the movie he was the half-troll son of Hrothgar and Grendel's mother in actuality he was just a plaguing monstrosity inhabiting the area along with his mother. There were other flaws in the movie: Christianity for one had most likely not been introduced to the Norwegian area during this era and was pushed as a toy for Christians who might have come to see the movie. The characters were referring to Christianity throughout the movie, as if they had changed religions on the spot. I challenge you to find the remnants of a Christian church around 300.AD Norway. In the movie the dragon was a Shape Shifting Wyvern, who was the son of Beowulf. In the Poem the Dragon was a monstrous Landwyrm that attacked Beowulf's men, Beowulf slew the beast not using a ""Magical neck heart"" but just chopping it's head off. The dragon in the movie was a half-demon half-human hybrid from Beowulf and Grendel's mother. He apparently can shape shift from human made of gold to a once again golden WYVERN. In Norse mythology the dragons depicted in mythology were Landwyrms, these dragons were corrupted humans from greed and other such sins and did not have wings, looked like lizards, and were more demon than human. Finally, The golden Drinking horn, it was not even mentioned in the Poem, Beowulf was offered a mass of various riches by Hrothgar not a Mysterious horn. Of the many movies and representations of mythological stories and tales, this one is by far the worst ever conceived. Pretty much the whole story was off."
"charchuk","4","6","12","15 December 2007"," More a technological marvel than a coherent movie
","Meh. I had low expectations going in, and it couldn't even really meet them. I saw it in 2D, and though the visuals were very impressive and at times stunning, there were too many instances where it seemed obvious that they were going for the 3D 'look' (basically, any time something flew at the camera). The backgrounds and sets and creatures all looked terrific, but the human characters were nowhere near realistic and just seemed to be rejects from the Shrek movies. I feel they should have used real actors, no animation, with every else CG - something like what 300 or Sin City did. As a result, I couldn't be simply wowed by the images.<br/><br/>The story has potential, but fails on the execution. I do like what they changed from the poem; the whole film flowed better and it got interesting right in the middle with regards to Grendel's mother. Unfortunately, the ideas the film brings up are never really fleshed out, and before long there's another incredible action scene to distract us from the plot. The acting is pretty bad, not only because the animated characters can't express emotion, but the voices are bland and have trouble getting around the clunky dialogue. Read the poem (and the excellent novel Grendel by John Gardner) if you want to think, see this if you want to be entertained.<br/><br/>It's not terrible, but it's not an overpowering experience like it's been made up to be. The action scenes aren't that impressive, and they're made even less so by the fact that it's all animated. It's more of a showcase for this new technology then a coherent, interesting movie, though it does adapt the poem well. It's a fun watch, and should definitely be seen in theatres, but that's about it."

","Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen -- and I've seen many. If you're a thirteen-year-old lad, you may like the gore, juvenile sexual innuendo and Dungeons-and-Dragons framing of this film. If you're an adult who has ever appreciated the original Anglo-Saxon epic, you'll be appalled. The plot has only the vaguest of resemblance to the original work. It was actually painful to hear Sir Anthony Hopkins recite such childish dialogue.<br/><br/>I can only conclude that the intent of this film was to create a video game -- that's what the film feels like . It certainly wasn't to tell the story of Beowulf. My recommendation: do yourself a favour; skip the film and buy the audiobook of Seamus Heaney's 1999 translation instead."

King Hrothgar(Anthony Hopkins)and his people and magnificent mead hall are being terrorized by the horrific monster Grendel(Crispin Glover). Hrothgar puts out the word for anyone with a strong army to come band with his own soldiers to battle the monster. It is the mightiest warrior of them all, Beowulf(Ray Winstone) and his cadre of soldiers to the rescue. The acclaimed hero destroys the demon Grendel and incurs the wrath of the monster's sexy and seductive serpentine mother(Angelina Jolie). The battle will echo through the ages, immortalizing the memory and name of Beowulf. Superior eye-candy.

"paulo20","2","4","7","9 December 2007"," 4 stars...for the dragon.
","Others have said it better than me but that's not going to stop my putting in my 2 pence. Here we have yet another classic work that has been compromised to presumably tell a more, presumably, ""believable"" tale. We're expected to believe Beowulf is flawed and that he's bragging about his exploits, yet we witness him performing the kind of feats he's supposedly bragging about. Perhaps someone can explain that to me.<br/><br/>The part where he demonstrates he really is flawed is when he is seduced by the presumably irresistible ""Monster Queen"" as played by Angelina Jolie. This is some pretty tawdry film-making. Basically, we're led to believe that no man, however hardy, can resist seduction and we're left with this bitter taste at the very ending of the film. That this is all part of some vicious, unending cycle.<br/><br/>We also have an alleged romance between Beowulf and Wealthow invented for the movie, yet I never saw any evidence of it on the screen, so why bother? The character herself was annoying as all get-out. Most of her ""performance"" was in giving endless wistful looks and showing off how pretty her face is. To be fair, some of these ideas themselves aren't really that awful...when explored on their own. When transposed on an epic work, they just ring false.<br/><br/>As does the animation. Loved the scenery but the character animation didn't do it for me. Despite, the exquisite textures (on the main characters, anyway; the extras looked like they came straight out of the Shrek movies), the renderings of humans didn't strike me as particularly convincing, especially the eyes. They are just off. They come off as cold, and thus, so do the characters. And men riding horses came off as risible.<br/><br/>However, the dragon sequence was awesome (despite the nature of the beast being changed for the film); cant' find any fault with that, probably because I'm a sucker for dragons. Hence the relatively generous rating."
"DarkAgentX","5","4","7","25 November 2007"," Classic Literature Dumbed Down Horribly
","Beowulf is a tale that has sparked great debate and was on of J.R.R. Tolkien's inspirations for the Lord of the Rings. It's a tale that deals with monsters and myth and interestingly, a world that is both Christian and Pagan. It's a story just as interesting today as it was all those centuries ago. This movie however is the anti-Beowulf picture. <br/><br/>Zemeckis undoubtedly saw the far superior Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and decided that he too could do a PG-13. CGI has come a long way since Toy Story and Shrek. With video games becoming the far more common and popular media, there is a large audience interested in CGI and so forth. On what could have been a great outing, this picture is turned to trash. <br/><br/>Our film starts sour from the beginning with the opening the hall of Herot by King Hrothgar. Were treated to a almost naked CGI version of Anthony Hopkins (Like anyone under 65 wants to see that anyway.) Drunkenly pretend to be funny and create filler. When everything seems like it hasn't dragged on enough, Grendel appears. <br/><br/>There's no real description of Grendel in text other than being a large monster however this CGI trash is nothing more than a super deformed giant blue child. It's hardly scary nor interesting. He just kills a few people and we move on to Beowulf coming.<br/><br/>Now, the CGI is great and there are times for example with Angelina Jolie's character, its almost lifelike and hard to tell whether they super imposed her head or merely did a CGI reconstruction of her face. The action sequences save for the end are hardly memorable. Beowulf being completely naked during the fight with Grendel becomes a game of hide Beowulf's penis. The epic sea serpent battle feels about as fake as sea monsters really are. <br/><br/>What could have saved the film would have been the second arc of the play where Beowulf goes after Grendel's mother. This epic departure from the text arguably and undoubtedly ruins the entire movie. Instead of engaging in an epic underwater fight with Grendel's mother, Beowulf is simply seduced by her and gives her a child. It's unsure what influence Angelina Jolie had and what the director wanted but this sudden rewriting of Jolie's role turns the movie upside down. <br/><br/>Were treated to a dull third arc that culminates with Beowulf's dry love affair with another maiden and the consequences of his one night stand with Grendel's nameless mother. The dragon for the finale was especially well down however, the revelation that its Beowulf's son is hardly realized until after the dragon is dead. Wiglaf, a minor player at the end of the text is barely added in and hardly helps.<br/><br/>If you love classic literature, stay away. If you hate dull characters, stay away. If you hate pointless sexual references, stay away. If you want comedy, action or something to remember, stay away. Angelina Jolie has hardly any real time in this picture. There's no faithfulness to the original epic which makes you ironically wish Beowulf would die. My congratulations to the team behind this.<br/><br/>CGI can be great, CGI can be revolutionary, however, this attempt just hinders the genre and makes action movies as a whole full of pointless violence that isn't even entertaining or exciting. You'll leave wishing you had chosen a better movie. Walk away please. With films like The Golden Compass coming soon, its better to stay home than waste your money."

The Ten Commandments...perhaps the best ever of any kind ever made(because of its time period). I was also enamored by the Disney classics, Snow White, Cinderella, Jungle Book and some of the latter...Ice Age and Shrek. But every one of these Video Game graphic movies are the same ... lame characters, wooden figures and dull background settings. How great a film would this have been with live action? And glasses are a pain, even if you already wear glasses so you are used to them. I hated the fact Disney made Sinbad as a cartoon and they cancelled the live action one with Keanu Reeves. Make real movies for real people, not just game freaks. I gave this a 2 and it really wasn't worth that much except the monsters were cool. Of course so were the monsters in Lord of the Rings...uh, but then that was with live actors!"
"labi722","10","7","15","17 November 2007"," Utterly Hilarious
","Despite the numerous plot holes, extendable arms, a wife who's best friends with her husband's concubine, inexplicably deformed children, a king who is happily portrayed as a back-flipping midget and a dragon with a tiny heart in its throat which lay inches from gallons of molten lead, I found this movie 'curiously intimate' and sock filled with 'poignant humility'.<br/><br/>Initially, it confused me that Grendel attacked the humans for making so much noise, however in the process of shutting them up he seemed to make a lot of noise himself. Also he must of realized that the townsfolk would not stop 'merry-making', which begs the questions 1) Why did he still live in his mum's house when he was clearly above 30 2) why didn't he get a place in the country which was a little quieter and 3) at least bloody ear muffs. Finally I found his lack of genitals slightly disturbing.<br/><br/>Speaking of this shortage (get it, its 'cos he has no penis) his mother, the 'excruciatingly sexy siren' also seemed to be lacking in any sexual organs which was odd as BEOWULF clearly had sex with her, come to mention that we never saw BEOWULF's 'manhood' despite his baffling readiness to do pretty much everything naked.<br/><br/>Moving on to Wulfy, his character again seemed flawed because he was constantly lying about all his victories, which is stupid because we, the audience, just saw what actually happened and he was lying. He was a lying, immodest, selfish prick and frankly I didn't like him at all. The oddest bit of the whole film was when he chopped off his arm but he still could not reach his son's heart with the sword but seconds later he reached it with his bare hands. While on the subject of his son's anatomy, his heart was in a very vulnerable place and he looked like the silver surfer. <br/><br/>The best bits were obviously all the scenes involving Angelina Jolie, though the odd growths on her heels made her walk like a porn star but that's not a complaint. Also her erratic behavior truly represented the women in this film as she slept with the man whom she knew to have just frankly tortured her son through extensive cauliflowering of his ear. Also BEOWULF's wife was inexplicably distant from him in the later part of the film and became friends with a woman who she knew banging her husband. In addition why did BEOWULF's son have the features of Greek Adonis while Hopkin's had a son which should have been shot at birth. Also can I mention that the castle was not up to code in heath and safety standards, if there was at least a guard rail on that poorly placed gap in the wall then Anthony Hopkins would have not had such clumsy and flamboyant exit from the film. Also there were numerous, perhaps inadvertent, references to Zelda, 300, beast master and Conan the barbarian. In conclusion despite the disorientating plot errors I loved it and am going to go see it 3D."
"lessa14402","2","13","33","18 November 2007"," This film had so much potential, but it missed in nearly every category.
","I've never walked out of a movie before, but I did for this one; about an hour in. (I kept thinking it would get better... but it didn't. It just kept getting worse.) Anyway, here's why you shouldn't waste your money: The animation was the only thing this movie had going for it. Yes, the animation is stunning. However, just because you can animate gore to look like the real thing doesn't mean that you should. I don't like horror/slasher movies, and I had to cover my eyes for about a third of the movie that I stayed for. I wasn't expecting an animated film to be unwatchable, that's for sure. Another thing; I wouldn't consider this move terribly appropriate for children; especially those easily frightened. Definitely see this one first and bring the kids next round if you feel you're willing to do so.<br/><br/>Number 2: The script. Here's a hint: Animated movies should never resemble grungy cheap late night specials. The dialogue was stiff, cheesy in places and overly vague in others; even the good vocalics of the actors couldn't rescue it, and there were way too many of those moments where you just feel embarrassed for the actors-- not because you're supposed to, but because you wonder what having participated in this film will do to their career for the next couple years. Even having studied the story in depth; there were quite a few moments where I felt if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have any idea what was going on.<br/><br/>Number 3: The monsters.<br/><br/>What the heck? Grendel's initial attack wasn't even so much scary as obnoxious and over-the-top gory; he was more like a fifteen-foot tall Gollum than a true monster. This was the only part of the story done with a touch of subtlety, the filmmakers did succeed in allowing you to feel sorry for Grendel. Then there's Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie. I'm sorry, Angelina... I just keep imagining her sitting next to Brad Pitt at the premier with something bigger to be embarrassed about than the split in her leather pants. I'm sure the first time the audience sees her on-screen will appeal to some moviegoers but it just added to my uneasiness with the movie. Not only that but the inexplicable accent and linguistics she shares with her son. The audience can only pick up a word here and there.<br/><br/>Number 4: The rest of the cast. Even a good actor can't rescue a bad script or a weak storyline.<br/><br/>And I'm sure there's more I missed, but right about the time Angelina Jolie comes out of the water for the first time, and the guy five seats down says, ""oh YEAH!"" I'd decided I'd had enough. Time to go.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we stayed too long to get a refund, but at least we got re-admittance tickets for another movie at another time. Do yourself a favor and wait til next week, then go see something good.<br/><br/>I give it a two because it is a beautifully animated film. But that's the only thing about it I liked."
"efrain911","5","9","21","14 November 2007"," ""Beowulf"" is a visually stunning movie-going experience, but a so-so movie.
","""Beowulf"" may wow audiences with its bombastic re-telling of an Anglo-Saxon epic, but it's too preoccupied with visual indulgence, sweeping camera movements and flat characters usually reserved for elaborate video game prologues. Oh and it's in 3D.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is a pretty straight-forward story: The buff and boastful warrior Beowulf (""played"" by Ray Winstone of ""The Departed"") must fight and defeat the demon-monster, Grendel (Crispin Glover), who is terrorizing King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) realm. Beowulf later must face the monster's mother (Angelina Jolie) who is an even more terrifying and powerful monster (and Lara Croft look-alike).<br/><br/>Competing for your attention are big battles involving heroic and sometimes naked warriors, oozing monsters and fire-breathing dragons, not to mention the over-usage of a semi-nude, digitally-enhanced, gold-covered female demon with a square-ish face reminiscent of bee-stung-lipped Jon Voight, all offering feasts for the eyes and not too much for the brain.<br/><br/>Well, that's not completely true; the movie does have a weighty message regarding humanity's pride, lust, and greed, and the consequences that follow when indulging in temporal pleasure for temporal glory. A power-wielding, gold-dripping and naked Barbie doll version of Angelina Jolie sums up the temptation toward these deadly sins when she offers Beowulf everything he's ever wanted.<br/><br/>Amidst all of the dragon-slaying and jock Nordic rabble-rousing, the blood-curdling cry of 'the sins of the father' rings loud throughout Beowulf's kingdom years later, calling him to face up to his past sins (see Numbers 23:32). I think director, Robert Zemeckis, along with co-writers, Roger Avary (""Pulp Fiction"") and Neil Gaiman (""Stardust), try to convey a simple ""pride goes before the fall"" message, but their message is lost in all the visual lasciviousness.<br/><br/>Speaking of pride, ""Beowulf"" isn't a likable character come to think of it. He's a haughty fool, strutting around exaggerating his mighty feats of monster-slaying and frequently declaring ""I am Beowulf!"" at the top of his lungs. I wonder if he's ever met King Leonidas of Sparta? For the young male target audience, ""Beowulf"" pushes the limits of a PG-13 movie, getting away with much dismemberment, disembowelment and semi-nudity. Zemeckis' clever misdirection emphasizes gore, butts, and boobs under the veil of the movie's unrealistic blend of animation and weird, live-action, motion-capture technology, also used in Zemeckis' previous film, ""The Polar Express"" -- another movie with interesting visuals, dead-looking 'actors', and a somewhat boring story.<br/><br/>Not that ""Beowulf"" is totally boring. While I could've done without Beowulf's need to fight in the nude against Grendel, the ""RealD"" experience allows for in-your-face effects like pointy swords, monster tails, guts and slobber, and yes, even Beowulf's butt. However, ""Beowulf"" is very self-conscious of its 3D world, spending a lot of time floating through prickly forests and damp caves, portraying illusions of depth while reminding us of how fake everything really is.<br/><br/>I wonder how interesting the visuals would be if it weren't on a big screen and in 3D. If you've ever seen ""Spy-Kids 3-D: Game Over"" or have experienced the 3D shows at Universal Studios, you'll know what I mean. The effect wears off after a while, and you just want something to blow up or get killed so you can stay awake.<br/><br/>The movie was a visually stimulating experience, but I couldn't help but think of ""Shrek 4-D"" and how it was almost better because it was shorter. ""Beowulf"" may draw comparisons to films like ""300"" and ""The 13th Warrior"", but only as a reminder that these movies do a better job of wowing us with the use of real people and stronger stories."

The makers of this film bank on the fact that most people who see it will have no idea of the true story of Beowulf and will never take the time to see how much of a botch this movie is. Call it something else and change a few names of characters and you could have claimed it was a brand new idea. If you go to this movie, go knowing that it has little to no reference to the actual poems, and after seeing it take the time to read the story as it was written.<br/><br/>One final comment, to a person who was heard saying, ""What a wonderful and original story!"" Beowulf was written 100s of years ago. If writers want credit for writing a story, they could at least title it themselves and sell it based on their writing, not based on the fame of the name ""Beowulf""."

","Sub Jolie and Hopkins: from the story book and narrativ content perception even ""the attack of the killer tomatoes"" is a master piece.

Why don't they just show his wang already? I don't think it is a spoiler that Beowulf appears naked in this film about 90% of the time. And if that prevents you from seeing it I've done my job. There is essentially no reason for this film to exist. All it does is crams a ridiculous amount of clich√©'s into a story that was before clich√©. And, oh yeah, Beowulf says ""I am Beowulf"" like 6 times. I guess in case you forgot the name of the guy who is the lead in the oldest English story ever told. This film is a waste of time.

The story is simple and yet engrossing.<br/><br/>The director, Robert Zemeckis move on from Polar Express to this animation Beowulf. While watching the trailers, I was confused about what I was seeing. It seemed realistic but after some scenes, I realised it was just animation. Beowulf used the motion of the real actors are captured on computer and is then put in the computer animation to make a photo-realistic movie. It is just amazing. The animation seems better than Polar express.<br/><br/>It is co-written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary. It is smart, cool and amazing. It could be all you are asking for.

It's like the awful POLAR EXPRESS all over again, with more of the same creepily realistic 3D Animated characters trying to sub in for real actors. With this movie, they get dangerously close to convincing (in some shots), but there's still something not right. The characters are beautifully animated and detailed, but lacking the life that real human actors would have... instead looking like a bunch of reanimated corpses interacting with each other. The effect is interesting in that it's a momentarily unique visual style (as SIN CITY and 300 were) but unsettling and overall quite useless and underwhelming when the big action sequences look just as cartoonish and fake as anything from CGI fest films made over a decade ago.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty awful too, with a decent though padded and drawn out first half that follows the book fairly well. About midway through, the film drastically changes direction and adds a whole 'nother act which is boringly paced and has a few plot ""twists"" that anyone should see long before they are revealed. Actually, the whole second half of the movie is a virtual remake of Scorsese's LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ with Beowulf instead coming to a crossroad decision involving a lusty maiden.<br/><br/>...which brings me to Angelina Jolie. What is so damn irresistible about her? She returns as basically the same gratingly abrasive character she played in Alexander, same awful vampire accent and everything. Hey scenes are awfully steamy and erotic for a PG-13 rated film, not that I have anything against it, but I wouldn't be too thrilled about my kids seeing it. The gore is also quite needlessly grotesque. As much as I like seeing people getting rended and disemboweled, this film crosses the line especially with Grendel's appearance and actions. A whiny rotting zombie/ogre exposed eardrum that throbs is not something I'm particularly excited about seeing.<br/><br/>Also, why would a dragon have such a puny heart?

Promoted with a beautiful series of posters and a couple of mystifying previews, I wondered whether it would be a successful production.<br/><br/>Successful is a matter now of perspective and interpretation. If the film brings in the dollars, it will be clearly referred as a hit. On the other hand, purists and other more discerning individuals may have a bit of a problem with some of what's going on here.<br/><br/>In this version, there are some points to admire, including a rather sharp technical 3-D version that highlights some of the production values. There are also a couple of amusing moments, in addition to many rather puzzling changes to the original text. In particular the aversion of the main characters to anything resembling clothes. There are moments when the audience might even wonder about the sexuality of the characters, and Hollywood managed to get a PG-13 rating for this movie.<br/><br/>Video game addicts might find some fun in the rather loose adaptation of the classic poem, which is now devoid of soul and engaging action. There are some amusing moments when we see a very thin plot involving a mythical hero and a few rather pesky monsters, and their bewitching mother.<br/><br/>Sadly, the action is few and far in between, with most of it happening because the audience gets to exercise their neck muscles avoid being picked or poked at with the many objects Zemeckis managed to ""place"" in front of the camera to showcase the 3-D effects. There is very little memorable in the film, with so much wasted acting talent. Winstone, Wright Penn, and Hopkins are among the casualties of a program that has improved somewhat since ""The Polar Express"" but still manages to show the characters as if they had way too much mead... It looks like stuff is way to powerful to ever lose that glazed look that was spooky in ""Express"" and is rather distracting in this movie.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is not a classic or a thriller or a very entertaining film. It's another pretty package that fails to deliver what in essence is a timeless tale of the eternal conflict between good and evil. Yet, I do understand that Angelina Jolie's looks is definitely a terrible thing to waste, and was Beowulf Greek? I thought this was a Nordic legend..."
"Robot_Kitty","4","3","5","23 June 2015"," As I die-hard fan of Beowulf..I am sad to say this is not the Beowulf film I had hoped it would be.
","No..just no. I am a die-hard fan of the epic Beowulf, and this movie could have been amazing - had they named it anything but Beowulf. <br/><br/>The positives:<br/><br/>The voice work is perfect and brings every character to life in such a way that the viewer will feel the emotions the characters feel.<br/><br/>The animation is extremely well done - at points I could not believe I was watching CGI characters..I loved how they shot the action scenes as they had the right degree of grittiness without being excessive. <br/><br/>The musical score is powerful - it accentuates the battles and grandiose character of the film.<br/><br/>Now for why I disliked the film so much:<br/><br/>I was a bit put off by their representation of Hrothgar, as they made him appear to be nothing more than a bumbling drunken oaf who could not keep his paws off of Wealtheow - this is not at all accurate. Further, I was dismayed at the proclamation that Grendel is ""Hrothgar's shame"" because he could have no children with Wealtheow - again this is not true, he had not one child, but TWO by Wealtheow - Hre√∞ric and Hro√∞mund. They completely glossed over the important characterization of Hrothgar as a good king, a generous king, and an honorable man; this greatly detracts from his character and the viewer's understanding of WHY his people loved him so much. They did not love him because he was a stereotypical grunting, lecherous, old fat guy, despite what is shown here. <br/><br/>I tolerated their interpretation of how Grendel looked. Though, he's not supposed to be some awkward half-cooked baby creature. He's the malformed seed of Cain. I disagree with the direction they took regarding Grendel's motives for killing the men in Heorot(which I felt could have been far more majestic, like it was in the poem). Grendel is not driven mad by the singing, he is driven mad by the fact that he was an outcast from their society - he had no culture to belong to so he sought to ruin the society and culture of Hrothgar's people. Grendel is a warning to those who are cast out of their hall. Now in the film, Grendel really has no motivation for killing the people in Heorot other than the fact that, ""he's a monster who dislikes noise so he kills the noisy people."" I further disagree with their portraying Beowulf as, essentially, a borderline liar. He ripped Grendel's arm off with raw power - that's why he's such an astonishing man who's wearing dazzling armor(which is significant because he earned all of that armor through martial prowess). This is why no other man could kill Grendel - no other man possessed the raw physical power of Beowulf. In this film, he ripped it off with a chain tied to a post, then claimed he ripped it off with his bare hands. We have no reason to doubt the narrator of the Beowulf poem, so I do not understand why the writer of the film decided to add this. It's completely unnecessary, and my only conclusion is that the writer must be pandering to some ludicrous modernistic mentality of, ""well, something that amazing could not REALLY happen, so he must be embellishing.""<br/><br/>The scene with Grendel's mother is offensive to anyone who's a fan of Beowulf. This scene obliterates the entire confrontation and significance behind it. Beowulf is not some lecherous imbecile who falls prey to the wiles of a monster begging him to procreate with her. Grendel's mother is not some sexy succubus who seduces men and kills them. Also, the entire persona of Beowulf is that he's MORE than just a man in every aspect. This scene is beyond ridiculous. It's insulting to the original source material and to anyone who's a fan of said source material. Beowulf then blatantly lies to Hrothgar's face about killing Grendel's mother, thus discrediting his character as being honorable and praiseworthy. Not to mention Wiglaf is killed, Beowulf's beloved companion, by Grendel's mother specifically because he is Beowulf's beloved companion. This does not happen in the movie. Instead, a bunch of nameless characters are slaughtered while Beowulf sleeps and then Beowulf decides to kill Grendel's mother because, well, she is Grendel's mother and still plaguing Heorot. <br/><br/>Then, just to punch everyone who loves Beowulf right between the eyes, the writer creates a scenario in which the dragon Beowulf faces at the end of the tale...is...the..spawn of..Grendel's mother. Why? I cannot fathom WHY the writer believed this was a good idea. The reason Beowulf goes to fight the dragon is not because he's trying to right some wrong he committed (because men are just lecherous individuals unable to control themselves from sexing a demon), it's because he cannot give up his desire for glory. It is a cycle that will end up leaving his people without a ruler just when they need a ruler most. It is a message against seeking personal glory at the expense of your people.<br/><br/>I am greatly disappointed in one of my favorite authors - Neil Gaiman, for perverting Beowulf. I cannot, and will not, recommend this film to anyone who has read and enjoyed Beowulf. That being said, I would recommend to someone who has never come in to contact with the source material, and does not mind watching a retelling of the tale(with the precaution that it is not really an accurate retelling)."

I just was constantly waiting for something amazing to happen but for me there was nothing spectacular about it.but the graphics behind it were great and amazingly put together, but besides that this film just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>I think if there was a better storyline it would have been great but it just lacked that spark to make me like the film.

"black_wolf_1970","2","3","5","12 April 2008"," What this movie is is not a telling of Beowulf!!!!!!!
","This movie seemed to rely on the hope that those going to see it were brain dead slugs who never picked up a book before in their lives. First it seemed like they were trying to make a poor remake of Excalibur. After that it just gets worse and worse. Where I would have given some leeway to improvisation to the story to make the film, this movie or as was mentioned by some of my friend as a very expensive and confusing cartoon, was from the first attack on the hall onward so far removed from the original that I almost felt like vomiting. If this is passing for adaptations of classics stories then please they need to stop now. Between the Dragon being his son (the golden child) who he has to kill and knows how to kill because of the story told to him by the king and so on I felt like I was watching a crumpled together bunch of movies that caused me to get lost because I kept getting lost as to what I was watching because it kept jumping to the other movies using almost word for word and scene for scene. People should read the book and burn this movie."
"xamsx","6","3","5","28 November 2007"," Modernisation of a Timeless Fable
","are there any fans of the original tale that were as disappointed as i was by the changes to the story? i was less than impressed with changing the portrayal of Grendel's mother to some sort of mystical seductress; for the sake of sexual overtones the movie's plot was changed where it didn't need to be. however i admit that in my opinion this led to an interesting and well performed portrayal of Beowulf's character in the first two thirds of the film, showing predominantly his arrogance leading to a lust and weakness for power. equally in the third act Beowulf's remorse and willingness to admit his failings as a man are further well acted by Winstone, who i must admit surprised in his diverse approach to the character. i felt that the scene where he is almost begging the invader to take his life was particularly powerful, showing an almost desperate desire to be rid of a life that he is now ashamed of, that can still be seen as arrogance and great leadership by his followers.<br/><br/>however the change of Grendel's mother also led to one of my biggest ills with this picture, with her offspring now being the cause of men of power laying with her. whilst this did lead to an interesting take on the character of Grendel it was something again that i felt wasn't needed. the original fable told Grendel and his mother as true monsters and whilst the reason for Grendel's killings did interest me, the original telling where he has no explained reason, makes him more of a monster. i didn't think that Grendel needed to be given human aspects to his character to make the audience sympathise with him, we only needed to know that there was a bond between him and his mother to explain her revenge killings.<br/><br/>this could all have been excused though, but for the inclusion of the dragon that kills Beowulf being the son of himself and Grendel's mother. this element was only written in because of the portrayal of Grendel's mother and to tie all the stories together full circle; i see no reason why they couldn't have kept the story the same as to the book and just show it as Beowulf's last great adventure.<br/><br/>there were other more minor changes to the story that i didn't agree with (such as the over elaborate way Grendel's arm was taken off rather than just displaying the brute strength of Beowulf ripping it off) but i didn't think they detracted from the story too much.<br/><br/>overall i felt the film itself was solid, there were some entertaining performances from Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovitch and Ray Winstone plesantly surprised me in a more diverse role than i've seen him play for some years. visually it was impressive, with varied interesting camera techniques implemented which made use of the limitless boundaries of using CGI and the realism of the human characters was quite astounding. the script i found was suspect in places (""how about a quick gobble?"") but i did expect there to be some instances of this due to making it appeal to a wide audience.<br/><br/>for those that had never heard of the tale before or only knew a limited amount about it, this would prove to be an epic adventure about a complicated man caught between the notions of honour and power. however for fans of the original fable, it doesn't live up to such a timeless story."
"Cube_TX","1","9","23","21 November 2007"," This is the future of cinema?
","I didn't make it past the first scene. Yes, many people will say that means I can't comment on the movie, but here's a sad fact -- I have NEVER walked out of a movie in my entire life until now. The animation is flat out annoying. If I wanted to see Shrek I'd buy the DVD. If this is the future of cinema then Hollywood will be bankrupt in a few years. Who actually wants to see movies that look like this? It looked stupid, the same way Final Fantasy and Polar Express looked completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Grendel looked like a giant booger. It was the worst depiction of Grendel I'd ever seen. The thing looked like a CGI Leatherface, only more mentally challenged.<br/><br/>I'm sure the fanboys will love this film, the theater was full of them. I'm sure they were all dying to see Angelina Jolie in some kind of CGI erotic scene.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but this movie was stupid. I've sat through some HORRIBLE films in my life -- I even made it through that pathetic Dragon Wars flick, but this was just too much. Save your money and go rent Shrek 3."
"whirling-darkness","10","4","8","26 June 2009"," Amazing movie!
","First of all, this movie is amazing. Period! Unlike some of the people who have commented, I do CG/3d graphics myself; and let me tell you, this movie is a masterpiece! The amount of work that must have gone into Beowulf absolutely shames even great CG movies like Shrek.<br/><br/>I remember reading Beowulf as a kid, being fascinated by dragons and legends. The legend, the original Beowulf, is dry reading for all but the most devoted. Yes, it has action and intrigue, but you'll need patience and an ability to digest old style prose to appreciate it.<br/><br/>This movie distills Beowulf into an accessible and modern adaptation which is beyond compare.<br/><br/>Some people think the CG aspect works against the movie. I beg to differ! It enhances it completely. Things that would be impossible or awkward to do with live actors is seamlessly done with CG. The action sequences are incredible and unlike any other movie. Even Lord of the Rings, a great master piece with amazing fight scenes, doesn't have anything even close to the final battle in Beowulf.<br/><br/>I saw the regular ""2d"" version, and it was great. I cannot comment on the one enhanced for blue/red 3d glasses, as they usually give me a headache to wear.<br/><br/>Criticizing this movie for poor CG is a show of incredible ignorance. I applaud the effort by the team behind this movie. It's a monumental achievement! If only I could be so lucky as to work with talented people like the ones who crafted this movie. I noticed, in many scenes, the utter attention to detail that went into making them. Things you may ordinarily not think about, but which stand out to those who deal with CG on a regular basis.<br/><br/>It's true that the people are not 100% real. It IS a CG movie. People do have a slightly waxy look to them, but it actually enhanced the movie for me. After a few minutes, it really worked to help suspend disbelief, because the whole world is complete. Everything looks like it belongs. No green screens here. No wires to remove. No compositing CG into ""live"" footage. No, it's all done seamlessly and it works on so many levels.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple enough, but also engaging. I can imagine the only people turned off by it must be film critics who are too stuffy to enjoy the good things in life.<br/><br/>Yes, an action filled fantasy adventure is not for everyone. But neither is ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Yet, you don't see people who are not a fan of that genre try and tear it down. The fantasy movie genre has too many real life trolls, unfortunately.<br/><br/>For everyone who was ever a kid, and anyone who doesn't mind extremely well done CG, watch Beowulf, you will thoroughly enjoy it!"
"dukehern","1","4","8","10 March 2008"," Can I have my hour and a half back?
","For those of you who was expecting a film based closely upon the story of Beowulf don't watch this it is down right insulting and I want my $3.75 back for the rental fee. It is in no real way based upon a classic piece of literature. I am sure that I am being fairly judgmental but I wouldn't suggest this movie to any one.<br/><br/>The CGI was wonderful but even that wasn't enough to make this movie enjoyable. <br/><br/>The story was completely changed and turned into something that in no way represented the original piece of work. This movie is in no way a reflection of the actors or their individual talents I fully lay this on the writers shoulders as they used their ""creative licensing"" to completely rewrite this story."
"andra_marin","2","4","8","13 December 2007"," Waste of Time
","I went to the cinema expecting to see a really good story and ready to accept that the movie couldn't have followed the legend closely. All I can say is: ""I was so WRONG!"". The movie was awful. On the first hand, the fighting scene with Beowulf and Grendel, was quite lame (I understand the concept of "" fighting with his bare hands"", but not the one of ""full monty"", certainly not in this movie) The only good thing was that it was computer generated, but there was a moment when I thought it was The Sims PC Game. I can't really understand why the movie has such high rating on IMDb, as I consider watching it was a total waste of time (Thank God I get cinema tickets discount for being a student)."
"james-deacon","1","4","8","13 December 2007"," Why waste so many great effects?
","I was excited at the thought of a film that was not limited, in anyway, by stunts and fight scenes. However while enduring the ""action packed"" film, it was apparent that the realistic effects had become so realistic that they had incorporated the real life limitations. Accept for a few moments of excitement the film lacked the over the top and adrenalin filled action that being completely computer animated would have allowed. The story itself is a great legend..however with the huge amount of changes to the tale it is barley recognisable. This is a film you should see if you want to check out the amazing similarities between the actors and their animated characters, however if you want a good film, with action and a strong story.....take a trip to blockbuster and rent the original Beowulf! a much better film."
"Markavian","4","4","8","23 November 2007"," Wooden, poorly executed, and WTF?
","I didn't even know it was going to be animated. Saw right through. The cheeks don't move. The cheeks - don't - move. They've got a bit of work to do with the flow, the characters look great in stills, the animation and action works, but it feels like a story told through game quality graphics, rather then movie quality composition.<br/><br/>The vocal lines were misplaced, felt badly timed, unsettling. As for the story, its good, and it resolves itself well, but some moments of the film, I was like WTF. Some of the art direction, language, animations... it just makes no sense. Fantasy nudity. Dragons. Fire! Cool castles. Bad film."
"PWNYCNY","1","6","14","30 November 2007"," Be gone, oh rotten movie! Hollowman and Alien vs. Predator! - you have company.
","Remember when your English teacher in high school or college told the class that one of their assignments was to read Beowulf? Not exactly the most popular work of literature. Really, how many people out there actually had, or have, any interest in reading Beowulf? Be honest. It would not be unreasonable to say that Beowulf is not on the list of the world's most popular literary works. Yet Hollywood, in its infinite quest for profit, decided that this is the kind of story that can be transposed onto the big screen and that there is an audience for this kind of story, with its heroes and villains and monsters and ... well you get the point. So Hollywood concocted this movie, part science fiction, part science fantasy, part epic and COMPLETE JUNK. Welcome to the world of special effects. After watching this movie, one can reasonably ask: Why have actors? Why not just special effects and who cares about the story? If the story is idiotic ... who cares? Just throw in some special effects. If the dialog is laughable? Who cares? That can be cured with special effects. If the plot is ridiculous, again, who cares? Special effects can do the trick. There are scenes in this movie that provoke outright laughter. If this movie accurately portrays the level of civilization in Europe circa 6th century A.D., then it is a miracle that people actually survived. If you believe this movie, then the people, particularly the men, were actually uglier than the monsters, except, of course, for Beowulf who, of course, is an Adonis while all the other guys are a bunch of overweight gin-guzzling jerks or skinny sniveling dorks who are too stupid to do anything except let themselves be kicked around or sacrificed for the hero, who, of course, has sex with beautiful women. This raises another point: In the 6th century why are the men so ugly while the women are so beautiful? It's like their two different species, with the men being like links between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal Man (except of course for Beowulf who is perfection personified - duh!) and the women being more like a bunch of giggling Aphrodites than poverty-stricken 6th century females just trying to survive. (I wonder what kind of odors women emitted in the 6th century? After all, bathing was not one of their priorities.) What about the female of females in the movie, the super-Monster, who is also a mother, yes, A MOTHER, played, surprise, surprise, by Angelina Jolie! Some super-monster! There are mothers and there are MOTHERS and Ms. Jolie plays A MOTHER!!! If Ms. Jolie's mother character is supposed to be a monster, than bring her on because any monster that looks like the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie is the kind of monster that one should have at home, or at work, or wherever. One other point: There are parts of this movie where certain characters speak a language that be best described as gibberish. It would have been helpful if those parts of the movie had included subtitles. Then again, maybe the entire script should have been in gibberish. As a matter of fact, this movie would have been far more interesting if the entire script had been written in Old English - without subtitles. Why have Beowulf speaking fluent English? Why have Beowulf speaking at all? What it comes down to is this: this movie is pretentious junk that tries to be part Hamlet, part Troy, and even part Alexander (the latter two not the greatest movies but light years better than this waste of celluloid) but actually is a hyped-up pseudo-cartoon version of a medieval story that probably no person has read in its entirety in maybe a thousand years but which someone in Hollywood believed could be transformed into something that today's contemporary audience would buy, meaning (must it be said? Yes!) - SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!! - and in 3D!!!! Hollywood made 3D movies in the 1950s - for kids and back then the movies cost a quarter and nobody made any big deal about it. Now 3D is supposed to be something special. Yeah, right. Leave Beowulf in the the book where he belongs so that the lone person who decides to actually read the book can use their imagination to visualize the story instead of having to rely on Hollywood's version - which is crass, banal and guided not by the quest for artistic excellence but by the quest for the almighty buck.<br/><br/>This movie is so bad that it makes Phantom of the Opera (movie version) seem like a 10-star classic. You can take special effects just so far, but special effects cannot replace a story, no way. This movie is about phantasmagorical events revolving around themes such as heroism, selflessness and other high personal virtues. Okay, but the movie approaches these themes by catering to the lowest common denominator of intelligence to dramatize these points. If Beowulf is the best example of English literature from the Middle Ages, then the middle ages were the dark ages indeed.<br/><br/>Now here's an idea: Why not take Godzilla, King Kong, Rodan, Mothra, the Giant Mantis, the Predator (with the infra-red vision and the a-bomb strapped to its arm)and the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and put them on an island with Beowulf and see what happens? All special effects. NO STORY NECESSARY.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins's presence in this movie is a travesty, a joke. It's not his fault. It's a gig and a paycheck, and he didn't create the role, he just acts it. But to have this fine actor going about half-naked would have been like Hamlet going about with his pants down while engaged in a soliloquy. Please, be gone, oh rotten movie, go to DVD-land with all the other forgettable rejects."
"Bart_Mancuso","1","5","11","14 March 2008"," This movie is nothing but bare asses
","Robert Zemeckis. When was the last time he made a masterpiece of film-making? Ah yes, it was 14 years ago when he directed Forrest Gump. That was his one accomplishment in life. Unfortunately, it was also his only accomplishment as a director that is still revered to this day. Beowulf however is a cinematic disASSter. Yes, Beowulf is a CGI character and he gets naked to fight a giant screaming monster. Doesn't that seem a little gay to you? Then I guess to compensate for all the bare asses in the film, Zemeckis tries to make it up to us by having CGI women's boobs flop around. As a heterosexual man though I have to say that I feel more shame than pride when seeing a CGI woman's boobs. This movie is certainly not appropriate for audiences under 13, or even under 86. It's more appropriate for those who have boob and ass fetishes. Beowulf features lots of people dying quite horribly and in many gruesome manners. The sound may have been louder than it was supposed to be, but the screaming was so obnoxious and loud it made me want to walk out of the movie, and that's exactly what I did! It may have action but the majority of it takes place in a hall with a bunch of drunken and obnoxious patrons, it feels claustrophobic to me. They made a noble attempt to have the CGI look real, but it looks horrible, looks fake and I can't help but think about freaking Shrek. The movie is not character or story-driven. Hell, it's not driven at all. There is nothing to this movie. If you really have to know an account of the story of Beowulf, then go do yourself a grand favor and read the freaking book instead please. I can guarandamntee you 100% less bare asses and boobs in the book."
"love_zelda0","1","5","11","27 November 2007"," Did they read the book?!
","About the only thing they got right in this movie are the names. I strongly question whether or not they read the book... <br/><br/>The First Battle: I've asked a couple people who have read the book and Grendel is commonly described as a wolf-like creature. In this he looks like a human who was in a nuclear disaster. Also, Beowulf is supposed to rip is arm of with his own hands. What's with the chain and door ripping Grendel's arm off?? <br/><br/>The Second Battle: Wait... there was no second battle. Beowulf is seduced by Grendel's mother. I definitely missed that in the book. Beowulf was supposed to kill Grendel's mother, not screw her. <br/><br/>The Third Battle: Okay... so the third battle wasn't as bad as the other two. At least they got the dragon right. The only complaint I have with this is when he cuts his arm off to stab the Dragon's heart. I can understand elaborating on the book a little, the book doesn't have that much detail, but that was a too much. <br/><br/>The Ending: Grendel's mother is supposed to be dead, and Beowulf was supposed to request no monuments in his name, but they decide to build one for him anyway.<br/><br/>Overall: Did they read the book?! Beowulf was projected as a liar and a fake hero throughout the movie. The real Beowulf was supposed to be super-human and a noble man. Him fornicating with women other than his wife, screwing Grendel's mother, and lying to the kingdom about it does not project a super-human, noble man.<br/><br/>I'm sure if you don't know the real story, the movie was good, but to those who have read the book: DON'T GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!"

","This movie has lots of eye candy and heroic themes, but to say its the story of Beowulf is a little bit of a stretch. Every major event that happened in the original story is in the movie, but they did not happen for the same reasons, at the same location, and in some cases to the same people. However, one event that shaped the rest of the movie happened completely differently in the original story. I am of course talking about Beowulf's encounter with Grendel's mother. Instead of chopping and slashing like in the original story, we have a movie industry cuddle that sets up the not quite so original idea of guilty pleasure. Its a so so movie about Scandinavian warriors, but it's a terrible movie about Beowulf. The consolation is that I see that it would be difficult to make a full length movie following precisely the original story. One last thing that bothered me is the pronunciation of the word scop. The word should be pronounced like shope."

There's no discussion of how anyone is thinking. That's the movie's biggest departure from the poem; we know how people are feeling. We know who's willing to make deals with the devil.

","You should see this movie, but only if you have too many brain cells and you need to kill a few of them in the most excruciating, gruesome, torturous, and most of all, insulting way possible. They took a literary masterpiece and reduced it to celluloid vomit. Really awful CGI (I don't know what those atrocities at the ends of their arms were, but they occupied the same space that hands would on a human being); the graphic work looks like it was done by a bunch of pre-pubescent boys given excellent rendering software, and absolutely no training in its use. The audience was laughing at the absurdity of a really awful movie trying desperately to take itself seriously (think ""Anaconda""). Aside of a nice dragon rendition, and a nifty fight scene between Beowulf and Grendel, there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie, and those two bits were ten minutes out of two of the most painful hours I can remember suffering through in a theater. A root canal would be more enjoyable. Pathetically bad doesn't even begin to describe it. The storytelling was low grade Jerry Springer at best. A complete waste of a talented cast.

It also insults Christianity, more of hollywood's anti-Christian rhetoric. Really stupid stuff throughout: Early on Beowulf decides to strip completely naked to help him defeat Grendel. Really dumb. For five minutes Beowulf runs, jumps, and swings around, completely naked as he fights Grendel in The Hall. A hand, a chair arm, etc. is always strategically located to cover the 2% of his anatomy.

"tristanhartup","4","2","3","8 December 2018"," Why is it animated?
","Beowulf is like the biggest question mark to me, purely as watched the movie and looked back on it the one question that was constantly on my mind was simply ""Why is it animated?"" I can understand why the Polar Express is animated even though yes you could've just made it in live-action and not much would be different, I can understand Christmas Carol being animated, but I for the life of me cannot comprehend what was the thought process behind the decision to make Beowulf animated. There was no real reason to have the movie be animated and nothing about it screamed for it to be animated, the movie could've simply have been made in live-action and nothing would be different, aside from Ray Winstone as Beowulf but that could be fixed through casting, I've often joked about how the possible reason for the movie being animated was that Zemeckis was too damn lazy to afford actually sets, props, costumes, make-up and extras that he was just like, ""You know, let's just do it all in animation and have our few main stars play multiple roles and be done for the day, I mean, honestly who cares anymore?"" I just couldn't get invested with the story, characters and action because I was just too damn distracted, baffled and unnerved by the animation of everything. The animation is right there in the uncanny valley, having a lot of character designs meant to look almost exactly like the actors playing the characters, with the exception of turning Ray Winstone into a beefed up action hero and Crispin Glover into a monster, which returns to my main question ""Why is it animated?"" If you're going through the trouble of trying to make a lot of characters look just like their actors and have them perform mo-cap to portray said characters, why couldn't they have just made the movie in live-action instead of hassling with animation? So yeah, I didn't like the movie, the only thing I did like about it was Alan Silvestri's score, but even then it didn't really do much to enhance my viewership of the movie, it made me listen to the music on its own and imagine a movie I would've liked to see along with music."
"thinker1691","9","2","3","29 January 2013"," "" Nordic Sages which told of Men of Iron and Fire Breathing Dragons ""
","From the far off lands of Ice and snow comes the fiery tale of a dark land, courageous men, sultry beautiful women and fierce monsters which assailed their cold barren world. This early fable arises in the 6th century A.D. and related a historical Saga of a time when a mythical monster called Grendal, terrorized the Land of The Vikings. Each night when the Danes would decide to celebrate with drinking, dancing, loud songs and boisterous merriment, a gigantic lake dwelling creature named Grendal would invade their Mead-Hall and began killing the men inside. The murderous spree would nightly reoccur until all the men were dead. A ghastly event which continued until the exasperated King finally offered his kingdom to any man who would kill the monster. This movie is called "" Beowulf "" and is based on that particular Nordic Saga. Ray Winstone plays Beowulf and is convincingly believable as the Icelandic hero. The film is a wondrous, action-pack movie and sure to entertain all who see it.. For those seeking excitement in a fantastic, dramatic and dark film, you've found it. It's got all the elements of a black legendary story complete with a fire-breathing dragon. This and a fine cast which includes Sir Anthony Hopkins. You can do no better. ****"
"Annawilliams247","2","2","3","20 August 2010"," Unenjoyable, don't waste your time
","I've read the poem Beowulf and found it interesting and riveting, but this film adaption does not do it justice. They changed the story ( a lot of it) to make it more 'entertaining', a popcorn film even no doubt but it really didn't need a change as it was a great story to begin with.Amongst many things they changed ,these bits of the story are which i found disappointing. * In the story Beowulf tears Grendels arm off but in the film Grendels arm gets trapped in a door by Beowulf and falls off. * In the story Beowulf kills Grendels mother when she tries to avenge her son but in the film he sleeps with her?! Who knew Beowulf was such a pimp! Seriously what was all that about?! * Grendels mother is supposed to be a disgusting creature (almost troll like) but in the film Grendels mother is Angelina Jolie covered in gold body paint, with a tail (ooh scary!) and strange feet which are high heeled shaped. So much for hideous! * In the story the dragon is guarding cursed treasure but in the film the dragon is Beowulfs son (huh!?) who he had with Grendels mother. * In the story Beowulf dies and his nation mourns for him but in the film we see a 2 minute scene of his funeral and afterwards his friend Wiglaf sees Grendels mother rise from the sea about to seduce him (She should be dead ! ) hinting at a possible sequel.<br/><br/>With that said the score is pretty good and (i saw it in 2d) the visual effects look nice but eventually it seems very similar to a medieval themed video game.<br/><br/>Also (in the UK) the film is rated 12A but i don't think it is suitable for children. It seems like the director was more intent on filming the village women's racks and corsets than any of Beowulfs actions. For example there is one scene when a male warrior is perving at a woman villager who is preparing food ( i cant remember the action really the camera didn't focus much on her actions more like on her chest!) and her corset is nearly bursting and we see them kinda flirting and scenes like this come up in the film quite often. Also the villagers gossip about scandals and similar things which are just useless. These scenes add nothing to the film. Whats the point in them? Why where they even put there? <br/><br/>Another really big problem i found with the film is the casting , well mainly for Beowulf.He looks all noble and strong like a warrior and when he opens his mouth he's cockney! It sounds totally out of place. 'Aww rightt mate i'm ere to slay your dragon son so gis us the tools an i'll be done wit him'. I don't think Ray Winstone should have voiced Beowulf. But it made me laugh. Overall I wouldn't bother watching this film."
"Rectangular_businessman","7","2","3","14 June 2010"," Could have been great...
","The animation is interesting, much like A Scanner Darkly. Beowulf is a character cursed by pride, vanity, and lust, among other things. While you may find yourself cheering for him in battle, it is difficult to sympathize with him. And, while it may be a moot point when it comes to the conflict, one wonders where these beasts come from (especially Grendel's mother) and what drives them. In sum, the forces of good are not that good and the forces of evil largely remain unknown. What reaction does this produce for the viewer? Mostly, boredom. The action scenes that are supposed to be intense lose intensity in the midst of so much silliness. When Beowulf fights Grendel, all you will be able to think is, ""Why does he have to fight naked?"" and, ""Is he really letting his naked body rub up against that disgusting thing?"" I could go on...<br/><br/>Still, it's much better than the horrible films ""Beowulf"" with Christopher Lambert and ""Beowulf & Grendel""."
"Quebec_Dragon","8","2","3","28 December 2009"," Bloody good Beowulf
","I admit that when I first saw the preview for this years ago I thought it was made with real actors although it seemed not quite right. So I saw it in 3d when it was in theaters and I saw it recently on my TV. The graphics still hold up extremely well today (2009) with some of the most life-like computer characters I've seen not only in terms of likeness but in terms of acting. It should be since advanced motion capture technology was used extensively with the real actors including facial expressions. The process is interesting because it allowed a wonderful character actor (Ray Winstone) to play a buff hero like Beowulf although he's middle-aged, not particularly in shape and basically looking nothing like the hero. It allowed a fine eccentric actor like Crispin Glover to play the very physical role of Grendel, the monster, and actually give it a tormented pitiable yet menacing presence. As for the other more famous actors, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright-Penn and John Malkovitch, they are quite recognizable, almost in an eerie way, yet not quite the same. The highlight for me was Robin Wright-Penn in the role of the queen. Her sad facial expressions shone through despite the virtual avatar.<br/><br/>The story is basically the Beowulf legend retold with a few creative liberties taken here and there. It's the foundation for many other stories and the prototypical warrior hero. At first glance, it seems rather simple but it's told really well and it has a mythic otherworldly quality to it. Beowulf as a character has a nice character arc and shows personality although he's not the most likable fellow, more of a macho boastful jerk actually. The action scenes are thrilling and filmed with angles and camera movements that are often surprising and original: sometimes not possible in real life. I especially enjoyed a long sequence where Beowulf fights naked yet his ""member"" is artfully hidden throughout. On occasion, certain scenes show that they were trying to impress with the 3d effects and it makes things look artificial on TV (ex: guard poking spear at Beowulf's head). At their best which is most of the time, the computer graphics are almost totally photo-realistic. At their worst, especially for secondary characters, they make us think of the human characters from Shrek. The monster designs and animations are wonderful and impressive with particular credit going for Grendel. So all in all, I think that although Beowulf might not have the most emotionally involving story or the most relatable characters, it's still quite entertaining and exciting today and you should have a very good time watching it. It has lots of dismemberments and bloody killings so people allergic to that should be warned.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"
"neil-476","8","2","3","5 January 2009"," Good but weird
","It is a very strange sensation to watch a film where the cast comprises largely imitations of the people in the cast: watching Anthony Hopkins occupy a replica of himself is profoundly weird. The experience then becomes even weirder when the character inhabited by the larger than life persona of Ray Winstone isn't Winstone! (despite his avowed intention of doing away with monstahs!) One also has to overcome the expectation that a cartoon film (if one can refer to a wholly CGI film as such) is aimed predominantly at the younger viewer: Beowulf contains some quite savage violence, not to mention some earthy humour, and is definitely not for youngsters.<br/><br/>It is a worthwhile effort, though. Taking some liberties with the ancient epic poem, it tells an exciting story, and always looks good. The cast are all excellent (even if, as noted above, they are somewhat distracting), and it is worth singling out Crispin Glover for his stunning performance as Grendel - he makes a barbaric murdering monster something deserving of sympathy.<br/><br/>I can't comment on the 3D as I saw a flat copy, but I can imagine that it would have been very effective.<br/><br/>An interesting experiment, and one which was successful in artistic terms, even if perhaps not in commercial terms."
"unbrokenmetal","Null","2","3","21 March 2008"," Vikings attacked by computers rather than monsters
","I had extremely mixed feelings about this latest adaption of ""Beowulf"". Is an archaic, wild'n'rough Viking epic the ideal subject for a glossy computer animation movie? I don't think so. The totally artificial look of everything (some actors looked as stiff as puppets, especially Malkovich and R.W. Penn) understandably lead to comments such as ""it's a trailer for a video game, just too long"". To be fair, there was a lot of effort put into some departments. I liked the music by Silvestri, the macabre story elements (probably courtesy of Neil Gaiman), some impressive fights and monsters. Grendel was suffering so much you'd almost sympathize with the critter. He bites heads off to make that feeling go away ;-). Angelina Jolie was so well animated they must have taken a lot more time on her than other characters (I understand that perfectly, guys). Anthony Hopkins was excellent once again, and his role had the depth missing in most others who either hack, slash, run, burn or scream. For all the violence, the rating seems to mild, by the way."

"darrenbjones","6","1","1","12 September 2019"," Definitely worth a watch.
","There have been several Beowulf's brought to the screen, from lower budget Gerard Butler through to Antonio Banderas' hugely underrated 13th Warrior. This is a more straight forward adaptation of the original legend albeit with a very interesting twist by the always talented pen of Neil Gaiman (author of American Gods and Coraline) that is in keeping with the parent/child conflict of Greek Myth and the cyclical nature of Norse mythology.
Beowulf is tempted by the riches on offer from King Hrothgar whose kingdom is cursed by the monster Grendel. Beowulf rises to the challenge but lurking behind Grendel is the greater threat of his Mother.
Stylistically it's a PG13 Polar Express and other than gimmick factor (and that Ray Winstone isn't built to be a leading action hero anymore) it's hard to fathom why it's animated rather than love action but it's rendered well and I soon forgot I was watching an animation.
The voice talent is great, Ray Winston is a great bullish young hero and as the older, jaded Beowulf really excelled. The always talented Brendan Gleason is fantastic as right hand man Wiglaf and Angelina Jolie is a disturbingly sexy Grendel's Mother (this is part of the plot). Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright and Crispin Glover round our the main cast.
Ultimately it's a story of sin, corruption, power and glory which is at the heart of the original epic poem.
It's not a perfect film but it isn't a bad one and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

The fight with Grendel is very well choreograph as well as the dragon fight scene in the end. Beowulf took of all his armor and clothes to fight Grendel so that it would be fair that stand to say how arrogant he is. I also like the scene on the beach where Beowulf dared a mook raider to kill him. He doesn't believe a nobody could kill him. He knows that the Gods not gonna die by simple means."
"paulclaassen","7","1","1","23 May 2019"," Beautiful, gory, sensual.
","The film has a very unique look to it. At times the animation actually looks real. This is maybe due to the fact that this is not completely animated. Instead, they used real actors, similar to 'The Polar Express'. In fact, Robert Zemeckis did 'The Polar Express' and 'Beowulf' back to back.<br/><br/>The film is bloody and gory, yet also has very deep emotion. It is a great story, and a wonderful epic action adventure fantasy horror. The actors did a great job, and the film is visually stunning. The film was also very sensual, focusing on both the male and female physique. Beowulf has a body to be admired.<br/><br/>If you've purchased the Blu Ray or DVD, be sure to watch the special features. 'The Making of' is fascinating."
"TwomeyLord","7","1","1","23 August 2018"," Enjoyable enough
","I'll start with the good of this movie. Zemeckis certainly brings an interesting adaptation of the classic viking tale, with an all-star cast featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins, Bendon Gleeson, and Angelina Jolie. He gives us an interesting twist too, along with how Beowulf's life was supposedly meant to symbolize the life of Christ. Luckily, he succeeded at the basis of the 'interesting twist' part.<br/><br/>The way he did it though, the only thing I could get out of it is that 'Men are the true monsters'. And when I say 'Men', I don't mean humans in general ;(. The way it was, whoever had sex with Grendel's mother and gave her a son, she would, in return, give them glory and power. So that explained where Grendel came from. And the dragon of the deep.<br/><br/>But, like I said, this movie is sexist, and I think that that's very unfair to portray the vikings like that all the time(that means you, History Channel). The Vikings are, to me, the most interesting people in history. Their leaders didn't fight each other, they traveled all over the world, and no, they weren't as bloodthirsty as people are led to believe. They were raiders, yes, but they were also traders and farmers, highly skilled millititians, craftsmen, blacksmiths, navigators, and yes ladies, new discoveries have proved that there were female viking warriors.<br/><br/>Despite the sexism , the movie is still plenty enjoyable. 'Beowulf' isn't the best movie ever, but it certainly isn't a bad one either. It depends on what you see in it."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","8","1","1","2 January 2017"," Always a hero comes home
","While the Polar Express has become an Xmas classic in the past 12 years Zemeckis' follow-up has sort of taken a backseat (and his return to live action has been met with constant disappointment). It's a shame because Beowulf is a visually stunning film with a dark, brooding atmosphere. It may not be Xmas-y but it sure is winter-y and perfect viewing for this time of year.<br/><br/>Based on the ancient epic poem (among the very earliest ""English"" literature) the story sees famous hero Beowulf arrive in Denmark to defeat Grendel, a horrific monster who has been terrorizing the locals. Beowulf likes to exaggerate his life and some are suspicious of him but when he lures Grendel into a confrontation his reputation is validated and he quickly becomes the reigning monarch. Many decades later Grendel's mother reveals a shocking secret and threatens Beowulf's kingdom with total destruction.<br/><br/>This is not the family-friendly viewing of the Pole Ex. Beowulf is brutal, bloody, very gory, and sometimes hard to watch. Grendel is one of the most gruesome, ugliest monsters ever to appear in a movie but Crispin Glover's typically eccentric performance (after settling a years-long feud with Zemeckis over BTTF 2) is harrowing and sympathetic. He may be a merciless killer but it's very hard not to feel sorry for him. Themes of surrendering to wicked temptation, regret, and mortality continue to resonate to this day. In fact, I honestly cannot think of any other work of fiction that has had as much influence on literature, history, and even popular culture (other than the Bible) as the ancient poem by Anonymous.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score is, as usual, highly involving and emotional lending a huge weight to the cold, lonely feel of the movie. Ray Winstone is the perfect actor to bring a voice to the character mixing cockney charm, bravado, honor, and secret shame to what might otherwise be a hollow CGI creation.<br/><br/>Please do not write this movie off. It seems like it still struggling to find an audience despite being one of my favorite of Zemeckis' career."
"Wuchakk","7","1","1","9 March 2014"," Entertaining and thought-provoking, even moving
","""Beowulf"" is an animated 2007 film version of the epos featuring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn. Although it's a ""cartoon"" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture with brutal violence and openly sexual situations & dialogue.<br/><br/>The film has the same characters as the epic poem -- Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon -- and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's ""sea hag"" mother and the dragon; other than this the film deviates from the poem. Needless to say, don't watch if you're a Beowulf purist.<br/><br/>However, if you don't mind the animation or the re-imagining and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, you'll likely appreciate it. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching this version back-to-back with 2005's ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which is a live-action version with Gerard Butler and Sarah Polley, shot on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland.<br/><br/>The message of this animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend because it has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero, but this isn't true. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't a hero, what is? Okay, so he exaggerates his past exploits and has a weakness for babes, what else is new?<br/><br/>I should add here that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title (""What We Need Is A Hero"") and the two versions of ""A Hero Comes Home"" (the first is the shorter version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits).<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** The rest of this review explores the meanings behind the story and gives away important plot elements<br/><br/>I'll be honest with you, although I was entertained the first time I saw ""Beowulf"" I came away from it thinking ""Huh?"" This version makes King Hrothgar the father of Grendel, and Beowulf the father of the dragon, making it absurd in a what-were-they-thinking way, but also creative. <br/><br/>Viewing it a second time, I was intent on figuring it out and gleaning the moral(s) of the story. The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.<br/><br/>Other points include:<br/><br/><ul><li>The mistakes of your past will inevitably come back to haunt you. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Apart from redemption, the ""sins of the fathers"" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally!). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Deal with your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt &amp; shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Men are easily entranced by a beautiful babe, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A beautiful woman can turn a man into a loaf of bread. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.</li></ul><br/><br/>Some things to think about: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is he able to morph back-and-forth at will? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?<br/><br/>Some criticize that Beowulf is not a Christ-figure, which isn't accurate. Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only ""weeping martyrs,"" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer, who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in ""Beowulf"" was created via Beowulf and is later revealed as a hideous dragon.<br/><br/>All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even ultra-heroes like Beowulf, which -- again -- is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about ""weeping martyrs"" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement. Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.<br/><br/>One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, ""KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!"" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invulnerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending proves he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality, my friend. Who would have expected this in a ""cartoon""?"

"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","1","19 July 2009"," Creative but unfaithful
","Beowulf is a magical piece of literature. And it's a good idea to keep some of the Anglo-Saxon original text. The director tries all he can to make the setting and costumes and psyche of these people realistic for the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ when Denmark was still believing in the Nordic Gods, Odin first of all, and before the arrival of Christianity at the beginning, after its arrival at the end. Interesting too to change the tale slightly to make the two half into one logic, the second half being the sequence of the first. Interesting too to use the magic of these old days and hence have some supernatural beings and events. It is true Grendel, his mother and the dragon were supernatural alright. But instead of making explicit the references to the giants and pre-human species surviving in total exclusion, instead of making explicit the reference to the runes brought to human beings by Odin himself, the director chooses a sexual line, from beginning to end. Then the monster is the son of the local Danish king and the mother who does not have a name but is a gorgeous woman disguising some kind of witch, a sorceress who has little difficulty mesmerizing the local king with promises of power into providing her with a son who will eventually be the scourge of the country and will have to be killed. Hence Grendel is the ""son"" of the local king when Beowulf arrives in Denmark and the dragon will be the ""son"" of Beowulf himself. He will kill Grendel, then tame the mother by giving her a son, and finally kill that very son, the dragon. This addition kills something in the tale. Beowulf is the obvious Christianization of traditional Nordic tales and sagas in Anglo-Saxon territory in the seventh to ninth centuries. This is present in the film, but the sexual dimension of these monsters goes against this Christianization since it states that every generation will have to live under the menace of a monster produced by the fornication of the previous king with the supernatural woman, as if such pagan facts could survive in front of the Christian faith. This rewriting of the tale is thus for a modern audience, what's more for a young audience. This is quite clear in the electronic and computer game conception of the fights. And this young audience does not care for all these religious things, including Christianity, and they can very easily imagine Christ having dinner with a dragon and being served by some unicorn. Dropping that dimension of believing and even faith that the saga originally had transforms the story into some kind of post-modern fantasy for a world that does not believe in anything and where believing has been transformed into some kind of personal private matter whereas it was a public communion with the whole society through its common rites and fears and hopes. Then the end of the film is the promise of a third monster, whereas the end of the saga was a final stop to the existence of all monsters.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","I try to avoid coming down too hard on dumb action movies. They are what they are, and in general, they work fine at being dumb, loud, and entertaining. Not Beowulf. In all honesty, I went to the movies to see a rip off of 300, and it's exactly what I got, albeit with even less quality than ripping off 300 implies. Whether or not it diverged too much from the original Beowulf story, it's a horrible movie. The dialog would make George Lucas blush, the animation, while at times brilliantly done, makes all its characters look like wax dummies, and the story made me want to scream at the screen for being so dumb. In the grand tradition of idiotic epics like the book Beowulf (that's right, I said it. Just because it's old doesn't mean it isn't basically the medieval equivalent of Power Rangers), this movie made my brain cells cry out in pain. Aside from being a dumb actionfest (which really wouldn't be that bad), it felt the need to pretend that it had any sense of moral ambiguity and nuance. Rather than accept that it's a really bad movie and revel in it, it goes into self parody territory with the sheer volume of pseudo-meaningful BS. It's like a movie made by the 14 year old metalhead who thinks that he's the most brilliant human being alive for listening to Dream Theater.

I wasn't sure which actress was Robin Wright Penn until more than halfway through it. As my husband commented, it looks like this was made by the same people who did Shrek.

","After seeing this movie, I've decided that I'm not really a fan of motion capture animation for a primarily human cast. I didn't think much about it in ""The Polar Express"", as I assumed the primary reason for it was to attempt to emulate the illustrations of the book it was based on. I also didn't think about it much in movies like ""Monster House"" and ""Happy Feet"", as the characters were cartoons for all intents and purposes. In ""Beowulf"", however, I believe the use of motion capture animation caused us to lose some of the human expression that may have really helped this feature to rise to the next level. While it was fantastic in some scenes, and especially in some shots of the movie (there were extreme closeups that never could have been done with a live camera), other scenes fell short where they should not have. My new opinion of this new technology is that it should be used to enhance film-making, rather than create it's own genre. For instance, if we were to perfect this new technology, we could create and use those shots that could not be done with a live action camera in a primarily live action movie (most illustrative point is Gollum). Having said all that, I thought the story was very well put together and not at all disjointed, as so many movies lately have been. The voice work was almost all superb, and the animated surroundings of the characters were beautiful. It's really too bad that it's so difficult to connect with characters that just don't feel human enough."

The strong supporting cast of characters were all well voiced by a variety of celeb talent. The prominent wrestling scene with Grendel was ridiculous however, with far too many sight gags hiding Beowulfs CGI genitalia - given the mature content and extreme violence of much of the rest of the film this modesty seems somewhat pointless.<br/><br/>If ever this film is remade maybe Tony Soprano would be a good choice for the lead - badda-bing, badda-bong."
"sourlemone","2","4","9","1 December 2007"," Go see the other movie.
","You probably know a few things about Beowulf ¬ñ firstly, that it is based on an Anglo-Saxon epic and involves monster-slaying, mead-drinking and a hero who lusts for power; secondly, that the movie is 'performance capture' animated, and is available in 3-D; and finally, that it features a stiletto-heeled, lizard-tailed, mostly naked Angelina Jolie, looking better than she has in years. All correct.<br/><br/>There are a few things, however, that you SHOULD know. Above all, the movie is terrible. My two major gripes are the animation and the script.<br/><br/>The animation leaves the characters lifeless, occasionally cross-eyed (what happened to Robin Wright Penn?) and often out of proportion, destroying any compelling reason that there may have been to FEEL for the hero or the others; they are simply too far removed from any notion of humanity to engage you or suspend your disbelief. Pixar has shown us that animation need not remove a human element from cinema, even when dealing with monsters, bugs and superheroes - and films like 'A Scanner Darkly' have animated actors without destroying their energy or nuance. This is a poor effort. As far as the 'technique' goes, anyone that has seen 'Final Fantasy' or has played a video game like 'God of War' will hardly be impressed by the novelty, and there are plenty of proficient animation and gaming studios in the entertainment industry that have developed better fare.<br/><br/>The script is appalling, lacking in both depth and variety and no doubt contributing to the lifelessness of the characters. Most of the movie is delivered in a monotone of ye-olde inspired whispers and growls, and none of the characters appear to care about each other at all, judging by their dialogue. There is no subtext whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that Unferth (John Malkovich) has a private motivation, or is actually thinking about anything at all when he throws a menacing stare at the camera; there is nothing given to the audience beyond 'too many secrets' to suggest Wealthow's (Robin Wright Penn's) furrowed brow conceals either a troubled heart or a brain; and for all reviewers have harped on about the script being camp and/or kitsch and/or satirical, I could not think of a single moment to validate any of the three interpretations, save for Angelina Jolie's stilettos, which are clearly absurd (and gave my packed out theatre it's only laugh for the whole two hour runtime). It's all truly woeful, not to mention boring.<br/><br/>Look, I don't always go to the cinema and expect to see a masterpiece. I went to this movie because Angelina gets naked and I was promised plenty of blood, guts and excitement. I got nothing, apart from Angelina, and a little violence. On a parting note, the 3-D adds absolutely nothing to the experience; as far as I am concerned, it is a pitiful gimmick and will hopefully die quickly before too many film makers latch on to the idea.<br/><br/>I could not possibly recommend this movie to anyone, particularly if you enjoy movies or have played an action-adventure video-game in the last four years. Do yourself a favour, and see something else. Two stars ¬ñ one for Mrs. Jolie, and the other for a briefly convincing scene between Hopkins and Winstone. That's it."

","Grand and EPIC do not even begin to do justice to the masterpiece that is Beowulf!!! Magnificent! This movie has it ALL! It is a poignant touching cautionary tale that will lie on your soul. The script is perfectly adapted and keeps a fast pace. Beginning to end this experience is a THRILL ride of event and twists. The CGI is so amazingly real it is awe-inspiring. Most of the time you forget that it is even CG. If anything it was *more* real than live action, in that the monsters and humans were perfectly integrated and so you never notice any special effects. It provides a continuity the film would not have had in live action. I have seen many realistic CGI films but this is an entirely new level. The hardest part is eyes. Anthony Hopkins has a way of expressing with his eyes like few actors do. Certainly, I expected, that would be lost in the CG. It was not. The pores on the skin, the sweet, the facial and body hairs, the control overt lighting and shadows was spectacular. Even though much of the lighting was candles that flicker the lighting was believable and realistic. Nothing less than astonishing! I would forget it was CG until things like Grendel the monster with no skin would show up all bloody a dripping mucus and puss. Then I was thankful I never encountered such a foul being in real life. Did I mention, don't take the children. I even had the opportunity to see the 3D version. The realism of a man getting impaled by the chandelier and the blood flying right at your face in 3D makes it even more graphic. On the other hand, the realism of Angelina Jolie's breasts popping out of the scene in 3D on several occasions was ... well, breathtaking. She was however, more than just eye candy, she voiced the role spectacularly. All the voice talent was phenomenal Ray Winstone reminds me of Russell Crowe's performance in Gladiator. This is much better yet in my opinion. At one point King Hrothgar says ""The Gods will not do for us what we do not do for our selves. What we need now is a HERO."" It takes a super hero of super heroes to be a Danish Viking Legend and the voice and the character of Beowulf (Ray Winstone) work together, pulling of shear authenticity in an unbelievable fictional character. How do you compliment the acting when it is CG, well I must because Hopkins is still a master. I ramble on¬Ö so I will not get into the story now, but you will be touched by the innocence of a grotesque monster in pain, stunned by the beauty of the monsters mother, appalled at the state of man who becomes monstrous, moved by the heart and courage a man who chooses to right the wrong he did, and most importantly you will be WOWED by the movie Beowulf!

I'm thoroughly disgusted by the sheer audacity these nuts have in creating what they call Beowulf; clearly they've done a terrible job of conveying the real meaning of the poem. I was so excited when I heard about the movie, because I thought it'd be a great supplement to the text we had just read. I mean, seriously, when was the last time you taught a text and a brand new film of it came out? The only redeeming quality of the film was when my students were sitting the theater saying, ""Hey, that wasn't in the book!"" throughout most of the film.

","I have seen and heard (radio dramas) many versions of this story. I even was the TD and sound engineer on a NPR release of Grendel. I have great respect for Neil Gaiman and yet, this is by far the worst retelling of this saga. Maybe Neil's writing was butchered by the editing of the production, but the beauty of the prose was absent. The drama between Beowulf and Unferth was lacking. The ending seemed to be just an afterthought.<br/><br/>Now the animation, an attempt at photorealism, was pathetic in its artistry. Why spend so much time, effort, and money to have Angelina's character look exactly like Angelina? What is the point? What is the intention? All this work and the character animation still look like stiff automatons with only brief moments of brilliance. The lighting and color palette are right out of any of a dozen cheap video games.<br/><br/>Again, why?"
"schilder-3","2","3","6","5 February 2008"," Could this be the worst movie ever ?
","The answer is yes. When one goes to see a movie that is adapted from a book or in this case an epic poem, one understands that there will be inconsistencies or changes to aid the story in its transition to the big screen. This being said, why do these adaptations insist on changing these great works into something that is barely representative of the original piece. This is entirely true of Zemeckis' adaptation of the epic poem. I don't understand why the screenwriters felt the need to change the characters and events in the poem. Honestly the story is pretty darn good to begin with, there would be very little that would need to be changed to adapt it to the screen. Why did they feel the need to turn the aged warrior king Hrothgar into a drunken, bumbling imbecile? Why did they change the Queen Wealthow into a whiny, lusting twit? Why did they turn Beowulf into a glory seeking, horny, liar? These are just a few of the character problems in this movie. Then there are the changes in the plot that stem from the characters. Where in the world did they come up with the idea to make Hrothgar Grendel's father? Why in the world would Beowulf sleep with Grendel's mother? Why was the dragon his son? Were these outlandish sexually driven plot changes a lame attempt to drawn in modern viewers. This is a terrible commentary on the movie going public if Hollywood feels that it must destroy great works to get a quick laugh and an extra buck. <br/><br/>Now to move away from how the original genius of the poem was ruined by this movie; the computer generated figures were absolutely terrible. Couldn't actors and CGI creatures and sets do the job just as well. Don't the cold, eyes of the images reflect the liveless script that was fashioned by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery? <br/><br/>There are only two acceptable aspects of this terrible movie. The music is quite good at times and when Grendel speaks in Old English, that was very interesting to hear. <br/><br/>Please reconsider if you are planning to watch this movie.

","...NOT ""Beowulf"", because it rogers the very concept of the epic poem Beowulf up the arse. Quite deliberately, too. It's a razor-sharp side-swipe at heroism itself, this tale, and bears a peculiar and quite knowing relation to the source material. It's up there with Starship Troopers. I think a lot of people have missed this.<br/><br/>Essentially this is the story of what the film-makers would like us to imagine is the REAL Beowulf. We're to believe that the real reason we're left with the epic as it is now is because that's just what stories do over time. This is clearly signalled during the film, in particular during the sequence where Beowulf's exploits are performed for him in miniature by the dwarfs. This movie is a calculated, grim-eyed stab at the original's heart. Whether this is a good or bad thing I will leave to others to decide, but make no mistake, the re-write was in no way an *arbitrary* remix of the source material, as some seem to think.<br/><br/>And therein lies the pity. A lot of careful effort's gone into making the story good. As an anti-hero's story, it's really bloody good. Beowulf starts out being a hyper-heroic cock and then becomes a good deal more human as the story progresses. Real, fleshy, palpable, flawed. He screws up. And then he redeems himself! And becomes a much more potent hero figure in the process! A hero whose true struggle, the hardest, most unforgiving one, will never truly be known as the unimaginative, bloodthirsty fools he shares the hall with won't tolerate any of his real feelings. This is much meatier stuff in terms of story-telling than the original. People will be angry with me for saying so, but it's true.<br/><br/>UNFORTUNATELY, this very good story has been tainted with the word ""BEOWULF"", the title of another story, also a very good story, but *quite different* in terms of theme, and I think this movie would be doing a lot better for itself in the IMDb tables if it was called... ummm... ""Simon"". Or something.<br/><br/>Cos, it's a very good story, I think.<br/><br/>I ended up liking Beowulf after at first thinking he was really a bit of a thick twit. I liked Grendel's mother from the start and now think she's one of the most interesting characters I've seen on screen this year, maybe in the last five years. Gravitas and guile, oh yes. And Grendel was brilliant, a truly hideous accident, a price paid, a warning, the personification of *dreadful consequence*. And everyone, really, all the actors did brilliantly, the script and acting and plot and effects and mis-en-scene were superb! Also, I really REALLY like the ending. It was a really strong, simple, unexpected ending that sent delightful shivers up my spine, cinematic shivers the like of which I rarely feel these days. Well done, Mr Gaiman! I imagine quite a few people will be cursing you heftily, I personally think you've done rather well... although, after making that strong, clean story, you should just have called it: ""Jonathan"". Or something. I know you like to be clever, but really, it would have been even better.<br/><br/>3D stuff was good, too! Not in your face at all. Well, apart from the odd tentacle.<br/><br/>Pity about the motion capture, though. Ick. Would have been 10 otherwise.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and the stiletto feet were daft.

But no, there wasn't. There are some particularly awful scenes, made to seed the feel of epicness but result in nothing but a weird joke.<br/><br/>The story was alright, it developed right and was interesting to follow. However, in a movie of human (and demon) relations accented, it is imperative to have humans act the talk-scenes. Computer graphics CAN'T replace human mimics especially in the tensed emotion scenes. I do have to admit I watched this movie on 2D, perhaps it looks better in 3D, but the computer graphics somewhat degraded this movie, adding a bit of comicness, which clearly doesn't fit in a movie like this. <br/><br/>The story was near perfect. It was quite obvious of the result in the beginning, but it's normal in these movies. The battle scenes were also thrilling and the creators have done a great job there. However, computer graphics awfully degrade this movie, I dare even say stealing an award or two, human emotions and mimics can never be fully replaced by computer and I had hoped Zemeckis knew that.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining movie for the epic adventure film fans, but will seem completely unacceptable for the rest.

I believe having done the movie with a standard shooting with some CGI effects would be much better. I am saying this because all the work of redoing the actor's faces would be unnecessary and it would seem more real.<br/><br/>I cannot say much about this film, only that I did not like it because the way the story was told was very confusing, and the movie is very hard to watch.<br/><br/>I expected more of the director of ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away"", even though the cast of this movie does not include Tom Hanks."

","Any students that believe they can watch the new cartoon movie ""Beowulf"" and then fool their English literature professors into believing that they read the 6th century Anglo-Saxon epic poem are in for a rude awakening. Indeed, none of the film or television versions of the Beowulf legend have kept the action of the original old English poem intact. As the first adaptation of the ancient Beowulf yarn, ""Grendel Grendel Grendel"" (1981) drew itsstoryline from author John Gardner's 1971 novella ""Grendel."" Gardner depicted the hideous Grendel monster in a sympathetic light. Not only was ""Grendel Grendel Grendel"" the first attempt at filming Beowulf, but the movie also relied on animation to render its larger-than-life events. In 1998, the BBC and HBO teamed up to televise a second cartoon version appropriately entitled ""Beowulf,"" with the incomparable London stage actor Sir Derek Jacobi serving as narrator. Later, British director Graham Baker helmed the first majorattempt to film the vintage Old English poem. Baker cast ""Highlander"" actor Christopher Lambert as the protagonist in ""Beowulf"" (1999), but it departed drastically from the poem, too. Essentially an outlandish science fiction spin on the fable, Baker changed the setting of ""Beowulf"" from ancient times to the post-apocalyptic future. Meanwhile, Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarsson's tedious ""Beowulf & Grendel"" (2005) with ""300"" star Gerard Butler, emerged as the next major television rehash, and Gunnarsson treated the Grendel monster as an outcast human. More recently, The Sci-Fi Channel aired its version of Beowulf back in January of 2007 and called it ""Grendel,"" but it differed in several aspects from the original poem, too.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, ""Back to the Future"" director Robert Zemeckis' new""Beowulf"" takes considerable liberties with the source material. Director Robert Zemeckis states unequivocally in a promotional video for ""Beowulf"" that his film ""Right now, I can only say that this has nothing to do with the Beowulf that you were forced to read in junior high school."" Zemeckis goes on to say, ""It's all about eating, drinking, killing and fornicating."" Imagine what the sword & sandal saga ""300"" would look like if it were done as a cartoon, and you'll know what to expect from ""Beowulf."" Unfortunately, Zemeckis' use of state-of-the-art, motion capture technology, which converts real-life actors into cartoon figures, is both its chief claim to fame as well as its main liability.<br/><br/>Scribes Roger (""Pulp Fiction"") Avary and Neil (""Stardust"") Gaiman dispense with the poem's opening lineage passages and launch headlong into the myth. As the story unfolds, King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins of ""Fracture"") and his Danish subjects are about to christen a massive mead hall‚Äîsomething akin to a private corporate camp house--with women, liquor, and loud music. Amazingly, Hrothgar and company create such uproar that it enrages Grendel, a truly pathetic-looking monster in the snow-swept wilderness not far away from the hall. This murderous fiend storms the mead hall and slaughters warriors left and right. Here, Grendel (Crispin Glover of ""Willard"") resembles a cross-between of an evil juvenile delinquent straight out of an ""Aqua Team Hunger Force"" TV episode and a huge emaciated cadaver. Basically, Grendel consists of bone and sinew, but he is merciless when he goes on a rampage.<br/><br/>Naturally, Grendel's bloody massacre horrifies Hrothgar, and the king summons any and all warriors willing to risk their necks, to slay Grendel. A Swedish warrior named Beowulf (paunchy Ray Winstone of ""The Departed"") and his sword-wielding soldiers arrive after a rigorous voyage. Hrothgar reopens the hall. Beowulf strips nude and sets aside his arsenal of weapons. He plans to kill Grendel with his bare hands. Later that evening after all the revelers have passed out, Grendel surprises them, but the warriors are ready for him. Beowulf rips off Grendel's arm, and the monster vamooses. Not long afterward, Grendel's mother appears and challenges Beowulf. Grendel's mother is not the hag in the poem. Instead, she emerges as a sexy, shape-shifting siren in stiletto heels, played by ""Tomb Raider"" star Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>What Avary and Gaiman have scripted is not much more than a standard ""Conan"" movie, except for the alluring power that Grendel's mother exerts over King Hrothgar and later Beowulf. The two writers have filled in the gaps between the three major set-pieces; (1) Beowulf's battle with Grendel, (2) Beowulf's combat with Grendel's mom, and decades later (3) the fight with a dragon. In doing so, Avary andmGaiman argue that King Hrothgar had a tryst with Grendel's mom and sired their illegitimate offspring.<br/><br/>Altogether, Zemeckis' ambitious but underwhelming ""Beowulf"" resembles a souped version of an 1960's Jonny Quest episode, unless you're fortunate enough to catch the 3-D version of this movie in an IMAX Theater. The animated eyes of the characters lack the vivacity of actual humans. Furthermore, their hands are crudely drawn and they look hilarious when they run. Despite the considerable advances made in photo-realistic, motion capture technology, ""Beowulf"" forfeits the subtly nuanced acting skills of thespians like Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Crispin Glover, Robin Wright Penn, and Brendan Gleeson. Meanwhile, everything non-human looks terrific. All works of literature and film are linked by universality. ""Beowulf"" constitutes the 6th century equivalent of a 21st century home invasion. Sadly, the hilarious looking Grendel villain and the less-than spectacular animation of the principal actors defeats ""Beowulf."""

There are TONS of complete story breakdowns throughout IMDb and they tell it far better than I could so I'll tell what I think is important to me.<br/><br/>Pros - 1. The 3D is stunning if you see it in 3D. 2. Animation is great even not in 3D. 3. Angelina Jolie looks stunning with a perfect blend of animation and live motion photography. Uhhh.. I wish there was more.<br/><br/>Cons - 1. The story doesn't follow the real story at all 2. The writer seems bent on making the character Beowulf so SUPREME of a fighter that he has him doing ridiculous things such as fighting naked to prove a point of his superior skill. This was laughable and did nothing but further prove my next point. 3. This should be RATED R. Everything is done over the top and especially the gore. I don't mind this when expecting it but I almost took my son to see this PG-13 film. I can honestly say that I would feel MUCH better taking him to see 300 than Beowulf and he is only 8 years old. Of course I wouldn't take him to see either. Beowulf comes off as a movie that could be seen by a family. Not only this but I found most of the gore was not needed at all and out of place. I can't say this about 300. I thought every part of the gore in that film served a purpose but with Beowulf it is non stop and as I said, unneeded. Every time you can expect a bloody part it is there but over done. If a creature is killed it can't just be slashed with blood coming out. It has to have an eye ball being slashed in half and then it cut in half with gushing blood that covers the screen. What's the point?!?! I felt like Beowulf was competing with Anime porn horror at times to be the goriest and sexiest it could be. My biggest question is, HOW did this get a PG-13 rating?! The nudity is there throughout although they do mask it a bit with what would be the equivalent of a large pasty over Angelina that is just thick enough to mute the color of her skin and hide her pubic hair but not thick enough to hide much else. Now, let me explain clearly. I'm not so opposed to this that I would rip it if it were rated R but being PG-13 I feel it needs a thrashing. If you thought 300 was even remotely too violent or too bloody then stay far away from Beowulf.<br/><br/>Summary - If you want to see one of the best films in 3D to come around and can stand a story that is destroyed, ridiculous writing with such scenes as the hero thinking he proves something by fighting while naked and you can handle plenty of gore then by all means check out Beowulf. However, if you thought 300 was gory or you don't appreciate gratuitous gore and nudity (although as I said the nudity is disguised so to speak) then you should stay away."
"preppy-3","5","3","6","24 November 2007"," The 3-D animation is all this has going for it
","Powerful Beowulf journeys to a village to destroy a monster named Grendel. Unfortunately he doesn't realize Grendel has a mother to deal with too.<br/><br/>OK--the 3-D animation is incredible. The characters look and act like real people. The voices match the characters perfectly also. Also, despite the PG-13 rating, this has plenty of nudity--mostly male. Beowulf has a long battle with Grendel--and he's completely nude during it! Still there are no frontal shots and you're always aware that you're looking at a computer-animated figure. Also the female nudity is pretty minor--you see breasts but no nipples. There's also some pretty extreme gore but it all comes across as fairly unrealistic. If this had been done live action it probably would have gotten an R. But, that aside, this is pretty routine and boring.<br/><br/>The story has been read by probably every kid in U.S. so you know exactly what's going to happen. Also they speak in Old English and it gets tiresome. Some of the speech is unintelligible--I couldn't understand half of Grendel's lines and Angelina Jolie (playing his mom) puts on a very strange accent. Also there's an ending that (surprise surprise) actually leaves room for a sequel! However I've never liked fantasy movies (except for the Lord of the Rings trilogy) so maybe it's no surprise that I was bored by this and looking at my watch far too much. But, again, the 3-D animation was superb and doesn't leave you with the blinding headaches that the old 3-D did. So--use your own judgment on how much you like fantasy for this."
"dcgaston-1","2","13","43","13 November 2007"," Anti-Christian and just flat out bad
","Rarely do I see a film with such blatant anti-Christian moments. This theme is progressed with contrasts between the hero Beowulf and references to the non-heroic / emasculated actions of Christians. Specifically, Unferth (John Malcovich) is contrasted against Beowulf throughout the film. Unferth is a coward who flees from the monsters terrorizing his village, whereas Beowulf is the hero who conquers the beasts. At the conclusion of the work Unferth has become a slave owning/beating Christian priest who is still just as cowardly as ever, yet Beowulf is the heroic king whose well deserved fame has spread throughout the land. This contrast summarizes the heroic idolization and the not-so-subtle anti-Christian theme apparent throughout the film.<br/><br/>Additionally, the plot is relatively absent. The film erred on the side of crowd pleasing with a presentation in 3D and spectacular special effects. But, such special effects are only expected by the current eight dollar paying movie-goer, so all the film really has going for it is a presentation in 3D. Regarding character depth, Beowulf (Ray Windstone) and his queen (Robin Wright Penn) seemed to demonstrate some towards the end of the movie, but all other characters lacked depth completely.<br/><br/>The film has no redeeming qualities. The market for the movie is unmistakably teenage boys with no desire to critically think about what they view. Just imagine what that does to a film."
"hsvfxeditorial","10","7","20","12 November 2007"," Beowulf redefines the 3D experience
","*** contains minor story revelations ***<br/><br/>Throughout the past decade DVDs, BluRays and HD-DVDs have upgraded many homes to theater like environments which is why a dedicated group of filmmakers like James Cameron and Robert Zemeckis have decided to push the theatrical movie going experience to new limits. The advent of Beowulf is the first result of their resolve as it utilizes photo realistic animation in conjunction with 3D digital projection to plunge the viewer right into the action.<br/><br/>The film's story is set in a small, remote northern village in Denmark where the inhabitants dwell in fear of a monster known as Grendel. Whenever the people engage in a merry feast an attack of the monster ensues. So the King promises a reward to he who rids the village of the creature and restores order. The brave Beowulf rises to the challenge but the revenge of Grendel's mother is terrible. So Beowulf sets out again, intent on killing Grendel's mother, but she turns out to be a beautiful, seductive entity that presents Beowulf with a promising choice, a choice the consequences of which Beowulf can not even begin to comprehend....<br/><br/>Of all the 3D movie experiences at theme parks, movie theaters etc. Beowulf has thus far been the by far most impressive one. (I did see it in regular 3D not in IMAX 3D) Robert Zemeckis has pushed motion capture based animation to new limits bearing a photorealism hitherto unseen. All the characters look fantastic, the best looking one is the Angelina Jolie based model of Grendel's mother. She really looks like the real deal. Pity she has only so much screen time.<br/><br/>The story was good even though at first it takes a little time to get going, but that's a good chance to get used to the 3D experience because once the action sets in your eyes will be challenged. Zemeckis shot/animated the movie with fluid shots that make good use of the depth of field that work so well in 3D. I did like the overall look, the actors voice work/mo-cap acting was great. Overall experience: Loved it. Can't wait to see it again."

","This is a dog of a movie. I wasn't put off by the CG or Beowulf's bare, digitally rendered ass. No, what I did have a problem with is that the first hour of the film could have easily been summed up in a two to three minute minute montage. Instead, what we got was a pointless exercise with barely emotional characters, incredibly loud screaming and lots of pointless scenes of Beowulf sitting around doing nothing. In short, there is action in the movie to be sure, but it is very little. There is just far too much talking and not enough doing. Beowulf is not the deep and intriguing character he was portrayed as in the books. In this movie there is very little we know about his background. I don't think anyone will find themselves excited by seeing a naked CGI man jumping around fighting with a giant troll then meeting with Angelina Jolie, who is naked except for some gold paint. As for the climax? Well hopefully you were wise enough to not ignore my warning and not go see this mess. It's certainly not the worst movie ever by a very long shot, but considering it's potential, it could have been a lot better."

","I'm glad to be alive for this period, when cinema is simultaneously maturing into deeper realms of introspection and evolving into a new form altogether. Even when I see a thoroughly unredeemable story like ""Transformers"" done with this new awareness of time and space, I feel ennobled, even hopeful about the future. And isn't that one reason we go to the movies, to fight the weight of others, the feeling that society is doomed?<br/><br/>What's happening is that different technologies are freeing us from the constraints of the physical camera. This ¬ó constrained only by what is thought to be the viewer's requirements for understanding ¬ó allows modern storytellers to see things differently, with a grander vocabulary. <br/><br/>It means adventures of the imagination. It means that we get to question and expand just who we are in relation to the story we watch. Are we invisible ghosts but with otherwise human limits? Are we agents in creating the story, things bent by our expectations and needs? Are we companions or competitors with the writer as he reveals, Scroogewise? <br/><br/>Or are we also growing ¬ó at least a little ¬ó into the literal weavers of the space into which the worlds of the story are poured by others? I believe so, and that belief deepens when we see even the most vulgar filmmakers get on board. This is new in the last decade and it is accelerating apace. No adventure film that depends on effects that was made even a decade ago is effective if first seen now.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what technologies will survive. By that I mean whether motion capture will be necessary, with real persons behind the puppets we see, as we have in this movie. Or whether we'll have something more like ""300"" and ""Sin City"" where the emphasis is on the subtle details of humans and all else synthesized. Or even whether the Pixar movement will grow. But I do know that the way we allow the camera to move has changed, and this film is a milestone of sorts.<br/><br/>Part of that is the way it was engineered to allow for the IMAX 3-d experience ¬ó how I saw it. Its more grand and overstated than we will end up with in real films, I'm sure. But it is a marker.<br/><br/>Unfortnately, since we still have a dummy at the steering wheel, the overall benefit is lost. What Zemekis does is swoop, but except for more overhead shots than usual, what he does is give us all the ""ordinary"" perspectives someone like him normally would a decade ago. But they are seamlessly connected. So it is generally: shot, swoop, pause, swoop, shot. We do get some spatial definition and weaving, but it is an unintended byproduct. He's just not smart enough to live in the connecting movements instead of the endstations. I'm watching this with ""Three Crowns of the Sailor"" made 25 years ago which had precisely the verb awareness instead of the noun, but without the technology.<br/><br/>So once again, we see the story reflecting what we have in the film. The story, if you don't know, is about the merger of the human and non-human. We see two iterations: one imperfect, a second nearly perfect. The first is grotesque but powerful, the second graceful and airborne. This movie is the first, a rather grotesque synthesis that we only expect to toss things about. (It intimates something along these lines with ""the new religion"" as well.)<br/><br/>We can only hope for the champion to arrive to give us the real juice, the one prepared to wrestle with only his soul, and to have a soul that matters. And when he comes, BOTH Robin and Angelina will carry.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"moviemaniac008","8","5","13","19 November 2007"," Beowulf: A great animated movie!
","I must say that it made a long time that an animated movie has had me captivated that much. In fact, it made a long time I had SEEN an animated movie. However, Beowulf had me really captivated. I must say that I admire Robert Zemeckis' work on this movie. The animated characters looked so real that I was thinking about real actors at some parts of the film. Though many characters(like Angelina Jolie's and Anthony Hopkins') were a bit unrealistic, however, their faces were actually recognizable. The battle scenes are kind of like in 300. My only negative point is that there is a few long scenes that last 20 minutes instead of 10(which would have been perfect).<br/><br/>Beowulf is a great movie with a lot of great animation. If you are searching for an action movie, then you won't be disappointed with Beowulf. However, don't bring the kids along!!"
"MissEvilToYou","8","5","13","15 November 2007"," Well I loved it and here's why with LOTS OF SPOILERS.
","From the outset, Beowulf is bawdy, bloody, and beautifully constructed. Neil Gaiman & Roger Avary's screenplay is impressively faithful to the original saga in general; the departures add colour and depth to the world in which the characters move, and help to make a point about the innate hubris of any alpha male. <br/><br/>Gaiman lives up to his reputation for having ""a dirty mouth in at least seven centuries"", and I look forward to one or two long-lost expressions returning to the nation's playgrounds when this goes on general release on Monday. While the BBFC may consider the language mild enough and the gore artificial enough given the fantastical setting, do not go into this expecting the kids' version. When Grendel attacks, not only do you get mystical blue flame, but you also get arterial spray. We see shadowplay of the monster ripping a man in half and think ""copout"" but then his torso, complete with exquisitely rendered dripping entrails, is thrown into the shot as he expires. A warrior's head is bitten off and Grendel chews it, lazily, like a gobstopper, for at least a minute. Fantastic.<br/><br/>The CGI itself is for the most part excellent. The gamble has paid off, since the subtle wrongness which affects CGI monsters and items in live-action permeates the whole film, enabling suspension of disbelief. The one sticking point is Angelina Jolie; allegedly deliberately overairbrushed (even more so than the other women featured) to lend her an ethereal quality as Grendel's hot momma, she often looks more like she's acting in a cut scene from Tomb Raider:Norse. In her defence, the prehensile, Gigeresque hairdo and the seamless spike-heeled feet are cracking ideas, reasonably well-realized.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone struggles manfully to hold in his Laaahndahn tones and mostly succeeds. Brendan Gleeson is excellent as his dignified lieutenant Wiglaf. The ladies are suitably decorative with just enough pinches of sassy dialogue, dignified in the delivery, to remind one this isn't actually so Boy's Own as all that. Malkovich walks the fine line between oily and sparky as ambiguous Unferth, and Hopkins is enchantingly barmy as ageing Hrothgar, calling to mind his sterling Van Helsing in parts. The slight accent slips that all the main characters suffer actually works in their favour - like the American and Scottish accents in Dangerous Liaisons, they help to distinguish the peoples - The Geats occasionally sound English, The Danes oddly Mid-Atlantic Welsh (Hopkins and Malkovich must have talked at each other for hours to nail that one), giving the impression of different peoples using a lingua franca. In a touch which made me bounce up and down in my seat a bit, Grendel speaks Very Old English. In fact in the scenes taken directly from the original text, he delivers his lines verbatim. The additional scenes inserted, apparently to give the monster a bit of motivation and set up the horrible truth of Hrothgar's shame for the uninitiated, are well-written (as you would expect - this is Gaiman after all) and actually manage to imbue Grendel with a bit of sympathy - this is definitely a product of a culture which no longer thinks in black-and-white terms.<br/><br/>On that note, another deviation from the original text is the position of faith in the film. At the start, all the main characters with the exception of Unferth are firmly pagan. Many years later, when Beowulf faces his third demon-battle, Christianity has moved in and Unferth is now a priest. And that's it. No debate, no manifesto, no bending of the story to serve a certain religious viewpoint (unlike the original).<br/><br/>Almost. <br/><br/>If you forget the dragon's first attack.<br/><br/>The scene, which ends in a horribly injured Unferth being carried to safety on a smouldering cross, bleeding onto a white snowfield, screaming ""The Sins Of The Fathers..."" appears to carry more than a few references to album covers of a certain nature. The fact that the first building the dragon sets fire to and stomps on is a church makes one wonder if Gaiman had a certain element among the viewers in his mind when planning it.<br/><br/>So anyway. To summarise. Emotional bits (Hrothgar's plummet, burials, aftermaths of attacks, any scene with ladies in): reasonably moving except for the singing. Who let Glenn Ballard in? Acting: some scenery-chewing but that's mostly due to the bombast of the script. Script: An excellent adaptation overall. Effects/Animation: Pisses all over Polar Express, and indeed Final Fantasy, from a great height, and the dragon is *gorgeous*. Keep an eye out for: some genuine, extant Viking artefacts in the prop basket, visual gags involving men staring at boobs, excellently rendered hideously graphic violence, some comedy cock-obscuring, Ray Winstone's little homage to Malcolm McDowell's Gangster Number One, and one of the most stupidly heroic and gruesome moments ever.<br/><br/>Heartily Recommended."

","First off I want to say I was so thrilled about the trailer. It looked like it was going to be fascinating. Also, I love the tales of Beowulf, so I was obviously pulled in from the get-go. So I'm sitting in the theater watching Beowulf when I find myself gagging at the boredom that is being thrown at me..Not to mention Anthony Hopkin's butt.<br/><br/>The scenery in the movie was phenomenal. I loved the animation, but when it came time for Beowulf to fight his first victim (spoiler) He decided it be more fair for him to fight butt naked...And yes, ladies and gentlemen, you get to enjoy a 3-5 minute Butt naked Beowulf fight scene between him and Grendal.<br/><br/>There also was so much talk about sex, and what the vikings were wanting to do to the villager women. Definitely deserves a R rating in my book. But so far, even though I personally hated that stuff being a PG-13 rated film, I let it pass..<br/><br/>Aye, but when Angelina Jolie's character pranced on the screen, that is when it concreted my thought and I soon after left theater. (spoiler) Angelina's character was not clothed at all. Nipples were clearly visible and well...so was other things. Not to mention..more butt.<br/><br/>So, If you enjoy Sex, Boobs, and Naked Men It will be the best movie to date..But if you are a moral human with any conscience I highly advise you to save your money for better movies that are to come."

","However, I loved the movie and the 3-D was 85% of what was enjoyable. I think a ""flat"" version would be flat. <br/><br/>Most of the excitement comes with the 3-D images coming at ya. I had to keep from reaching my hand up to touch the bubbles (or whatever) seemed to be floating in the air right in front of me.<br/><br/>After about 20 minute, I started to feel ooky, so took off my glasses and closed my eyes for a few minutes. Had to repeat this several times. But I'm proud to say I made it thru the 1:55 movie length without barfing. <br/><br/>It's now 2 hours since I left the theater and I'm still slightly nauseous.<br/><br/>However, other people weren't bothered. SO maybe it's just me -- or where I was sitting (last row, far right seat). I think you have to find out exactly where your head needs to be so you don't see double images -- then pin your head to the back of your seat and DON'T MOVE IT!<br/><br/>Another warning: it's pushing the limits for a PG-13 movie. For the timid or very young, it might be too much. Lots of limb-ripping, head-chomping, torso-goring and nudity. <br/><br/>Several children in our theater were crying.

"Matt-j-russell","7","7","21","12 November 2007"," Definitely worth a watch but only at the cinema, and only for the 3D thing
","Let's not beat around the bush here. This movie is good for one reason and one reason only - the jaw-dropping, unable to drag your eyes away from the screen 3D it's filmed in.<br/><br/>The CGI is very good for the most part. The women look a bit fake but the guys are very impressive. They really seem to have facial hair thing down. The standard of acting wasn't very high although Anthony Hopkins was almost indistinguishable from his real life version and Brendan Gleeson provided some much needed comic relief as Beowulf's right hand man. The rest of them though seemed very wooden and I was unsure whether it was the animation or their voices which let them down.<br/><br/>The only thing I found truly disappointing though was what they did with the character of Grendel's mother. As far as i'm concerned, it's just plain wrong to change such an old and epic story just to accommodate Angelina Jolie's computer animated boobs. It was silly and disrespectful to the poem although I'm sure it'll draw in the crowds, or at least the teenage boys.<br/><br/>Acting and story-changes aside, the action is fast paced but not exhausting. It never drags or loses it's way and seriously, the 3D is very impressive, even if it does milk it a little at the beginning (lots of pointlessly traversing landscapes and people throwing things at the 'camera') <br/><br/>In summary then it is definitely worth watching but only at the cinema, and only for the 3D thing, oh and Angelina Jolie's boobs if you're really that desperate."

"cultfilmfan","9","4","10","18 November 2007"," Beowulf
","Beowulf is an animated film based on an old English poem thought to be written between the 8th and 11th century and nobody has ever known who the author was and people still do not know, but the poem has become very popular throughout the years and has been the basis for other films as well. The film is animated using a technique called motion capture where the film's directors would film action and things in motion by the film's actors and later animate it over with 3 dimensional animation. The same technique was used a couple of years ago in the film The Polar Express also by Beowulf director Robert Zemeckis. The film takes place in late 500 AD in England and is about a village that is terrorized by a monster named Grendel who frequently comes to the surface of the Earth and kills whoever is being merry and making music. King Hrothgar sends for a warrior named Beowulf to slay Grendel and after doing so, Beowulf soon becomes king of the land, but a lie that he has covered up with his famous battle will soon come back to haunt him and the kingdom. I think because of the animation and visual style of the film and also because it's story and action sequences that people will compare this film to this year's earlier film 300. While I gave 300 a pretty favourable review on this site mostly because of the visuals I felt that the visuals were better than the story and film itself, but luckily Beowulf uses great animation and visuals along with a truly exciting and entertaining story. Beowulf is a beautiful film to look at because of it's animation and I thought the story was full of action and excitement which was enough to capture my interest for the film's length. I have always been into mythology and stories of that kind, so for that reason Beowulf also intrigued me even more and I think that today there is a large audience into the sword battle and monster films, so I think this film should appeal to many and with it's great pace it will surely entertain. The only thing I had a problem with in this film was a few lines of dialogue that the screenwriters put in that were unintentionally funny in a crude kind of way when I don't think they were particularly meant to be, so for that reason I don't think those few scenes really fit in and I noticed the audience laughed like I did at said moments, so I knew I wasn't the only one with this complaint. Those lines and scenes just didn't suit a serious film like this. However this is only a real mild complaint while the rest of the movie I enjoyed immensely because of the fascinating story, the non stop action and the visual beauty of the animation. This is one of the best animated films of the year so far and I think if people were to ignore those few scenes and lines of dialogue I mentioned above then they should be in for a good time as well as a visually stunning experience as well."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","4","4","10","17 November 2007"," A legendary story suffers a legendary butchering
","I'd like to start of and say that the film gets 3 stars for the visuals, and 1 star for Angelina Jolie being naked the whole time she's on screen (a whopping 10 minutes at most). Everything else makes this incredible epic look incredibly bad. Whether it be horrible thick accents, tiresome dialog, undeveloped characters, or the horrible translation from story to screen, Beowulf takes the cake as the most disappointing film of 2007.<br/><br/>We all know the legendary tale: Beowulf answers the call of King Hrothgar to kill the monstrous Grendel, only to incur the wrath of Grendel's mother.<br/><br/>The plot itself is weak. It suffers from boring scene after boring scene, each revering Beowulf as a saint, though this movie transforms the epic work in a way that makes Grendel more likable. Kudos to Crispin Glover for creating a wonderful Grendel. His cries are so real and full of emotion. You're going to feel Grendel's pain. Glover and Angelina Jolie, who plays his mother, give the best performances. Jolie's accent is a little weird, but it works and she's definitely one of the better villains of 2007. I liked Ray Winstone as Beowulf, it worked, but his performance is underminded by the royal screwing his character gets in the script. Anthony Hopkins is really entertaining as the drunk Hrothgar. I hated John Malkovich in this film. How can such a fine actor become so annoying? His accent was horrible. There were no Danish accents in the entire film. There's Scottish, Welsh, and even Greek, but no Danish. In a movie set in Denmark. Nice one, Zemeckis.<br/><br/>The visual effects are definitely wonderful. No doubt about it. Zemeckis is the master of this kind of animation, but he forgot to add a plot. I liked the finale, and the landscapes were beautiful. Beowulf deserved an Oscar nod for this department. However, the big problem I had was that the movie tried too hard to make the audience remember it's in 3D. We know it's in 3D. We're wearing these stupid glasses. Zemeckis, you failed. You've succeeded, however, in turning a literary masterpiece into a cinematic disaster.<br/><br/>4/10 --spy"
"artzau","8","5","14","17 November 2007"," Interesting Twist
","OK. I wasn't expecting that the epic would be true point by point to the original and certainly wasn't expecting all the CGI treatments. However, I liked the twist on the original saga with the themes of greed, lust and power, all of which drive the political mechanism in culture and society. The perspective then becomes one of power corrupting, as both the old and young kings fall prey to the inner weakness of power, fame and glory. Beowulf's redemption is gained through self-sacrifice; his predecessor and successors' are left ambiguous and the mother as archetype of lust, greed and power remains eternal. Nice touch. Lots of fun things with Malkovich, Gleeson and the ever wonderful Tony Hopkins. Crispin Glover, although hard to recognize under all that CGI, is his usual competent self and the lasses, Robin Wright Penn and Alison Lohman are beautiful and sexual-- and then, there's Angelina Jolie who steals the scene each time with her dark, seductive beauty. Winstone with his Cockney toughness comes across well as the vulnerable hero and the battle scenes are wonderful albeit, a bit intense. So, if you want to read the original, for gosh sakes read Seamus Heaney's masterful translation rather some of the older stodgy versions. But, if you just want some great entertainment, see this movie."

","i couldn't even watch the whole thing on HBO - i was too tired to waste my time any longer. most negative comments complain about ""not following the storyline of the poem"". well, I haven't read the poem. and the movie still is a great disappointment. the plot and the dialogues are far worse than the version from 1999 with Cristophe Lambert (a movie with a 3,6 rating and deserving it) the only good thing about the whole experience: a few touching lines from Grendel. Beowulf himself was so damn hilarious. And naked. Almost all the time. For no obvious reason. The ""shadow"" covering his genitals - common means to hide inappropriate sights in anime for example, is frustratingly misplaced in a realistic 3D. If they were so ashamed, why not give him a pair of viking pants. The dialogues were incredibly lame and funny, like they were written (and performed) by nerdy 13-year-old gamers trying to burlesque Manowar. Grendel's mum was also hilarious. I still can't imagine why in the world did Angelina say ""yes"" to take part in this. Or Antony Hopkins. Or Malkovich or any of the other great (and not so great) actors starring in that ridiculous excuse for an epic movie. Anyway, I was talking about Grendel's mum. So... alright, she was ridiculous (and 3D-made Angelina doesn't have even half of the sex appeal of the normal ms. Jolie.) She had high heels, alright. Coming out of her bare feet. Can you possibly imagine just how funny that looks? Anyway, soon after the appearance of the gold-painted reptile known as ""Grendel's Mother"" my patience was exhausted and I switched the channel...

Yes, I do realise the review doesn't flow)<br/><br/>I was surprised that this was the first animation in which the characters could not act. Their tone of voice mentioned nothing but ""I really need another hit movie on my portfolio"".<br/><br/>The 3D was the only thing that I enjoyed. I quite liked how I was transported into Beowulf's world. I was glad that I did not attempt to watch the 2D version of this. But sometimes the 3d went fuzzy and I couldn't see anything without crossing my eyes.<br/><br/>Last and not least was the emotions created by the movie. I viewed Beowulf as a villain, not a hero, for slaying the big tree thing (Was it called Granald?) because of the sympathy created by Angelina Jolie's character and because it really was innocent and only wanted a bit of piece and quiet. The emotions created for the audience was all over the place.<br/><br/>Although I must admit I did like one part. The part before the film had started and there was a trailer for another film, which looked very good. Probably the best part of the ride, and thinking about it, it sounds pathetic. I'm not usually the one to critise but I want my money back."

","I personally want to say a few words about Beowulf, after I've seen it earlier today. I was pretty curious for the content of this movie, from all the things I heard about it. I knew it had this strange sort of style, where it was somewhere in between real life persons and 3D game model figures, but that wasn't my concern. The fact is that I did not even like a single part of the whole story, except maybe for one of the last scenes, where there was finally some action going on. The rest of the movie was just pityful in my opinion, not even close to what could be seen in many other movies, even of the same subject. I would not recommend you guys to watch this movie, but it's up to you!"

The rest is hardly more but a lot of chatting and a little fighting. And - thats it ! No sub-context, no story twists, no comedy, no irony, nothing.<br/><br/>And the new technology of making movies is awful. Its tolerable if human skin looks rather like marzipan. But its a huge problem when most faces are simply lifeless and unnatural. Even the main characters faces ! The only exception is Angelina Jolie, because she's the only one who kept mostly her original face.<br/><br/>Another thing which really nerved me was the absurd prudery of the movie. We see a man fighting naked, but somehow there is always something in the way that hides his penis. We get Angelina Jolie all naked, but she has breasts without nipples. If the creators of the movie didn't wanted to show naked people, they should have just kept their characters dressed, instead of such embarrassing trickery.<br/><br/>No recommendation. This picture wont make you want to poke out your eyes, but thats the best I can say about it."

If you have seen the preview, well, the heavy metal music is missing, otherwise it would at least have been a good music video clip.<br/><br/>Others have already spoken about the literary quality of this video clip (ie. it's hardly related to the poem), and you will only enjoy this one if you are willing to see a 100-min animation sequence as if cut from a computer game, waiting for the part when you can make something happen. This was boring. Anything the characters say is quite dull, and the action is so average that you are forced to notice the lengthy scenes without content. I have seen the German version, so I cannot comment on the words being in plain English (ie. not like the poem), but it was certainly not worth listening to these - overly predictable - developments.<br/><br/>The action, if that's what you want to call it, hardly makes up for the weak storyline (only the showdown I didn't regret watching, therefore 2 out of 10), mind you not of the medieval story but this Zemecki clip. This is among his weakest films."

","I've heard some say that starting with the silent movies at the beginning of the last century, the motion picture has finally reached its ultimate destination, in something like ""Beowulf"". I am inclined to share this view.<br/><br/>The bizaare merging of real life acting with animated screen presentation was fun as far as it went in ""Waking life"" (2001), particularly when it had Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy giving the craving audience another glimpse of Jesse and Celine, between ""Before sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before sunset"" (2004). But ""Waking life"" is true animation, by which I mean you see characters drawn the way they would appear in a comic book. <br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is an entirely different kettle of fish. In this ""animation"", they try to make the characters look as if they were real. Question: if I can see the real actors, why would I want to see their computer-generated replica? A general observation of the result: the men look almost real probably because of the effect of their beard, but the women look pathetically ""plastic"" (can't think of another way to describe how they look on screen).<br/><br/>As an animation heroic tale, ""Beowulf"" scores high. The entire story is shrouded in a gloomy Greek tragedy mood. The characters are larger than life ¬ñ tragic and flawed hero, blood-curdling and yet irresistible enchantress, lovely suffering queen, terrifying monsters, loyal comrade-in-arms. The action sequence produced by cutting edge technique is of course a visual treat. There is also excellent voice acting, particularly from Anthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone. In the end, however, I stand firm in that while I enjoy tremendously CGI action sequences, I prefer to see real actors. ""300"" is just fine but ""Beowulf"" has gone too far. But if people like Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich see a reason to lend their support to this project, what am I to say?"

","Beowulf (Winstone) comes to King Hrothgar's (Hopkins) lands to fight the monster Grendel.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. If you need to take a test on Beowulf, you best read the entire epic poem, or at the very least, find the Classic Comic Book (if it's still around) because Hollywood has done it again by deviating from the epic poem. So you will find very few answers in here. Yes, Woody Allen did tell Diane Keaton in Annie Hall that she should never take a course that makes you read Beowulf, but he should have also added ""or watch a movie that is historically incorrect.""<br/><br/>So what are we left with? Why the CGI, silly. And wasn't this what it was all about? Some even saw it in 3-D. Imagine that. I wasn't so lucky and had to watch the old fashioned way on a DVD without 3-D. Poor me. <br/><br/>The real winner here is the CGI. And, it was spectacular to say the very least. Yes, the acting was very good too, but the CGI was all of Oscar Worthiness. The cinematography rivaled Sin City, Bram Stoker's Dracula and the war scenes in Atonement. And, it must be assumed also that no CGI horses were harmed in any way in the filming of this movie. <br/><br/>Now for the flaw in the Hollywood version of the story. Grendel's Mother (Jolie) lets Beowulf rule for 50 years and then pulls everything away. Why? What did Beowulf do to have that happen to him? What was his sin? It was never explained. Of course, in the real epic poem, Grendel's Mother was defeated by Beowulf at the time Grendel was defeated so there was never anything given to Beowulf by Grendel's Mother. See? (There must be a Classic Comic around somewhere, maybe on Ebay.)<br/><br/>Yes, there was more cleavage going around than outright nudity in here. Angelina Jolie may have been fully naked, but there was nothing erotic about her. She was covered in a paint of some kind that had me looking to see what kind of paint was used. And, that could explain why the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Enjoy the CGI with or without the 3-D glasses. That is what it was all about. And, they are spectacular (with apologies to Seinfeld).<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Sex: Not really, Nudity: Yes, but not erotic, Language: No, did they know any language in the 500s?"
"CelluloidRehab","9","2","4","8 April 2008"," Helloh IMAX !
","Beowulf (if you have ever studied the English language you have probably been aware of the epic poem of the 8th Century and most likely already have read it) is the story of a 6th Century King (Hro√∞gar), who built a great hall (Heorot) that is attacked by Grendel. A young warrior from Geatland (Beowulf) hears of the incident and goes there to help. The second act is about Grendel's mother and the third act takes place many years later and involves a dragon. <br/><br/>This movie is rendered in 3 dimensional animation and looks incredibly amazing. Stupendously something something. You have to see it to believe it. True, it is not quite indistinguishable from ""real"" people on film, but animals and panoramic landscapes look just right. I think it is something in the eyes of the people, even with digital scans of the real actors, that gives them away. There is a sort of melancholic, sacrificial cow look to them as if there is no one home. There were several scenes where I was unsure if I was looking at photograph of the actor. I think that had to do more with the pose and that the eyes were not facing forward. The voice acting is very good and the confrontation scene between Beowulf and Grendel gave me goose pimples and I felt a shiver on the back of my neck. <br/><br/>Maybe it was the IMAX talking but I don't think I liked the movie as much visually if it wasn't in 3D. However, I actually found myself focused more on the story and my appreciation of it as a film increased when I saw it again on DVD. The IMAX version distracted with the 3D gimmickry, which at times is appealing and by the end quite tangible. On DVD, the magician's ""trick"" is revealed and now we have to focus on something else; the story.<br/><br/>This is a ""Wicked"" version of Beowulf as it differs from the poem and suggests that the characters existed and their life becomes the poem (the poem though fictional is based on actual historically known people). Many themes are touched upon: adultery, deception, the nature of a monster, bravery, a hero, sacrifice, death, life, guilt, temptation, glory, legacy, determination, lust, greed, envy, and legends. I think it works quite well and can be described as logical or at the very least plausible (for a universe where dragons, magic and monsters exist). <br/><br/>Some have compared this film to 300 and in some instances even surpassed it, however, I do not feel the same. Beowulf is by far the better movie. It takes artistic license with the original text only, where as 300 is based on Snyder's over the top interpretation of Frank Miller's sandal Dark Horse mini series based on the historical documents of the Battle of Thermopylae. You can see the derivation is diminishing the mixture. 300's ambiguous political message, CG blood-stain-proof bloodletting and hypocritical motivational speeches have been already over done in the last 20 years (Braveheart, Glory, and just about every football movie ever seen). 300 is a good movie (slightly better upon second viewing) but Beowulf is more original and captivating.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was something else entirely. Most theater experiences these days consists of frustration at the immaturity and gold fish attention spans that think going to the movies is synonymous with walking on the street. Also the products released these days are severely underwhelming and homogeneous. With the rise of home theaters, high resolution and large displays, more and more people are just staying home and watching DVDs (this also explains why DVDs come out a mere few months after the theatrical release, some going straight to DVD and others limited day-only-screenings on HDTV channels like Mojo or InHD). Perhaps this unusually energetic and participatory audience stirred some emotional connection, however small. Much like the world in 2000 AD (the comic) ours has become an automated gray limbo where all you care about is your next vice to make you feel something, anything.<br/><br/>Both versions appealed to me and I would put them on equal footing if not for the above recollection of my initial viewing. The IMAX version wins out slightly simple because of the spark that still exists in humanity. Even if it lasted for 1 second or the story ended in disappointment, it would have be sufficient for the price of admission. Don't skip this one."

","Ever since Robert Zemeckis pioneered the motion capture process with The Polar Express, its a style of film-making he seems completely enamoured with. Not only has he shot Beowulf in the same process, but his upcoming project, A Christmas Carol will be made the same way. Zemeckis has always been a man on the cutting edge of special effects technology, but it would be nice to see him make a film with flesh and blood actors again someday soon.<br/><br/>Still Zemeckis, great director that he is is equally at home in the world of the engineered as he is in the world of solid reality. And while Beowulf needn't necessarily have been done in motion capture, its another of Robert Zemeckis' good ones, and provides some truly superb special effects sequences.<br/><br/>Using a 3000 word poem as its source, it follows the tale of warrior Beowulf defending 6th Century Denmark from the monster Grendel. But what starts out as a straightforward fight becomes something deeply personal for Beowulf when he gets involved with Grendel's mother, played as a seductive and deadly creature by Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>With Robert Zemeckis at the helm, you can guarantee Beowulf will not just be a commercially inclined special effects vehicle. Zemeckis has a rare talent among American filmmakers where he uses special effects only as a tool, and not as a means to an end (Forrest Gump notwithstanding). The effects are so flawlessly integrated into the narrative that after a while you begin to forget they're even there. Zemeckis is wise in that he knows the actors' performances are the hook to hang the story from. Not the special effects.<br/><br/>And so it is with Beowulf. Zemeckis assembles a top-drawer cast of characters to breathe life into the epic tale. Hearing Beowulf speak in Ray Winstone's East End accent is initially off-putting, but you do eventually get used to it. And Winstone is quite excellent in the role. He brings the exact amount of cocksure cavalier attitude the role requires. Even when the weight of the entire kingdom is on his shoulders, you feel his burden.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is his usual reliable self as King Hrothgar. While not one of the truly great Anthony Hopkins performances, like Hannibal Lecter or Richard Nixon, he brings his trademark professionalism to the role, especially when his murky dealings with Grendel's mother come to light.<br/><br/>John Malkovich is effective in a small but necessary role as Unferth, Beowulf's one opponent to his presence there. Unferth suspects Beowulf is a teller of tales, especially when it comes to his exploits, and he's right. But when Beowulf wins his trust, Unferth's role in the film becomes more interesting when the kingdom comes under attack. He blindly follows Beowulf into battle, when really he could have used some of his earlier cynicism. And it proves his undoing.<br/><br/>But the scene stealer is Angelina Jolie, giving a brief but very impressive performance as Grendel's mother. She only gets one scene to strut her stuff, but what a scene it is! She emerges from a pool of water, stark nude and proceeds to seduce Beowulf's mind. Watching her peel away the layers of his defences is very unnerving. Speaking in an exotic tone. Appearing from the shadows and disappearing into them just as quickly, she holds a complete magisterial presence.<br/><br/>Its impressive the way Beowulf has come to kill this creature, and by the end of the scene, without even realising it, he's completely fallen for her. She carefully and sinuously twists and twirls her words around Beowulf like a web. Until he's practically at her beck and call. Even convincing him to have a new son with her, one that will pick up where Grendel left off. If you think Angelina Jolie is just a pretty face with an incredible body, watch Beowulf to see some very impressive acting ability on her part. Her finest role to date.<br/><br/>This being a Robert Zemeckis film, the special effects are expectedly excellent. But like The Polar Express, the whole process of motion capture still hasn't quite got the hang of emulating human facial responses. They've made notable leaps and bounds in the three years since, and Zemeckis has polished his act in the interim, but that deadness to the characters eyes is still there. They can keep refining they're technique, but I'm not sure if technology can ever completely mimic the spark of life present in a real human face.<br/><br/>But the backdrops of Beowulf are worth the price of admission alone. Zemeckis has created some truly stunning surroundings for you to enjoy. Mountain regions. Gorgeous horizons. And the camera enjoyably swoops and soars throughout. There's a particularly eye-popping scene from a bird's point of view, flying away from a village, further and further while trees, branches and bushes appear around all sides of the screen.<br/><br/>And Zemeckis doesn't disappoint on the action front either. Beowulf's fight with Grendel is rip-roaring stuff, although why Zemeckis has him naked at the time is anyone's guess. But its thrilling to watch, with the camera always on the move so every viewing reveals something new to you. The crowning glory of the entire movie comes in the final 15 minutes, when Beowulf must battle his own son to the death. A terrifying dragon he conceived with Jolie. Its one of the most pulse-pounding action scenes you'll ever see. Filled with hair-raising camera swoops, angles both claustrophobic and expansive, its one hell of a wild ride!<br/><br/>Beowulf is marred by a sometimes sluggish pace, but its a fine treatment of the poem. It has a nice structure, plenty of action, and interesting ambiguities too. Like the ending. Just as you think its all over, Grendel's mother shows up in the presence of Beowulf's friend, and leaves you with the absolute certainty that the chaos is about to start all over again.<br/><br/>Stirring score from Alan Silvestri too."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","4","11 February 2008"," Shrek with sex and violence (spoilers)
","I'm not quite sure what's up with Robert Zemeckis' animation fetish. First The Polar Express and now Beowulf (and in the future, A Christmas Carol). He seems to have got tired with any notion of reality, of the limitations that traditional film-making techniques put on him. After all, Beowulf could have been a live-action picture. With technology today, it wouldn't have been that difficult. But instead Zemeckis decided against pursuing that route.<br/><br/>This decision has both benefits and drawbacks. Yes the characters often move in a weird, jerky way and yes it's strange seeing animated versions of famous actors, but at the same time the fidelity to this technique gives you a certain purity of vision ¬ñ there's no awkward mixture of effects and reality; you either buy into this visualisation of the story or you don't. And to be honest, the technique never took me out of the film.<br/><br/>Well, okay, there was one thing that took me out of the film. The hero is played by Ray Winstone. Okay, that shouldn't affect me in any way ¬ñ he's a good actor. But the character here is ripped, whereas Ray is, well, fat. Everyone else looks like the actor who plays them, while Beowulf looks like Sean Bean. Weird.<br/><br/>But of course part of the point of filming the movie this way is to do things that you couldn't do in a normal film ¬ñ impossible camera shots, have fantastical beasts interact more easily with humans and have the characters age more convincingly. And there are some beautiful moments. There's one bit near the start where the King's hall is celebrating and dancing and you slowly move out of the building and across the snowy fields. But then the camera keeps moving. It keeps moving through forests and mountains until it comes to a cave. We then see the monster Grendel scream in pain. It's a flashy shot but it's also a great way of explaining the character ¬ñ the enjoyment of others, the pleasure this monster can never have, is what causes him pain.<br/><br/>And the monster is a pretty horrific creation. His screams are ear-splittingly loud and he cries like a child. But he also appears in the King's hall and rips men to pieces ¬ñ one even gets tossed in the air and lands on a spear. But worse than this, in a later scene, where Beowulf confronts the monster, he eats a soldier. For a while he stands there munching on the guy, a sad look on his face. Quite how this film got released as a 12A/PG-13, I don't know.<br/><br/>But the confrontation between Beowulf and Grendel is probably the best scene in the film. It's horrific, exciting and the monster's ultimate destruction (by Beowulf ripping its arm off) is also quite sad. As well as being fearsome, Grendel is also incredibly pathetic. He's a sad little child who is under the thumb of his demonic mother. And as Beowulf shouts at him while having him trapped, he can only whimper.<br/><br/>However, as well as all this, the scene is also amusing. Why, you ask? Well, for some reason, Beowulf decides he has to fight the monster naked. The explanation is something silly, like because the monster has no weapon he's going to fight it without weapons as well. But when he disrobes, women squeal in excitement. And to hide his dangly bits from the children who will doubtlessly be seeing this film, objects are always obscuring his genitals. The best example of this is when he stands on a table and approaches a sword that is implanted in the wood. Yes, he has a large sword. Yes, he's one hell of a man.<br/><br/>But there's actually plenty of sex in the film. Not only do you have a gnarly buff warrior disrobing so that he can go toe-to-toe with a monster, but you have the soldiers flirting with a maid with large knockers and Grendel's mother who has golden breasts. Fighting and shagging are the film's forte. And it's weird that Angelina, without the tats and with some shape brought back to her increasingly emaciated face, looks better here than she does in reality. No wonder so many Kings have been brought to their doom ¬ñ who wouldn't want to nail a demon with golden breasts and feet that are in the shape of high heels?<br/><br/>However, there's a high price to pay for nailing Grendel's mum. Her womb seems to be a bit messed up. One King gets a crying, ten-foot tall troll as a son and Beowulf gets a dragon. Yeah, that's a high price to pay for some sweet, sweet demon poontang.<br/><br/>The final action scene, where Beowulf fights the dragon, isn't as enjoyable as the scrap with Grendel, but it continues the theme of extreme violence. Not only does Beowulf hack off part of his own arm but he also reaches into the dragon's chest and rips its heart out. And we see this in close-up. Nice.<br/><br/>But although the violence is fun, I was more impressed with the atmosphere and the tension the film creates. Sure there are one too many cheap-shots ('we're going to show this film in 3-D, so let's just have things fly at the screen ad nausea; it'll be great!') and the sound is pumped up to 11, but the film is genuinely creepy in places, which pleased me a great deal. And I also like the theme that runs through the film of the importance of stories - how we need them to build heroes, heroes who make our normal lives more bearable. But with this you also have the poison of lies. Once we let them creep into our lives we'll always been enslaved to them. And with this in mind, I have to say that I enjoyed the open ending. Apparently the weakness of men is everlasting; poontang will ruin us all."

There are lots of moments of hysterical satire and hysterically bad lines of dialog (this is a movie you can laugh at and with). When the film isn't in motion the film often stalls in long long winded scenes of dialog that are just plain awful.(And yes it is possible to know what Neil Gaiman wrote, especially if you've read his paycheck comics and watched his earlier film adventures). Clearly the script was suppose to be a joke, but Zemekis didn't seem to notice and filmed it straight removing much of the humor along the way.<br/><br/>And thats the problem. Zemekis insistence on doing this as motion capture because ""it would cost too much as a live action film"" is what ruins the subtleties the script might have had (and is pure horse hockey since all monster and action stuff would have been CGI anyway). First off the most of the character animation sucks. The characters are pasty faced non-emotive automatons that go threw the motions. I felt I was watching the road company of the background characters from Shrek 3. The technique pretty much prevents any sort of real performance with the exception of Ray Winstone and Anthony Hopkins.(John Malkovich gives a performance but its so bizarre as to classified as a knowing joke). Robin Wright Penn's character-vital to the story- is so stiff (in every sense of the word) that it looks embalmed. The animation is often worse than any big budget computer game, and worse than whats coming out of Japan or out of many film studios effect houses.<br/><br/>Another major problem (especially in 2D where the visuals don't distract you from the many flaws) is the damned choral score which is repetitive to the point of making you want to commit suicide. Its ten times worse than any video game ear worm you've ever heard and been scared by.<br/><br/>There are some great sequences as I said. the action scenes are spectacular with Beowulf's sea battle and dragon battle being the very very bloody highlights. They are the reasons the film might have a life on DVD and cable, since flat or 3D they are way cool.<br/><br/>Two other points I think I should mention.<br/><br/>First clearly there is something wrong when this film is PG13 and Tekkonkinkreet is R. Grendel is far more bloody and sexually (both straight and gay) in your face that the animated film from Japan.If you want to see the effect of a big studio on the ratings board this is it. Honestly many ""bloody"" horror films don't have this much blood. The fights in this film are bloody and disgusting and make you wonder about the ratings board.(This is a really really bloody movie) Secondly anyone else but me feel that Grendel is throw back to the old days where mentally or physically handicapped people were to be locked up in the attic and feared because they were different? Come on strip away the monstrous size and fact that by the time we meet him, Grendel has gone insane from being locked in a cave, he is a ""special needs"" child gone bad. Its sad.<br/><br/>When I saw this is 3D I was less critical because of the visual effects but it still didn't make it really a batter film, just one where the flash hides the flaws. So as a 3D film the effects will make the action scenes enough of a thrill ride to get past the deadly slow talky bits-so it 6 out 10 as 3D As a 2D film where nothing is in your face and it all looks odd 3 to 4 out of 10, with a couple of great action scenes that are great regardless of flat or multi dimensional. Unfortunately the talky bits make it very tough going with out the gee whiz of the 3D.<br/><br/>Lastly, this and the 3D process are being hailed by some as the future of movies; If this is the future of movies we all deserve to go blind."

","I didn't get to see Beowulf in 3D and I still loved it.<br/><br/>I didn't go expecting much, but I knew I'd enjoy it on some levels. I love animated films and I love movie monsters. Can't go far wrong here.<br/><br/>I can see what's wrong with it. The characters lacked depth, as did the story. The movie had no meaning or flow. It was very much animation for the sake of animation and blood, gore and sex as much as the rating would allow. And it really is filled to the brim. But that's why it was good, it was exciting, because this isn't what you expect from a 12A... or an animated movie. <br/><br/>When I watched this film I was keeping an eye on a noisy group of boys who'd come to see it and amongst the giggles there was stunned silence. The sexuality isn't such that younger viewers will miss, it's blatant, crude and shocking.<br/><br/>Grendel was truly scary, there are 2 fantastic scenes where he simply butchers everyone in his path and it's one of the most visually exciting things I've seen in the cinema this year (after the maelstrom scene in Pirates 3). He's probably the character with the most depth in the film too, he's not only scary to look at... but he's emotionally terrifying, out of control and filled with sorrow. His screams will send shivers down your spine.<br/><br/>If you're impressed by computer animation and enjoy chaotic action/horror sequences, you'll love this. Might be a bit much for some timid kids, but I'd have LOVED this even more when I was younger."
"Nemeszisz","5","2","4","22 December 2007"," A bit disappointment!
","I saw this movie and I couldn't decide whether this movie deserves to be speak of or not. Well I'm damn sure it is worth! But not because it's good but rather disappointing. As a matter of fact it is a failure. When I looked through the cast I thought OK, my favorite actor Sir Anthony Hopkins took part in this, it must have been good. And the plot was all right. But I was wrong. Besides its unique 3D graphic, the hole movie is a clich√© which is took part in the medieval Denmark. The same old story: a kingdom needs to be saved from an evil demon, of course the hero will arrive soon after the terrifying massacre. Yes! Very original and it is very very astonishing that the king has got filthy background. Returning scenes does not very various neither the characters speeches. After a dozen ""I'm Beowulf, the mighty and the cool guy"" I was a little bit annoyed. Actors are professionals, it was a routine job for Sir Hopkins and Angelina Jolie, but nothing significant. The directing was proper too, I think the mistake was committed in the screenplay.<br/><br/>However the reason why I gave it 5/10 is the graphic and one symbol: Grendel is freak and evil monster, also the son of the king, but Beowulf's son is a mighty, pure but also an evil dragon. Their sons refer to their real personalities, which are not so noble. I think this is mentionable, but it clears up during the movie."

","To say that I was keen to see this movie is an understatement. I had to take a bus, subway, commuter train, cross the border to Hong Kong, take the KCR, the MTR then finally a shuttle bus just to see this movie in IMAX+3D+ English.<br/><br/>So was it worth it? Well I can say this movie was so exciting that my friend went in with perfect stocking and by the end of the movie they were full of holes (and I am a perfect gentleman, so it was the excitement of the movie and not me that did it).<br/><br/>Beowulf is an old English poem (which is in fact a Germanic language) and often talked about but few people have read it (those that have generally don't seem to like this movie, but...given the sort of people that read only English poetry this is not surprising).<br/><br/>Anyway, Beowulf (which I believe means Bear Wolf) must first kill a monster named Grendle, and having done that must also kill it's mother. This second element makes Beowulf stand out in heroic epics and provides the meat for the re adaption of this story. <br/><br/>This movie is based on the poem and the legend, it both tries to add realism and humanity to the characters as well as confront the nature of heroism. <br/><br/>What do we end up with is this.<br/><br/>1. A well made and interesting story that works both as a classic tale and modern (or post modern) epic. 2. A combination of amazing animation for the faces and really terrible animation for the movement (seriously it is like watching the original supermario brothers act). 3. The best dragon ever...personally I have never been satisfied by the dragons in movies, but finally I have found one that I like. 4. A movie that is made for 3-D, I don't think the 3D is worth it, but I doubt that the movie would stand up to a 2D viewing. Plus 3D is fun, especially when it looks like monster saliva is going to land on your lap.<br/><br/>My final comment is this, it is an exciting modern tale based on, but updating a classic tale."
"guyfromjerzee","9","2","4","17 December 2007"," A very pleasant surprise!
","Take it from me. This is not the type of film I usually flock to see. For one thing, it's animated. I'm not one of these adults who likes to flaunt about being a kid at heart. Call me close-minded, but I prefer seeing REAL people with REAL facial expressions. Second of all, ""fantasy"" is not exactly my favorite genre. I'm a big advocate of realism in movies. I'd much rather watch an indie film where characters sit in cafes and bars, and just ramble on about the mundane details of life than watch the next special effects spectacular. Until this day, I haven't seen one ""Lord of the Rings"" film. Normally, the minute I see anything too out of ordinary in a film, my mind starts to wander and I become disconnected from it.<br/><br/>Therefore, I'm pleading with people--please, please, please go see this film! I don't normally go on and on about a film's special effects. To me, what's the use of effects when...they look like effects? Watching ""Matrix Reloaded"" is the equivalent of watching two coats of paint dry in my opinion. ""Beowulf,"" on the other hand, is one of the few films I can think of that uses special effects for GOOD! The animation is absolutely incredible. There are moments in the film where I forget I'm watching a piece of animation, because the characters are soooo lifelike. I know I complained previously about animated characters not showing a range of facial expressions. Not in this case. It's incredible how the emotions of the real actors were able to get converted into animation. It's so complex that I wouldn't be surprised if Anthony Hopkins gets an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film.<br/><br/>I will preface that I saw this film in 3D. I'm sure the regular version will be enjoyable as well, but Robert Zemeckis took full advantage of the 3D technology, truly making you feel like you're part of this world. This is not like back in the days when occasionally you'd see some creature's arms stretch towards you, and that would be the extent of the 3D. There's a moment where Beowulf is about to get his crotch impaled, and I found myself almost gasping (I'm a guy, of course). It doesn't hurt that we get to see a very lifelike replication of Angelina Jolie strutting around almost naked during her every scene.<br/><br/>Now, for all you parents out there, DO NOT take your young ones. I find it funny that the movie is virtually being promoted as a kiddie flick. If this were R-rated, I would classify it as a hard R. I can't come up with any sort of explanation as to why this gory, gruesome film was awarded a PG-13 rating, other than....it's animated. I guess you can get away with a lot more with animated violence. Don't quote me on that, though. We're treated to such images as a monster getting stabbed in the eye and a heart getting torn out. Yet a movie with 10 uses of the F-word gets an R-rating. The MPAA is on crack. It's official.<br/><br/>If I have to make any mild criticism, it's that Robin Wright Penn's character looks a bit too cartoonish and flat. Ray Winstone has a great and powerful voice, and lends it well to the main character. I just find it funny that his character was the only one that had no resemblance to him. His character is tall, muscular, and handsome--the exact opposite of the real life Winstone. I liked the performances for the most part. Some have said that John Malkovich was pretty awful. I disagree. I thought he played a great heavy, as he always does. I suggest everyone checks this movie out in theaters, though. As big of a cinephile as I am, I don't usually urge people to see films on the big screen. To me, if a film is truly great, you can watch on your laptop or your I-Pod and still enjoy it just as much. ""Beowulf"" NEEDS to be seen on the big screen. It is not just a movie. It is an experience!"
"fantasyescapist","Null","2","4","6 December 2007"," An unintentionally funny film with a about average plot but very good SFX if that matters to you ...
","I just wondered when I saw this whether it was meant to be a comedy or not, but I give it that it was entertaining in a way.<br/><br/>The story about the hero - who is obviously the title character - slays a monster Grendwald and weirdly enough talks with an unintentionally funny strong cockney accent, voiced and motion captured from Ray Winstone.<br/><br/>The has to be one of the most sexual 12A films I've seen, so parents, you've been warned. There are moments of horror which scared a bit(but it was more bizarre or creepy really), and even if the first part was weak and I was fighting sleep, the heroic ending with our hero who redeems himself is at least worth viewing, even if it does look like something I've seen before somewhere ...<br/><br/>Yeah, the effects are like the standard XBox 360/PS3 stuff now, and while some characters looked very real, like Anthony Hopkin's character, others were obviously computer animated, like some of the women. In other words, the tech is yet to be absolutely perfected.<br/><br/>The music in it is quite good(I liked a few songs Robin Wright Penn sang), but I don't think this is worth money to pay to see, though, as you could be very disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, a big epic that suffers from some dodgy dialogue and plot but has great special effects that will probably please some in need of something that looks flashy and impressive. See with caution."
"DoctorStrangelove","9","2","4","3 December 2007"," Lives up to the hype.
","I saw ""Beowulf"" in IMAX 3-D... and at the risk of sounding like a teenager, I just gotta say: it was, like, totally awesome! Not a life-changing experience, mind you - and I'm sure the 3-D would've been more effective if I'd been in the center of the theater - but no matter how you slice it, this is one of the best movie events of the year. Although it's possibly just as good (and certainly cheaper) if you see the regular 2-D version.<br/><br/>The CGI is better than ever, although you may not be able to forget the film's animated (which could be by design - it's nearly aware of its own legend status) and you will certainly NOT forget that it is PG-13. ""Beowulf"" never devolves into anything dirty - there are some metaphors and double entendres (kids won't catch these; some adults in our packed theater clearly didn't) but there's nothing as offensive as what you'd find in a rated-R comedy. There are a couple of bare male rears and a pseudo-nude CGI Angelina Jolie for a minute or so... which didn't look very realistic. It was like an extraterrestrial's rendering of the perfect woman - beautiful, yes, but artificial (which would make sense, story-wise). More like a drawing from an anatomy textbook than a living human.<br/><br/>There's some good humor, and the action is simply unbelievably cool - this is one area where the 3-D might have played a major part. Take my word for it - as in ""300"", when it comes to manly men doing manly things, this movie lets it all hang out and does its fair share of earning its violence rating. Grendel is horrible, pitiable and looks amazing - as does the dragon. The battles are as epic, swooping and visually eye-popping as the best parts of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy... you simply need to see for yourself. Just keep in mind that this is all about legends, glamour and exaggeration, and you'll have a total blast.<br/><br/>9/10 -- a big BIG recommend."
"JulianMHall","9","2","4","2 December 2007"," Excellent in parts
","Overall superb. The screenplay and adaptation of this well known classic was superb. I watched the 2D version and was *not* disappointed in any of that side of things.<br/><br/>The core element is of course the animation, the CGI. Contrary to what others have said. I found the long shots (at least of countryside and buildings) more convincing than the close shots. As one reviewer commented, while the close-up shots of people are very good I was never able to forget it was CGI. They still cannot do eyes properly, and fluid effects such as water, nor volumetrics such as flames. Thankfully, for certain scenes, they *can* do fog - a fact I was extremely grateful for when Beowulf decided to strip off.<br/><br/>There were some unnecessary errors in the CGI which really ought to have been caught before final rendering.<br/><br/>Examples: Grendel's mother was supposed to be a naked water devil in human form - yet whoever did the CGI forgot to omit the *high heels* Angelina Jolie was presumably wearing for the test shots. Secondly the scene where Beowulf was crowned. Who made the schoolboy howler that the crown was wider than his ears but still somehow stayed on??<br/><br/>Then there were the accents. Oh dear the accents. Why oh why do modern directors not care about accents?? Hrothgar was not born in West Wales (Sir Anthony should know better) nor was Beowulf born within the sound of Bow Bells.<br/><br/>I must disagree though with the reviewer who said Angelina Jolie was poor in this respect. At one point I caught an *American* accent from Robin Wright Penn, yet Angelina Jolie did at least try and IMHO succeeded, in giving her character an appropriate accent. Be honest, do we know how a water demon would speak? No of course not, so Jolie made the accent for us, and IMHO did an extremely good job.<br/><br/>Conversely, do we know the accent humans spoke in that region? Yes, we do. Although we cannot know precisely we *can* say it is likely to be close to the accent today. The actors portraying humans dropped the ball far more heavily than Angelina Jolie IMHO.<br/><br/>John Malkovich. I had problems. Possibly because I watched him in Johnny English a couple of days ago. Also because I loved the LOTR movies directed by Peter Jackson. Unferth came over as a cross between Pascal Sauvage and Wormtongue as portrayed by Brad Dourif. Not really as good as either. The accent was questionable as was the portrayal, although I have to admit that the sequence where he offered his sword to Beowulf was excellent.<br/><br/>The monster Grendel. Disappointing visually. Although he is supposed to be a hybrid of human/demonic coupling it just looked like the Hollow Man half way through a change. I wasn't convinced of it being a viable creature - I wasn't even really convinced of it being a monster - it was more how Mary Shelley describes Frankenstein's creation than the organic result of mating between a demon and a human. I would at least have expected it to have a tail as its' mother did (on that note why the hell is Jolie's tail coming out of her head, and not the traditional place the small of her back? No creatures in Nature have tails coming out of their heads. It looked wrong). The characterisation of Grendel though was excellent, again hearkening to Frankenstein's monster, but in this case he is poisoned not by the prejudices of man, but by the desires and wilful nature of his mother. In this I agree that he is to some extent pitiable and pathetic.<br/><br/>Finally, the rating. Oh yes the 12A rating. Not for the first time I wonder who is in control at the BBFC? The film makers wanting to maximise 'bums on seats' or the BBFC wanting to protect young minds from the more adult content of movies? Somebody needs to rewrite the rules, because 'animation' is now at a level where the violence and depiction of it, is close enough to reality to make no difference. They've made worse mistakes before - Star Wars Ep III - Anakin having his legs chopped off and being burned to a crisp.. a 12? I think not! Incidentally I'm 37 and by no means a prude.<br/><br/>Verdict. A very enjoyable and entertaining movie, Not perfect, but then so few things are it's worth enjoying the ones that come closest. This is one of them. Not one to take a 12 year old child to though, even accompanied by an adult."
"sviastoslav","8","2","4","30 November 2007"," Interesting take on the ""classic""
","This movie is not a faithful rendering to the book; in fact, I don't think it was meant to be. Instead, the producers wanted to make a story about stories, how stories were made and told. Some people criticize this movie for distorting the ""classic"", but we must remember that the book was itself a nexus between oral poetry and written text. Much has changed: Beowulf changed from something spoken and heard to something that you can read in your room (or back then, a manuscript in the monastery). And now Beowulf is something you can watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>So this movie is about how myths are told and passed down, from one storyteller to another, from the book to Hollywood. Zemeckis is pretty good at mixing genres and poking fun at them, for example Back to the Future III. This movie does just that - it makes fun of the search for the ""authentic"".<br/><br/>Great cast - most of the characters are able to escape stereotypes, they have subtle personalities and it's interesting to see how they change through the movie. Beowulf is sort of a bully-like hero, and you actually feel sorry for Grendel, who unleashes his attack, Revenge of the Nerds style, on the human frat parties. Malkovich did a great job, interesting intermediary between being pagan and Christian. Angelina Jolie plays Grendel's milf, quite creepy.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie (for the above reasons), even though it might scare little kids and disappoint the Old English Literature (Beowulf-is- written-by-Homer-or-Shakespeare) fan club. But hey, watching a movie is supposed to be fun: thinking is optional."
"andell","7","2","4","28 November 2007"," Impressive in 3D, but why not use live action film?
","Beowulf has the distinction, at least in my memory, of being the sole Hollywood release that has been filmed entirely in 3D. Unfortunately it is also filmed in a form of animation that seems to exist between both the live action and animated elements of film making. Given the advancement of visual effects, why the film wouldn't take part in a live action element seems to be contradictory- live action film would undoubtedly require more sets and such, but the fact that the film is in 3D disputes the entire idea that the film making was lazy.<br/><br/>In fairness, the film ""Beowulf"" pretty accurately follows the myth of Beowulf. To clarify, a Danish kingdom is cursed by a sinister creature named ""Grendel."" The King of the Kingdom (Anthony Hopkins) is obviously the father of ""Grendel,"" and the mother of Grendel is a ""water demon."" After a vicious attack on the new Hall, the building is securely locked up until Beowulf and his men come as heroes to slay the beast. Beowulf kills Grendel by ripping his arm off, which sends Grendel's mother into a rage. The morning after his success, Beowulf awakes in the hall to find that all but one of his men have been dispatched (presumably by Grendel's mother) and hung up in the ceiling.<br/><br/>After this outrage, Beowulf travels to a nearby cave to slay Grendel's mother. Of course this doesn't happen- Grendel's mother seduces Beowulf into giving her another son, and in turn she has given him long lasting strength, a kingdom (he inherits it after Anthony Hopkins throws himself off a cliff), a Queen who he has longed after since arriving, and so on. The one limitation is that his good fortune will only last as long as a golden horn remains in the cave.<br/><br/>Fast forward many years, with a much older Beowulf, who has a dilemma when the slave of a Priest finds the golden horn and brings it out to the kingdom. With the golden horn brought out, Beowulf's son (a dragon) arrives to unleash another hell onto the Kingdom.<br/><br/>In the spirit of a happy ending, the dragon is slain, however in the spirit of a disjointed conclusion, Grendel/Dragon's mother arrives on the scene to try and seduce the new King of the Kingdom. This is where the film ends.<br/><br/>The IMAX 3D is the only way to see this film, and it is definitely worth watching for this angle. However I don't recommend it in a regular theater- my rating with go from 7/10 to 5/10."
"oleandervyce","6","2","4","23 November 2007"," Not So Epic
","Honestly I didn't go to this movie expecting it to be a masterpiece. That would have been pointless--sort of like everyone who went to 300 thinking it would be an actual quality film.<br/><br/>Of course Hollywood had to skew the original tale of Beowulf, so I won't even go in to that. Creative license and all, and really, the story line was the least of this film's problems. My biggest beef was with the use of 3D. Really, if you're going to go all-out with 3D effects, at least try and be creative. In this case, it worked entirely against the movie.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins looked like Anthony Hopkins. Grendel's mother looked like Angelina Jolie. I have to wonder then, what is the bloody point? Why not just film the actors since you're not going to take any artistic liberties with the character designs save hair and some costumes? Moreover, why were we stuck looking at Angelina Jolie the entire time instead of actually getting a glimpse of what her true form was? Additionally, as others have mentioned, most of the movie felt like you were watching cut scenes from a PC game. The animation on the humans was incredibly stiff in a lot of parts. For such high-end graphics, this film did a very, very poor job.<br/><br/>Finally, I found it very difficult to sympathize with Beowulf at all. His character flip-flopped between being the great hero and the weasely old man trying to redeem himself. A shame, really.<br/><br/>I'll give them a six for effort."

"aboudiom","9","0","0","18 June 2020"," A cynical view of the hero myth
","This movie is a strange case in cinema, It's kind of a forgotten movie in most cases due to it's animation that ranges from uncanny to so bafflingly human. And even when it is spoken of in good it's mostly recommended as a fun enjoyable ride despite how actually depressing and cynical this movie is with yes its fleeting moments of hope. But my God those silences those looks in their eyes.<br/><br/>This movie is separated in two and so will be this review<br/><br/>So the first half of the movie is the weakest part even though in my opinion not by a long shot but it is clearly the more traditional heroic tale of the two parts, and for a good reason. A kingdom is in celebration a monster crashes the party and terorizes the kingdom and Beowulf the blond handsome and mighty comes to town and saves the day by killing the monster in honor of his papa's friendship with the king. Typical hero story isn't it? Yet throughout it there is a profound underlying cynicism to it. King Hrothgar is a vane old drunken fool who thinks about nothing but money and drinks. Beowulf is an egotistical lying a**hole who is more preoccupied with forging his legend than anything even if he has to embelish reality or lie about his exploits. Grendel the monster instead of roaring and intimidating constantly wails and is misshapen as if he was in constant suffering and merely existing was a punishement yet him the ""mosnter"" spare the king. Beowulf fight the monster buck naked and is more animalistic and monstruous than the monster itself but it's not until Beowulf go fights Grendel's mother that the movie truly starts to reveal itself. One exchange of looks it's all it took for human failure to be shown bare. In that very precise moment the movie stops pretending and stares you down ast it talks to you of the failure of the heroic myths suddenly all the characters grow out of their clich√©s all of them become nuanced and complex. Beowulf becomes a man faced with his failure but still clinging on to the falsehood of the hero yet his new responsibilities consequence of his lies awaits him. King Hrothgar becomes this broken man haunted by his errors yet there is a wisdom that he gained from all his errors and after seeing the failure of Beowulf he decides to leave the stage and an age that he is not fit for anymore instead of being swallowed by it he decides to leave on his own terms and that is goddamn depressingly beautiful. Grendel becomes this poor creature damned by his own birth suffering constantly by merely existing yet he spares his father partly as an act of vengeance but also because deep down he knows that his father is his only link to his hummanity. Grendel's mother becomes the bringer of temptation a grieving mother and a creature simply trying to survive. And as Hrothgar leaves the stage so does the twilight of the age of heroes start its end.<br/><br/>The second half of this movie is a masterclass and fully utilizes the first half to its advantages despite being initially jarringby the sheer amount time passed in one sequence. The age of heroes is at its end and time has taken its toll. Beowulf is now a legendary invincible hero king famous throughout and revered throughout the land. He is old and tired more wise with the years and sees the vanity and futility of war and legends. He is no more the arrogant man and is starting to be done pretending to be a hero. It takes Wiglaf his most trusted friend and the shining ray of good human nature to make him work up the courage for one last time to be a hero. This time a true one, one who faces his mistakes head on and sacrifices himself for the sake of others and as he lays on the beach the dragon he has slayn taking on the form of a golden man he recoginses and accepts his son and his mistakes. In his last action he does as a simple man he becomes a true hero and in his dying breath he asks Wiglaf, his friend, for one thing no more lies this time. Wiglaf is in my opinion the heart and true hero of the story honest honorable and loyal he sees the flaws in his friend yet recognises the necessity of the hero myth as a way of inspiring the new generation and constantly urges his friend to be better. In a story that is more and more depressing he is a shining ray of light yet as his friend ends the age of heroes by killing the last dragon and simply asks for the end of lies, Wiglaf lies. He depicts at what should have been the funerals of a man the tale of Beowulf the hero king without fear the invicible, the infaillible, the flawless. And then as the body of Beowulf is taken by the seas in his drakkar the Ogress comes and kisses his dead body. Intrigued Wiglaf comes to the edge of the sea. That silence, that deafening defeating silence, all it took was an exchange of looks. You wish for him to not be tempted to be better but you cannot fool yourself. This is all beyond us it has always been beyond us oh so beyond our comprehension. We are only human we are faillible and you are next."

By far the funniest part was when he fought Grendel naked and he was always positioned in a way where something was covering his junk."

"davidmvining","7","0","0","22 November 2019"," A compelling dramatization of a thesis paper, not a poem
","In the original epic poem, why does Beowulf come back from defeating Grendel's mother carrying Grendel's head? It's an interesting question that has fired literary critics imaginations for a while, and when Robert Zemeckis set out to make his big screen adaptation of the poem, he went beyond merely adapting the text itself. Instead, he took those questions that critics had considered and ran with them dramatically.<br/><br/>So, what we end up having isn't so much an adaptation of Beowulf, but an adaptation of a master's thesis on Beowulf.<br/><br/>The movie received mixed to positive reviews when it came out. A lot of the negativity seemed connected to the movie's visual style. Expanding what he had done on The Polar Express, Zemeckis used motion capture and computer animation to get realistic-ish looking characters. The problem is that the characters exact right in the middle of the Uncanny Valley. They are too real to treat as cartoons, but not real enough to convince the mind that they are real, so there's a natural barrier that's created because the brain knows it's not real despite a somewhat realistic looking appearance. I was more okay with the look of the film upon its initial release, but less so now.<br/><br/>I understand, though, why Zemeckis was enamored with the technique. The freedom as a filmmaker to build the environments he wanted and place the camera wherever he wanted must have been quite enticing. The problem was the effort at getting photo-realistic effects, which end up falling short. A more cartoonish look might have been less jarring for the audience.<br/><br/>Moving on, though, the movie's approach to the material, as implied, is really smart. It's not just a monster movie, but an exploration of bravery, heroism, and the costs of power. It takes a different approach than the original poem, but that's fine by me. The seduction of power, and the literal seduction of Grendel's mother, is an interesting approach to take, and I think it works really well. Beowulf must sell his soul to achieve power, but when the bill comes due he doesn't lay down like Hrothgar did. He fights. He reclaims his honor and sense of bravery by having a spectacle infused fight with a dragon. It's a sop to modern movie convention, but it's still fun on its own while refusing to undermine the basic point of the story.<br/><br/>Performances, which you mainly need to judge by voices since the faces do have a plastic-like feel that they movie can't escape, are very good. I can see why Zemeckis wanted to cast Ray Winstone as Beowulf because he carries a gravelly voice that matches the vision of the character perfectly, but Winstone is, at the same time, not a body builder with 8 pack abs. Brendan Gleeson is wonderful as Wiglaf, the sad advisor, Anthony Hopkins is wise, sad, and guilt-ridden as Hrothgar, and Angelina Jolie is pure seduction as Grendel's mother. Special nod to Crispin Glover as Grendel, speaking Old English and evoking quite a bit of emotion as a monstrous creature with inside out ears."

","24 November 2007. Theatrical animation technology has finally reached the dilemma point of having to push ahead towards replacing live action film or retain its distinctive animated nature. Not since the ill-fated FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN (2001) has animation taken the realistic leap into recreating real life forms. Unfortunately, while the creative innovations are used here, they are used inconsistently, with glimpses of the great potential that animated technology can have in delivering an amazing cinematic experience. The qualitative inconsistency between the male and female characters where many of the male characters have rich, densely, layered human appearances, most of the delicate females seem artificial and incomplete for the most part. Even the Angelina Jolie's character, sometimes sumptuously rich, will in the same scene alternate between a realistic image of a creature to just a caricature. The plot outline also has a number of weaknesses, particularly how the Queen's character was not realistically portrayed either she had contemporary morality of faithfulness that didn't match that of the times or would accept later the sharing of her husband. The recovery of a special, cherished item was also mysterious. While there will fabulous animated scenes that clearly justified animation, there were also several scenes that just seemed awkward in the use of animation. The spawn creature was also not fully developed and its relationship to its maker wasn't fully captured on screen. This movie does deserve credit for being a morality tale that isn't what the American audience is used to. Unfortunately, the potential of animation was touched but not fully executed to its greatest effect. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","This was a good representation of the book of Beowulf. However there were a few things in the movie that are different from the book. Like how Grendal kills many men instead of just one as in the original text. Also in the movie Beowulf kills the dragon differently then how the book describe it. Also Beowulf and the dragon are buried in the book. And lastly in the book of Beowulf there is no golden dragon horn.

"qatmom","3","0","0","26 October 2012"," Tedious
","Anyone who sets out to write fantasy (and that is what Beowulf is) should find a copy of Ursula LeGuin's essay from ""Elfland to Poughkeepsie"". One of the points she makes is that characters in such tales should NOT speak like contemporary Americans--they should not use slang or phrases that will distract the gentle reader (or viewer) from the fantasy universe.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of bad written fantasy suffers from reading like an adventure lived by American teenagers in costume; the really foul stuff even uses contemporary slang. Some of it sells quite well to an unsophisticated readership.<br/><br/>Watching Beowulf was misery, because it was full of Americans delivering their lines like Americans in costume. I just could not believe these were Nordic guys living the Northern Thing, with dragons and swords. Most of the characters were completely unconvincing, as were their wigs.<br/><br/>The dragon...o dear gawd...reminded me of the dragon Ollie from Kukla, Fran & Ollie.<br/><br/>I stuck it out to the end, but it was painful. Much of it looked like it had filmed the first time the actors tried out their lines, and that they had not yet rehearsed together.<br/><br/>It takes more than action scenes and CGI to make a movie worthwhile."
"whittmarine","8","0","0","13 July 2012"," To enjoy, you must be in the correct frame of mind
","MINOR SPOILERS! Nothing too serious.<br/><br/>As stated above, you need to understand what the creators of this film were attempting. This is not a realistic retelling of the tale (Beowulf and Grendel), nor is it just a cheesy action flick (Christopher Lambert's Beowulf). It's not a straight-up film adaptation, or a character study (most of you are out the door at this point). This is an analysis on the creation and destruction of heroes and villains. They just used Beowulf, Grendel and the others involved most likely because it is the most significant.<br/><br/>For Beowulf, the character, three different aspects show how the creation (or destruction) of a hero can happen. The first, and most obvious, is the storyteller's creative liberties. As is expected, the original tale is elaborated on to make the hero's dealings greater than they actually were. The second is satanic (or evil, if you wish) dealings. Beowulf becomes wealthy and world-famous due to mystical means, often times used to create villains, but shows that it's not always the case. The third is religion (true or false, it matters not for the sake of the film). As its influence spreads, the older beliefs and icons must be either destroyed or reshaped (meaning the said religion could have either destroyed Beowulf's tale, which gave strength to the older ones, or they could reshape it to fit their own religion, which gives strength to their own following).<br/><br/>As one aware of Beowulf's tale should know, it's not just about the hero but the villains he faces, and they are taken into account as well. For Grendel, his turn to malicious means is due solely to pain. The pain of his existence, and the pain of knowing that others are out there that are not suffering as he is. The mother's nature is due to both revenge (which is of course expected) and justification (Beowulf broke the deal, ergo she can do as she wishes). And the dragon is not so much evil by nature, but by nurture (he only does what he is told, we can presume).<br/><br/>The above was really for the nay-sayers of the film. Everything else in the film is quite strong. The visual effects are gorgeous (save for dead-pan eyes), the acting is amazing, and the action is awesome. I saw this in 2D, which for the most part is fine, although there were a couple of shots here and there that were obviously meant to show off the 3D.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a VERY good film, but you HAVE to look at it for what it is, and not what it's based on. Otherwise, haters are just gonna hate."
"pontifikator","7","0","0","19 June 2012"," CGI characters and sets well-used for the story
","Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this is a ""performance capture"" film. It stars performances by Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, and Crispin Glover. Oh, and Angelina Jolie. <br/><br/>Performance capture, also known as motion capture, basically means the actors wear skin tight clothes with markers on them and act in front of a green screen. Later, computers render the performance digitally, with costumes, sets, and even the characters created by algorithms. For some people, this is a killer, and they can't accept the movie as a movie. I have some agreement with this. Wright Penn's character, Wealthow, was a blank for me. Whatever expression the actress gave the character, it never showed on the CGI face. Brendan Gleeson's Wiglaf, on the other hand, was totally credible throughout. <br/><br/>But you must know that the sets, the costumes, the scenery, and the characters are all generated on computer and do not look photorealistic at all. My perspective was that I was watching a comic book playing out on the screen, with excellent illustrations and an actual story. In one scene, we see a dragon swimming underwater, breathing fire and making the water boil around its mouth - I thought this was excellent. The fantasy aspects of ""Beowulf"" worked wonderfully. But when the characters talked, the motions and facial expressions weren't real, and often I had no feeling that the characters were walking on whatever surface they were supposed to be on. Overall, I was not so distracted from it to have it spoil the story for me. And ""Beowulf"" certainly tells a story.<br/><br/>Scriptwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary took liberties with the original story, an ancient English heroic poem of uncertain date and origin. I've read a translation of the poem, and the movie does not follow it too closely, but the screenplay is epic in itself and worked well for me. Scholars may be disappointed, but movie goers will not be. This is an action drama, with enough emphasis on character, loss, flaw, and disappointment to keep the adults in attention.<br/><br/>Because the movie is computer generated, the art aspects of the movie can really come to the fore. I did not feel ever that the performance capture aspects were used as tricks; Zemeckis kept the story in the forefront, with the animation as the servant of the story at all times. Both the old king (Hrothgar, played by Hopkins) and Beowulf (Winstone) had their flaws; no comic book (nor Old English, neither) heroes they. The artwork surrounding the characters was outstanding, in my very humble opinion, and added to the feel of the story.<br/><br/>I am a great fan of illustration, and I saw the movie as excellent illustration with very credible plot and characters. It has great action, although some may find the gore a bit much in the battle scenes. Because the performances are in computer, I think the scenes are more realistic than live action battles, and this realism may be disturbing to those that are disturbed by such things - you know who you are.<br/><br/>Glover performs as Grendel, and he gives a very interesting performance, taking Grendel far afield from the epic poem by making Grendel a touch more human than monster.<br/><br/>A couple of notes: Beowulf and his kin are not being called ""geeks"" in the movie; they are ""Geats,"" natives of a no longer extant kingdom somewhere in Scandinavia. The most feared animals in Europe during the Dark Ages were bears. As was common among unschooled folk, it was considered bad luck even to say the word bear, so other terms were made up. In England, the common word was ""brown,"" the color of the unnameable, which at the time was pronounced ""bruin."" In Scandinavia, bears were referred to as bee-wolves, a word combination having no meaning on its own now called a kenning. The Scandinavian spelling of bee-wolf was - you guessed it - Beowulf. So our hero is a bear, the most fearsome creature on the continent. The characters refer occasionally to their worship of Odin. Gaiman has written a novel called ""American Gods,"" which has Odin as a central character. Other forms of Odin's name include Woden, Wotan, and surprisingly Mercury. Our day called Wednesday is a form of Woden's Day, the germanic form of the Latin Dies Mercurii, also known as mercredi in French and miercoles in Spanish, which use the latinate form. (Why we pronounce Wednesday ""wenzdi"" is another question.) Additionally, Gaiman wrote ""The Sandman"" series of comic books, which brings me back to the visualization of this movie as a comic book in action with most excellent illustration."

So he, his right hand man Unferth (John Malkovich), young trophy wife Wealthow (Robin Wright-Penn) and miscellaneous others settle in for a season of non-stop partying, apparently going on and on until the break-a-dawn.<br/><br/>That is until their non-stop boisterous ructions disturb the aurally challenged local 16 foot tall fairy tale creature Grendel, who lives in the mountains a distance away. Grendel, a normally placid giant with sensitive yet scungy ears, becomes so enraged and sensitive to the noise that he crashes the celebrorgy wreaks havoc, leaving many locals dead. The only thing missing was the sound of scratching as the record is suddenly shut down ‚Äì that sound effect is used in a million films even when there is no record to stop.<br/><br/>The King decides that giant 16 foot ogres busting up his orgies just is not on, and immediately decrees that Grendel must be killed, putting a handsome bounty on Grendel's non-handsome puss filled head.<br/><br/>A short while later through heaving seas comes a vessel carrying a small number of burly, heavily armed men. Upon alighting the burliest among them announces to the King and all in attendance that: ""I am Beowulf, and I am here to kill your monster!"" The King is pleased with this turn of events, the shifty 2IC Unferth is not, but as every card player knows King trumps shifty 2Ic, so another celebratory dinner is swiftly organised to thank Beowulf (Ray Winstone) and co.<br/><br/>That very evening the rumpus once again awakens grumpy old Grendel, who probably muttering something about those pesky kids meanders down the mountain to order them to shut their damn music down.<br/><br/>After a battle Beowulf trails Grendel back to his lair, where he meets Grendel's Mum who looks like a Computer Generated mostly naked Angelina Jolie¬Ö at this point I stopped pretending I was a movie reviewer and started a different thought process entirely.<br/><br/>At one point the film fast forwards several decades and it turns out that (now King) Beowulf had similar thoughts to mine and no doubt millions of other males, telling his wife and subjects something to the effect of ""I'm off to the mountains to get the paper. Don't wait up,"" every week or so.<br/><br/>Beowulf is immaculately animated and simply amazing to look at ‚Äì even the non-Angie scenes ‚Äì though they thankfully erased the various tattoos and the zipper marks from her various children. The characters look exactly like their real life counterparts except when they don't, I don't remember Jolie having a tail, this is the Jolie that wore the silver wetsuit in Tomb Raider, only even better. Furthermore if it is accurate I want the personal trainer Winstone has! The story is apparently a well worn classic, though not one I had heard of until this release, but to me it still seemed quite straightforward and just a little lacking, like a basic Aesop fable stretched to two hours. I loved looking at Beowulf, but after a while I stopped enjoying watching it quite as much.<br/><br/>Final Rating ‚Äì 6 / 10. An animated film purpose built for adults, albeit nerdy bookish ones who harbour dreams of Vikings and fantasy creatures. And give me the CGI Jolie over the current real life iteration any day."
"trashgang","8","0","0","9 February 2012"," excellent CGI flick with great performances
","I came across this flick due two reasons, the first one is very simple, it's cheaply to catch on Blu Ray these days and this is one you must see on Blu Ray. Secondly the director, Robert Zemeckis isn't an unknown name to me. He produced a few flicks in my genre, Bordello Of Blood (1996) and The Frighteneres (1996) and he went further towards Thi13ten Ghosts (2001) were he started to use CGI, it went further to Ghost ship (2002) notable for the opening sequence, full CGI. So it became clear that CGI was his thing, and even now as a director he's going for CGI, this flick and his latest one Real Steel (2011) are full of CGI. Beowulf is even a full CGI flick. Still he's most notorious with directing the Back To The Future trilogy.<br/><br/>People who follow me on the Web do know that I'm not a CGI lover, it's so cold and especially in my genre (horror) it doesn't work at all but here it does work. It reminded me of Final Fantasy (1994) were the faces of the actors were digitally disguised. But Beowulf actually even had a good script. <br/><br/>Even as it looks that you are gaming still you get involved into the characters and you are in the flick from the start. What also works is that once Beowulf is becoming a king things move further with the lie of Beowulf. It's funny to see that if it would have been made without CGI it rather would be a gory flick because the CGI blood do flow frequently. I wont recommend it to everybody but if you are into mythology then this is your thing or if you like fantasy than pick this up. <br/><br/>On the part of the acting, they were all very believable and so many geeks were waiting for the mother of Grendel to appear out of the water to see her (Angelina Jolie) attractive figure. I liked this flick more then the Comic flicks that are out there because our hero has some dark secrets and isn't what he seems to be.

In this case 'Beowulf' let himself get tempted by 'Jolie' the mother of all monsters the 'human soul', the result of this temptation led to his end. So the story goes with every hero.

","I'm not especially familiar with the Old English saga on which this is based, nor am I particularly interested in the Norse mythology that serves as its basis in general. Still, I found this to be a very good movie. It's exciting pretty much from beginning to end, but what really struck me was the quality of the animation. It is absolutely superb, to the point at which there are times when you wouldn't even know this was animated. Those who put this together made the very wise decision to make the animated characters look like the actors who are voicing the roles, so that Hrothgar looks like Anthony Hopkins and doesn't just have his voice - and, again, the animated Hopkins was spectacularly like the real Hopkins. In a way that made me wonder if this not have been even better as a blend of live action with animation. Why so meticulously recreate the looks of the actors? Why not just put them onto the screen sometimes?<br/><br/>The story is interesting throughout. Hrothgar's kingdom is being menaced by a strange and grotesque creature named Grendel. When all hope seems lost Beowulf (Ray Winstone) shows up as the miracle Hrothgar had been waiting for and does battle with both Grendel and Grendel's demonic mother. It's a great ride all the way through - graphic, with good dialogue and very exciting. There really isn't much here that could be criticized, except perhaps that decision not to mix in some live action. If I were a real connoisseur of the story, I'd probably rate this even more highly.

I think it looks rather silly, like it does not know whether it is live action or animation. After his children's' story The Polar Express, Zemeckis takes on the Dark Ages Poem Beowulf, casting Ray Winstone as the title character. Winstone acted, but his appearance is changed to make him look more buff. Incorrect portrayal of the ancient poem's story, (I guess Zemeckis was counting on no one having read the poem or understood it) and the performance capture has made strides, but still fails as a dramatic medium.

"Eternality","5","0","0","29 June 2011"," Beowulf can be described as a colossal disappointment.
","Beowulf (pronounced as ""bay-wolf"") can be described as a colossal disappointment. One of the most anticipated movies of 2007, and nearly three years in the making, Beowulf is all-hype but with little, if any, positive end product. Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis who gave us memorable pictures such as Forrest Gump, Contact, and Back To The Future seeks to build upon the technical success of The Polar Express but ends up with a punctured tyre.<br/><br/>Unlike digital CGI, hand-drawn, or stop-motion animation, Zemeckis and his team of talented animators have pioneered a cutting-edge technique that's able to capture photo-realistically an actor's facial expressions and body movements in animated form. In a way, Beowulf makes cinematic history for being the first feature film to be entirely created using the above-mentioned technique.<br/><br/>The animation is truly stunning and visually captivating. There's a jarring problem though - the eyes of the characters often seem to 'stare into space' rather than effectuating eye contact with one another; it's the main reason there's low chemistry among the characters, and also why we feel the presence of a vacuum between viewer and character. Nevertheless, Beowulf has the potential to be nominated for Academy Awards for best visual effects, sound, and sound editing categories though. It's unlikely to win any with Zack Snyder's 300 in the hat as well. <br/><br/>So what really caused the downfall of Beowulf? The filmmakers have simply ignored the very basic fundamental of making a great movie - the screenplay! No great film can survive with a weak script (no matter how impressive the effects are, or how well the director and cast have collaborated). Beowulf's screenplay is as shallow as a fifth-grader's essay. To compound the misery, it's poorly edited with numerous scenes (especially during quieter moments) showing an obvious lack in pacing.<br/><br/>Beowulf's failure could have been prevented. Alas, the filmmakers are too short-sighted to notice its major shortcomings. For all the slash and burn, plus the wonders of modern movie magic, Beowulf isn't the cinematic knockout that I have hoped for. Watching Beowulf was more of a chore than a pleasure. And if I may add: Zemeckis, work harder on those soulless eyes please!<br/><br/>GRADE: C- (5.5/10 or 2.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

","In the Middle Ages, a Danish tribe led by Hrothgar are plagued by a monstrous creature, Grendel. Beowulf, a warrior from a neighbouring state, comes to confront the beast and claim the King's reward. Can he defeat this evil and free the people from its curse ?<br/><br/>This is a great animated version of the classic Saxon poem, one of the oldest recorded stories in history. Zemeckis updates the motion capture technique he used previously in The Polar Express and the movie looks terrific, with fantastic attention to detail - hair, frost, dirt, candlelight - although just occasionally it creaks a little (the shots of the horses riding for instance). There are breathtaking pull-backs, dizzying overheads and stunning lighting tricks, like the moment in the cave when the dragon is revealed. Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary's script also takes some interesting liberties with the classic tale, turning Beowulf into a complex and tragic figure; in the original story he kills Grendel's mother, but the different take on that here leads to much more interesting second half. It also does a great job of evoking the drunken, debauched, wintry atmosphere of the story; it could so easily be stuffy and prosaic but instead is full of rabble-rousing action, curvy women and horrible monsters. Perhaps because of the mo-cap technology, the actors all give big, theatrical, lusty performances more akin to stage acting and deliver a great physicality to their roles. Winstone and Hopkins are both good fun, Penn is terrific and does some great singing, Malkovich for once isn't the villain, Glover is pretty unforgettable as the freakish miscreant Grendel with a weird pig-Dutch/German/English lingo, and Jolie does one of her sauciest self-test-your-heterosexuality slithering bits. The use of colour (primarily red and white) is outstanding, and there is fantastic music throughout by Alan Silvestri, all heaving drums counterpointed with delicate strings. The film was designed by talented artist Doug Chiang (Jumanji, The Phantom Menace) and almost everything in it, from the golden chalice to Grendel's severed arm, is crafted with great care and imagination. This movie is perhaps not as well known as it should be, because it's carrying on the traditions of Ralph Bakshi and Katsuhiro Otomo - whilst it's animated, it's not aimed at young kids. What it is however, is a beautiful updating of a story that literally spans centuries into the most modern technique of storytelling, and like all great stories it transcends the method used to tell it. For me, no-one has quite managed to do a full-blown computer-generated photo-realistic dramatic film of people yet (Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within comes the closest), but this is a bloody good try and a cracking picture of a timeless tale."

At first, the movie was quite true to the original plot, but things really started to diverge with the encounter with Grendel's mother. In the actual story, she is a hideous beast, just like her son, and NOT a beautiful, scantly clad sea-witch. In the story, another fight occurs, but not in the film.<br/><br/>From there, the differences only get bigger. In the movie, it turns out that Hrothgar and Beowulf both had sex with Grendel's mother, that the dragon is the offspring of Beowulf and Grendel's mother, and Beowulf kills the dragon himself, at the cost of his life. Those are all untrue to the story: In reality, Grendel's mother is just another monster, the dragon is completely unrelated to her, and Wiglaf helps kill the dragon before it can kill Beowulf.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the story itself was good. Indeed, its theme was far more complex than that of the original Anglo-Saxon epic, and the action, special effects, and acting were all commendable. However, the story is simply too different to be called ""Beowulf."" Had they called it something else and stated that it was their own story, I would have given a much higher rating."

I still sort of liked the imagery of the attacks of Grendel(like the fire turning blue, or how realistically the queen reacted, or how Grendel treated humankind like a bunch of terrifying bugs,) but I still think that it-by far- was not suitable for a thirteen year old. I would probably come out of the cinema shaking if I were thirteen...(and understand, violence is my nickname, so I am not exaggerating it.) <br/><br/>In the end, I can recommend it to you only if your guts are strong enough to see the spilling of other's guts.

Everyone in the audience was given what looked like cheap-ass shades, but they did the job wonderfully and fitted snugly over my regular specs.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the plot was tight and well scripted, the voice acting was great (Ray Winstone rocks), the action was breathtaking, some of the CGI was unbelievably gorgeous and the music and incidental sound was great!

It seemed apparent that given an unlimited budget, this movie would have looked phenomenal in every scene, but unfortunately the budget wasn't unlimited and it shows in a number of places. Nothing looks horrible, but you can tell that they had to pick and choose where to go for high detail.

"Hinosan417","6","0","0","21 February 2010"," ""Beowulf"" isn't really ""Beowulf""
","As other people have noted, the story in ""Beowulf"" is quite far from the content of the original poem - so far, in fact, that I feel it was misleading to call this film ""Beowulf"" at all. Whereas, say, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is essentially faithful to its source material, this film twists the source material so far that it becomes substantially a different story.<br/><br/>In fairness to the film, it does explore some interesting themes. One theme is how legends tend to grow and become distorted in the re-telling, as the legend of Beowulf is shown becoming distorted in the re-telling even during his own lifetime. And corollary to that is the idea that people tend to believe what they want to believe; although Beowulf offers no direct proof of the witch being dead, for example, they want to believe it and so it becomes accepted as part of the story. Also noteworthy is the theme of a hero sowing the seeds of his own downfall.<br/><br/>That being said, I feel this film reflects too much the skeptical point-of-view of modern times, where we tend to receive heroic tales with skepticism and doubt about the real motives and motivations of those involved. Compared to the original character, this Beowulf seems not only flawed but downright devious, and I think that treatment doesn't do justice to the character. Also, the cartoonified style of the film didn't appeal to me personally; since the point of the film seems to be to treat Beowulf as a flawed human being with conflicted motivations (more like one of us ordinary people than a legendary noble hero), wouldn't a realistic film style be more appropriate? That style might work for a film like ""300"", but here it was distracting at best and jarring at worst, reminding me too much of a video game.<br/><br/>And what to say about the witch depicted by Angelina Jolie - so different from the witch of the poem that she's almost an entirely different character? The titillating semi-nudity is so gratuitous that it's almost comical, right down to the strange detail of modern-looking high heels (in the 6th century A.D.?) That sort of thing makes me wonder if this is the sort of film that's trying to do too much at once - pandering to the lowest common denominators of taste with crude violence and sex while simultaneously trying to deconstruct an epic poem; maybe that's just too tall an order."
"dee.reid","7","0","0","26 December 2009"," ""Beowulf"" - Zemeckis-style...
","Admittedly, 2007's ""Beowulf,"" the latest adaptation of the classic Old English epic poem with no known author (and is very often required reading in high school), is not a film I paid very much attention to when it was first released two years ago. Home video has been very kind to this picture, however, since it received mixed reviews but was a huge box office success (it earned well over $150 million during its theatrical run) when it was released, due in no small part to its groundbreaking performance-capture CGI technology - improved significantly from director Robert Zemeckis's earlier ""The Polar Express"" (2004).<br/><br/>But let's be honest with ourselves: this is not your father's ""Beowulf."" I don't remember the exact details of the epic poem from English 12 my senior year in high school five years ago, but I do not recall that it was a dark, uber-sexy, ultra-bloody affair and treatise on the dangers of pride (this review is based on the unrated director's cut of the film, not the ""PG-13"" theatrical version). Differences aside - major and minor - Zemeckis's ""Beowulf"" is not a bad film, but a different one from what most of us are probably used to reading about, whether in school or for pleasure. In fact, ""Beowulf"" is a ridiculously entertaining film, even if it is prone to slowing down during its quieter moments, and the performance-captured animation is nothing short of beautiful and breathtaking.<br/><br/>In 6th-century Denmark, King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) kingdom of Heorot is being terrorized on a nightly basis by the hideous demon Grendel (a frighteningly effective Crispin Glover). To the rescue is the fearless Geat hero Beowulf (Ray Winstone) to battle Grendel and restore peace & tranquility to Hrothgar's kingdom. (Winstone's Beowulf is significantly different from the one in the poem; he's no longer the perfect ""hero,"" but is instead flawed and is much more believably human. He's also prone to strong lapses in judgment when he lets his pride get the better of him.) Those who know the story know the rest of the film's events - Beowulf eventually slays Grendel, and does battle with his mother (Angelina Jolie) and becomes king of Heorot himself, now married to Queen Wealtheow (Robin Wright Penn). And lastly, there is the costly battle with the dragon that comes to terrorize his kingdom a few years later down the road.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is a breathtaking action-adventure fantasy epic. It looks fabulous, and is appropriately dark, violent and sexy, everything a revved-up Hollywood adaptation of an ancient work of classical literature should be. The animation is advanced enough that it does allow for the characters to express believable amounts of emotion and even display facial expressions. And it's easy to tell who's playing who, since the characters do somewhat resemble the actors playing them, except of course the frightening, hideous monster that is Grendel. That was a brave performance by Crispin Glover, I'll tell you, who manages to make such a ravenous creature sympathetic by making him appear as a misunderstood outsider who is disturbed by the noises coming from King Hrothgar's mead hall and only goes there in an attempt at trying to get some peace & quiet. He's no longer the soulless, evil monster that we might remember from the epic poem, but simply a misunderstood monster-child who's trying to get some sleep, but the greedy, noisy humans who live nearby won't let him. I'm quite surprised that Crispin Glover hasn't gotten better work over the years.<br/><br/>And there is also a healthy dose of sex appeal to be enjoyed by members of both sexes. Considering that Ray Winstone looks nothing like his animated on-screen counterpart, the film's animators can be forgiven with taking some creative liberties with the actors. (And Angelina Jolie, presumably the sexiest woman in Hollywood, is certainly enjoying the you-know-what out of her 10-minute cameo here as the seductive, ultra-sexy Mother of Grendel, who eventually manages to seduce Our Hero Beowulf. The movie is certainly worth the ticket price alone just to see her in the nude, with gold body paint covering up her most private of parts, about an hour into the picture. Does anybody know for sure if she was really naked in this movie?)<br/><br/>Considering the movie was co-written by comic book artist Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, I expected the script to be a little bit better. And what I mean is the tendency of the film to slow down toward the middle. Some of the changes that they made to the story can also be forgiven, but it also gives the viewer the impression of how much they were trying inject modern-day religious (read: Christian) themes into the story, which I can't even remember being hinted at in the original epic poem (but then again it's been a while since high school). The character Unferth (John Malkovich) becomes a vocal proponent of the then-new Christian faith and his suggestion early in the picture that King Hrothgar and others pray to the new Roman god is just one prime example of this. It goes to show the viewer the type of modern-day slant the filmmakers were trying to put on the picture.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis is still one of Hollywood's most valued dealers in groundbreaking special effects-laden spectacles. Even if his ""Beowulf"" is a mixed bag - but a significant upgrade from ""The Polar Express"" five years ago - it is an entertaining film, a ridiculously entertaining and ultra-sexy/ultra-bloody film. If you can, I'd highly recommend watching Zemeckis's director's cut. With this version of the film at least, even though it's got more bloody violence and greater sex appeal, you get the feeling that this is the complete film, and the real story that Zemeckis was really trying to tell, short of the ratings restrictions on the picture.<br/><br/>You'll either really love it or really hate it; I think I'm somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I wasn't too sure what to make of this film when I saw it. I think maybe it's one of those that you have to watch twice before you fully understand it. It is true that is looks amazing. That is to say the animation is really something. It's done quite obviously in CGI but in such a way that it really suits the dark mood of the film and the story. It is almost worth watching just for this reason. The characters actually look like the actors portraying them, bringing a new purpose to the job of voice-over. It's unfortunate then that I didn't like it that much. Obviously Beowulf is a classic story and making a film such as this was inevitable. The problem is that doing it in animated form kind of dumbs it down a little. What I mean is I'm not really sure who this film is for, the dark story and horror elements (Beowulf is essentially a horror story) make it for adults but the animation says its for young teenagers. If it wasn't animated the amount of blood featured in this film would no doubt make it a 15 certificate. The result is a film that doesn't really know what it wants to be, some films can get away with appealing for both audiences but Beowulf doesn't quite seem to pull it off. The voices of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins and (dare I say it) the addition of Angelina Jolie are fun to listen to and suit their characters perfectly. The overall result is something that is fun to watch but becomes boring for both audiences about halfway through."

I thought the sexual jokes weren't needed, I mean they are cartoon characters.<br/><br/>In the movie, Beowulf is ready to accept King Hrothgar's challenge to kill Grendel. Grendel looks more human in the movie than usually depicted in other films. So, Beowulf fights him naked for some reason, because that is not in the poem. So, there is always some strategic placed object when showing Beowulf from the front or a dark shadow. I don't get why they had him take off his pants. He kills Grendel but then is seduced by his mother, whom is voiced by the beautiful Anjelina Jolie. Her character is drawn to resemble Jolie's face. He makes a deal with the mother, and is given the Kingdom. Some how the a charm was placed on Hrothgar and he kills himself. I don't think that was in the poem.<br/><br/>One day, Beowulf's son shows up in the form of a dragon. What!!! How does that happen.

Ray Winstone (THE DEPARTED) as the dominating Beowulf. And the sexiest woman alive, Angelina Jolie (WANTED) as Grendel's deceptive mother. I mean, what a cast! This is what great films are made of. And the realism of the computer animation in terms of how they resembled the actual actors was astonishing ...which begged a pretty big question: WHY NOT SIMPLY FILM BEOWULF WITH LIVE ACTION AND NOT ANIMATION?! Cost was probably an issue, but with the $150 million budget I think they could've done a fine live action film. In 2005 Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarson proved it could be done with his very nicely done BEOWULF & GRENDEL starring Gerard Butler (300). With comparable run times (103 minutes to 114 minutes) and Beowulf & Grendel's much lower budget (I believe it was around $75 million), it can be done and done well if you have the inclination. But, for whatever reason, director Robert Zemeckis (MONSTER HOUSE) decided to shoot it this way.<br/><br/>It may sound as if I'm bashing animated films in general, which I'm not. There are some really great ones out there (FINDING NEMO, HOODWINKED, etc.), so animation can be pulled off if care is taken to present it as such. But with Beowulf, it seems they were trying to mix live action with animation in order to produce some sort of hybrid ...which simply didn't work for me. It might for some and that's fine, but, if you're going to show realistic characters that look like the actual actors, why not simply do live action? It's so maddening! It was nice, however, to see some care taken with the source material (namely Neil Gaiman's reimagining of the epic poem by the same name). Beowulf had some shady dealings and it was refreshing to see this brought out in the story and not simply showing him as some flawless hero.<br/><br/>Still, if you're into animation, this one might not work for you. Or if you're solely a live action fan, this one might REALLY bug you. So beware. You've been warned."

What ruined this movie for me was not that the decision was made to not just do a direct movie and to make it using CGI, or that the movie strayed from the epic poem, since so many movies based on great works get changed, but the way the lines were delivered throughout the movie. That, and the fact we had to turn on the English subtitles to get it all. Other than some of the dialogue between Grendel and his mother. What were they saying to one another? It felt like every line, some actors were worse, or maybe it was intentional to make them seem like idiots, were halting and robotic. Word-pause, word-word-pause, all throughout. No one talks like that. Okay, those who are hearing impaired might do so. And those in badly edited movies. Yes, this was beautiful to look at, especially Wright-Penn (when is she not?), and for some reason her lines were not so halting. Why is that? Because she refused to speak as she knew no one really did? And the actor who portrayed Beowulf, well, hot bod, but not so hot of an actor, at least in this movie.

(that's until Ray Winstone (Beowulf) appears).<br/><br/>Beowulf begins as any epic tale would. It lays out the cold, Norse, setting and the characters in a plain, simple fashion. Then the battles start. In fact, Beowulf only really begins 20 minutes in, when Grendel, a hideous giant, kills many people in a food hall in the presence of the king (Antony Hopkins). The King orders that the hall be closed and sends out a message stating that anyone who can slay Grendel will get riches 'beyond their wildest dreams.' Eventually, Beowulf, a warrior with oily muscles and a London accent arrives, and claims he will ""kill your monsta'!"" A battle scene between him and Grendel commences, which seems a repeat of the first battle, apart from Beowulf is naked. This is a weird and miss-fitted scene, as it falls awkwardly between the line of comedy (Beowulf has sausages, wine glasses, poles, swords blocking his private parts throughout in order to maintain a 12A (PG-13) certificate), and violent action. Beowulf eventually kills Grendel , but this angers another beast in the far mountains, his mother (Angelina Jolie).<br/><br/>After this, the film climaxes for 40 minutes, bearing the heavy promise of deep, moving scenes and great, energetic action scenes. But it's not to be, as the film slows down instead, tediously crawling along all its CGI frames, before a quick action scene is slapped on the end.<br/><br/>Its a real shame, after all, as Beowulf seems to miss the point in the second half.

","To say that it was a ridiculous decision to make Beowulf into a motion-capture CG film is an understatement. With the technology we have today, this could've made for a grand live-action feature, and I bet it would've had Robert Zemeckis not been involved. The mere notion that this wasn't gonna be live-action turned me off from seeing it in theaters, and had a friend not brought the DVD over, I would've never seen this film. However, after viewing it, I actually appreciated it more, but that's not to say it isn't without its flaws.<br/><br/>The CG is very good. From a long distance, the characters look like Shrek -- not a good thing. However, when at a close distance of a few feet, the characters are astonishingly life-like. The dragon was a great beast, and so was Grendel's mother. Yet the horses were poorly done, and some of the fight sequences were less than spectacular.<br/><br/>To those concerned about how violent or extreme this film is, it's perhaps best to say: this is the most hardcore PG-13 film made of the decade. There's quite a bit of nudity and vulgarities (mainly the inappropriate actions of Hrothgar's people and Beowulf's soldiers). The violence is way over board. Our title hero is slicing open sea monsters and their intestines and blood fly all over the place. Grendel's arm is ripped from its socket, and people are squeezed of their blood as Grendel drains them into his mouth. Way too much for a young audience, in fact, I highly recommend only children of 14-years or older watch this film.<br/><br/>The screenplay is actually quite well done. The gaps in text are nicely spruced up for the film, and the themes of ""lies coming back to haunt you"" and ""the rising power of Christianity"" are realized, even if the latter is very subtle.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score is a disappointment. It only sweeps a few times, and the vocals by Robin Wright Penn aren't very flattering. There's a few themes throughout, primarily Beowulf's bombastic one, the Hero Comes Home, and the twinkling of Grendel and his mother.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone is very good as the title character, and so is Anthony Hopkins, and Brendan Gleeson. John Malkovich is god awful in his role, and says his lines as if he were a 1st-grader reading in front of the class: very slow and dull.<br/><br/>All in all, I was quite pleased to see Beowulf on DVD. As hardcore as it was in vision, the story as a whole is beautiful. The writers captured what needed to be told, and what could stay in the poem. From the acting to the CGI, it's pretty satisfying, and I recommend it to the fans of 300 and Troy.<br/><br/>** SEEING THIS FILM DOES NOT JUSTIFY NOT READING THE POEM FOR SCHOOL."

","I watched this movie on DVD on my laptop and despite this enjoyed it. I suspect the CGI would be much more impressive on a big screen and doubly so in IMAX but I could appreciate it even on such a small screen (squashed as close to my face as possible I might add). At times the effects really are stunning, usually when there is not much movement. When the characters are jumping around or riding horses I found myself unimpressed by the realism. Faces and bodies are, however, on the whole amazing and given some of the models quite breathtaking.<br/><br/>Another negative for the film is the wide variety of accents (usually bad). Weird combinations of Scottish, English, Irish and Scandinavian really baffled me, the most bizarre choice for me being that of the Beowulf himself who has an accent that belongs in 'Snatch' or 'Lock Stock..'.<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on legend I believe and is in itself quite interesting. The monsters are .. monstrous especially Grendel who really made me squirm! The action is watchable and refreshingly quite believable. The dialog is a bit naff in places but not on a grand scale as in other hero action movies (a positive?).<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkin's performance and the presence of Alison Lohman and a surprisingly hot version (given that I don't rate the real version that highly) of Angelina Jolie made this overall watchable.

","I knew I wasn't going to like this when they showed Hrothgar as a doddering, drunken fool. The poem is pretty clear that he's lost is manhood to the ravages of time, not to the drink. Also, the flyting between Unferth and Beowulf was pretty lame, and there is nothing, NOTHING in the original to suggest that Unferth would try to stab Beowulf in the hall.<br/><br/>Though I can appreciate the well-placed candles, smoke, and sword hilt in the Heorot fight scene. Beowulf's wang is not something I ever wanted to see, and some guy stabbing away at Grendel's junk isn't either. In fact, there are a lot of dick references here (candle, sword hilt, third leg, golden horn, thrusting Hrunting into Grendel's mother...with which he ""laid"" her in her grave), and I'm not entirely convinced there's a good reason for it.<br/><br/>If Beowulf stands for strength and power as he says in his little tag line, then why is it Beowulf's craft that tears the arm from Grendel (using a chain and the door) rather than his own brute strength is in the poem. You can argue all you want that this is a re-imagining of the poem, and I agree. I actually LIKE the Grendel's mother-as-sexy-dragon plot line because it unifies the movie in a way that the poem never could. But some of the choices I just find ridiculous. The movie tries to tie too much of it together: writing in a past between Hrothgar and Grendel's mother in order to explain away the father figure is too clean. But I have to admit, I did gain an appreciation for what the character of Beowulf must have felt the night that Grendel's mother attacks: ""WTF, Hrothgar? Anything else you want to tell me about before I save your ass again? Is she made of rainbows and lollipops and guarded by unicorns? Does she have machine-gun jomblies? Is she really hot? Does she wear high heels and strategically-placed gold lam√©?"" These are important things to know before fighting Angelina Jolie."

The characters aside from the main people kind of resemble the background characters of 'Shrek', which is a bit tedious sometimes, but some of the other characters look very good. For example, have you seen a comparison of Ray Winstons chest in the movie vs his real life belly? And giving Angelina Jolie stilettos on her feet (without shoes) is pretty neat. <br/><br/>The best of these effects however are used on Grendal, who is like an ogre/mutant/""Monstah""! as Beowulf would put it. What's really interesting about Grendal is that even though he's going around killing everyone, (when they sing it makes him mad, which I don't really understand) you really feel bad for him. What's even more interesting is that Grendal is played by Crispan Glover (Marty McFly's dad from back to the future, who is completely unrecognizable here).<br/><br/>One thing I really don't get though is, why did he die when Beowulf 'dis-arms' him?

","What a movie. What a combination of violence, extremely loud sounds and odd characters (like Beowulf himself). To most people, it is an amazing recreation of graphics to entertain audiences who like war movies such as Lord of the Rings. To me it is an utter exposure of flamboyant terror (if that makes sense). I don't know whether it was the fact that I was too weak, or the movie was too strong for people my age (15). Even my sister who is four years my senior, was crouching in her chair with her ears covered by her hands. However, when I came home almost dizzy with those overwhelming special effects, I read in time magazine that it is the tenth best movie of the year. I was surprised¬Öbut I came to some sort of conclusion. It was not the fact that the movie was too violent or too shameful or a disgrace to society¬Öit was the fact that it was advertised the wrong way. People who liked lord of the rings like myself would not necessarily enjoy this overwhelmingly graphical movie. It should in fact be rated ""R"" unless a video game freak maybe younger than me who plays games rated ""Mature"" (and can handle them) wants to see it. What a strange situation this is"

","Though I find that I would have immensely enjoyed the film in 3D format, I can say that I will happily settle for having seen it in the typical two-dimensional style. On other notes, the movie was, all in all, a marvelous rendition of the age old tale, and is definitely an addition to my favorite list. The animation was not only an intelligent addition to the movie, but also a thoughtful one, making it easier for one to delve into the realm of blood-thirsty, terrifying creatures, feeling that they had a more realistic existence when compared to the humans in the film, making it far more easy to enjoy the storyline. An applaud to a very much under-appreciated Crispin Glover, for a masterful performance as Grendel, the afflicted, ruthless, terrifying yet strangely delicate creature who inspires the story to come to life. In my opinion, the best performance of the movie, and I found myself greatly sympathizing for the monster at the arrival of his death. Angelina Jolie served, with no doubt, a superb performance as Grendel's vengeance-streaked mother, set out to seduce Beowulf for her own common yearns, later acknowledged as his misfortunes. A villain role that Jolie can definitely put into her accomplishment bag. Anthony Hopkins gave his usual upstanding performance, as well as Ray Winstone, both having the marvelous king-like characteristic indented throughout their reign in the film. Beowulf's character was simply genius, only making the realism of the hero so much more adequate and vivid, with examples including the character's quick willingness to lie of his race in the water, and his surrender to Grendel's mother, her seduction winning over. Despite the lifeless emotion in the animated characters eyes,foolish addition of Beowulf's continuous nude scenes, and witty yet distracting hiding of Beowulf's manhood, the movie produces an action packed, blood and gore guaranteed, emotionally striking, and magnificent cast filled experience that I recommend all adults, not children, to see."

","he much hyped animated Hollywood movie Beowulf actually disappoints me. The movie is about a hero called Beowulf who slays a monster and becomes a King. Nothing unusual about it. But there is a bit of something unusual in it. The hero is actually not a great one. He lies about his accomplishments and adds spice to his stories on slaying demons and sea monsters. He actually lost a race to another warrior because he got distracted by a mermaid after killing a sea monster. But he hides the mermaid part to the world and boasts that he killed the sea monster. This has made his name reach far ends of the world. One particular kingdom is troubled by a monster called Grendal who is an offspring of the King and a Demon (Angelina Jolie). The king Hrothgar (Antony Hopkins) is so taken by the beauty of the Demon that he makes it out with her and falls for a curse called ""Sins of the Fathers"". The queen refuses to sleep with him because of this. Grendal is disturbed by party music in the kingdom and actually crashes (gory violence) the party and the party guests. So the King is troubled that he can neither have anymore parties nor lay his queen. Here comes our Beowulf to the rescue and he manages to kill Grendal by crushing its Cochlea with his bare hands and ripping of one of the monster's arms. And thus the Curse is broken.<br/><br/>Angered by the death of her handsome Grendal, Grendal's mother takes on Beowulf's men and kills them. Reciprocating this, Beowulf seeks out to kill her but commits the ""Sins of the Fathers"" . But he tells everyone that he has killed her and he becomes the king and gets to lay the former King's queen and a few other women in the regime. (Actually don't understand why he shouts ""I Am Beowulf"" before and after killing demons.) Without his knowledge, Angelina gives birth to his son and this time its a Dragon. After a few years, the curse is set loose and the Dragon starts killing a few people in the kingdom.<br/><br/>Our Man sets out again and after a series of CG gimmicks manages to slay the dragon and dies along with it. His heroism is sung and his body cremated. His minister eyes Grendal's mother and probably commits ""Sins of the Fathers"". I guess that's left to the producers of Beowulf part 2, if there is any¬Ö The graphic gimmicks and sound effects are awesome. It really sensuous to watch Angelina emerge out of the waters in near-nude swimming suit. Interesting to watch a Hero who has a weak heart for women and lies about his courage. Probably he is a practical cool hero, for a change. But for otherwise the movie is a sheer waste of time. Being a great fan of both fairy tales and animation movies, I was lured to watch it. But every aspect of the movie disappointed me. It turned out to be a mega-animated-gory-tale.<br/><br/>Give it a miss"
"Ithorianjedimaster2","5","0","0","14 June 2008"," Beautiful CG, but not much else.
","Beowulf is a strange movie, not in a delightful ""Guillermo del Toro"" strange, but a ""what is its purpose?"" kind of strange. Norse mythology talks about one of man's first true heroes, a brave man named Beowulf who fought the devilish Grendel and finally a dragon and saved the Danes from complete destruction, so it's very clear that someone would pick up on the story of Beowulf and turn it into a movie, and a CG one at that is just great. And yet, CG animation is all the movie really has going for it, because everything else seems to fall short.<br/><br/>The movie never seems to take itself seriously, which is odd because there are a lot of gory, dark atmospheric scenes throughout. This might be the director trying different approaches to the story like the unknown writer of the original Beowulf text did, but unlike this ancient author, the director's approach between comedic and horrific scenes will just throw you off and make the movie feel very awkward. For instance, before the battle with Grendel, Beowulf strips himself of his armor and clothes, saying that since Grendel wears no armor, then neither would he since he likes a 'fair' fight. The battle afterward with a screaming Grendel and a nude Beowulf isn't very epic, mostly due to Beowulf's nudity, because it just becomes a distraction.<br/><br/>Beowulf also seems to have popped into theaters in the wrong century, because though it portrays how Norse men enjoy sex and beer and their superstitious ways, a lot of people in the audience won't understand a lot of it and will think negatively of it. Such is the scene when Beowulf is talking to his teenage bed maid, who is oh too happy to sleep with him. Many people think Beowulf is a pedophile for this, even though it was custom for kings of old to have one or two bed maids for them to sleep with when their queen wasn't in the mood.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that some of the dialogue is just plain BAD. The script writers must have spent little time trying to make sophisticated lines for the characters. One line that was hilariously terrible was when the Danish queen is talking to Beowulf ""Many heroes have come to taste my lord's golden mead..."". The audience was LAUGHING at this and my friends and I had a good chuckle as well. There are times too, where you're wondering where Beowulf's sense of pride and valor is like when he, again, takes off his armor and reveals his chest to an enemy warrior, taunting him by shouting ""Go on! Kill me! Kill me!"" and the fact that he so easily succumbs to Grendel's mother's seduction. But then again, it's Angelina Jolie. How could he refuse? <br/><br/>Animation-wise, the movie is beautiful. I mean, the individual strands of hair on the characters, the lighting, shadows, and color of their environments, and terrific orchestral music really give you the feel of being back in ancient times. I just wish the acting was as good. Don't get me wrong, Ray Winstone does a good job in acting out the great Norse hero, though some scenes, he kind of over-acts like Beowulf's amazement at the beauty of the Danish queen in the Mead Hall.<br/><br/>However, Robin Wreight Penn doesn't do a very good job and you don't grow any kind of liking for her. Robin's acting is so robotic and emotionless that when she is attacked by the dragon at the end of the movie, you don't really have the kind of ""Hurry, Beowulf! Save her!"" tension going. Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie, on the other hand, seem like they were born for their roles, but what can you expect from Anthony Hopkins?<br/><br/>I would like to say more, but IMDb's limit isn't going to let me. In the end, I'd say the movie, visually, is full of atmosphere and beauty, but like a Victoria's Secret model, there's not much substance underneath. Sure, the final battle with the golden dragon was awesome, but with a ridiculous build-up and a ""what the heck were they thinking"" cliff-hanger, yes a CLIFF-HANGER, ending, Beowulf just ends up being like a small pond during the spring, beautiful but shallow."

","Unfortunately I didn't realise this was an animated movie when I hired it from the video shop, you'd think they'd make that clear on the cover. In any case, it was a fairly enjoyable movie and there were a few moments where you could forget it was animated. But mostly the people had that other-worldly quality to them that made them look more animated than real. Apparently this is only very loosely based on the original Beowulf story, which I think is a real shame. Sticking to the original story would have really added to the experience for me even if it made it less of a traditional movie plot with some kind of resolution and retribution within it.

","My Take: A thrilling summer movie blockbuster. <br/><br/>BEOWULF is perhaps the oldest story that Hollywood still takes pride in making. Remember the very memorable battle between Beowulf, the monster Grendel and the monster's mother? And the moral that pride is the curse? Well, its Hollywood's proudest pleasure to give you the new BEOWULF, the new motion-capture animated baby from the father of the craft (or at least the one who uses it the most), Robert Zemeckis. Although BEOWULF still has those emotionless-eyed motion-capture drones and has a big dose of silly dialog, BEOWULF is an ideal model of an action-packed summer movie adventure. Filled with thrilling moments and heart-pounding battles, BEOWULF is an action fans playhouse, and if your home entertainment system's built for the job, this is a real killer on DVD! On the basis of script, however, Zemeckis still hasn't found the perfection. The dialog is made up of the cheesy old-English dialog that's bound the produce a giggle. Although there are real intentional humor in the film, some are still on the verge of camp. The scene where Beowulf fights with the monster evenly by being naked is still hilarious.<br/><br/>On the action however, Zemeckis is one heck of a carnival barker. Moments of thrills and excitement are at an abundance. From the moment where Grendel breaks through a feast, entirely shot in darkness, is often chilling. Then of course there's Beowulf battling the monster and even a large dragon in the end (and this is a PG-13). That's pure Hollywood, and that's pure action entertainment.<br/><br/>Ask for the actors, we have Ray Winstone as the brave but foolhardy Beowulf (with help from a macho model double), Anthony Hopkins plays the drunken mad Hrothgar, Robin Wright Penn is Wealthhow, Hrothgar's (and later Beowulf's) wife. But Angelina Jolie stills stands out above the rest, baring it all (well, his animation that is) as the monster Grendel's (voiced by Crispin Glover, by the way) mother, vowing vengeance when her monster child was killed (the scene where she emerges all gold, with high heels will just crack you up).<br/><br/>The movie's a great example of how a cheesy old sword-and-sorcery flick can become the next best action movie coming out for the summer. It's a lot of fun and I doubt you'll be bored.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"Dworkyll","5","0","0","8 May 2008"," Cutscene, not film
","Well,<br/><br/>I consider myself as a fan of the old Nordic sagas, and the movies based on them, like the Excalibur, or the 13th Warrior. So I looked forward to see this movie with great interest. Apart form the films, where the visuals cover the weaknesses of the script/directing, the script here is very good. Based on a millennium old tale, actualized by professionals: and the promise is kept. The visual experience, when we talk about action and scenery, is simply stunning. Even on a screen at home. <br/><br/>However when we talk about closeups, the whole thing just falls apart. The eyes are dead, and improperly used, the mimic is awful. This renders the actors(?) to puppets, and eliminates the whole humanity from the film. I do not understand, why such great actors like Anthony Hopkins, or John Malkovich let the producers to use them. What makes it more annoying, that the film industry is after 300, or Sin City, or even Shrek, where the balanced mix between technology and reality had been worked out just perfectly. Why fails here? There is one exception, the figure of Grendel. Despite his complete inhumanity, the only ""acting"" is performed by Grendel.<br/><br/>The overall feeling was that I'm watching an enormous cut-scene from some slashing computer game, and in minutes I will have control over the characters, and can start my own adventure. A twisted way of ""immersion"" I would say. So if you like nice CGI generated action and scenery, go and see it. If you are interested in the plot, wait for the book. If you are interested in the plot visually, I recommend the 13th Warrior, or the Excalibur."
"Blueghost","Null","0","0","4 May 2008"," Robert Zemeckis; ""What would have taken us two days, we shot in two hours...""
","... or words to that effect, and, to be exceedingly honest, that scene and all the rest look like they were shot in two hours. That's no compliment.<br/><br/>Admittedly, in the intermediate long run, this is ""the future"" of movies. Even so, Zemeckis really put a chagrin on my face. I could picture this film being shot on location in Sweden or Norway, with real actors and real sets. Admittedly this film was engineered for the IMAX format, and so it was geared for that kind of big-splashy entertainment, but, even so, again, to repeat, I simply could not get away from the sense that the real tale could have been told without all the CGI.<br/><br/>When I heard about this project I was hoping someone would do something better than the version that was shot in Iceland, and released a year or two before. Visually, the IMAX version is far more impressive, but artistically falls flat as a convincing piece of entertainment. If you want to shoot your scenes in two-hours, and crank out this kind of film, then more power to you. Personally, I would advise against it. The end result speaks for itself.<br/><br/>The other thing about this film was the writing. The story execution was fairly clich√©, and not just because it's a classic tale. No. It's because Zemeckis, for whatever reason, tried to make this tale and the film more within the reach of the mainstream audience. An admirable effort, though probably more understandable given the fact that the film was aimed at the D&D/Lord-of-the-Rings audience than classic myth and/or historical film aficionados.<br/><br/>The Beowulf tale has intrigued many directors, and someday, someone, somewhere, will get it right. The best version or iteration of the tale I've ever seen on the big screen was the screen adaptation of Chriton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" tale. A real sense of realism combined with a historical context and heroism. That, verse this tale which sits solidly in the realm of fantasy.<br/><br/>I wasn't too interested in seeing the film, but after thumbing through the conceptual art book, and thinking to myself ""This looks really good..."" Well, just as you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't judge a film by its published conceptual art. And again, I'm not really baffled so much as chagrined that another version of the Norse myth has missed its mark, particularly when the art in the book looked far superior than the final product; i.e. the visual material within the film itself.<br/><br/>But, maybe someday someone will really run with this tale. Until then, I'd recommend avoiding this film. It's worth seeing once, but that's about it."

","""Beowulf"" has superhuman levels of brawling, which I should have expected from any version based on the story. The violence is somewhat more extreme than I was expecting. It's still comic book or cartoonish violence, lacking the poetry and epic grandeur of language I was hoping for. Instead, the character Beowulf grandiosely declaims a lot of bragging speeches.<br/><br/>Somehow, I thought the writers would invent slightly more plot. I was hopeful when John Malkovich's treacherous character showed up, but he wasn't much of a subplot. The monsters are truly amazing, though, and Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie, is gorgeously inhuman. I won't give away the plot twist that Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary wrote to extend the story, except that they could have developed it more. I liked King Hrothgar, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, and he had more of an emotional range than Beowulf, the hero's, character. I'd give this a 6-7 out of 10 -- enjoyable and worth the money, but not required viewing."
"blackburnj-1","6","0","0","14 April 2008"," Robert wants to show you his new toys
","Robert Zemeckis has a new toy. Two new toys, actually. After fiddling with cartoons and archive footage in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Forrest Gump"" respectively, he's now using motion capture digital technology rather than film. But he's done it before so this time he's going to use it with 3D. Unfortunately, I watched this at home. So the film is left to stand on its actual merits, rather than its gimmicks.<br/><br/>That's a shame really, because watching the film I could sense that in full IMAX 3D this would have been bangs-for-your-bucks, jump out of your seat fun. Whenever he has the opportunity to, Zemeckis throws things at the camera and moves it in such an incredibly fluid manner that on a really, really big screen it would thrill. Unfortunately, all I was left with was the narrative.<br/><br/>The film's problems start early on. The opening is garish and, without the benefit of the 3D, overblown. It sets the tone for the rest of the film rather well. The characters chew their way through the dialogue before the first attack from Grendel, which has so much violence that it puts Tarantino in the shade. It is a miracle that this film, with all of its blood and guts, not to mention essentially full on nudity, received a PG-13 in America and a 12A (it's British equivalent). Don't let anyone younger than 12 see this film.<br/><br/>It is a full quarter of an hour before Beowulf arrives. He receives extremely little time for development, which is the same for all of the characters, but this film isn't really here for that. It's a cheap thrills picture, and Zemeckis delivers them by the barrelful. But, many of them, whilst grand on scale, have something wrong with them. Beowulf's first fight, for instance, is done as an Austin Powers gag, with the nude Beowulf's manhood being covered with helmets, spears and swords. What would Freud say? There are strong points. Winstone, in his CGI form, is very good as the lead, Angelina Jolie turns up as Angelina Jolie and does very well, whilst Sir An-TH-ony Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself a lot. However, the quality of the CGI is astonishing. There are a few things that look dodgy, such as the horses and the fire, but at times it is photo-real even if the artistry of the animation and the creation of the images are nowhere near those of ""Ratatouille"" which was released in the same year.<br/><br/>However, there are weak points, most of all John Malkovich, who is so wooden that he is largely indistinguishable from the large cross he waves around. But the real problem with the film is that it isn't really a film. It is a bunch of gimmicks, designed to thrill rather than entertain, and now that it has passed away from the 3D screens it will not last."

Beowulf's character yes was well renowned but the depiction made the character know he was aware of it and make it seem he could do anything, including a nude fight with an extremely mutilated Grendel, who also bears no likeness of a troll like in the original story as well.<br/><br/>The movie loses the audience when they are trying to cover up how ""well endowed"" Beowulf is rather than concentrating on the fight that will forever ruin the life of the main character, and the people involved with him.

Despite the fact his characters finally shows heroism in the last part of the film but by then so much disrespect has been lost for the character that it unfortunately doesn't shine true for viewers.<br/><br/>While the movie did hold strong performances by many of its actors, and the excellent theme of bargaining with the devil, it was hard to keep going when they director felt having as many naked butt as possible was more important than developing characters.

","I had previously read the book in my English class. So I was already familiar with the title and the story line. It really irritates me when a movie doesn't follow the book. However, this was originally an oral tale passed down through the generations. During that time the story most likely had been altered. So this time it was interesting how everything turned out. I was impressed with the animation. At some parts you couldn't even tell it was animation. This is why I gave it five stars.<br/><br/>However, this is where I subtracted five stars. I thought it would be cool to see it in 3D, but the 3D effects were not very good. The stuff that was supposed to ""pop out"" at you didn't seem to at all. The snow falling was about the only thing that the 3D worked. The other thing, There was a lot of nudity for it to be a PG-13 movie. About half of the movie, there is images of naked men. Even though it only showed the backside, I thought the movie would have been a lot better without the nudity; It was completely unnecessary. There were sexual references but no sexual content. The nudity was not sexual at all.<br/><br/>There was a comment to the Christian religion that I particularly didn't care for. If people of other religions get angry about Christians ridiculing their beliefs (not that I ridicule other people), then they have no right to do it back to us. It makes both sides look bad. But that's just my take on the movie."
"Whythorne","1","3","8","27 March 2008"," Woeful Beowulf creepy for wrong reasons
","While one can be impressed with all the gee-whiz technology that went into the making of ""Beowulf,"" in the end it gave me the creeps for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The video game, talking avatar feel of the CG was disturbing in the sense that it made me think of cheesy wax museum figures or department store mannequins coming to life after hours.<br/><br/>Another unintended creepiness of the film stemmed from the fact that evidently Zemeckis and company felt that people would be titillated by the gratuitous use of video game-flavored sexual references. Maybe hormone-raging adolescents who enjoy AO-rated Playstation games get a kick out of that sort of thing, but an adult would have to really be in a bad way if digitized breasts and buns turn him or her on.<br/><br/>The fact that animated CG is such a planned, thought out, painstaking, technical process further gives the nudity and sexual overtones a rather deliberate, pornographic air that is repulsive.<br/><br/>A bad decision from the start, one has to ask, why go the CG route? If the goal is realism, then why not a film with real actors and settings? Instead, one is left with the impression that this was intended to be an exercise in showing off and boasting, ""Hey! Look what we can do now!"" Or, in other words, they make a film likes this simply because nowadays they can. And yet, in spite of all the technical sweat and tears, the human characters still end up looking unnatural and unconvincing.<br/><br/>In addition, the Grendel character, who looks like a cross between Gollum and the mummy from the Brendan Fraser movies, tears bodies in half and bites off heads, but the video game gore splattered everywhere is also unnatural and not convincing enough to elicit any kind of shock or horror.<br/><br/>I also had the impression that the CG technology process overruled the subtle and sensitive nuances that make great films, and watching the special features portion of the DVD confirmed that impression. The actors, out of costume on their virtual, sterile stages, and therefore out of their natural element, appeared to be going through the motions while the director seemed satisfied that one take was good enough, since anything that might be lacking could be added in later by computer artists and technicians.<br/><br/>With regard to the script, I am not troubled by the fact that it took liberties with the original myth. What does trouble me is that once again we have an example of a story in which we are suppose to identify with characters simply because they exist, without any substantial character development being breathed into them.<br/><br/>Hence, we are to root for Beowulf not for any number of admirable character qualities, but only because the script says he IS the hero of the tale. Or perhaps because he is relatively less repulsive than other characters in the story.<br/><br/>A sad waste of expertise, money, technology...this kind of CG may work for ""Shrek"" or something like ""The Polar Express"" that are intended to be pure, unrealistic fantasy, but it is still not yet ready for subject matter that is intended to be taken seriously. And ""Beowulf"" makes me wonder if it ever will be."
"argus-15","10","3","8","24 December 2007"," The first movie ever to really celebrate 3D. WARNING: this rating only applies to the 3D version
","My expectations for this one were very low. I expected a crap story, crap performances, crap CGI for the faces, crap action. To be short: I just expected crap. I went with my girlfriend and the only reason we went was because we, or rather I, had some faint hope some people would finally have realized the true potential of 3D cinema. We missed the last show in the only Imax theater in Holland and I thought I'd missed the opportunity to see Beowolf in 3D. Yesterday my girlfriend took me to the cinema as a surprise. When it turned out we were going to see Beowolf for a moment I was (quite) scared it would be 2D. I was much relieved to see the 3D 'diving goggles' at the entrance (and what a dive it would be!) It turned out that the 3D release not only applies for Imax, but also for digital projection systems. We were in the theater with only 5 people, the three others being youngsters that started having 'fun' making hand-shadow figures on the screen and talking about where those funny glasses were meant for. I was preparing for a worst case scenario. A few moments later everyone was captured in one of those rare enchanting cinematic experiences, that come only once a decade (I didn't ask the youngsters, but judging by the fact that there were no further attempts to make us aware of their presence, they must have found out what those funny glasses were for).<br/><br/>To be honest the 2D version probably wouldn't get me writing a review or giving a top rating. Alas there was not the same depth in the story and characters as in the picture. But the story and characters were involving enough to enjoy in their own right. And the 3D isn't just a gimmick added to upgrade a mediocre product. This movie is made to be 3D and the makers showed art and craft. Who cares if the excitement comes as much from the SFX as from the story. Beowolf 3D is an adventure with an extra dimension. Go see it, or rather experience it, if you have the opportunity (exept if your sensitive to violence). <br/><br/>Note: Some time earlier I saw the latest Harry Potter in Imax 3D and it's 3D experience wasn't nearly as stunning as this. Here the glasses and 3D image didn't diminish the picture quality in any way. I don't know where the difference comes from, but I guess it's a combination of qualities of the movie itself in the way it was made (motion capture digitized afterward), projection type (digital/celluloid) and of the used equipment of the theater (projector, screen, glasses) Hope you will be/were as lucky as we were."

","I really enjoyed this interpretation of Beowulf. The plot, story line, and flow were great. I probably would have given the movie an 8 or so if they would have used humans. Although we've advanced amazingly in technology and ""digital enhancement"" the characters movements were still robotic and unnatural in my opinion. I didn't really pay that much attention to the trailers on this movie and was shocked that it was ENTIRELY digitally generated with voice-overs. If you're going to pay the actors to do that, why not let them act? Personally, I thought the computer generated version of Robin Wright Penn as Wealthow was creepy looking and did her a great injustice for she is much prettier than the hollow-eyed computer version. Don't even get me started on what I thought of their version of the troll.... Overall, I was extremely let down with the movie because it was all computer generated. It could have been a great hit if they would have used digital ""enhancement"" and not entrapment."

You know the CGI looked almost like live action, but I know it's CGI; it's in the hair.<br/><br/>I love it when Beowulf gets enchanted by the strikingly beautiful Queen Weathlow.

","I don't know what this guy is talking about...just because a movie isn't constant, mindless, bloody action doesn't mean its boring. If you want a movie like that go see 300 for the 60th time. Beowulf is far superior to 300 in many ways. Better characters, better story, better everything. And just because this movie isn't an exact copy of the original Anglo-Saxon poem doesn't mean its flawed. The original poem is a legend based on factual events. The sheer fact that the story is over 1,500 years old means that it has been morphed and skewed thousands of times compared to the original. The acting was excellent, the plot was an interesting and original interpretation of the poem and it was very entertaining all the way through. I'll agree that this movie was kind of cheesy at some parts but I thought it was necessary to show Beowulf's enormous ego and his tendency to stretch the truth when telling of his exploits. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see an entertaining, fun, and well-done piece of cinema. I'm not saying this is the greatest movie ever, but it FAR surpassed my expectations. Don't listen to the joker above me...please."
"mardiggan","4","3","8","18 November 2007"," Disappointed, Disgusted, Depressed
","A misunderstanding as to the fundamental nature of this movie ruined it for me from the opening scene; I had been under the impression, as were the three people I saw the movie with, that it was to be either (largely) live-action, such as the Lord of the Rings, or CGI-assisted, such as The 300, when in fact the film is entirely animated (I was frequently reminded of Shrek, an unpleasant comparison at best given the epic nature of the Beowulf legend). Some of the characters appeared decidedly cartoon-like, and the range of motion, activity, etc. was definitively so (the film was most strongly reminiscent of Shrek in this particular aspect, but the individual characters were frequently of no higher quality than the major ""normal human"" characters who share said green ogre's adventures). Additionally, the creators of Beowulf seem to have been a bit confused as to their target audience, with moments straight from Disney-type film antics sprinkled liberally throughout moments of both male and female nudity (often up-close) and the graphic detailing of people screaming as they burn to death; the final rating of PG-13 strikes me as being a frustrated ""average"" of the film's content (only modern-day 'foul language' is conspicuously absent). Major plot scenes are dominated largely by a ghastly, overdone running gag of almost-but-not-quite spotting Beowulf's ""third leg"" (a reference made in the movie itself, as well)... before something inevitably -- and in a most contrived manner -- obstructs the view. Once or twice might have been funny, if a bit inappropriate; more than a dozen times in a scene is downright ridiculous. Beavis and Butthead would've stopped laughing by the time Beowulf's writers are finished not-quite-flashing you. A much better, purer, more epic version of the movie could have and should have been done, with real actors and well-written dialog."

The animation and effects are second to none, maybe the Final Fantasy series, but it lacks in so many places. The story line is wrong for a start and there is too many plodding moments when you sit wishing for something good to happen. You watch it thinking, is this part of a trilogy and thats why they are building the story so much, but it ain't no part one of three.

"almostwitty","9","3","8","17 November 2007"," It's a cinematic marvel!
","I hadn't heard anything about it at all until the other day, when Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins swooped in for the premiere. So I kinda knew it was computer-generated using virtual motion capture for the acting - which I had a bad feeling about because I really hated The Polar Express.<br/><br/>But I needn't have worried. The actors looked like the actors - hell, forget computer graphics. That *was* Angelina Jolie rising out of the water, as sexy as ever. Even if she did have a scaly tail and impossibly beautiful (if spherical) breasts covered in mud. The sooner cinema gets to the point when you can take home your own computer-generated 3D model of your favourite character as you leave the auditorium, the better. Seriously, the friend I took with me had no idea the acting was computer-animated. She knew something was slightly off, but she assumed it was a side-effect from the blurriness of the 3D IMAX format.<br/><br/>Over here, it seems to have been given a 12A rating. Which is so wrong. The first minute lulls you into a false sense of comfortableness, before it's all blown apart in five harrowing minutes of gore, up close in CGI.<br/><br/>Once I got home, of course I had to look it up on Wikipedia. And while a lot of it did seem to have the Hollywood treatment, I was surprised at how much of it had been ""changed"" from the original story. Then again, the original tale has probably been augmented a lot (to say the least) over the years..."
"Psiju","6","4","13","17 November 2007"," Mediocre.
","Over the past few years I have enjoyed the progress of animated film making, PIXAR often giving the most noteworthy contribution.<br/><br/>However, BEOWULF is a step backwards in what animated film making should be.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the film drags. It attempts to stretch a 40-minute-or-so plot over a period of two hours, resulting in a lot of dead space where no progress in the story is made. Useless, predictable lines are uttered and shots are held out longer for ""emphasis"" in the place of quality storytelling, hallmarks of uninspired direction.<br/><br/>Throughout most of the film, we see VERY impressive artwork--great textures, great models, great hair, skin, water etc. Some characters are better than others. The better ones not only look real, but possess a great deal of character.<br/><br/>However, most of this cool, realistic-looking stuff doesn't MOVE right, despite the fact that a lot of the animation is motion-captured. This severely affects how characters emote throughout most of the film. What results are awkward and inexpressive performances from the virtual actors. Only a handful of shots in the film actually had heart and soul in the animation, where characters actually emote properly. Unfortunately, these were in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>When Beowulf is put next to Ratatouille or Shrek, the difference in animation and quality of storytelling is immediately noticeable. It feels as though PIXAR and Dreamworks really care about the movement and expression of the characters and the pacing of the story. In addition, they manage to pull off better screen writing in their animations. BEOWULF pales in comparison in these regards.<br/><br/>It's not good animation, and should be discouraged in modern film making. 5 out of 10."

","First of all, and this is a point that was so annoying that I never really got to asses all the other aspects of the movie, the movie is digitalized or animated. For some unknown reason everything in the movie was covered with a layer of animation. This means that you never saw any acting going on. For a comedy this might work but for a movie with both tragedy and drama this is really a very unwise decision in my humble opinion. And why in heavens employ expensive actors when you are going to cover their appearance with digital effects? How they really acted or chose to interpret their character we will never know and in order to like this movie you have to be indifferent towards this. I cannot hide that I was at first quite confused and then right after very frustrated when I realized this. The animation effect was furthermore very, very amateurish. It is difficult to asses whether the animation guys on purpose had chosen to distort the facial characteristics of the actors but either way this was what happened and that was also very annoying.<br/><br/>There isn't very much I can underline as positive. The Vikings are being portrayed as a gang of drunken and obscene imbeciles and Beowulf is the bragging hero who like to walk around naked.<br/><br/>If you are considering spending your evening with this movie I would strongly advice against it and instead recommend Shrek 3 to you; it has trolls, heroes, dragons and animation too and on top it has a lot of humor...;-)<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

","I'm writing this comment mainly to inform those about to go see the movie about one important fact - the whole thing is COMPUTER ANIMATED. And utterly poorly at that.<br/><br/>I had somehow missed this little fact before I went to see it, and as the titles left the screen and the action started, I was more disappointed than I can find words to describe. Instead of an hour and a half of LOTR-style fantasy, what I got was something more akin to watching my nephew play one of his online fantasy computer games.<br/><br/>Computer graphics are fine. If used in good taste, and for the right reason; in the modern cartoon style of for example Shrek or Ratatouille, or as enhancement and backup of real-life action, as in the aforementioned Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>But why someone would choose to make an ENTIRE movie in the plastic, lifeless, stale, computer game-like style of Beowulf, is utterly beyond me. The computer models are made as likenesses of the real actors. Or perhaps superimposed somehow over real footage of them, I don't know. But the result is some sort of bastard mix of computer animation seemingly mixed with real life action, that I don't honestly don't understand how anyone can find entertaining in the least. It falls completely in between two chairs - it's neither good enough to pass for real life action; nor does it go ""all computer"" and make use of the tool that computer graphics are, to it's full artistic potential.<br/><br/>It just looks bad. And meanwhile, you know that the actors are doing their job behind those computer model likenesses, which is beyond frustrating - all that hard work gone to waste behind Beowulf's tasteless, artificial exterior. Having some people act out the script with their characters in World of Warcraft (a online fantasy roleplaying game), and just taping that, would have been cheaper for the producers."

There are still some work to be done in capturing a realistic gate of a horse running and here and there the movements are jerky. But all in all, this is a technological achievement.<br/><br/>Story wise, the film is pretty good. The bravado encompassed in Beowulf's exclamation of ""I am Beowulf"" perfectly captures the essence of the character. There is an uncomfortable exhibitionism about Beowolf. He seems intent on meeting his enemies in the ""barest"" possible setting. If you can get passed Beowulf fighting ala commando, you will enjoy the story and action. The film does start out a bit shaky, but once Beowulf shows up, it picks up pace and we are transported into a fun story. <br/><br/>There has been a lot of advances done with motion capture over the years. At times, you forget this is animated and get pulled into the movie through the character moments where they are thinking, contemplating their next movie.

Insight (not necessarily historically accurate) into the Beowulf poems, but definitely stays in the spirit of the myth. Nice addition - showing Beowulf as a fallible hero.

Good use of Norse (or Olde English?) in critical places throughout the movie..<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>* Not enough Angelina :-) although her character, when she(it) appears, is very striking with her ""suit"" of liquid gold. <br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>* While the main characters like Beowulf and Hrothgar seem to have had MUCH attention paid to the detail of their CGI generated faces (esp. the male characters who look just like their reality counterparts), the more minor the characters seemed to get, the more they looked like they came out of Goth version of Shrek. Also, they apparently decided to use the same algorithm for the motion of ALL the horses in the movie - which made them look comically mechanical - straight out of a video game.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Although the violence borders on over-the-top, it's still a great movie to see with your older children. It may inspire them to read the original poems. It might have worked better as a series of movies in a chronicle series.<br/><br/>This film generally ONLY works well because it is done entirely in CG. A live action version attempting the same effect would be entirely ludicrous. Its a testament to how far CG has come just within the last six years since ""Final Fantasy"""

The 3D effect is fully enmeshed with the developing of the story, and the plot is so dynamic that you have little time to think things out, you just let yourself go and enjoy the wonderful images. Maybe the plot does not follow the original literature sources, maybe you'll find a little too many nude and sexy ingredients sown here and there to drag you into the film, OK, but... who cares?

","I found this film to be virtually unwatchable. It is nothing more than a sequence of ""gee! see what I can do in CG"" scenes. There is nothing here that enables the viewer to identify with nor care about the characters, and that is a fatal flaw in an epic adventure if not in most movies/stories in general.<br/><br/>CG and visual effects can be useful to enhance the movie experience and/or to help tell a story that might otherwise be impractical to film as real action or settings. However, CG or animated characters are very difficult to identify with unless the actors, writers, and director focus extensively on creating an emotional tapestry that pulls in the viewer. Without the latter, a film devolves into a mere series of images and scenes that will have little if any impact.<br/><br/>Beowulf makes the mistake described above, and it is clearly reflected in the flat performances of the voice actors. Despite having a cast with several A-list and award-winning thespians, all of them sounded like they were reading from scripts. I don't doubt that they found it difficult to bring the ""story"" to life in their own minds given the complete-animation format, and the director clearly did nothing to address this fundamental problem.<br/><br/>As computer game, Beowulf might have had a chance, but as a film it is a complete waste of time.

On flat screen, the CG of the humans is not convincing for the most part. If you want a better movie on this subject, see ""Beowulf and Grendel,"" directed by Sturla Gunnarsson. I do like my movies to be reasonably accurate, and I found enough errors to be irritating, though not more so than the norm for movies about the era.

","I don't quite understand what it is about purveyors of work such as this that leaves them w/ the impression that, through gross distortion of original source material, they can convey something more resonating than a 1000+ y.o. masterpiece of literature. Is there a self-loathing in them so great that they are unable to celebrate even the possibility of goodness in man so powerfully depicted in the ancient poem? While you might be able to paint the poem's hero as overly pleased w/ his feats, his portrayal as a venal dissembler is an atrocity which destroys this film. Others here have very well documented the heavy-handed, wearisome creep of ""political correctness"" and emasculation into the film (""I said no and meant no""--gracious)so I'll spare great detail. Just know this is a tragically missed opportunity to dedicate a large studio budget toward bringing to life one of the great stories of all time. I agree w/ the poster who hopes another, wiser, director will give it another chance.<br/><br/>I still gave it a 2, as some of the technical mastery in the visual presentation must be acknowledged."
"TheUnknown837-1","3","2","5","26 January 2008"," a film that overdoes itself and relies too much on its special effects
","""Beowulf"" was a sore disappointment for me, especially since I was expecting so much more from a talented director like Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, etc). His recent medieval monster movie based on an old English poem of the same name, is a messy, under-developed, poorly written, and over-reactive high-budget film that unfortunately descends into schlock. It revolves around a hero named Beowulf who likes to hunt and fight monsters and is out to fight a creature called Grendel, who has developed a sudden and unfavorable habit of attacking a local kingdom. Grendel has a sadistic mother, yet another opponent for Beowulf and his men. It was a very fine idea that could have been wonderful and glorious, but is boring and sometimes disturbing.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is an extravagant treat. The special effects, though not convincing at all times, are plentiful and compelling. The 3-D models that substitute in for the actors during impossible-to-perform scenes are convincing, the monsters look real, and so on and so forth. But like I mentioned in my summary, the movie relies too much on its visuals and not enough on substance. The character of our story are weak, boring, uninteresting, too simple to be compelling, and oftentimes very irritating. While there were some good performances from Ray Whinstone and Anthony Hopkins, it didn't really help any.<br/><br/>So if character development is poor and visuals are good, does that make ""Beowulf"" a film that can just be enjoyed for what it is? Sadly, no. It still lacks substance that is present in numerous, much better mindless action movies of the same genre and order. There is not enough action for a two-hour mindless action movie, and some action sequences are completely preposterous. Such as the idea of a naked man doing somersaults through the air while fighting a monster. Or sliding down the belly of a sea monster while slicing its belly open and pouring impossible amounts of blood into the water. Overall, there are many preposterous moments in the film that devoid us of any entertainment value. It almost seems comical, but is too perturbing to be even that.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Beowulf"" is a major disappointment. Even under command of a talented director such as Robert Zemeckis, the film can not work out. It begins as weakly and strangely as it ends."

","Went to see this movie in a regular theater without 3D and it was really bad, so I went to the customer service center and asked them if my wife and I could pay the extra and go to the 3D IMAX. We paid the extra $4.00 each and got the glasses and sat down just as the movie was starting. WOW what a difference. It was like we were watching a completely different movie. It was really great. The story was the same but the visual experience was completely different. This was by far the best 3D movie we have ever seen. My wife kept grabbing my arm as spears and blood and guts kept flying at us. If you are going to pay money to see this movie in a theater, then you have to see it in 3D. Otherwise don't waste your money. They should have never let this movie be released without 3D. Without 3D this film is just like a bad Saturday morning cartoon.

","Spielberg prot√©g√© Zemeckis continues his animated adventures by bringing the classic epic poem of 'Beowulf' with a script provided by Neil Gaiman (Sandman) and Roger Avery (Pulp Fiction, Killing Zoe}.<br/><br/>Being an animation fan I couldn't wait for this one. The CGI animation keeps getting better and better. A few more generations and you may see a huge shift at the Cineplex. The invention of the 'Real D' technology helps to sell it even more with an absolutely jaw dropping experience. So jaw-dropping in fact I don't think that it will translate too well in 2D and the small screen. Being a huge Neil Gaiman fan and having loads of respect for Roger Avery I was even more interested in it but the screenplay is big on sight gags but a little weak otherwise. It may be due to the shortcomings of the source poem since I only vaguely recall reading it in school. 'Beowulf' is a great theatrical experience that probably will not translate very well on home video."

Some lines in Old English spoken by Grendel. The music was splendid, very complimentary to the era. (Thank goodness it wasn't rock and roll!)<br/><br/>The Bad: First and foremost: Grendel's design. For some reason he's a deformed kid with an ear problem... Not scary, just kind of goofy. And, for some reason they decided to make him Hrothgar's and Grendel's mother's love child. Now that's messed up! Even more messed up: The dragon ended up being Beowulf's and Grendel's mother's kid. <br/><br/>Most of the characters weren't very likable. Beowulf always found a way to get naked, Hrothgar had no shame and was suicidal, Grendel's mother was a sex maniac instead of a monster... and the list goes on. <br/><br/>All in all, probably worth a watch or two.

The 3D puts you in the action like no other film up until now. All of the main action scenes are fantastic, especially Beowulf's battle against a dragon. The movie is pretty funny (even a bit silly at points) and very enjoyable. Some parts were a little weak but nothing so bad that it detracts from the whole.

","It's just a average popcorn movie with fantastic 3d graphic. It just ended too fast for me. I went to the cinema with very high expectation (The trailer is amazing), but at the end i can just conclude that Beowulf is an average heroic movie. If i rate 300 with 8, and troy with 7, Beowulf rating is below both of this movie. I think the director is too much focusing on the graphic performance instead of the storyline. it is below my expectation, actually i expect this movie not far below 300 storyline quality.

This movie is so monstrously well-made and it covers up from the ugly-ass Grendel and up until the slaying of Beowulf's son a.k.a. the whooped-ass Golden Dragon guy and by the way, Beowulf dies..<br/><br/>After first viewing at the movie theaters, I never expected a thunderous eruption of applause at the end by the audience!

"timcarter152","8","3","10","19 November 2007"," ""Are you not entertained?!""... whoops, wrong movie... ""THIS IS SPARTA!""... okay, one more go... ""I AM BEOWULF!""
","(Note: If the film is in IMAX 3-D (as I saw it), then this film gets a 9).<br/><br/>I AM BEOWULF! Man, I couldn't even count how many times he shouted that in this movie. Anyway, for my latest review, I'll take a look at the new film from Robert Zemeckis, ""Beowulf"", which is based on an old folk tale that I've never read. Fortunately, you won't have to have read that story to enjoy ""Beowulf"".<br/><br/>The Positives: -Visually and aurally, this film is phenomenal. It's unlike just about anything you've ever seen before, and it's a masterful showcase of motion capture technology. Plus, you know that problem with ""The Polar Express"" where the characters occasionally looked creepy? Well, they pretty much fixed that here. -The performers all do a very good job of playing their characters. I especially liked Crispen Glover's portrayal of the monster Grendel, and I actually felt pity for him when he was put to rest. -The action scenes are great, and are by far the best aspect of ""Beowulf"". The climactic battle between the aged Beowulf and the dragon is absolutely breathtaking (and yes, I do realize that I sound as if I'm begging to be quoted).<br/><br/>The Negatives: -The story itself is good but not great, and for a fantasy or epic battle film, I often expect the story to be great. This isn't a huge problem, mind you, but I simply felt that the story was missing something (which, yes, I can't put my finger on). -The movie doesn't start all too strongly, and the earlier half of the film has occasional jokes that come close to being groan-inducing. The acting also seems a bit weaker at the start. Fortunately, the film's quality improves as it goes along, and it reaches true greatness once Beowulf prepares to encounter Grendel's mother (played by Angelina Jolie... but you already knew that, didn't you?) -This is a small quibble, but when Beowulf decides to fight Grendel... er... naked, other guys in the audience (myself included) may feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>My 3 choice words: Revolutionary, Exhilarating, Gorgeous."
"honorhorror","8","3","10","16 November 2007"," Great attempt to eliminate boundary between animation and real-person movie, although didn't surpass God of War.
","This is a great attempt to eliminate boundary between animation and real-person movie. Note that the movie's budget is 70,000,000 dollars which is way lower compared to early movies like ""Final Fantasy""(2001). However, ""Final Fantasy""(2001) is a failure for a movie, especially one everyone was expecting to deliver some real material. Beowulf is highlighted as it's violent and gory, as alluring as the beauties animated.<br/><br/>Earlierly, the definition of 3D cartoon movies was almost a copyright of Disney(Pixar). The characters are all comically simple, and their movements are all cartooned jerks convincing in the imagined world of the makers(remember the movements of humans in Incredibles and Rattatoulie). All the others withing this genre also avoid to be realistic. Instead, the emphasis would be jokes which is predominantly a theme for American-style CGI cartoons. Now in Beowulf, all the humans are in normal size and figures, winding the swords and axes humanly instead of comically. To realize the natural interactions of hundreds of different roles isn't a piece of cake for any studio, not even anyone in Pixar. And, don't you think it's a great idea to make something for grown-ups only to change the concept of 3D cartoon? Feel the lights and shadows on Beowulf and Angelina Jolie's skins.<br/><br/>Plus, Beowulf is not simply some video-game alike slaughtering fast-food movie, although a lot of people expected it to be(I was one of them). Note that more than half of the movie was about the dramatical main role Beowulf's conversation with other people(or demons), therefore the hardship to overcome in making could be the detailed, sometimes implied expressions and feelings of the characters. Every movement of faces can be considered as a single piece of art, not to mention the tragic fates combined with North Europe's severe climate. If you concentrate on humanity drama of Beowulf, you won't be disappointed for sure.<br/><br/>But, Beowulf is not perfect. although I sincerely appreciate the effort Robert Zemeckis took to make this superb reality-approximating animation, I have to point out the weakness lies within the PACE. If you've ever played the PS2 game ""God of War"", you would surely be expecting Beowulf for some non-stop fighting sequences shot in the harsh, bloody myth style seasoned with cool lines. Don't worry the movie surely contains all these elements, but they fell apart. All these elements are not combined efficiently enough to make your blood boil. Every time, the battle finished too fast after our hero enters his full-loaded fighting status. If the director could put all 3 sequences of fighting together and edit them to be like in ""God of War"", we will surely be awed by it. Stated in general, Beowulf is not equipped with enough exciting moments.<br/><br/>Simply there are no twists in the movie, the theme is simple and 90% of the story can be predicted. But if you are interested in seeing the best real-human-size animated drama so far, you should go to cinema now."
"eastbergholt2002","8","3","11","18 November 2007"," Modern Viking Hero
","Beowolf is an entertaining action movie. I vaguely remembered the story from long ago English lessons, so I expected the film to be dull but worthy, but it was enjoyable and often gripping. The dialog is cleverly written and you soon forget you are watching animated characters. Beowolf as a hero, would not be out of place in Marvel or D.C. Comics. The film also has a sense of humor. <br/><br/>Liberties are obviously taken with the original story so that Beolwolf is depicted as a hero with character flaws and marital problems. These these adjustments probably make the film more palatable to modern audiences and make him appear more sympathetic. The story starts with a Danish king (Hopkins) who is being terrorized by a monster called Grendel. He sends for help and Beowolf arrives from Sweden with his team of warriors. Beowolf is initially made to seem like a silly, loud-mouthed braggart, but he quickly proves he is brave and up to the challenge. Beowolf likes to fight fairly and brawls with monsters in the buff.<br/><br/>The ""cast"" are excellent although, the accents seem all over the place. The digitalized Beowulf combines the head of a twenty-something Ray Winstone (who is fat and fifty) with the body of a superhero. Winstone also sounds like a Swede who has spent a lot of time in south London. Robin Wright Penn is a Danish queen who sounds Welsh. Angelina Jolie who plays Grendel's mother has a strange unidentifiable accent and spends most of her time on screen naked and in high heels. Her character is a beautiful yet vicious seductress who charms men by offering them sexual favors. It's a fun movie."
"MOOVYZ","7","3","11","17 November 2007"," This is the beginning of a new era in Cinema!
","OK, let me start by saying that I knew nothing of the Beowolf poem/legend, etc. going in. From reading the reviews here, I guess that was a good thing. Most fans of the story are not liking this adaptation.<br/><br/>But from a simply cinematic position, this movie is stunning! The story (and I won't go into it here, enough of the others will fill you in) is just so,so. Ordinary, shallow dialog that's often hard to understand. The performances are fine, but then they are basically CGI/animated, so what can you expect. The facial expressions and movements are stiff and the eyes, although better than Polar Express, are still lifeless.<br/><br/>But again, the visuals are stunning. The 3D version is the ONLY one to watch. I think those who have panned this movie so badly must have seen it in 2D. I can't even imagine how boring and flat that must have been. The movie is always and only about the new 3D. This is the first (not really the first, but the first in wide spread normal theaters that have been updated with new digital screens and projectors) in what I think will be a steady staple of great 3D pictures in the future. (one of the previews was for the first-ever live action 3D... coming soon... looks great!). In the first few scenes there's a bit too much of things coming at you as the director is showing off his new toy, but then the movie settles in for a great cinematic visual experience. It's actually so good, that there are few things that really stick in your mind as you leave the theater. It all is visually stunning, not just a scene or 2. The ""RealD"" 3D glasses are much better than the old style, yet not up to Imax quality yet. And they have a tendency to make the entire film seem too dark ( a few times I peeked above the glasses and it was far brighter) but overall it was very enjoyable to watch. Angelina looks especially good naked and in 3D! As I said, the movie is just so so for acting, story and dialog. But it gives us a glimpse into the future of the 3D cinematic experience that is coming. Within the next few years, something will come along completing the rest of the equation and we will see a movie that is stunning in every aspect in this amazing new format.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 for the pioneering of a relatively new format!"

","Well overall the movie was not bad at all. I might have gone so far as to say it was ""good"" had I not been familiar with the ACTUAL story of Beowulf.<br/><br/>A more appropriate title for the movie would be ""A story vaguely based on BEOWULF"". In all seriousness, this classic story that has survived the ages was utterly defiled in favor of cheap Hollywood style sexual drama. These parts were so poorly put together that it really seems like Angelina Jolie blackmailed the writers to change the script the night before.<br/><br/>It was full of good action however, and a couple laughs, but the modern clich√©'s detracted from the epic nature of the story. It's worth seeing if you're a technology fanatic because this is the best piece of computer generated graphics that I have ever seen. In some parts the motions are kind of strange, but in others, the renders are so beautiful and photo-realistic."
"tman90","9","3","11","16 November 2007"," I am Beowulf.
","If you've taken the 11th year of high school, you should know the epic poem of Beowulf. The poem is beautifully, but sometimes comically (in a bad way) brought to the screen by newly 3D whiz Robert Zemeckis and an all star cast, an two very hard working writers.<br/><br/>The film and the poem are very similar while at the same time being very different. The plot lines are identical and some of the phrases are recognized in the character's dialogue. However, the film is missing the back story of Hrothgar. The audience is unsure of why Grendel is attacking the kingdom except for the mention that the lands are cursed. There is no mention that the curse is on Hrothgar himself for a past sin he committed against his brother. Speaking of Grendel, the portrayal of his appearance was surprising. Instead of what the general reader may picture- a gigantic, hairy beast- Grendel is nothing of the sort. Instead, he is an extremely ugly over-sized skinny human that looked like the skin was peeled off of his body and was burned in some places. He jaw is crooked forcing his words to come out slurred and inaudible. Words? That's right, Grendel speaks. Only to his mother of course, but the fact that he speaks is thought provoking because a reader may wonder back to try and recall any time in the poem that specifies he can actually talk. Grendel also has a personality in a way. The viewer almost pities him- feels bad for him because of the horrible whining he makes when things get too loud. Contrary to the image from the novel which had Grendel bumbling around destroying whatever he saw just because he was a monster. One difference that was a bit disappointing was the killing of Grendel. An iconic image in the reader's mind is Beowulf holding the arm of the monster high into the air. But instead, Beowulf's right hand man, Wiglaf, is the one who raises it into the sky for all to gaze upon. Now, personally, as a reader who only read to the aforementioned scene in the poem, the rest of the movie was a brand new story to me. Thus, I can not talk too strongly about differences and similarities now, but one thing that intrigued me was something I thought too big of a plot hole to not be in the poem was the insinuation and later proved fact that Hrothgar slept with Grendel's mother, which in turn produced Grendel himself. I found that shocking and exciting at the same time. Even more exciting to watch Beowulf make the same mistake Hrothgar made by giving in to temptation rather than standing for what he believes in- fighting for honor- and becoming victim to Grendel's mother's seduction. The themes of the film seem to include the power and vulnerability of temptation along with Old English literature themes.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was very entertaining and fun to watch. I would definitely recommend to the fantasy/adventure/action fan, the readers of the poem, and almost anyone other than young children and the squeamish. The technology of the movie was breathtaking and sometimes hard to believe it was animated. Although, it made me wonder- would it have less of a comical feel is it was shot live-action rather that computer animated? Nevertheless, the style works for the epic/fantasy feel of the film and I definitely will be sure to see it again."

","I don't understand why lots of people are commenting on the movie being like 'shrek' only different? There are no talking donkeys or green ogres and it isn't strictly for kids, it obviously had less action then it first looked like it would (that is why it has only received 9 rather than 10) but as a Fantasy movie it is superb. The poem of Beowulf has served as one of the key corner stones for all fantasy (even influenced LotR). <br/><br/>Presentation: The beautiful CGI is fantastic, all the characters look amazing. Sometimes the characters have a plastic look but its never to serious (and it was done in a stylish way). People complain that you are being shown 3D just for sake of '3D' but the truth is it looks outstanding and if I had made it I would want it to be shown a bit.<br/><br/>Story: Is a decent fantasy story and superbly presented<br/><br/>Voice Acting: The Voice Acting is fantastic, they use actual danish accents at points combined with other light accents which you notice but doesn't ruin the film. Ray Winstone fits the character perfectly and so does everyone else. Grendels voice is fantastically portrayed. <br/><br/>Action: The action is superb in the fight scenes. The last one being purely amazing.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Even though I was let down by the lack of action, the film looks fantastic but the story falls perfectly into fantasy and is what you expected (some people have said it wasn't plausible, its a fantasy film what do you expect. Are you saying LotR was?)<br/><br/>9/10 - Highly Recommend seeing this movie especially in IMAX, Digital or 3D. It is utterly superb. Excellent Fantasy Movie that should not be compared to 300 and Shrek, its in a totally different genre and secondly 300 was a hybrid of real people and CGI whilst Beowulf is complete CGI."

However, what you might not know is that the praised visuals in Beowulf are no more impressive than that of a next-generation video game console, that Angelina Jolie's screen-time is minimal (lesser even than in the text from which the screenplay was adapted), and that, though Gaiman and Avery's adaptation is fair for a 3D-intended blockbuster spectacle, it lacks what made the historic poem so true: the sullenness of the main character, who hid behind a fa√ßade of heroism and prestige, only to be poisoned by his own secrecy and hollowness, and the knowledge that his glory came birthed from the lies he'd told. Don't get me wrong, Beowulf is entertaining¬ópretty darn entertaining, in fact¬óand contains enough blood and eroticism to gratify a young boy's lust for such things, but its aspirations seem to end there. What could have been a condensed LOTR-esquire experience falls far short of anything close, and ends up where our supposed hero did, lost between what it tries to be and what it actually is."

Yes, when the movie begin, the movie's visual is sweet at first sight. After so long, you'll get tired of it. Most of the time the characters looked plastic and dull, which eventually provokes no emotions to the acting/story at all.

I should have counted but I think there was a total of 20 lines per actor in the whole damned movie. There couldn't have been more awkward moments between characters because of a lack of dialog and good acting. To say that you simply didn't care about any of the characters is an understatement. Does anybody even know what Malkovich's character was there for? I mean holy **** people! Please, if you see a review higher than 1 star for this crap, it's purely for promotional reasons!"

This is a video and audio Tour De Force (Angelina isn't bad either).<br/><br/>I'd just like to say that given the ancient and epic source of this story it couldn't have been better made. every frame memorable, clever use of the 3-d feature and exciting like no other film since Return of the King.

","I won't go into 3D or story since most have covered it. Yep, gory-bloody and I would not take an under-12 to it. Loved the scenery, loved the dragon, as someone who loves Old English it was a delight to actually hear it in the movie - but, man, I just could not get into these plastic-looking, c-animated ''actors''. Just utterly, utterly unconvincing and I'm pretty good at suspending my disbelief. The vacant eyes; inaccurate mouth movements, limited facial expression, the clumsy graceless galloping of the horses. I've seen hand puppets with more emotion. As to the actors behind the faces - OK - but personally, I thought Beowulf looked more like Sean Bean. Again, visually, parts of it are a treat - but please combine real actors again with superb c-animation, like LOTR - which ticked all my boxes (although I'm still ticked off they left out Tom Bombadil and Goldberry, etc). I can't yet buy into the idea that films like this Beowulf are going to be the future. There's a place for them of course, but I prefer relating to real live actors. I'm not ready to sigh over plastic warriors. I also saw the last version of Beowulf and Grendel with - omigosh - real actors and preferred that over this. To each his own, I guess."
"ExpendableMan","6","2","6","18 November 2007"," This is not Sparta
","Robert Zemeckis clearly wasn't paying attention the last time Hollywood tried to make 3D films, otherwise he'd have been party to forgettable trash like Friday the 13th 3D or the third Jaws movie and most likely, decided to dismiss it and release Beowulf as a regular film. Regardless of how good you might consider the finished product, sitting in a theatre watching it makes you realise how tacky the 3D gimmick is. Bodily fluids and weapons do not fly out of the screen at the audience, the only thing it adds is a degree of depth perception to the crowd scenes and a decrease in picture quality, where weapon edges are blurry and the screen isn't entirely in focus. Shame really, as a film, Beowulf is quite decent. It's not a masterpiece and there's bound to be a few purists out there driven to fury seeing a classic piece of literary prose turned into a silly piece of pop trash, but it's still quite fun in places. It's also got more brains than you might first realise.<br/><br/>The main reason behind this is that Zemeckis hasn't gone for a straight adaptation. The core story of Beowulf fighting a string of monsters one after the other is still there, but the central hero isn't the infallible stalwart he was in the fifth century. Here, Beowulf's mouth is as big as his biceps, his ego is so massive it casts a shadow and the story is as much about the creation of his myth as it is about fist fights with cave trolls. He's also an incredibly randy sod who finds it difficult to turn women down, which gets him into all manner of hot water throughout the course of the film.<br/><br/>Aside from the frustrating 3D meanwhile, Beowulf's biggest selling point is the motion capture animation and in close ups, it's remarkably impressive. Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Brendan Gleeson look fantastic, the detail so startling it's occasionally difficult to tell that it's not the real thing. When the camera pans out however, the cracks begin to appear. The extras are bland and ill-defined and in some cases look no better than extended cut scenes from Playstation 2 games. Thankfully, the characters still sparkle with warmth and emotion, but it's not a major leap forward by any means.<br/><br/>If there's one place where Beowulf shines though, it's the action scenes. Grendel's initial beer hall rampage is a bit dizzying, but the rest is fantastic to behold. Beowulf's flashback tussle with a pack of ravenous sea monsters is the first high point as he butchers his slippery foes in a series of ingenious ways, turning the sea crimson in a ludicrously macho five minute sequence that gets the adrenaline pumping in time for his naked rumble with Grendel. These are merely the warm up bouts however and his main event battle with a giant, golden dragon is a riot; serpent and Dane spilling down a mountain, crashing through forests, battling on bridges, plunging into the ocean and kicking seven bells out of each other in a jaw dropping brawl that should satisfy any action junkie's fix.<br/><br/>Thanks to the delirious violence and overtly macho storyline, Beowulf is perhaps the first film to benefit from 300's success earlier this year but sadly, it isn't as good as the Frank Miller movie. The central premise of a man making his own myth is surprisingly clever and the action scenes are a blast, but it's just not as instantly memorable. It's a fun way to spend a night out, especially if you psyche yourself up by listening to Viking metal like Turisas, Amon Amarth and Finntroll beforehand, but a fun night out is all it is. Fifteen hundred years from now, it's a safe bet that this version will be entirely forgotten while academics still write dissertations on the poem. Go and watch it for the blood, the thunder and the popcorn, but don't expect to witness the future of cinema."

"cashbacher","10","1","2","30 January 2019"," An epic old English poem reasonably expressed as a movie
","Beowulf is an ancient English epic poem of over 3,000 lines that is known as having been first written down sometime between 975 and 1025 CE. It is set in Scandinavia, a land of bitter cold, mountains, moors and mysteries. Beowulf is a traditional hero, coming to the aid of a king and kingdom besieged by a hideous monster, defeating it in battle and then being hailed as a hero.
When the original story opens, the mead hall of Hrothgar, King of the Danes, is attacked by the monster Grendel. Beowulf vows to kill the monster, which he does. Enraged by the death of her son, Grendel's mother seeks revenge, and in a second titanic battle, Beowulf succeeds in killing her as well.
Beowulf then returns to his own kingdom and assumes the position of king. Fifty years later, a dragon becomes enraged when a gold cup is stolen from its' lair. It emerges and begins burning everything it encounters. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon and Beowulf insists that he carry on the battle alone. Outmatched, Beowulf is losing the fight until his warrior friend Wiglaf disobeys orders and assists Beowulf. The dragon is killed, but Beowulf is mortally wounded, and the story ends with his funeral pyre burning.
The producers take some significant poetic license with the original story, specifically in the rendition of the battle between Beowulf and Grendel's mother and Beowulf's ascension to the throne. Yet, this is another demonstration of how the old epic poems of heroism can be made into quality modern movies.
It is unfortunate that Beowulf is not given more attention in K-12 English classes, for it is the northern European equivalent to the Iliad of Homer. With this movie as an educational aid, it will be much easier to generate interest among the students in this key element of Western Civilization."

","The 2007 film Beowulf is a good adaptation of the original text, making changes where necessary and tying up some lose ends. However, I the movie's style is quite peculiar. The entire time watching the movie, everything seemed out of place due to the animation style, bordering on the uncanny valley. Some of the movements were perfect, yet others seemed unnatural. Additionally, there were many unnecessarily long shots in the movie, that left me wondering why they felt the need to zoom out of the scene for 20 seconds, rather than just panning out for a shorter amount of time. The same effect is gained in a shorter time, and it just felt like padding for the movie. For all my gripes with the movie, Grendel was portrayed very well, they did an excellent job making him look disgusting and detestable. Beowulf's final fight with the dragon, while different from the story, offered a satisfying conclusion to the movie. Overall, there was nothing fantastic about the movie, and the odd animation style was off-putting for me, which is why I'm giving the movie 4/10 stars."

","A lot of things have been said about Beowulf that are entirely undeserved. Amazing, a masterpiece, the best movie of the year... Beowulf is none of these things. <br/><br/>When this movie came out, it was recommended to me that i avoid it, because it was not worth the money. I should have listened. They should have also explained, that it was not worth the time. Allow me to explain. I am aware that this film is entirely CG. It was made clear to me within seconds of it. The poorly textured skin, the bad motion capture, the poor fluid dynamics, everything about this film stuck out like a sore thumb. Perhaps i noticed more because visual effects is what i do for a living, but even with that, no other film i have EVER watched (and i am not exaggerating) has EVER given me a worse case of filmmakers sickness. Many movies i have watched where the CG is noticeable, but its never brought me out of the story to this extent where i can't even pay attention to anything else. And don't get me wrong, i was still about to excuse it, hoping i would look it up and find a 10 million dollar budget, or perhaps less. But no, this movie cost a whopping 130 million. All of which was p√Æssed carelessly down the drain.<br/><br/>The creators say it was a CG masterpiece. It was not. I've seen students that make better work for their first character design portfolio. They could have bothered to use normal maps or bump maps to create a more realistic skin textures, especially considering the amount of skin shown. They didn't. They supposedly used next gen motion capture. I was surprised to find they even used it at all. They could have done better with a decent animator and some blend shapes. With that kind of budget they should have used Realflow, with simulated fluid dynamics instead of the cheap wave displacements that don't even interact with the characters in the water. they didn't even use a Fresnel shader on the water, it was so freaking amateur. the only decent work was done in the design of Grendel and the sea monsters, and that was in imagination, rather than detail. None of the characters had life to them, the recoil of limbs, a sense of tissue, recoil, anticipation. The animators straight up didn't know the 12 basic principles of animation. <br/><br/>Lets remember, this is 2007. We can't bash something that was done 7 years ago can we? Yes, we can. The incredible hulk came out a year later with only 30 million more of a budget, and a hyper realism that put this movie to shame, like child's play. Assassins creed II came out just 2 years later with considerably MORE CG elements, 3 cities worth including a variety of landscapes and only a 30 million budget, less than a 4th of what this movie cost, and rendered it with a considerable amount of detail, reflections and depth of field IN REAL TIME that came close to what this movie accomplished with offline render farms, of a major studio. Just recently watchdogs was released, with a budget of 68 million and graphics that pretty much beat Beowulf to a pulp, also in real time. And lets remember, these are video games we are talking about. They have poly counts to worry about, and part of that budget went to programmers, and level designers, there is absolutely NO excuse why Beowulf should have created the garbage it did with the budget it had, and the 4 or so locations it even dealt with. What, you can't even hire a dynamics expert? You're really going to burst a frigging piece of wood into a mist of stock footage splinters rather than the more realistic approach, 3D prefracturing and hard body sims? I could do that with just 100$ and the action essentials pack and it still would look better. You're frigging kidding me here.<br/><br/>I could go on all day about the graphics, terrible blood hits, that weird gold coating Angelina Jolie--Angelina Jolie? Seriously?--but you know what, lets address what else is wrong with the film. For one, they completely ruined a classic short story. The dialog is so corny. The characters are all f*cked in the head, and they're not even good caricatures of scumbags, they're just plain unbelievable. And when i say unbelievable i mean those characters could not and would not exist under any circumstances and if they did exist and you put them into a room together they would not behave as such. One moment the dude is kicking his slave the next he is talking about honor and glory? Or the drunken king who's clothes basically fall off and then the next minute he's a fighter and a hero and then the next he's a poor man begging for help? I mean make up your mind godd√•mn it. And the worst part is, in the story he's nothing like that. Beowulf doesn't f*ck Grendels mother either. And she's not pretty. And Grendel isn't a whiny little b√Ætch. And i'm not sure he even speaks. And there's this whole part they left out about ever hero trying and failing, and this epic battle as Grendel's mother drags Beowulf down under the lake that i was really hoping to see, instead the dude just basically jumped in the water and then hopped out in the underground cavern all Mario like, like he doesn't even need to grab ahold of something and pull himself out, he can just swim jump. Its f*cking stupid man. I hate you people. Next time the producers have millions of dollars to p√Æss away, give it to me. Or maybe flush it down the toilet. The toilet would find a better use for it."

","Started watching this movie again last night. Got as far as 'Beowulf's' line: 'I will kill your monster!' delivered by actor Ray Winstone in an outrageous 'Cockney' accent. All that was missing was 'Orrite Guvnah?' at the end. 'Beowulf' is one of those movies you wish was fabulous as it's such a great story and great cast including Sir Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich, but on top of Winstone's 'Cockney Beowulf' the cgi renderings of the characters (apart from the Gollum-like 'Grendel') are woefully wooden. Also, the delivery of the lines by the other actors, even the usually compelling Malkovich, is as wooden as the cgi rendering of him. He looks like a deranged version of Max Wall. Zemeckis (who also made the equally terrible 'Polar Express', again using all cgi) should have used live action and green screen a la 'Lord Of The Rings'. For the next remake, I hope Peter Jackson picks it up, then it would be a fabulous movie... as long as he recasts the lead."

","Based on the epic poem, King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is attacked by monstrous troll Grendel (Crispin Glover).

He finds not just Grendel, but his mother (Angelina Jolie) as well.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis is using his motion capture CGI technology once again. It is a big improvement over 'Polar Express'. However the faces still lack a certain amount of life. Their eyes are still doll-like, but it's getting much better. This movie doesn't really answers the question of why. Other than a couple of interesting scenes, the movie could have easily been done better with live actors.<br/><br/>As for the story, it lacks a character to root for. The dialog is so stiff. The movie needs an antagonist more compelling than a muscle bound screaming hero. Nevertheless, the advancement in movie technology should be praised."
"gigan-92","7","1","2","30 September 2010"," Hoping It Had Been Live Action
","I'm surprised to see such a film coming from Robert Zemericks, I must say. Finally a movie on that epic poem of Beowulf that I read so much about in high school. Of course, I was expecting to see live action and to get the animation was a bit of a downer. It may look pretty close, but nothing beats the real deal.<br/><br/>For the voice cast we have some very good actors and actresses selected, like Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins. Playing Beowulf is Ray Winstone, who does great by the way. Grendel is a hell of a lot different than I always had imagined him. When I first read about it I had pictured him as a more reptilian type of being but¬Öyeah, he's kind of hard to describe in the film. Voiced by Crispin Glover, it was a more or less bad choice. Aside that, many differences between the poem and the film are present, some good, and some bad. Beowulf being a somewhat flawed man on the inside, something somewhat enjoyable. King Hrothgar being a womanizing alcoholic was something I found no point in honestly. However, the whole story arc concerning Grendel's mom as a seductress rather than a monster was unexpected and fun to figure out. First time I saw it, it definitely didn't hit me. How Grendel and the Dragon at the climax are children of power-hungry men, Hrothgar and Beowulf. It's really in-between the lines but a very interesting development. I just hate how she never dies¬Öa major annoyance considering Beowulf killed her in the poem not long after Grendel had been slain.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri is not a bad composer, and the animation is beautiful so all in all Zemericks did well. I guess it all depends whether or not you take it seriously because it's not live action. Kind of a ""The Incredibles"" type of thing. Animation belongs to family films, and gruesome hero flicks belong live-action."

","A monster Grendel is terrorizing the kingdom of king Hogarth. The vile beast must be slain and lo and behold, Beowulf, the great hero, comes with his men and he slays the monster by ripping its arm off. But the monster has a mother and as it also wants to revenge the death of her offspring, Beowulf must kill her as well.<br/><br/>Beowulf is well written and well told story. It has a solid soundtrack and some pretty bad ass action scenes as well some nicely twisted sense of humour. Yet I can't give it more than 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>The main reason for this is the way the movie has been made. The CGI looks great and the the makers have managed to bring a great deal of atmosphere to Denmark. But the characters seem lifeless and the animation seem very awkward in some places and there are even a couple of scenes in which the animation is plain bad. Ray Winstone does a good voice job, but there are some characters whose voice acting is plain and uninspired. Yes, I'm talking about John Malkovich here. And Anthony Hopkins ain't in his A game here either.<br/><br/>But as I said it is very well told and written story. I especially liked what they had done with Grendel. He's not just some brainless monster, but a pathetic, twisted shell, who is in constant pain. Even though he does terrible things you can't but to feel sorry for him because of the sins of his parents."

","I had know idea what to expect when i saw Beowulf because i had missed all the promotional material but boy was i pleasantly surprised. I will not talk about the technical aspects of the movie but what it said to me personally.<br/><br/>Beowulf as a character is arrogant, confident, engaging, commanding, entertaining , enthralling and totally exciting. He believes in his own hype so much that when he tells his fantastic stories you really don't have a choice but to believe him unless you are have already decided to hate him.<br/><br/>One of the two things that resonates with me though is the fact that here is this man who slays monsters and as a result is pretty well known if not a legend, larger than life, more than a man, but he is so easily seduced by the beauty and promises of the very creatures that he has crossed a sea to slay and that has already slain his own men .In this he proves he is just a man.<br/><br/>The second thing would be, after Beowulf has made the deal and recognized that it was a bad choice he is then confronted with the ultimate manifestation of his bad decision. He then acknowledges the true magnitude of his actions and accounts for it by battling the most horrific thing of all, his own demon, literally. Thus, proving that he may be just a man..... but he is also a true hero."

For the most part. l was zoned out before it was over. so he pulled it and put in IRON MAN, which eventually had me running for home as that definitely was not Tony Stark up on the big screen. Back to BEOWULF: the story is one of our earliest hero legends, about a warrior who slays a great monster, named Grendel. This cartoon movie loosely follows that story. It is difficult to watch, in a way very similar to POLAR EXPRESS, and was at this moment I should have realized it was a Robert Zemeckis flick. Robert, when will you stop screwing around with the imagery in your movies and just tell a decent story? For an adult, unless that adult is of a juvenile mindset, the film will be virtually unwatchable. It's all motion capture and green screen. I thought the hero should at least have been played by Sean Bean. This Beowulf looks remarkably like Bean but doesn't sound like him, as ""it"" was actually played by the guy who played Golum.

Not that that kept me from being entertained, understand, but I was still taken aback by such extreme revisionism. Other posters here have detailed the butchery, so I won't bother, but it's a shame that talented scripters like Neil ""Stardust"" Gaiman and Roger ""Killing Zoe"" Avary took a decade to deliver such a puerile, exploitative script. If they'd stuck to the real deal, I'd be willing to bet the film would have done better at the box office, but what do I know? The voice work is mostly impeccable, though I noticed a few instances in which the dialog didn't seem to match the animation. ""Beowulf"" sports plenty of star wattage: Ray ""The Departed"" Winstone, Anthony ""you have to ask?"" Hopkins, John ""ditto"" Malkovich, Crispin ""Willard"" Glover, the remarkable Brendan ""28 Days Later..."" Gleeson, Robin Wright ""Empire Falls"" Penn (who regrettably looks the least like her animated self), and the ever provocative Angelina ""Gia"" Jolie; all acquit themselves well, but fail to transcend the material, with the possible exception of Gleeson. As they say, it's tough to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.<br/><br/>The problem lies partly with the otherwise stunning visuals provided by Gentle ""Fight Club"" Giant Studios, Sony Pictures ""The Polar Express"" Imageworks, and W.M. ""Van Helsing"" Creations. The rendering of the human characters fails to instill them with any real life, particularly in the eyes, and leaves one feeling that one is watching an elaborate computer game. The result is that it's very difficult to establish any real identification with the characters, a fate that ""300"" suffered as well. More's the pity, since everything else is such a feast. It's all wonderful eye candy, thanks to Norman ""War of the Worlds"" Newberry's lush art direction and Doug ""The Polar Express"" Chiang's superb production design, but it all seems ultimately empty and forgettable. The lensing by Robert ""The Polar Express"" Presley swoops and soars, and must be extremely impressive when viewed in the intended 3-D format (even in 2-D, it's pretty daggone nice), while Jeremiah ""The Polar Express"" O'Driscoll's editing is clean and concise. Alan ""Night at the Museum"" Silvestri's score is evocative and not overly manipulative.<br/><br/>For empty-calorie viewing, ""Beowulf"" succeeds nicely. For devotees of the original epic poem/legend, the film fails in a big way; students of the literature will find nothing of interest here.

If he can do it, I don't know why a virtual Ray Winstone has to be shy.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film, and well worth a look."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","12 May 2008"," Contrived story and very bad graphics
","This film is about a hero called Beowulf in ancient Denmark, who kills monsters that plague the kingdom.<br/><br/>I was hugely disappointed with the animation. Many scenes are so badly faked that they hurt my eyes. For example, the scene where a soldier challenges the old Beowulf on the beach, the whole scene is so fake that it looks as if it is lifted off a badly animated video game. Lighting is bad and uniform, movements are unconvincing and faces look like plastic mannequins.<br/><br/>The bad animation already turns me off. It is not helped by the ultra simple story line. Many scenes are laughably contrived, such as John Malkovich's character challenging Beowulf and then makes up.Or old Beowulf's girl begging Beowulf not to go, and the girl runs away after Beowulf refuses.<br/><br/>People say ""Beowulf"" is visually fantastic and fascinating. My friends were thrilled about the film, but I did not feel the same way."
"jennys-saviour","2","1","2","30 April 2008"," The technology and the magic (Contains Major Spoilers)
","A few of my friends recommended I go and see Beowulf. They all said that the story wasn't much but that visually it was amazing and to make sure I see it in 3-D.<br/><br/>The story is almost frighteningly small. Beowulf turns up to a kingdom (and a small kingdom at that, it seems to be one hall big sometimes) to rid the king of a monster (WARNING SPOILERS from here on in) and does so only to find out the king was actually the father of the monster as he'd slept with the monsters mother who's also a monster but being played by Angelina Jolie helps make bestiality understandable.<br/><br/>Beowulf then becomes King, sleeps with the Monster Jolie and then a monster son comes after him. Only this time the monster is a dragon!<br/><br/>Sounds great doesn't it. Full of action! We'll to a degree it is full of action but the way producer/director Robert Zemekis was chosen to do it (entirely in 3-D CGI graphics) ends up destroying most of the excitement to be had from this story. The whole film being done as 3-D CGI graphics element stopped me from really getting into the film and the end result was a film that felt like an extremely overlong cut-scene from a video game.<br/><br/>I think this problem with relating to the characters isn't just because they're not real, anime and Fleischer Brothers cartoons have given us numerous characters that we've been able to relate to strongly. I found the original FIST OF THE NORTH incredibly moving when I first saw it. Same with PRINCESS MONONOKE and the original TRANSFORMERS movie<br/><br/>The problem is that BEOWULFS 3-D creations more resemble video game characters then actual animated characters. My 3-D animation teacher told me never to copy directly from real life as the actual animation ends up looking ""dead"". The key to a great animator is knowing the best way to over-emphasize. <br/><br/>In BEOWULF they used a special software that enabled them to capture the actors performances pretty much exactly but in the conversion to 3-D animation they have for the most part come out dead. The only two actors who escape this are John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie. These actors quirks are so strong that vestiges of their humanity still manage to come across in there on-screen avatars/characters. I never thought they're would be a way of stopping Ray Winstone (star of so many great films such as LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE AMAZING STAINS, SCUM, NIL BY MOUTH and SEXY BEAST) or Brendan Gleeson from giving magnetic performances but Robert Zemekis found a way. Poor Robin Wright Penn fairs the worst in this process. Such a great subtle actor, her performance is totally lost in the translation to 3D.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the finale of BEOWULF. In the end Beowulf must confront and single- handedly destroy the dragon. In the course of this he is thrown about, shot at with arrows, rides the dragon and nearly falls to his death. We'll in a live action film this would be completely riveting. The 1980's movie DRAGONSLAYER proved how incredible dragons could be in movies. That whole film was based on what an incredibly frightening sight they are. But unfortunately since you know that you don't have control over the video game looking and that all the things you are seeing are being controlled by artists via a computer program there's no reason to become to involved in what's happening on-screen.<br/><br/>The enjoyable things about BEOWULF are all technical. Seeing how detailed computer graphics have become and the new visual fluidity a camera is allowed in a 3-D environment. How realistic water and fire effects can be rendered. <br/><br/>The first 14mins (about the length of a He-man cartoon) are the best. The close ups of objects are great too, such as a shot of pebbles on the beach just before a horse comes crashing over the camera and scatters them. <br/><br/>The worst shots are the wide shots as they show just how cheap and fake 3D can be. One particular shot of Beowulf running on one side of a chasm with his troops on the other firing arrows at the dragon looked like a bad D & D video game. <br/><br/>What makes this sad rather then just a novelty is that Robert Zemeckis used to be such a great director and one of the things he was best with was memorable characters. Remember how many great characters there were in the Back To The Future series? Marty Mcfly, Biff, Doc Brown? All great!<br/><br/>Do you remember Forrest Gump? For all the anti-American sentiment of it in Australia I know plenty of people who found it incredibly emotionally moving and a large part of that was director and the actors attention to performance. It's telling that the most emotional shot in the whole film is a wide shot of Forrest telling his wife that despite his mental handicap he does understand love.<br/><br/>But in his last two outings something has gone terribly wrong. The technology has taken over the film. The vital human element has been lost under a plethora of pixels.<br/><br/>I can't think of anything about the Polar Express that would make me want to see it in the form it is or even show it to my younger relatives (those who are of the age to appreciate that sort of film). Same with BEOWULF! Nothing about the technical approach added to the film. If I had really gotten to see the real Ray Winstone playing Beowulf then maybe the small plot would have been less of a concern because I could have related to him. What's so baffling is that there already exists a successful formula for making ancient stories into great cinematic entertainment. It's called JIM HENSONS STORYTELLER and 90mins of that flies by."
"garythemessage","1","1","2","21 April 2008"," Why call this Beowulf?
","Wrong name for an average movie. I lost track of all the embellishments about 30 minutes into it, turned it off after Beowulf met up with Grendal's mother (in her lair). To name this ""Beowulf"" is ridiculous. Will there ever be a film that actually tells the story of Beowulf? No. Not as long as films are made to please the ignorant masses. This flick is about making money - not about making film or telling a proper story. Pass, unless you weren't interested in seeing the story of Beowulf.<br/><br/>Well, IMDb needs some more lines of text. I mean, really, when a movie completely removes the air from your pool toy - what can you say? After the film ""Beowulf and Grendal"" totally let me down, I thought this one would be different. WRONG! This one was probably worse. I could go into detail about every single embellishment, but other reviews have done that already. My biggest complaint was that Beowulf wasn't nearly big enough. He should have been huge, like the biggest man on earth. His arms and chest should have been massive. In the real story Beowulf held Grendal by the hand during their entire battle, then he literally ripped Grendal's arm off. Ripped it off with sheer strength. And what happened to the firesnakes? Didn't Beowulf have to swim through firesnakes to get to Grendal's lair? Nevermind. I'm sure this is enough text by now. Read some of the ""Hated It"" reviews to see all the ""mistakes"" this film made."

","I was fortunate enough to see this in cinema, however I don't think I would somehow spend 20 pounds on the DVD when it became available. Yes the film loosely follows the manuscript, however it fails to provide the sense of 'superlativity' that the poem was intended to provide. I digress, the film itself is one of those epics that will be remembered, it is in the ranks with 300, Ben Hur, Star Wars, LOTR and the likes of. However the animation is comparable to Shrek and the story line is comparable. Yes, it follows the path of a great warrior and yes it shows the traditional struggle of triumph over evil, but it's just too cheesy don't you think? The amount of angloisms (British based words and terminology such as 'bollocks' and 'wanks') leaves any non-British audience feeling slightly flummoxed, and the timescale from Beowulf as a young warrior to an aged king is immediate, which is not the way in which the original Old English Manuscript intended but also confusing to any audience. There is no doubt that Ray Winston, Brendon Gleeson and Anthony Hopkins performances were at their best throughout the entirety of the movie yet it lacks in that certain quality feel that will rank it highly amongst the greats of the 21st century. To the average audience such as myself when I first saw it, yes! this movie is great, full of action, swears, boobs and violence, yet to capture the true ideas of the poem written 1000 years ago, i feel it cheapens the memory of not only scribes and 'bards' of the era, but also its inhabitants. Yeah OK a good film all in all, very entertaining, but not wholly accurate and not wholly pleasing, decide for yourself."

","The best thing about the 2007 Beowolf is the performances and dialog appropriate to the story and setting. The second best thing was the background scenery. Where the movie fails is with its silly looking special effects which were NOT enhanced by the awful camera work and excessive zoom-lens jump-about. Also, I thought the story was weakened by a lack of camaraderie among the men.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is a true beauty and she did not need a ""nude scene"" where her breasts are enhanced with rubber to a 60+ size. How silly. Also, besides the rubber breasts, most of us prefer our women without over-sized scale-laden tails wagging like a T-rex. How does a man have sex with a creature like that? And why? What's the logistics of dealing with a 100 pound T-rex tail wagging all over creation? Since Beowolf does just fine with women his age or half his age he could ""just walk away"" from any woman with a questionable unsightly giant tail.<br/><br/>Sixty years ago Hollywood excelled in making outstanding pictures in this genre. But now they lack creative talent with the maturity to put the breaks on the Whiz Kids with all the fancy gadgets that simply wreck most 2007 movies. A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground."

The hubris of the screenwriters to think that they can improve on a story that has endured for more than 1000 years.

","I saw a bad copy of this film, so the animation looked like a computergame. I will definitely rent this when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>The story is simple but a good adventure. But being danish, I've never heard of Beowulf. But as I understand the myth is much more famous in England than here.<br/><br/>But still, there are things that I wonder why they can't get right, whenever they portray Denmark in foreign movies. First of all, we have no mountains here. This is a completely flat country with only big hills. But they don't come even close to real mountains. Secondly, we speak danish in Denmark, not English. I know this movie is made in the US, but they could at least speak with danish accents. It was the same problem with ""The Prince and me"". Appaerently the royal family in Denmark speaks English with a British accent and not danish. It just shows how little the Americans actually know of Denmark. The ones that have heard of our country, thinks it's the capital of Sweden.<br/><br/>But enough of that. Like I said I liked this movie, but I think it would have been much more entertaining and definitely much more impressive, if they had made this as a real movie. But I guess it would have been way to expensive to make. Or maybe it was because Ray Winstone who is old and overweight, could'nt have played the part as a young Beowulf.<br/><br/>Even though I saw a bad copy, I could still tell that animated actors still look fake. The technology hasn't improved since Final Fantasy.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was hot as Grendels mother. And she had a much nicer and curvier body than in real life. Impressive that they could take this bony actress and make her so sexy in an animated version.<br/><br/>But I have to wonder why they made this animated movie, when two real movies already has been made. The last one in 2005, from Iceland. And another one with Christopher Lambert from 1999.<br/><br/>I give this movie 5 out of 10. Maaybe I will rank it higher, when I see a good copy on DVD."

","It's hard to push animated movies for the older crowd, Final Fantasy: Spirits Within's abysmal box office performance made producers stray away from these types of productions. Enter Robert Zemeckis, who after Polar Express, takes another shot at this complex genre.<br/><br/>Set in a non-specific a.c. time, the movie tells the tale of one Beowulf, a hero sent to a land where king Hrotgar and his people are plagued by a (really)horrific monster named Grendel who begins attacking the townspeople because he is upset by their loud music and dancing.<br/><br/>For a PG-13 movie, I must say it really stretches that rating with sexual innuendo,nudity, 300 style violence and bestiality.<br/><br/>Visually, it's nice to see, but sometimes the animations are not too perfect, making it look like a video game. Performance-wise, the movie's only two flaws are John Malkovich who uses the same accent from Eragon, a movie which will likely haunt him to this very day and Angelina Jolie's terrible accent. Everybody else does good, though sometimes you'll notice the voices are not entirely matching the action on screen.<br/><br/>Another downside, is that even for a 100 or so minute movie, it feels very slow, some pieces kinda take forever to end, of course when it gets to the action bit it's all good.<br/><br/>The story strikes me as odd, because of how it's more a cyclical tale of moral ambiguity and lust for power, which leads a man to it's ultimate demise, then the heroic, sarcasm-free and perfect hero Beowulf slaying all that dare challenge him, be it monster or a human foe.<br/><br/>This Beowulf character can defeat anyone, but apparently he can't kill Grendel's mother, but her offspring(product of interspecies breeding) can be decimated. I never understood why..."
"Chris Knipp","8","1","2","18 December 2007"," Livening up the Anglo-Saxons
","Sturla Gunnarsson's film version of this Anglo-Saxon poem and legend a couple of years ago robbed the story of its legendary elements. Since Beowulf is a national myth freely blending the magical, fantastic, and historical, nothing very memorable, or even appropriate, came out Gunnarsson's well meaning effort to make it brooding, ""historical,"" and ""realistic""--except that he did capture the overwhelming gloom of much Anglo-Saxon poetry.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has done a new version, vivid and full of life, gore, and occasional humor. To achieve this effect he has used motion capture technology, with improvements over the previous feature to use the effect, Polar Express. He's also enlisted some rather famous actors, and the movie's been shown in regular format, a 3-D projection with the old glasses bit, and I-Max.<br/><br/>All of which turn the tale into something fabulous, perhaps a bit kitsch, pretty entertaining, and the most ridiculous PG-13 movie ever. It's extraordinarily violent; but then, so are many traditional children's stories, myths--and national epics (the Iliad and the Odyssey aren't sweet little nursery tales; but that's the point: nursery tales aren't sweet).<br/><br/>In the 3-D version I saw, as in the old days of 3-D, which never did catch on, spears and drops of blood and pebbles spew constantly in your face. We'd be dead or maimed if our mugs were thrust so close to such events. But after a while you get used to it. You adjust to the motion capture imagery too. It makes sense for legendary characters to have an artificial gloss. The point is there's no naturalistic way to render the Beowulf story.<br/><br/>This movie has done well at the US box office. Some have compared it to a computer game, and it's certainly comic book or graphic novel material in the Zemeckis version. But the result is surprisingly effective, and despite some jarring elements--most people may just remember a naked Angelina Jolie with an odd accent, and maybe Crispin Glover covered in gore and spore and magnified to fifteen times a man's size, as Grendel, the monster.<br/><br/>A highly computer-enhanced Ray Winstone (provided with a super-nautilus body) plays Beowulf, the Geat who comes to slay Grendel for Hrothgar, leader of the Danes. The story opens with the great ""mead hall"" where the early Scandinavians got drunk and swore oaths they later were held to. Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is a drunken, fat old man with a young wife Wealhtheow (Robin Wright Penn); he's nonetheless extraordinarily brave. When the monster Grendel, a misshapen, outcast creature, comes to kill many of Hrothgar's men in the hall, Hrothgar stands up to him boldly--and survives. But the next day he closes the hall and goes into a period of grieving.<br/><br/>When Beowulf comes along offering to slay Grendel and boasting of his prowess, he is challenged, primarily by Unferth (John Malkovitch)--an interesting character, unappealing, cowardly, but a useful foil for Beowulf whom the hero ultimately forgives and in the film version turns friendly. Unferth accuses Beowulf of exaggerating his prowess in a swimming contest. In the movie, Beowulf is a liar several important times. This is not exactly the way the story originally went, but writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary have embellished the original in interesting ways.<br/><br/>The most obvious one is Angelina. ""Grendel's dam"" (an animal term for mother) as the poem calls her is never clearly described--certainly not as a big-breasted, bee-sting-lipped naked babe. This is certainly a lively element, but a pretty distracting one. Beowulf has to battle Grendel, then his mother, and then, later, a great dragon. Arguably the dragon is even more distracting, since it's a huge, spectacular, golden creature. But this makes for an appropriately grandiose climax.<br/><br/>Grendel is pretty weird looking, a little too grotesque and disgusting and not monstrous on a heroic scale as the epic poem implies, but naturally Crispin Glover does good things with the character, making him a pitiful as well as scary figure.<br/><br/>Scholars argue endlessly about the meaning of various elements in the story; a big issue is how strong the Christian element in it is. As someone who studied the original pretty closely at one time myself, I was impressed at how well this movie brings the story to life. It doesn't seem to have appealed much to the critics. But the ancient bard who spun out the original poem was not an art-house filmmaker. Yes, it's kitsch; yes, Angelina's a jarring element; and yes, the various accents are a dreadful mixture. But anything that leads people back to the oldest English literary tradition of all and gives it popular appeal again seems pretty worthwhile to me."

","About two minutes into Robert Zemeckis' sumptuous Beowulf, you'll breathe a sigh of relief; for the most part, the 'hollow-zombie-evil-eyes' syndrome which plagued Zemeckis' previous motion-capture outing, The Polar Express, has been enormously improved upon. Granted, the technology still remains unable to fully replicate the spark and nuance of actual human performance, but early in the piece, it becomes very clear that Zemeckis and co. have come damned close.<br/><br/>A modern re-jigging of the Old English epic, Beowulf sees its titular hero arrive at the hall of the aging King Hrothgar to slay the demon who's befouled his once-great kingdom and torn half of its inhabitants limb from bloody limb. Voiced with gruff swagger by a stalwart Ray Winstone, this Beowulf is a boastful champion, a man almost as great as the stories he tells of himself, but by golly, does he know it. This pride proves Beowulf's curse, and his lesson in humility and, in turn, true greatness, could scarce come harder learned.<br/><br/>An excellent supporting cast all rise to the occasion here, with Anthony Hopkins as the ill-fated Hrothgar and an ethereal Angelina Jolie as the demon's succubus honeytrap mother fleshing out the tragedy and elevating this to the level of genuine (albeit heightened) drama. As written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, Beowulf is an exhilarating spin on the classic hero's journey that sees richly realised characters brought to vivid, mesmerising life by Zemeckis' eye for scope and detail and the incredible technology at his disposal.<br/><br/>In fact, the only real complaint is that the film could have benefited from a few extra minutes to further cultivate plot and character and really push this into the realms of greatness for which its flawed hero so desperately grasps. Despite a solid effort in ensuring characters are given time to come into their own, the plot seems to move at whipcrack pace, and, at its completion, does leave the impression of being comprised almost entirely of action. That's not to say the film is left in want of character complexity, however, but more that the sheer spectacle of it all can tend to overwhelm its various more subtle aspects.<br/><br/>As for the technology, in IMAX 3D, Beowulf becomes a wholly immersive experience. The film's visual extravagance is serviced magnificently by the format; the major set-pieces bookending the film are nothing short of spectacular when witnessed like this. The 3D is rich and crisp and wholly convincing, providing, quite literally, an entirely new dimension to the action. If you plan on seeing the film at all, plan on seeing it like this.<br/><br/>Teeming with bawdy humour, surprisingly graphic violence and finely-honed visual inventiveness, Beowulf is not only Zemeckis' best film for some time, but also rates as one of the year's most fabulously exciting exercises in bang. If you like your action literate, with brains as well as boom, don't make the mistake of overlooking Beowulf."

","Well, I actually thought this movie was pretty good. I mean, if you ignore the fact that Denmark does NOT have mountains or huge cliffs as it's Portrayed in this movie (Denmark is extremely flat). I've never read the poem, but I'm a big fan of old Nordic literature and folk poems. I could imagine that some people may be offended by the lack of keeping close to the real story, but I still think it's a great and entertaining movie. I have to agree with the critics, though. The computer technique makes the characters eyes look really dead. It's a bit funny, though, noticing their attempt to put in some danish in the script. ""Min son..."" Haha!"

","Let me start by saying I am well read in the original Norse tale of ""Beowulf"" and ""Grendel"" and am a proud Swede. I have never been so excited to see a blockbuster action flick adapted from a book in my life. I went and stood in line to see it at the IMAX in 3-D. The theater was packed and the crowd was in great spirits.<br/><br/>As soon as the movie started, you are like ""Wow"", is this really animation? I mean, you know its fake, but the close ups and detailing is really amazing. Hopkins was super classic as the drunken king too. Instantly the movie kicks into action when Grendel shows up. The movie then introduces Grendel's mother, looking hotter than in real life and does a great job of tempting everyone.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is it gets a little boring in the middle. I understand the reasoning, but I think it could have been adapted better to keep the audience more interested.<br/><br/>All in all, great movie and I can't wait for the DVD!"
"Mr_Sensitive","7","1","2","1 December 2007"," Quite Entertaining
","When I go to see the movie I was bored and have no expectation of this movie at all, the trailer didn‚Äôt even look that convincing. I needed to see some movie so I went to see it; also it was directed by Robert Zemickis, for me this name is good enough for me to buy the ticket.<br/><br/>Synopsis: When a small town was terrorized by a monster, a king ordered his men to trace a warrior that could save his town a greatest reward. That is when our hero came in ‚Äì Beowulf.<br/><br/>I have never read the books before so I will go by the story of what I see in the movie. The whole movie was much more entertaining than I thought it would be, maybe because I have no expectation like the others who also went to see it. I must say that extra money that they charge me for the 3D thing was worth it, the outcome, the animation and everything was breathtaking. It was crystal clear. They even gave the preview the different between 3D and non 3D.<br/><br/>I thought the whole story was pretty OK, nothing great or memorable, seem like they put more energy in the making of this movie into 3D than the great storyline. The story is not that well distributed and here and there can be a little bit boring. The character is quite shallow and the dialogue in this movie was way too little. And there is so much gore that seems quite unnecessary.<br/><br/>The good outcome was I don‚Äôt really get border by the fact that this movie is CGI like I felt as I watch The Polar Express; this one felt more like a normal movie. As I said before this movie seem to only concentrated a lot on making it a lifelike as possible so tried to watch it in a highly enhance Digital Cinema like I did and you will felt quite impressive at the new technology that everything look so clear and real.<br/><br/>Overall it was a fun flick, don‚Äôt expect that good of the story but tried to look at that awesomely done CGI.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Should At least Watch It Once.<br/><br/>Reason to Watch: The Future of Film Making!!!! Reason Not To: Story is very shallow, and if not for CGI this movie is just average Mythology movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+).<br/><br/>Please Rate Y/N After Read."
"ddj-14","7","1","2","30 November 2007"," Great animation movie, but not faithful to original myth
","Well, it is surely an impressive animation movie with a very advanced technique which mixes real and virtual actors. The story is also very well designed, BUT it is not faithful to the original tale. In the Beowulf, Grendel's mother is killed by the hero, the cup appears only in the third act and the dragon has no relationship with Grendel's mother.<br/><br/>I understand the necessity to change the story for commercial reasons, but we risk to transfer to the descendant an altered version of story. I personally do not like that. Most people still think that the Andresen's Little Marmaid is an happy ending story because of the Disney cartoon. I do not like that. We need to preserve original tales."
"adamdonaghey","7","1","2","29 November 2007"," Definitely worth it--if only for the technology
","After seeing the trailer for Beowulf, I decided I had no interest in seeing the film. However, after the screening last night, in 3-D at an IMAX theater, I'm glad I did. Other than the character names, places and objects, and some of the sequences that take place, the film is nothing like the epic poem. In fact, the underlying premise of the entire movie is completely made up and found no where in the poem. It's certainly sexed up and modernized, Hollywood style, to make it more accessible. And while I think it works well for the film, I certainly hope no ninth grader deems it a substitute for reading the actual epic. I actually pulled a copy myself from my library to re-read.<br/><br/>But who really cares about the poem, right? Haha, I jest! The story's the same as all the trumped up warrior movies of late (compare ""I...Am...BEOWULF!"" with ""This...Is...SPARTA!""): heroic, sexy, hedonistic and violent. The monster Grendel is a foul ravaging, pus-ridden beast who towers over men with ease and rips their heads off like twigs. Liberties were taken, however, to make him also meek and hesitant, and clearly existentially bewildered. This gives the character soul and compels the viewer to find humanity in the creature. I really liked Grendel's mother, I must admit, even though creative license took her far beyond the original character in the poem. The cartoon version of Angelina Jolie arouses just as well, if not better, than the real thing (I could have lived without the high heels though). If I were Brad Pitt, I'd be quite jealous of cartoon Ray Winstone! It's a cool movie and definitely worth watching, but more so because of the technology, and less so about the story. You've got swords and blood and waves and stones and spears and beasts all coming at you at once! It's like you're in this foreign world battling right along with our hero! Alright, it's not that impressive, but it's certainly worth a movie ticket to check it out. I really can't say for sure how I'd feel about the film if I'd seen it in traditional two dimensional style on a normal movie screen... But then again, I'm not reviewing that experience, now am I?"
"zero_destiny_0","Null","1","2","28 November 2007"," Pay attention!
","Everything I hear about Beowulf focuses on graphics, graphics, graphics. Stop it, please. We all know the graphics are rather spectacular, and if you see it in 3d as I did, it's so spectacular it might make your eyes hurt. The CG is tops - at first I thought it must be a blending of real life and CG, not entirely the latter.<br/><br/>Before I get too carried away singing its praises, however, let me tell you - it slaughtered the real story of Beowulf. I read the story in high school (or was it middle school?) and the movie was so utterly inaccurate to ANY degree, that I started remembering that story. Grendel looks awesome in the movie poster. He looks like a large leper in the film. I thought I noticed some scale change as well - video games do better than that. For the informed, Grendel's mother is monstrous. She's not the sexy babe you always have to see in every movie. Nor does she give birth to the dragon - and on that note, how does such a thing happen anyway? Even if you've never read the story, the movie still won't make sense.<br/><br/>When the dragon... wine... thing gets lost and returns, it's never explained. Watch how Beowful slays the dragon (by the way, in the actual story, he didn't slay the dragon; one of his loyal knights did). If you want a real action-filled story that leaves you entranced, then um, go to the library and pick up Beowulf. If you just want eye candy, then go see the movie."
"nvolpa","4","1","2","21 November 2007"," This is supposed to be based on the classic epic?
","If you have ever read the epic Beowulf, then saw the movie, you would be completely disappointed as I was. The best to happen to this film, a changed title other than Beowulf. This is added to my list of movies terrible done supposedly based on the book. The movie was so loosely based that I wouldn't ever see it again. Comparing with the epic, the list is too great to say, so read it and you'll see what I mean. The least that they could have done was have someone state Grendel's curse other than an evil mother, who in the book, never spoke and was disgustingly ugly. The true reason was his long ago father's sin, Cain for killing his brother Able. Grendel's appearance as being a hideous outcasted monster was great except his eardrum was located in a normal and healthy place. His place of dwelling with his mother was also wrong, though partly true. They were secluded very far away, but not above ground and through a small cave. No. Through the fire snakes you must swim down to the bottom, where the world that Grendel comes from can be seen. <br/><br/>Unferth'scene and big to-do of the Brecca vs. Beowulf swimming match was great. He seemed to try more in the movie, which was good for Beowulf to prove himself well capable to fight and kill Grendel. Unferth did give Beowulf the sword Hrunting, but he brought it back after killing Grendel's mother, but with and other sword. The one in their lair under the fire snake lake.<br/><br/>Grendel's blue fire and strobe light entrance was rather peculiar. Significance is noted that he is not normal. But to the extent of a different colored lighting element back in the days of Beowulf, even more notice to Grendel,and less credit to the movie creators who made it ""based upon the classic epic"" More can be said, but if you thought you liked the movie, you'll love the epic and never think back on the falsely based movie."
"DonFishies","7","3","12","17 November 2007"," Brilliantly bloody visuals do not automatically mean an amazing movie
","Beowulf.<br/><br/>Everyone, or most people at least, remember encountering it in a high school English class. A lot remember the main story, and some, like me, slept right through most of the readings, and cannot fathom any idea about the story other than recalling the fight between the heroic Beowulf and the monster Grendel.<br/><br/>So in a way, it really does not help my case that the new film, tinkers and reinvents the legendary poem into something a little clearer and more tangible. While the key events are present within the film, it does change quite a few things within the mythical poem, but does stay fairly within the realm of the idea of what happens to Beowulf (Ray Winstone) after he fights Grendel (Crispin Glover).<br/><br/>Looking beyond the fact that the film is based on material written originally in Old English, the film stands out as a bit of a mishmash of ideas and concepts based in the initial text, but also based around the style of epic film-making. For one, it really brings a sense of age to the screen. The viewer can easily get a sense of similarity between this film and the likes of The Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, even the recent 300. It just does not feel entirely fresh in the aspect of it staying within the ancient European epic genre. It also falters in the dialogue. It frequently shifts between using Old English style wordings, to normal modern wordings, to just throwing in random pieces of comedy for no reason (and sequences designed specifically to incite laughter alongside them). The material is clearly brooding with darkness and cynicism, was there really a reason to make light jokes at the expense of the kids watching it? Do the majority ruling adults have no say? It jumps around for the entirety of the running time in this manner, and at times, becomes downright bothersome (hell, Grendel only speaks in Old English).<br/><br/>There has been plenty of publicity about Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary's long road to getting the film made, and it really brings to light the reasoning behind the ill-placed light hearted sequences. It just does not feel like it is a fully cohesive piece. The tone is never steady, and if it is not trying to catch some laughs, the dialogue comes off at times as being ridiculously overacted and silly. How can anyone assume they are in for a hell of ride if you cannot even get past some of the horrible deliveries? Continuing on that same idea, the characters themselves are not much better. With the exception of Beowulf, Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and maybe Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), none of the characters are fully described or are even given some sort of backstory. We are subjected to this over and over, and never does it seem like the film is making a genuine attempt at even trying to cloak the idea that the characters are written so poorly. Some are given small doses of influence and motivation (like Grendel and even Unferth (John Malkovich)), but even then the characters seem very grounded in their ideas and style. It even gets to the point that when they talk, they just bring the entire movie down into sheer boredom (even with the stunning credit list of supporting actors). Incite and intrigue seemed to be the last thing on anyone's mind when they were actually creating the film. For the most part, the actors do look like they are trying, it just does not look like they are doing too much.<br/><br/>Winstone, as the lead, is a lot like the tone and design of the writing on the film. He truly shows off his talents as an actor in one scene, and then wavers into an uncontrollable mess of a character in the next. There is no balance whatsoever when he appears on screen in these scenes, and it brings to mind the question of how a true hero really should act. Winstone nails the lines, and the body language, but he just does not have the zest to carry the film in the direction it needs to go.<br/><br/>What does carry are the visuals. Absolutely immaculate in their design and near flawless, these are some of the best CGI scenes ever put to celluloid. By using motion capture technology, director Robert Zemeckis and his crew have put together characters that look, move and sound like the real thing. You can see the shade in all of the characters (and mythical creatures) that suggests that they are animated, but every other moment it is a bit more difficult to notice that the actors are animated.. The most minuscule physical details are corrected meticulously for every character, even the disgustingly deformed Grendel (who looks astonishingly realistic, and may just be the ticket to an Oscar come February). Just examining the beard Beowulf has exhibits millions of tiny hairs and blazingly realistic wrinkles. No CGI character (save for Gollum, Kong and Jar Jar) has ever been so completely and minutely realistic as the characters are in this film. I just wish liquids looked nearly as good as the actors and the backgrounds.<br/><br/>What is also interesting is the aging and weight loss given during the film. Winstone is a big guy, but you would never know because he is rather chiselled and athletic in this movie. And when he ages by fifty years, you can see no difference in the character other than the age. It is absolutely awestriking to watch and if for any reason to see the movie immediately, it would be that.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect by any means, but Beowulf is a valiant try at capturing an epic poem that is practically untranslatable. See it for the visuals, not the incomplete story.<br/><br/>7/10."
"mbtrent1617","8","3","12","15 November 2007"," Beowulf Is Exciting and Thought Provoking
","I don't really know what to say about this movie right now. The 3D visuals are amazing. There were countless times when I held on for my life to my seat. I jumped several times also.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a joyous feast at the dining hall. The drunk king Hrothgar names it Mead Hall after the drink. Singing and dancing ensues to commemorate this seemingly reckless kings greatness. We soon find that Grendel (the most hideous and disturbing creature I have ever seen) hates loud noises, especially singing. He lays waste to a bunch of people in Mead hall to rid his fury. Soon the king (played by Hopkins) offers half of the kingdoms gold to whoever rids him of this monster. Key in Beowulf: After slaying Grendel (nekkid and nimbly) he goes forth after his mother. He makes a deal with the temptress and goes back to seek glory and fame for the kill.<br/><br/>After time, we see Beowulf, now a king who is regretful and full of sorrow. His deal comes back to haunt him and his kingdom. What follows is the most incredible and eye popping action sequences I have ever seen (especially in 3D). The dragon is truly terrifying, not as kind looking as the nazgul in LOTR. Beowulf finally rids himself of his curse..But will the new king succumb under the same temptations??? We see how our decisions can sometime affect others with horrible consequences. Things that look good do not always fulfill us, they destroy us.<br/><br/>I somewhat enjoyed the movie until I saw the last 20 minutes or so. That last section of the movie won me over.<br/><br/>The pace isn't necessarily relentless, but the time flies by. I couldn't believe that the two hours went like they did. Zemeckis does a great job building some tension in the scenes with Grendel and his mother.<br/><br/>How this film got a PG-13 rating is surprising. If I had young kids I definitely wouldn't let them see it. The scenes with Angelina leave nothing to the mind. WOW.... We also see some naked and nekkid men running around. Mostly Beowulf going after Grendel. The violence wasn't terrible, but worse than any other PG-13 I've seen. It should have been rated R. They manipulated the MPAA probably by making the film animated. Either way I liked it.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie and the story. I would have to give the film an 8 out of 10 at this point. I am going to see it again it IMAX next week. This will probably be a film that gets better with repeat viewings.<br/><br/>I had no idea what to expect when I went into the film but I did have high expectations. I was not disappointed, but I was dumbfounded. I am anxious to see this film again with an open mind to see my reactions to it."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","7","22 November 2007"," an unlikely epic blockbuster done in CGI meant for 3D; it's brutal and fun
","Robert Zemeckis and his Imagemovers team and CGI people and 'motion-capture' folks have turned out another following the Polar Express in 2004: once again the technique of a fully realized animated feature wrapped around real-actors performing only animated over. It's a little like a mix-and-match method of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, only this time with Toontown completely bleeding over LA. Speaking of bleeding over, Beowulf is not the kind of movie that will work well for the wee kiddies, the ones who maybe just have gotten a taste of Lord of the Rings; despite the PG-13, had it been animated by someone else like Ralph Bakshi, it would definitely get an R. While not on the same level of relentless video-game violence of 300, Beowulf does contend to bring in a similar contingent of an audience, while also likely alienating many who might have loved the original epic poem in the murky middle-English text. Transformed into a tale of a flawed monster killer who keeps on reminding us over and over ""I-AM-BEOWULF!"" as he ascends into a position of total power as a living legend, Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman leave it more as a director's film, making little moments of nuance and strength in the epic action-movie sort of way.<br/><br/>To be fair, Beowulf isn't very complex, which is just as well for many of the people who will go see it. There's also not much intended humor either, albeit somewhere in the similar ballpark of unintended laughs as 300 (if, perhaps, with a slightly better filmmaker at the helm). Story: Beowulf (Winstone, who's voice is about as commanding as imaginable) is called by a Danish king (Hopkins) to slay Grendel, a man-monster living in a mountain, who comes down to demolish all the people in his path based on noise vibrations that tick him off. He does slay the beast, and when Grendel's mother finds out, she goes also on a rampage of some slaughter. When Beowulf goes to confront her, he knocks her up (and why not when it's portrayed by a consistently nude Angelina Jolie), and she bears a son (not quite) unbeknownst to him. Then his son is born as a dragon, who also as Beowulf is an old king ravages the town. Take 3! <br/><br/>Inbetween this there isn't much else story, save for a tiff between Beowulf and Malkovich's character, and some allusions to adultery in the King's marriage to the Queen (color us shocked). The reason to watch the film isn't for it's poetry in language, anyway, but for the rip-roaring sensationalism of the piece visually, as a kind of pop-art throwback to both folklore and video-games of the present. Luckily, Zemeckis has gotten rid of the ""dead-eyes"" syndrome that plagued the Polar Express. It doesn't mean from time to time the characters come off a little wooden, even if it is behind layers and layers of silicon detail. What works best is seeing Zemeckis and his technical team make it as something of a marvel: when watching the shot where it pulls back all the way through the village, through the woods, and to the mountain and cave where Grendel groans in agony, the shot and the audio of the dissipating banging and singing in the King's hall makes as much of a stand-out as anything in Zemeckis's arsenal.<br/><br/>Add to this the imagination in the fantasy elements: Grendel is one of the great creations in the realm of computer animation, right up there with Gollum and the new-and-improved Yoda; he's an abomination, with no skin and lots of deformities all very close up in 3-D, but there's a very real human quality to him too, tortured and retarded, led on by the (as a contrast) slick, golden, and attractive mother. Then back to the dragon in the climax, who is a combination of all three, and even if somehow the dragon doesn't quite work as well as Grendel, it comes close. As a piece of drama, it leans towards the silly and pompous, including a five-minute fight sequence where the animators avoid an R with the dreaded shot of Beowulf's crotch. As a piece of skillfully controlled work of eye-popping maneuvering, it almost completely makes up for the flaws in the material. It's a must-see in the sense that you should see it on a big screen, with the glasses, and as close as possible. How it is with flesh and blood characters is just so-so."
"rightwingprof","Null","2","7","16 November 2007"," We'll see
","We're seeing it tomorrow, but just a few points here. First, the tagline, which all by itself reveals that the writers didn't read the original. There is no ""pride"" in Beowulf, nor is it a curse. Beowulf is, in fact, self-deprecating. There are no lies about achievements, or greed (Beowulf gives the reward he was given to his king, and keeps none of it).<br/><br/>There are perhaps ten words describing Grendel, not enough to know what he looked like (he had scales and a claw, and that's about all the author felt we needed to know).<br/><br/>There is no sex or seduction. Grendel's mother is repulsive, she does not try to seduce Beowulf, he does not strip. He kills her, beheads the corpse, and swims back to his thanes. Period.<br/><br/>I'll let the commenter get away with calling Beowulf a Viking, although he was a Geat. Still, close enough, I suppose.<br/><br/>I'm not at all hopeful. In fact, I'm sure I will despise it. Everything I have read, including this comment, tells me the writers have no respect for the original, and have turned this into a roller coaster for 14 year-old boys. But at least they will have heard of Beowulf, even if every one of the impressions they get from the movie will have been false."

They kept the movie flowing well and did a good job at adding comic relief. The action scenes were very well done. Many movies nowadays are so close to the action you cant tell what is going on. There are a few moments when you first met Grendel that were close but I think it was just to draw out his entrance. This movie stayed far enough away to keep the immediate area in view which I prefer.

"taishi81","7","2","8","19 November 2007"," More than just a good 3-D film--it's a good film period
","This review is mostly in response to film critics. Rarely have I seen reviewers become so uptight and unable to engage a film as with ""Beowulf."" Most reviews have been positive, but with a superior back-handed complimentary attitude. Writers acknowledge the great 3-D imagery, the fun action, and, of course, a nude (kind of) Angelina Jolie as crowd-pleasing elements, but they are never fooled by this low-brow Hollywood entertainment; not for a moment. And they must mention how movie is different from the book--the near-incomprehensible 1400 year-old book. Shocking.<br/><br/>In response, I say yes, the 3-D animation, the lively action, and the weirdly nude-but-not Angelina Jolie are fun, and they should be, but they are never tacky or unintentionally cheesy. These elements supply the surface gloss to a story dealing with deeper business. ""Beowulf"" examines dimensional characters dealing with dark demons, both literal and internal. It deals with a cursed land ruled by cursed kings, who attain and keep power through black deals forged from black souls. It shows loud angry strength, and quiet chilling loss. And it conveys all this through animation. Director Robert Zemeckis presents all these themes and thoughts and ambitions through animation, which is a real achievement. For so long American animation has been relegated to the genre of children films, instead of acting as a platform to explore all genres. Beowulf stands as the first American major release to warrant a PG-13 rating (it should be higher actually) and deal with adult concepts and characters. This alone heralds a special and much needed change in film-making.<br/><br/>All this is not to say ""Beowulf"" is some challenging think piece, or that it even tries to be. Of course the film is not as deep as the book, or maybe even a well-written college paper on the book. But give it credit for trying to be more than some empty-headed 3-D gimmick. It risks and achieves more."
"divadrummer-1","7","2","8","18 November 2007"," Without the gimmicks - decent, but still dry.
","The all-CGI, 3D release Beowulf kicks off the holiday fantasy season with a bang. What other force on earth can draw together English Lit majors and frat boys gawking at Angelina Jolie's naked boobs? Everyone's anxious to see the spectacle of an all-CGI movie. We've been disappointed in the past, but we're still hopeful. We love the shinies, oh yes we do. From the previews, we all know the movie looks stunning. But does the story hold its own? More or less. I enjoyed it more than the book, at least.<br/><br/>Beowulf is an ancient English tale about a boastful warrior (Beowulf) who vows to save a small Danish kingdom from Grendel - a man-eating troll. Through the course of the movie, we learn why the kingdom has been cursed, and what other evils lie in store for those who are brave enough to face them. The new screenplay adds some interpretations and irony onto the original poem, turning this from a hack-n-slash tale of trials into a story more suitable to hold our attention spans for two hours of visuals.<br/><br/>Please don't bring your children to this movie. If you've never read Beowulf or aren't familiar with ancient literature, then you may not know that these stories are usually very violent. Though you may equate animation with cartoons, this is not a kids movie, and unless you have no problems letting your children watch Beowulf hack various parts off grotesque and disfigured demons, do us all a favor and hire a babysitter.<br/><br/>The film doesn't attain Apocalypto-like levels of violence, but enough to push the envelope. If you're a fantasy action enthusiast, you'll love the epic battles. Grendel bursts into the hall and picks up every nearby human, crashes them to the ground, uses humans to beat on other humans, and tears people in half. A very impressive dragon makes an appearance in the last act of the movie, and Beowulf fights on his back, hacking at his wings and fiery throat as the dragon proceeds to destroy half the Danish city. Yay, dragons! We never see Mommy's true form, but it's hinted at in her reflections, and in point-of-view shots with her tentacles caressing Grendel, her monstrous son.<br/><br/>The graphics are beautiful. Most of the people look like people, Ms. Jolie among them. The 3D affects were a constant delight to many of the moviegoers, who constantly OOHed and AHHed at the tips of spears protruding towards the camera, pebbles flying up into their faces as horses ran a cobbled road, and deep, snowy landscapes wooshing into view. For all the awe-inspiring graphics, there are still plenty of problems in rendering the characters. Queen Wealthow was so meek and withdrawn in her body language that she looked like a cartoon. Many of the movements in action sequences were too fast or too smooth to look natural. And the movie seemed to use two lighting schemes only - dark shadows cast by glowing fires indoors, or stark, monochromatic winter landscapes. But the graphics do their job rather well, because after awhile, you forget about the 3D goodies and CGI humans until the next 3D trick comes at you. I don't like the gimmick, but I think that CGI has the potential to be the best format for fantasy movies. Supernatural elements are better immersed in a CGI movie than they are in a live-action film that adds CGI afterwords.<br/><br/>For those wanting to see Angelina as her creator made her, you might want to stay home and watch the Apple trailer, because the trailer has almost all of her nude scenes in the movie. In fact, there are more naked men in the movie than there are women. Beowulf strips down and fights Grendel bare, and King Hrothgar is frequently derobing while drunk. I appreciate the equal opportunity, but I'm not really a fan of fanservice. I'm even less of a fan of being in a theatre with fans of fanservice.<br/><br/>The story and acting could have made this movie fantastic, but fell short. I appreciate the updated take on Beowulf and the added irony, but there's a lack of affection for most of the characters. Beowulf is a generic hero - we get a hint of his boastfulness and heroic spirit, but he's mostly lost in the action and constantly shouting his own name in an annoying fashion, a-la ""this is SPARTA!"" We get the sense that King Hrothgar isn't as foolhardy as he initially seems, but only in glimpses towards the end of the movie. Queen Wealthow is a vision of loveliness, but doesn't say much and acts out even less - most of her time is spent casting worried glances. Grendel cries in a very congested human voice, which some may find disconcerting but others will find out of place.<br/><br/>The best performances in the movie go to John Malkovich as Unferth and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother. John Malkovich's role might have been tailor made for him. Unferth is neither good nor bad, a little smarmy, very arrogant but dynamic, and can admit to his own faults. The dialog and Malkovich's delivery stand out as the voice of intellect in the movie, where all the rest of the men grumble in a forgettable, standard half-brogue. Grendel's Mother also has some notable speeches, dangerously low-pitched and slithering with lithe consonants. The desired effect may have been creepy and a little sexy, but wound up the other way around - no one minds.<br/><br/>Do shell out some extra for those 3D glasses if you're a graphics freak. Don't go if you're expecting to find something to put next to your Lord of the Rings DVDs. Beowulf is in many ways still the same dry meal you had in your high school English curriculum, only with interesting side dishes."
"bbbl67","7","2","8","17 November 2007"," Special effects and stuff
","This was a slightly over-long movie, with too many slow spots in between. However, I'm glad I went to see it in IMAX 3D, as it heightened the enjoyment, above what it normally would've been. I'd highly suggest you see it in 3D too, rather than in the normal version.<br/><br/>One thing I was surprised to find out was that this was a completely animated movie, and not a live action movie with special effects. That's because the characters in the movie all mostly looked like the actors who were just playing their voices. Anthony Hopkins looked like Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson looked like Brendan Gleeson, and of course Angelina Jolie looked like Angelina Jolie (most of the time). So when I saw the trailers, I just assumed it was just live action. It was an interesting choice to make the characters look like their voice actors who we're all familiar with.<br/><br/>However, that's not to say that it was perfect. I found the characters' expressions were lifeless. I wish they had put some scanners on the voice actor's faces and replicated them to their animated character's faces. This is a problem with a lot of animated movies trying for authenticity -- they just never get the facial expressions right, for example the Final Fantasy movie. It isn't such a problem with a character based on Angelina Jolie, who has relatively few facial expressions, but it was a problem for the Anthony Hopkins character (King Hrothgar), the Ray Winstone character (Beowulf), and especially Robin Wright Penn's character (Wealthow). Wealthow looked like a marionette throughout the movie with almost no expressions on her character's face. Also, in some scenes the Angelina Jolie character looked like her (almost too perfectly, her animated body was much curvier than her real life body), but in other scenes it didn't look like her at all. It doesn't look like they paid attention to quality control throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Also a warning about the 3D effects. It is somewhat headache inducing. The movie looks 3D alright, but mainly like the flattened 3D like what you would see inside a Viewmaster stereoscope. Foreground objects pass in front of background objects like you would expect in 3D, but the foreground objects look like 2D cardboard cutouts; there is no depth to the foreground objects themselves. I hope some future 3D technology takes care of this annoyance."
"ligaya","9","2","9","16 November 2007"," Must see! IMAX 3D best or DLP 3D
","8.5-9 out of 10. According to Reelz Dailies: Phenomenal. Rotten Tomatoes: 72%. I often see a movie twice - once for first impressions, again for what I might have missed the first time. I liked it even more the 2nd time. When I got out of 11am show, people were already in line for 1:45pm show. It was all I could do to keep myself from buying another ticket.<br/><br/>OH YEAH, definitely worth seeing in 3D, and the IMAX 3D is superlative. Does the movie/story work? A resounding yes. You don't have to know the classic story, and if you do know it ¬ñ it's interesting to see the changes the scriptwriters made. The first half is a little slow because it's setting up the last half ¬ñ which is a more than satisfying payoff. The movie asks: what is a hero?, what is a monster?, what is human? It's very moving, and I had a few teary moments.<br/><br/>My highlights: starting with the IMAX 10-second countdown, sheet of water in the opening credits, the running joke early on, Grendel vs. Beowulf fight, Grendel's mom, the DRAGON ¬ñ best I've ever seen. The final action sequence must be seen to be believed. I did get the epic, heroic, bigger than life feeling. I felt the same feelings like when (dating myself) I watched Steve Reeves' Hercules movies, Jason & the Argonauts, etc.<br/><br/>Angelina has limited visual screen time, a little less than John Malkovich, but she is present throughout the movie either with her voice or characters talking about her. And her character is as key to the story as Beowulf. At the first sight of Angelina emerging from the pool (a la Marlon Brando in Apocalypse now and many movies since), the 75% male audience were moaning and cheering. It was really quite funny. With every reveal from her face to her breasts to her torso to her pelvic area to her heels and finally to the whole digital Angelina, dripping in chocolate gold, the fanboys reacted. Her face is Shiseido-ad perfection. Angelina's performance was spot on, literally pitch perfect. Totally seductive, not evil, it's her words as much as her appearance that mortal men find impossible to ignore. It's their souls they willingly hand over as she exploits their weaknesses and becomes the agent of their downfall. (I thought that this must be what anti-Angelina haters believe Angelina the person to be.) <br/><br/>Sir Anthony is magnificent as always, Ray Winstone heroic, and Crispin Glover as Grendel is as pitiful as he is monstrous. Brendan Gleeson, Beowulf's second in command, gives a wonderful performance. Beowulf looks nothing like Ray Winstone, Grendel's mom looks totally like Angelina, and we recognize Sir Anthony's & Malkovich's faces & voices but they have different bodies from their own, Robin Wright Penn & Alison Lohman look nothing like themselves.<br/><br/>It was like looking through those toy stereoscopes (can't remember their names ¬ñ senior moment). Then it became naturally 3D like our real world. The switch from 2D to 3D is going to be like the change from silent movies to talkies. The motion capture is about 80-90% there. Some of the characters are a little stiff and not realistic, others Like Angelina we could swear was real not digital, galloping horses need improvement.<br/><br/>I think these are awards worthy: animation, stirring musical score, sound, production & costume design."

","Ah ""Beowulf"" great story, An Balls out Anglo-Saxon poem from long ago. Ah Robert Zemeckis and Neil (sandman) Gaiman, two enormously overrated hacks. Hence we have ""Beowulf"" the cheesy cartoon! I know, some are screaming it's CGI! Big, fat hair deal, it's animated, for the most part badly, I do give this cartoon a 5, largely because it has one kick-ass dragon! But dozy is it dumb.<br/><br/>Beowulf, voiced by Ray Winstone but bearing no resemblance to the pudgy actor, is a conceited, boastful lying pig-ape in this cartoon who roams bout with his fellow geeks, oops sorry, Geats, offering to slay monsters and demons in return for women or gold. Yeah, what a hero. His BFF is Hamish, sorry Waflig, or some such dippy name, it's Hamish from ""Braveheart"" Honest. At the beleaguered hall of Santa Claus, oops again sorry, it's Hrothgar, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, apparently he's started drinking again. King Santa had a young queen who looks like an uncomfortable waxen cross breed between Meryl Streep and Robin Wright if she was fat and wore a bad wig. Anyhoo, Hrothgar made some mistake sand his hall is being bitch-smacked by the monster Grendel who looks rather like a knobby troll.<br/><br/>Naturally Beobreath rips Grendel and wins the day. For some reasons no explained by this cartoon he goes to see GRendel's Mom, voiced in a Russian accent by Agnelina Jolie. Ah Good ole Bob Zemeckis, he gives us the cartoon asses of Hopkins and Winstone, but Angie? Nah, gold dipped and phony as hell. Sigh.<br/><br/>After Hrothgar drowns in his corn flakes, Beowuss becomes king. Flash forward ma ny years, we don't' know how many, and Beo has a queen and a girl Urusla, who looks like a min-me of the queen. Princess? Daughter, no just some bitch for Beoballs to hammer at night when he gets bored with Robin, er Wealthrow, Uh-huh, again what a great ""hero"" he is! Well he's sinned big time too and that comes back to bite him in his still tight and curiously hairless rear.<br/><br/>Ugh, there are some pluses here, some dynamic action, some rousing songs, but it's all misogynistic and dumb and well it's a freakin cartoon! It's also waay long and simplistic. Even the ending is kinda vague, though most epic poems or sagas if you prefer, were vague in their endings, i. e. GAwain and the Green Knight. Anyhoo, check ""Beowulf' the cartoon if you liked ""Brave"" pretty similar and again the Dragon is awesome!! 15yold boys may rate this much higher."
"Antagonisten","5","1","3","17 July 2008"," Mediocre
","I wasn't really that interested in the movie Beowulf, but i when i got a chance to see it on DVD i thought i might as well. And honestly it was a bewildering experience.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis is in my opinion a fairly competent director, although not the most exciting one. Somehow it seems he's made it his ""thing"" to make special-effects heavy movies that even have effects where none are needed. I remember watching the (quite good) ""What Lies Beneath"", not realizing that almost every scene had been full of CGI. So it seems that Zemeckis gets a high from CGI (it rhymes!) and of course to each his own... But Beowulf really suffers from this. Maybe it's just me, but i can't see the point of this movie being animated like it is. You take good actors, nice-looking actors, and animate them to look like plastic versions of themselves. The effect is somewhat reminiscent of a slightly more realistic Shrek. Why would they do this? The CGI is so good today that they could just record the movie in front of a green-screen and add whatever they want, why animate the characters? This is my main problem with this movie, especially since the CGI doesn't look very good. The animations are stiff and objects seem to lack weight and substance in a way that was more common in CGI a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>I can't say that this movie ""did it"" for me aside from the CGI either. The story has been seen many times before and it's not really spectacular any more. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's uninteresting, but it does lack something to make it truly interesting. A definite upside to the movie is the actors. There are many recognizable voices (and faces, although they look plastic-wrapped) and many of them do a fine job with the material. I have always liked Ray Winstone and he doesn't disappoint here either. Most of the supporting cast were good, and Angelina Jolie was awful as usual. I honestly don't see what she has going for her except her looks. She re-uses the Russian accent from ""Alexander"" and puts in another pathetic performance. It's impressive to get so far while being so lousy in most of what you do.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum things up i guess this could have been an interesting movie save for a few major flaws. We have a story that's a bit bland, characters that are hard to care about and a visual style that is severely lacking. On the upside we have mostly good actors, a good orchestral score and fair entertainment as long as it lasts. The next time around i hope they go for a more natural look, skip the CGI and work harder on the script. Unfortunately, this movie is mediocre."

","Great good film, excellent speruma feelings contrary to what was said by roberranti and tizianoarianti, a name, a guarantee. In the film, I noticed many terrible elements including the terrifying dictatorship of the Taliban and the fear of the inhabitants of Kabul, the film makes good idea of what he meant to live under the Taliban. The problem is that when you are not directors, is behind a monitor, you can write what you want, reaching even to write untruths. On the Internet everything happens often, most of the films are rejected, not because the films are produced evil but because there are few characters particularly receptive. It must be very insensitive and apathetic to define this film minimalist and reductive, if you do not like the film then you become directors as there attenete word by word to the book.

","This movie had good graphics for an animated movie, however, the plot and storyline, are absolutely HORRID. This could not have been written more poorly. Coming from a writers perspective, and one of this particular movies nature, this was downright appalling. Not to mention the fact that, based on the hundreds of legends and stories about Beowulf, they chose to leave out, basically everything, misinterpret one of the worst ones, and turn it into a 1 hour and 40 minute ""Hey, look what we can do with our new graphics rig!""

"Smells_Like_Cheese","5","1","3","20 March 2008"," The CGI is a little bit too much and takes away from the story
","I remember a year ago seeing the trailer for Beowulf and to be honest, nothing seemed too special about it. I know the poem, lucky enough I never had to read it, my friends said it was boring, so never found interest enough to read it on my own. I saw Beowulf on DVD for rental and figured just to go ahead and check it out. So I watched the film this morning and honestly, I wasn't that impressed with it. The story itself was an interesting one and I think I might read the poem after all, although from what I'm reading from here on IMDb, the movie wasn't all that accurate to the poem itself. But my main problem with the film is the CGI, I know this is a fantasy type of film, but Lord of the Rings was able to pull off a fantasy type of feel with a live action film. The bad looking effects just take over what could've been a great epic film.<br/><br/>Hrothgar is the king of his Denmark land, but there are demons that are attacking him and his people. He and his soldiers are not able to defeat the demon, so they send for a hero. Thankfully a hero is on his way, he is called Beowulf, I like to call him Beobuff. He has come to save the day with his men and they do succeed in killing one of the demons. Unfortunately, the demon's mom does not take this so lightly and offers Beowulf a deal in exchange for a new son. But things take a dark turn when Hrothgar knows a little more about the woman/demon who wanted a son.<br/><br/>Beowulf is an alright movie, seriously though, would I recommend it? Not really, the story was wonderful and magical, but the way the film was made and the cast was not what I would've done if I created the movie. I think it would have been a better idea to use unknown actors, because we have these incredible actors who are aways a pleasure to watch on the screen, but seriously, on Beowulf, this was not their film. The CGI is way too over the top and looks very fake, I didn't enjoy the ""eye candy"". If you read the poem, go ahead and check the film out, if you haven't, you might not get into it.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I was surprised to find that this film was shot entirely in computer graphics--no live action. I wasn't prepared by anything I'd read, including the jacket on the DVD itself. Why weren't the producers more open about this? Did they think we wouldn't notice? The CG gave the movie an unintended creepiness-the figures looked almost alive, but not quite, giving the impression that they were animated corpses. I'd much rather see real people. In addition to the problem of the almost-but-not-quite-right appearance of people, I didn't like how much the CG allowed the producers to show. When the appearance of a monster is implied rather than suggested, it takes some of the power out of the effect."

This is really meant for the theater or IMAX.<br/><br/>That being said here's the break down:<br/><br/>1. I really felt as if they didn't care about developing the story and characters, but more preoccupied with trying to shock you with sex and violence. I assume this is due to them trying to modernize it. Honestly I am totally fine with sex and violence as long as it has its place in the story, but once again it didn't.<br/><br/>2. The action and violence was cartoony and not smooth at all. I thought they could have made it live action and it would have been smoother. <br/><br/>3. By now you would think they would have the animation perfected, but in attempting to make it look really it still looks over polished. Also the movement still looks more puppetish.<br/><br/>All that said. The liberties that they have taken with the Beowulf story may have damaged it. I did liked the irony of 'the sins of the father' bit they added. <br/><br/>In the end they had a chance to create a story that added more emotion and detail to the characters than the book did--but they didn't.

"aeon_static","8","1","3","16 February 2008"," A film that smashes elitist pessimism to a pulp!
","Wow. I am in complete awe over this film. What's even more awe-inspiring is the level of nay-saying towards it by a select number of elitist morons. Let's start from the beginning.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" follows the story of a hero - whose name escapes me - and his fight against a monster or two that threaten his would-be kingdom. That's about as accurate the film is to the actual work of literature it's based upon. The sexual innuendo is heavy. The action is over-the-top and fantastic. The characters aren't as rich as they could be, but there are plenty of successful exchanges between them to prove effective.<br/><br/>Instead of a tale preaching blind, gallant, honorable heroism, the film touches on some serious critiques over the danger of such ideas. Man is flawed and imperfect. Even great men - men of legend - have elements attributed to them that are appalling. This isn't an original theme by any means, but it rings out hard and true in the film. It rings out so true, in fact, that it seems to have shot over the heads of the demographic of ""high-end"" individuals, their ego-driven pessimism focusing on all of the ""trendy"" elements that were added to the film, giving it some spice and flare.<br/><br/>Much like the Lord of the Rings films, ""Beowulf"" dances gracefully between pseudo-realism and outright fantasy. One second, our hero is . . . stressed . . . being grazed against a cliff-side on the back of a dragon - a second later, he is pummeled so deep into the ocean that any real human being's vitals would burst under pressure. Such a deep-sea venture does little more than ""stress"" our hero once again. I found it wildly entertaining. Questionably subjective viewers did not.<br/><br/>Take my advice. Don't go into this film expecting a loyal adaptation of the original. Don't go into this film expecting something as mindless as ""300"", nor as carefully-woven as ""The Lord of the Rings"". Go into this film expecting something lavishly clich√©, yet unique and compelling (with a LOT of social undertones that many people don't seem to get), and that's exactly what you'll get.<br/><br/>It's heavy. It's over-the-top. It's very well-done, and brings to light some ideas that not enough 'mainstream' films dare to approach. I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>8/10"
"my_anywhere","5","1","3","21 January 2008"," Not All Poetry Translates to Greatness
","When I first heard that a movie version of the old English epic poem Beowulf was being made, and that its screenplay was going to be by the same author of Stardust, I immediately knew that I wanted to see it. In research I found that the movie was going to be made using a progressing style of filming called motion capture (used previously in the family Christmas movie The Polar Express) in which movements of actors are digitally recorded and then animated over, it seemed like it might be a good idea, and the fact that the movie was being put through all sorts of editing to keep it PG-13 made me believe that perhaps this wouldn't be just another ""fit-as-much-blood-into-this-as-possible"" type of action film.<br/><br/>Although I have to admit that the movie was entertaining and the special effects beyond belief, overall the film was disappointing. Improved as the motion capture effect was, the humans' movements were floppy and almost comical, I was reminded forcefully of the Shrek movies where the humans have overly-thick sausage fingers and sharp, unnatural movements. The only relief from these human images was close-ups of the characters faces where the detail was so rich it was almost impossible to tell if the image was real or computer generated. Real human actors would have done much better.<br/><br/>Another setback which utterly destroyed what would have otherwise been a successfully entertaining first half was the fact that the monster Grendel, which was the main reason for Beowulf's heroics, was laughable. Given a human voice (and a whiny one at that), Grendel pitifully screams his way through the first fight in which he demolished half the population of the village he's attacking. Rather than grimacing at the fact that he tears a person in half at one point, the audience laughed at how bad his presence was. Even I found him annoying.<br/><br/>And the rating? The most shocking part of the film was the fact that it was rated PG-13. So full of violence was this movie that a family in the theater with me left before the end of the film. As I said before, a person is ripped in half right before our eyes, twenty-something people are hung from the ceiling with their skin torn off and blood dripping down their bodies. What were they thinking when they gave the rating? I don't suggest this movie for younger brothers or sisters.<br/><br/>Disappointing though it was, the movie, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and Crispin Glover, wasn't a total loss and was actually pretty decent when you got past all its flaws¬Öand bad first half. The only justification for going to see it in theaters is to fully appreciate the beauty with which the backgrounds and other scenery were made."

It did have some originality though, with the way it seemed like it was about something which kept coming back, in different forms, usually, but it all seemed abit messy.

I imagine it'll be quite a big hit at the cinema but it just didn't float my boat. The CGI was fantastic, although it failed to convey the sense of emotion that real actors would; in some scenes you are left wandering as to what the characters are supposed to be conveying by their rather bizarre computer generated facial expressions. The score has a few great tracks but is nothing exceptional. To be completely honest if you are genuinely interested in the Anglo-Saxon ""real"" Beowulf then check out Beowulf and Grendel with Gerard Butler. If you want a brainless action fest based loosely on the events in the source material then check out 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas."
"swillsqueal","7","1","3","24 December 2007"," ""What's new Beowulf""....or LORD OF THE GEATS
","It was the early 8th Century A.D. when BEOWULF was penned. It was a time of massive change for the Anglo-Saxons, Danes and Anglo-Celts of Britain and the various Viking tribal kingdoms, East and West in the surrounding sea swept Danish kingdoms. The times of pagan ritual and heroes were morphing into the Medieval Christian era. It was also a time of upheaval, with the old ideological authoritarian structures crumbling, leaving room for literary creativity. Compared with what was to follow, it was a mini-renaissance. Then, dead time ruled up until at least the 14th Century when Chaucer came on the scene, along with the new times which were brewing underneath the slow but sure decay of the Christian Dark Ages.<br/><br/>So, BEOWULF the literary work, reflects a newly forming 8th Century A.D. Christian message which is also wrapped up with a lot of Viking era, pagan lore, including the existence of monsters like Grendel, who according the the epic poem, was a descendant of Cain, the brother of Abel, sons of Adam and Eve. <br/><br/>In ""Beowulf"" the movie, matters are different; but still very exciting, pregnant with change. These are our times, on the edge of climatic upheaval and political turmoil which certainly rivals and probably surpasses that of the 8th Century era. But now, epic must change in both form and its content. No longer an epic poem, ""Beowulf"" has become the 3D movie. Grendel is still a monster; but not descended from Cain. No, unbeknownst to all, Grendel, the monster is descended from Hrothgar, King of the Danish tribe known as the Scyldings.<br/><br/>This twist in the tale gives rise to a variety of opportunities to turn the original ideological intent of BEOWULF's author on its head, for Grendel's mother is none other than the ever enticing Angelina Jolie...I mean, when she wants to be, she's an irresistible Circe.<br/><br/>In the original BEOWULF, our hero of the Geats (a West Danish tribe), does race Breca through the ocean for five days straight and he does encounter difficulties with sea monsters; but in the movie, Beowulf is also seduced by a monster turned a kind of beauteous mermaid.<br/><br/>Such is life in a sea of change and when our filmic Beowulf lays eyes on ultra-attractive women, he is slain and eventually lain. And from his loins spring.....well, in the original epic poem, Grendel is outfoxed and beaten by Beowulf who confronts Angelina Jolie's child, naked, without armour in that great mead hall, Heorot! True to the spirit of the Viking Danes (both East and West--Geats were West Danes) and of BEOWULF the original, Herot is the place where lustful heroes and wenches frolic and feast and drink, not only the honey-based mead, but also those tankards and tankards of ale. Grendel is spoiling the fun by coming to Herot to slaughter and feed--on warriors and maidens. Shame. So, it's Beowulf to the rescue, all naked and shiny and strong like a bull. When Grendel feels the power of Beowulf's grip, he knows that he's met his match.<br/><br/>In the poem, Beowulf slays both Grendel and his mother, an appropriate entry into the staid, stagnant world Medieval monkery. In the film however, the slaying of one becomes the laying of the other and very importantly: lies, betrayals and in their wake, the slow death for ancient heroism a la Odysseus prevail, as Christianity rises and the once meek, weak, double-dealing, fratricidal Unferth becomes the personification of a sadistic Christianity in the power saddle, slouching towards the Dark Ages.<br/><br/>But wait...lustful loins, heroism and dragons will have their day! And the father will eventually be re-united with his son and the spirit of Grendel's mother will live on as she faces noble Wiglaf, Beowulf's comrade in arms, breast deep from the waves at the end of the flick.<br/><br/>See this movie in the 3D version. And don't quibble too much about the cgi effects. Just enjoy your time in the ale hall. Long may Heorot stand!"
"thebengalimafia-1","3","1","3","16 December 2007"," A weak attempt at story telling; the film is utterly laughable (in both good and bad ways).
","Bob Zemickis' Beowulf tells the story of the legendary warrior who comes to free a Mead Hall of a despicable monster known as Grendel. The final product that is Beowulf is a modern day Monty Python and the Holy Grail. As Beowulf walks around naked, it sets off a chain of movements in the Mead Hall to hide his bits and pieces, from candle sticks to pointy helmets and everything in between.<br/><br/>For those of you who read the book in high school, you'll immediately notice that the narrative has been changed to offer more spectacle than narrative. And that is exactly the point with Motion Capture CGI (MoCap for short). These films aren't supposed to be about the writing or the directing; the film is about spectacle, pure and simple. And in trying to explain MoCap there needs to be an understanding of the oft-misunderstood phenomenon of spectacle versus narrative.<br/><br/>Spectacle can be defined as something that can be seen or viewed, especially something of a remarkable or impressive nature. So we're talking about something that exists for the sake of ""showing"" the audience something as opposed to the narrative of a film (God forbid the movie actually tries to tell a story, right?) Narrative on the other hand is a narrated account; a story. Simple enough; the narrative can be manipulated depending on the film. Is it a story about people? Is the film a historical event? The point is that narrative is about telling the audience something and taking them through the journey of story telling. Spectacle is more about leaving your brain at home type cinema, whereas a narrative based film is considerable more highbrow. Now Wikipedia tells me that spectacle can be both high brow and low brow; since spectacle on par with Chinese acrobats is something that is difficult to duplicate, and theatre sets a la The Spanish Opera is in a league on its own.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, the last 100 years of American history tells us that spectacle in America leans toward (and usually spills over into) the ""freak show"" type. The gaudy, trash, and downright repulsive shows traveling America: shows involving dead bodies, public sex acts, and the world's fattest man category. People who take part in these spectacles are usually lesser educated and incapable of understanding the more engaging, involving, and thought provoking cinema; cinema that is becoming scarce today.<br/><br/>Beowulf plays right into the hands of the dim witted spectacle seekers. But oddly enough, there was nothing in the film that was over the top or original in terms of the spectacle. The film was one big excuse to show the audience what it looks like when you animate sex and violence and try to pass it off as cinema. Keep in mind, Angelina was never naked (she's quite overrated to begin with). A million and one nodes attached to your body so the computer knows what you look like, even naked. Even that couldn't save Beowulf."

It has a slew of flaws, but it's still good entertainment. Some of the animation bugged me because instead of thinking ""this is Grendel's crazy monster mom,"" I kept thinking ""Oh look, it's a cartoon big lipped Angelina Jolie!""

"El_Farmerino_Esq","6","1","3","12 December 2007"," Highly amusing, if little else.
","Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf is the tale of a man whose hobbies include killing monsters, embellishing stories and shouting his own name (often combining the three). During the course of the movie he fights a huge, rather nasty-looking bloke while completely in the nip, shags his demon mother and then marries what appears to be a transsexual; thus putting his sexuality under serious question. The fact that he looks like a beefed-up David Beckham but speaks like Ray Winstone doesn't help either...<br/><br/>It's in Beowulf's best interests for this review to refrain from venturing into the realms of a serious appraisal. The story, heavily re-jiggered as it is, is feeble to say the least. The voice acting ranges from decent to absolutely atrocious (to give some credit to the actors, though, they hardly have a fantastic script to work with). The animated actors, though highly impressive, still fail to resemble actual human beings consistently enough to convince. In reality, the only things in Beowulf that really work are the two monsters - Grendel and the dragon. The former in particular is fantastically rendered and his loss at the midway point is a major nail in the movie's coffin. Never again does the movie really thrill, although there are a couple of mildly stirring moments near the end.<br/><br/>However, there's something else at work here - something which lifts Beowulf from the ""take-it-or-leave-it"" doldrums into the heights of ""worth a look."" Simply this - it's funny. At times, uproariously so. Rather than raising memories of previous action/monster flicks, Beowulf is much more likely to call to mind decidedly comedic predecessors. The titular character's fondness for screaming his own name at times recalls South Park's Timmy (particularly in one hilarious moment involving him bursting from a creature's eyeball). The Malkovich character's penchant for arbitrarily beating his servant is somewhat Pythonesque. There's even a 'hide-the-sausage' sequence to rival Austin Powers.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say how much of this is intentional. It's certainly hard to believe lines like ""We swam for five days neck and neck. I was conserving my strength for the final stretch"" were ever intended to be taken seriously. Whatever the intention, though, the fact remains - a stirring, thrilling epic it ain't, but a bloody good laugh it most definitely is."

","If you like faithful adaptations of literary classics, then you'll hate this movie. If, on the other hand, you like mindless violence, eye-popping 3D special effects, and Angelina Jolie (herself something of a 3D special effect), then you'll enjoy this movie. Zemeckis and co. have sexed up Beowulf, freely inventing infidelity and paternity issues that wouldn't look out of place on an Oprah episode. (Don't tell me you never wondered who Grendel's FATHER was.) There is some philosophical mumbo-jumbo about the coming of Christianity bringing an end to the age of heroes and monsters, but this is just undergraduate b.s. to fill screen time until the next fight scene breaks out. Not quite as ludicrous as 300, but not from want of trying. The mocap animation makes it look like the world's most expensive video game. Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich are also in this big budget B-movie, looking rather sheepish; this may be the greatest waste of acting talent since CLASH OF THE TITANS."
"Bungle-9","7","1","3","10 December 2007"," Enjoyable yet flawed
","While there are some conceptual things about this movie that I don't really agree with, such as modelling the faces of the actors in acute detail in CG instead of just using the actors themselves, I found that I enjoyed it a lot more than what I thought I would.<br/><br/>The graphics themselves are very impressive and almost photorealistic (which isn't necessarily a good thing, see previous comment). The film was more hardcore horror than what I thought it was going to be, which made it all the more surprising and entertaining for myself. I am very glad to see that Zemeckis hasn't settled into a groove and is trying new things cinematically, some of which are very evident here.<br/><br/>The voice acting was interesting - my guess is that as the Celts originated from Saxony it would make some sort of sense to have the actors put on different forms of Celtic accents, apart from Jolie's stereotypical Russian business and Winstone's broad London brogue. Given the pedigree of the writers it's not surprising that the script is very well written - not childish in the least, more engaging and adult than that. To be honest, I am very glad to see a major Western company putting in the effort to make a CG film that isn't aimed at children.<br/><br/>At points the film slows down to a laboured chug as some characters are developed. These moments are somewhat forgettable when the next action sequence comes along and amazes you. Trust me, they are amazing. Some complain that the movie isn't true to the poem and the whole story, to which I say well Frank Miller's 300 is based on such a story, yet takes many liberties, and I would put this movie in the same vein as this. It doesn't set out to be a perfect rendition of the poem.<br/><br/>Basically this is a very entertaining, adult movie with a bit of God of War about it, which is a very good thing. Definitely worth a watch."

","Beowulf was an eye thrilling adventure filled with heroes and villains. I enjoyed Robert Zemeckis's film direction, Ray Winstone's acting was superb as usual as was Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, and Crispin Glover. I highly recommend this film to any Lord of the Ring fans, and to people who love medieval movies. The only major disappointment I have about this film is the quick pace the film takes you on, I fill that there was a major gap between when Beowulf was younger, to when Beowulf was older as a king. This film was pretty entertaining but I felt like there was never really any answer to what happens in the end, and that is for the people who haven't read the story."
"colonel_green","7","1","3","7 December 2007"," A decent adaptation, dragged down by Zemeckis' choices.
","""Beowulf"" is the classic work of Old English literature, but, truth be told, it really isn't much of a story, when viewed in a modern sense; Beowulf fights Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a dragon, winning in each case simply because he can, dying in the final combat, which is completely disconnected from the previous two parts. Tolkien forgive me, but that is my view of the story. Here, Gaiman and Avary solve the structural problem of the disconnect between the first two acts and the third; at the same time the story changes rather dramatically, and is no longer a straightforward heroic tale, but a story about a flawed hero perpetrating a lie and having to face the consequences. Devotees of the classic will take issue with this, but I don't. I find this story a lot more interesting.<br/><br/>The major problem with this film is the way Robert Zemeckis chooses to film it. Zemeckis has always been very interested in pushing technical achievement in his film; ""Forrest Gump"", for example made virtuoso use of editing and CGI to insert Tom Hanks into 40 years of American TV footage. However, in the last little while, his new project as become creating totally photo-real CGI, and he's lost the human element in the process. I am not saying that CGI cannot be used for human characters; Pixar has done so quite successfully; but attempts to completely replicate real actors simply have not worked yet, and, as detailed by the ""Uncanny Valley"" effect, the closer they look to real, the more apparent the flaws in the technology become. The stylized humans in ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" were much more fully realized as characters. Zemeckis should either have shot this in live action, or animated it in a more animated fashion where such matters aren't important.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, and interesting production."
"onelegobuilder","8","1","3","6 December 2007"," The future of action and fantasy films as we know it, 8/10
","*CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Just like the director's previous films ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" and ""Back to the Future."" ""Beowulf"" is a movie both entertaining and visually spectacular. And it's been a very long time for an animated movie to debut strictly for adults. Ray Winestone is wonderful as Beowulf and so is Crispin Glover as the grotesque and violent Grendel. The two actors are probably the ones with the most body tweaking through the CGI process. Still they display great voice work. Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, and John Malkovich are all nice touches too.<br/><br/>The plot has monumental differences from the epic poems. But this film could have taken a whole step backwards by having violence cleaned up as if this was a Disney film. Which it is not. And if you are unwise to compare this movie to a video game you'd better take a look at the cut scenes in parts you don't play. Obviously the video sequences are afterthoughts. Video game designers don't really care about face expressions, lip movements, or body language, only the actual game play. Unlike ""Beowulf"" which is computer animation at its best. Sometimes you can mistake it for being a live action movie. With lifelike violence and male and female nudity. Of course, we will see more of this film-making in the future, because when ""Beowulf"" is talking in one scene and fighting a dragon in another, that character would need a CGI double for that action scene. But if Winestone is already rendered in CGI, there is no doubling!! People can believe that the ""actor"" can clearly be seen in every shot. Do yourself a favor and see this film. I made the mistake of seeing it on the normal screen when it should really be seen in 3-D. Incredible characters, action scenes, scenery, monsters, and storytelling."
"3xHCCH","7","1","3","6 December 2007"," Technology is the Star Here
","I watched this spectacular movie completely in mind-blowing 3D and IMAX! I think this is the only way to watch this movie, and I do not regret the money I paid for it.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where the technology is the star, not the story, the script nor the actors. The movie is completely computer generated. The artwork was excellent in the architecture, the landscape and the male characters, especially Beowulf himself. The 3D effect multiplies the grandiosity and excitement of everything in the film several-fold. The action sequences were really top notch in 3D, most especially the climactic battle of Beowulf and the Dragon. I certainly cannot imagine how this movie would look and feel in 2D.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone's Beowulf looks every inch a hero, but the story makes him flawed, thus more realistic. I did not know who Winstone was before this movie. He has a grand time looking heroic, with his stances, poses and braggadocio. He was totally naked during his battle with Grendel, and the way his manhood was hidden by various other props can be quite amusing, which distracts from the great action somewhat.<br/><br/>I was a bit off-put by the strange over-the-top rendering of Grendel's monstrosity. I did not expect such extremely grotesque interpretation, with a mishmash of deformed human features. The script did imbue Grendel with much drama and tragedy, much enhanced courtesy of Crispin Glover's acting.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was depicted in gorgeous elaborate artwork as Grendel's mother. All the scenes involving Jolie were really very well done. She does well in looking both beautiful and sinister at the same time. Her costume is very remarkable as well. Unfortunately, aside from her, the other female characters were not very well rendered, particularly Robin Wright Penn's Queen.<br/><br/>Overall I would really recommend watching ""Beowulf"". But please watch it in 3D. I cannot avoid comparing this movie with a similarly-themed movie shown earlier this year, ""300"". I liked ""300"" much better because of the live actors involved. (I read that 300 was also available in 3D IMAX format, but I am not sure if they showed this locally. I don't think so.) I gave ""300"" a 5-star rating despite seeing it only in 2D. ""Beowulf"" could have been an average movie, but it gets an extra star because I saw it in 3D."
"lhhung_himself","8","1","3","6 December 2007"," For what it is - it's really pretty good
","This is simply the best 3D film that I've ever seen. Although there are a few times where they still are playing with the technology which are extraneous and distracting, on the whole the 3D experience is well integrated and used to bring out the action in the film. Some of the shots in the hall and in caves were excellent and subtle uses of the technology. The final breathtaking battle scenes were less subtle but effective uses of 3D to generate excitement and bring out different points of views.<br/><br/>What's great about this film is that the parts that you expect to suffer in a CGI movie - acting, plot, characters (think the later Star Wars films) are actually surprisingly strong. The performances are good, closer to the level of LOTR, than Attack of the Clones. Most surprising was how intelligently (relatively speaking- remember this *is* Hollywood) the plot was treated. The beginning of the film is based on the original Beowulf story and they cleverly justified this by having the story preserved in the songs (and recited in old English in one part) which is how it comes down to us. The ending which is new, while tacked on for the effects, was still, IMO, in keeping with the mood and atmosphere of the English classic.<br/><br/>And did I mention the CGI and 3D effects?<br/><br/>Pay the extra to see it in IMAX, the sound and 3D are worth it and make sure you sit far enough away from the screen - if the entire screen isn't in your field of view things can get blurry."

These adventures are narrated now in this good movie in an admirable way full of powerful and beautiful images (even if sometimes horrendous) and movement. The story is told more by images than words and some of them are really breath-taking. The legendary atmosphere of tales of High Middle Ages is very well presented. This story of heroes, monsters, warriors, witches and ordinary men is very well told indeed in all its aspects. One of the best movies of this kind."

","A lot of the audience's problems with The Matrix Reloaded, was the fact that the CGI was too cartoonish for a film in which it is supposed to be realistic. Personally, it didn't bother me in The Matrix Reloaded and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>In Beowulf, the CGI is so close to realistic that I found it detracted from the film because I felt it was very off-putting. The CGI was trying too hard in my estimation. Every character was neither cartoonish or real. Other 3D generated films past (Toy story etc.) have stuck to keeping the feel of the movie more cartoonish.<br/><br/>In other elements, the film was interesting. I enjoyed it. It was very far from great and well above bad.<br/><br/>I think a mixture of CGI and Real life might have been served better - for the movie to look more authentic.

","Beowulf is a motion-cap adaptation of the epic poem and is here to show off it's glory. The cast is racked up with people like Ray Winestone, Robin Wright Penn, Anthony Hopkins yes; Angelina Jolie. The story is about Beowulf attempt to fight and defeat Grendel and then later he must take on Grendel's Mother who wants some hard-core revenge. When the film opens it seems to be a very average film via effects but when Beowulf arrives the film beings to look much better. A scene in which Beowulf fights giant sea creatures left my jaw on the floor. First of all the detail and lighting is perfect then I was surprised how much they could put into a PG-13 film. Zemeckis has shown improvement from 'The Polar Express' but still does not have the 'Forest Gump' thing going on but it's very close to it. The only thing that ruins Beowulf is that the story gets a little off-beat but Gaiman and Avary's script shines most of the time. All together Beowulf is much better then 300 and will epically be one of the best films of the year."
"schaefer.oliver","7","1","3","3 December 2007"," Good film but I don't get this motion capture technique
","Well, if this had been made as a live action feature, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. To me there's no sense in using motion capture instead of live action. OK, the director seems to think that he may have more freedom with camera moves, art direction and the aging problem, not to speak of using the not very slim or athletic Ray Winstone (who I really like as a live action actor) as the hunky hero. The only exception may be the 3-D part, which I wasn't able to see. But I'm pretty sure that this could have been made for the same amount of money as a live action feature with lots of CGI. In ""Beowulf"" I haven't seen anything that wouldn't be possible in live action/CGI. The dragon? Look at ""Reign of fire"" or even ""Dragonheart"" and ""Eragon"". Complicated camera moves? Look at ""The Matrix"" and ""The lord of the rings"". Art direction and production design? Again, look at ""The lord of the rings"", ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"". And instead of Ray Winstone (Sorry, Ray) I'm sure there are enough athletic actors capable of this role. To me, the motion capture versions of Hopkins, Malkovich, Gleeson and their colleagues were distracting during the entire movie. The only really good and realistic looking face was that of Angelina Jolie, which sometimes seemed to not really be ""overpainted"" at all. I'm wishing everyone involved in making this film the very best, but I do hope that this movie won't recoup it's costs and that motion capture will be relegated back to making creatures like ""Gollum"" or ""Grendel"" possible, but not making entire movies using it."
"DarthBill","7","1","3","3 December 2007"," A valiant effort
","Adapted very loosely from the original poem - without which we would not have the plot archetype of ""band of heroic warriors travel into unknown territory to fight an unknown menace they may not be able to handle"" that served writers so well in the centuries that followed, from the sword & sorcery epics to hard hitting science fiction action films like ALIENS (1986) and PREDATOR (1987) - big rugged muscle bound Beowulf (Ray Winstone) is asked by fat old has-been turned drunken degenerate King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) to kill a pesky monster known as Grendel (Crispin Glover) that's been terrorizing Hrothgar's kingdom. Beowulf does as asked - in the nude no less - then goes to kill the big whiny voice brute's mother (Angelina Jolie). The result? Grendle's mom, who appears to be a hot mama shape-shifter, seduces Beowulf, has sexual intercourse with him and then curses him. Hrothgar declares Beowulf his heir, since he has no sons of his own, leaves the kingdom and his lovely, love lorn wife Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) to big B before committing suicide. Years later, an old but still very buff Beowulf finds he must confront a dragon, which turns out to be the shape-shifting son he had with Grendel's mom. Turns out Hrothgar made the same mistake as Beowulf many years ago - he thought with his balls instead of with his brains, slept with Grendel's mom, Grendel was the son of that encounter, and being terrorized by Grendel was Hrothgar's curse, and probably another reason why his wife wouldn't sleep with him, besides the fact that - yet again - Wealthow was a beautiful young lady trapped in a loveless marriage to a man old enough to be her father (or possibly grandfather). By this point, old Beowulf's relationship with the equally old queen is also on the rocks and he's taken to sleeping around with wenches (one particular wench played by Alison Lohman), just as Hrothgar did, but before he goes off to fight the dragon, he tries to reconcile with her. Beowulf fights the dragon - cutting his arm off in the process - dies a hero's death, names his long time sensible best friend Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson) to take his place as king, then at the end Wiglaf is confronted by Grendel's mother, and it is left ambiguous as to whether Wiglaf will succumb to temptation just as Beowulf and Hrothgar did, or if Wiglaf will have the good sense to stay away from the horrid she-demon, thus ending the cycle.<br/><br/>Entertaining as throw away entertainment, but those looking for an honest adaptation of the original poem may be disappointed with the liberties taken. Though Beowulf is still one tough cookie, he's not quite as heroic as the original poem made him out to be, as the screenplay chooses to play him up as a flawed, self-loathing & regretful anti-hero, probably in hopes of making him more appealing to the cynical, jaded audiences of the 21st century, yet you can't help but wonder if that basically defeats the purpose of what his character stands for in the original poem (films such as ""Troy"" and ""Superman Returns"" had a similar problem). Beowulf fighting naked came across as unintentionally funny seeing as how they had to keep hiding his frontal private parts with whatever objects are handy (while it's true he chose to fight without weapons against Grendel in the book, he did not strip himself naked to fight the monster); other bits of nudity (both male & female) or just outright exploitation (zooming in on a bar woman's twitching bosom) feels even more crass here than it would in live action, and reeks of desperation for attention, as if to say ""Look! We're pure CGI but we're doing stuff with CGI that wasn't done in Shrek or Toy Story!"", a desperation that would make even Ralph Bakshi (who made a similar attempt with animation & radioscopy decades ago) roll his eyes. Also, the original poem contained no romantic subplot between Beowulf and the queen, Hrothgar and his wife did have children, Beowulf killed Grendel's mom (he wore armor BTW) and while Beowulf did become king and die fighting a dragon, he became king of a different area, and the dragon was not his offspring. For all these creative liberties, they may as well have just changed all the names of the characters and called it something else (thinkg the 2004 bomb ""King Arthur""). <br/><br/>Beowulf himself looked quite real at times, as did certain props and backgrounds, but other characters were not so fortunate, as the CGI stop motion bit is clearly not completely ironed out yet (empty eyes, vacant stares, puffy faces, etc). The action sequences are quite good though; when they cut loose, they really cut loose. The ""acting"" as it were is decent. Film tries hard, I will give it that. Probably best watched as a separate entity unto itself than as a true adaptation of the poem."

","Simply put, this movie is a showcase of how 3D effects can greatly enhance a movie viewing experience. May not be cutting-edge technology as this are already in use in theme parks or IMAX. Still, I haven't seen a 3D movie as mesmerizing as this. When I saw the swooping landscapes, the 3D really gives it a very good sense of distance and perspective. I can feel the scale of near and far objects. Then there's the action sequences which benefits from the use of 3D effects. Adding that third dimension enhances the viewer's experience by giving the illusion of being closer to the action. Combine this with the clever use of camera angles and movements and you got yourself a winner. Even simple scenes such as people talking and moving around - we see the characters, surroundings and objects pops out of the theater screen. It's a treat for the eyes.<br/><br/>The 3D effect is topnotch but the CGI animation itself is somewhat of a letdown. The quality is not consistent. There are times when King Hrothgar, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, does look like the actor but on other scenes the character looked entirely different. Facial animation is very important as this is the main driver for the visuals of the character's emotions and yet we see unblinking eyes and some video game-grade lip-sync. Face modeling looks great for the male characters while a little patchy on the female characters. Beowulf's face is nicely rendered, the facial hair, pores and scars looked realistic. Contrast it with Queen Wealtheow's face whose texture looked like it came from a wax museum. The jerky movements of the characters is also noticeable at times. Overall, good animation but I've seen better.<br/><br/>The story takes a backseat from the overwhelming visuals but it's still good. It is based from the heroic legend of Beowulf, battling a monster named Grendel and a dragon. What I appreciated about the movie is that the writers, Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, ties up those two unrelated battles by including a subplot showing that the hero can be fallible and dearly pays for his mistake. I like the story adaptation but purists will surely be upset.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing just for the novelty of the 3D effects, so please skip the 2D version. The movie is a good effort and I'm looking forward on the next generation of 3D movies.<br/><br/>I watched the movie at SM North, admission price P300.

Afterward, he must face Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie in an enticing role) and years later a dragon. This movie can be taken as a metaphor on life and many of the things we all go through at some point in our lives. One of the most prevalent involves the sins of the father and how those sins can lead to more dangerous things in the future.<br/><br/>The story in the movie is not great, but it works well enough in a movie like Beowulf that is 100 percent computer graphic, and actually looks good. The characters, especially Anthony Hopkins as Hrothgar and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother, were almost identical to the people playing them in real life. The scenery surrounding the characters was also splendid, and the creation of Grendel almost tops that of Gollum in Lord of The Rings. I really felt for Grendel (played perfectly by Crispin Glover). Instead of making Grendel the horrible beast that he was in the poem, the writers and director made him into a sort of tragic creature that we all pitied.<br/><br/>Not much else to say. Beowulf is definitely a movie that entertains until the end. It may not be the best movie you'll see all year, but it definitely isn't the worst."
"grumpy-3","3","1","3","1 December 2007"," dated and underwhelming cgi
","this is the year 2007 and yet the cgi in this film looks about ten years old, the character movements are stilted, the eyes have no expression in them, how come they can get it right in the kids cgi films that pixar do, and the great achievements of the Rings movies and King Kong, about more than half the cgi in here is pretty bad, if it were not for the 3d which mostly works i would have walked out halfway thru, the other major flaw in the film is the dreadful voice of ray winstone, who knows what accent he was going for at times he sounded like a bad peter o'toole and an even worse richard burton, and worst of all he did his trademark shouting every sentence, the best thing was the creation of grendel's mother the animation almost did justice to the beauty of angelina jollie and her voice was perfect, it goes without saying that the script was truly appalling even by comic book standards, all in all a pretty bad movie i cannot believe its rating is as high as it is, it should not be more than a 3"
"arthera09","9","1","3","1 December 2007"," Not a great movie if not for the 3D
","I loved this movie. I was smiling for almost all of it. The visuals were absolutely stunning and I cannot wait to see what the future has for this new type of movie making. The story was actually pretty weak and the writing was surprisingly bad considering I really like Neil Gaiman. It was not paced well. The dialog was lacking and the story was just not that good. I am not a fan of how Grendel's mother was a beautiful demon. I would have loved to have seen a story following Beowolf making a name for himself and them having the movie end with a battle with Grendel and then his mother. The other thing that I did not like was the who the nudity was handled. It reminded me and it seemed like most of the audience of the Austin Powers scene from the first movie. I think they should have just made an R-rated version and let the man meat be out there instead of using stupid props to cover it up. Even with the fact that it was not a great movie it looked so good it makes up for it. I actually flinch more than a few times at things coming at me or from behind me. I actually felt tempted to turn around occasionally to make sure a tree branch wasn't going to hit me in the back of the head. The faces did not show all of the emotion that real actors could, but it was still stunning. One of my favorite parts was a rather quite part of the movie where it was snowing on a little bridge. One can really see all of the snowflakes and how they actually looked layered. I describe say how cool the action sequenced looked and they must be seen for themselves. In all honesty this movie would have gotten a 6 or even a 5 without the 3D, but with the 3D the movie was a pure pleasure and is a once in a lifetime experience. I do want to mention it took a few seconds for my eyes to get used it, but after about 5 or 10 minutes my mind bought it and it only came up when I away from the screen."

","After initially being put off by the motion capture technique used in this movie, once I settled into it I was riveted. I've always loved the Beowulf and Grendel story and although this is not a literal interpretation of the classic epic poem, it is thoroughly entertaining on it's own terms. I went in the theatre knowing nothing of the cast, save that Angelina Jolie (fantastic dragon lady!) was in it and was pleasantly surprised to find the likes of Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn sharing the screen. I will not even reveal who played Grendel, because it was such a treat to discover this at the end, in the credits. I found this version of the story to be the absolute best I've ever seen even if the director did take certain liberties in the retelling. I appreciate the fact that the director was able to evoke my sympathy for pitiful Grendel even as I was revolted and horrified by him. He is rather a Frankenstein monster for the medieval set; didn't ask to be born, but there he is. I cannot possibly spoil this movie for anyone which I will do if I keep writing. Hie thee to the theatre posthaste and see this mesmerizing film!"

","Went to see this at the IMAX in Waterloo, London. Great fun to watch-made all the more so by meeting Beowulf himself- Ray Winstone, who had sneaked in with his wife to catch the film on a relatively quiet Monday afternoon.<br/><br/>Sorry Ray- I had to get a photo! The film opens and after a few minutes of settling into the ""3D"" format (initial camera tracking/panning shots appeared a little blurry to me), the movie set its stall out quickly.<br/><br/>Grendal, the genetically deformed ""monster""-spawn of the union of a water demon and a man, is tortured to the point of self-harming by sounds of revelry and fornication coming from the drinking hall of King Hrothgar. The creature is great- not traditionally scary or cool-looking, ala Alien or predator, more a melting pot of the Fly crossed with gollum on steroids! Grendal is closer to Karloff's sad & misunderstood monster in Frankenstein, than any evil incarnate. However, he wrecks a terrible blood-thirtsy revenge on the men and women of the town. This was a superb, grotesque and horrific slaughter-brought to life by the huge IMAX ""3D"" screen. Beowulf enters the fray, travelling from overseas, seeking glory and reward. Inadvertently, his ambition is sowing the seeds of his own destruction at the hands of the only mortal who can defeat him- himself. The boastful, but likable portrayal of the young hero is captured wonderfully by the unrecognisable Winstone, as is Hopkins King Hrothgar. Angelina Jolie has never looked more sensual- and all in a CGI/motion capture movie! <br/><br/>Beowulf defeats Grendal-but at what price? Will The temptation into the Faustian pact between Beowulf and the beasts mother be his undoing? Will he realise the true cost of his actions? <br/><br/>The final battle with the Dragon is superb!<br/><br/>The original Epic story comes from a 3000+ lined poem from England-as early as 700A.D. and contains many of the key emotional elements of human-kinds greatest strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>PLUS POINTS: The 3D and the motion capture CGI is getting better and better- not much of the dead zombie eyes in this. Brutal, action packed set pieces. A solid story. NEGATIVE FACTORS: -The naked Beowulf's genitals being covered in every shot by furnishings, foreground etc, ala Austin Powers- should have left him with his wolf skin pants on! -The animated horses were poor in terms of capturing their motion- seemed a little unconvincing. - People moaning about it doesn't look totally real! Get over it- it isn't!<br/><br/>One thing I have to say, just because this is in essence an ""animated"" movie- does not make it ""Walt Disney"" by any means! To suggest kids younger than 12 (even if accompanied by an adult) can see this is crazy! The censors should be ashamed!"

","If you have read the Beowulf, the book Grendel, and some work by Nietzche ,especially, Genelogy of Morality, then this script will surely be of great satisfaction to you. If you are hoping for the uber-Christian hero of the original epic you have come to the wrong movie. The movie alters the elements of the original story, casting all the main characters and events in a light that is not early-Christin propaganda, but instead a decidedly unchristian interpretation.<br/><br/>As to the visual effects, i thought they worked very well sense a CGI creatures in most movies tend to stick out like a sore thumb. With the whole movie as a digital rendering the actors and monsters at least seemed to exist within the same visual field.<br/><br/>I am very surprised that this got a PG-13 rating as it is sexually explicit in many ways and graphically violent in even more. I would certainly not recommend taking younger children to the movie.<br/><br/>In summation this movie was an intelligent action film that had developed and flawed characters, and was not afraid to ridicule itself and its genre from time to time. Ingenuity of Visual Effects, Intelligent Plot, unique adaption, humor, and good pacing made this movie well worth seeing."

","Having never read the story before, I came into Beowulf not knowing exactly what to expect. However, within the first five minutes, I was sold on the ambiance of the picture. Robert Zemenkis creates a mileu of a beautiful yet unforgiving snowy landscape that sets the tone for the story, (the same kind of dark ambiance one can expect in Harry Potter). I came in expecting excessive spectacle, ( like 300), and granted, there was some, but not in excess. The 3-d effect was a also a welcomed addition. The only thing I grew weary of was the lack of development in Beowulf character, whereas they stereotyped him as a Leonidas like hero, brawling, boisterous, and full of hubris. Otherwise the story is a classic that I am glad to see has stood the test of time."

","This is good movie and reminds me those orcs from those RPG games we used to play in the basement and The Lord of the Rings. I also think they could have made this movie bigger. The story has a good message honesty, bravery and choices in life. One must always make a choice and live with it for the rest of their life... be it lust, love, sex, fighting, lying, etc...<br/><br/>The CGI reminded me of the Final Fantasy IV Movie. A couple times during the movie I actually felt as though I was there, (of course the actors are a little big because of the huge IMAX screen). Take for example the stormy boat voyage or the one scene with a lantern in the top left corner. B.t.w. I think sitting position has a little influence on your final experience. We sat on the left side and further to the back, but to be honest, at the end, once the place cleared up and the credits where still rolling, I moved closer to the front (ie. First row of the second section) and the experience felt a bit more enveloping. If you've never seen a 3D movie, do see this. The entire movie is 3D and beats the 10 minutes of 3D effect which came out this summer in Harry Potter. <br/><br/>I gave it 8 out of 10 stars. Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing in her role as an evil seductress. The male actors give a comforting recognized voice. Unfortunately, I believe the lip movement was a little off from the voices at one point. The music is superb with not too much techno mixed into the classic sections. I personally believe music should stay in the background and in this case there where only a few instances where it shines... with it hidden themes. I'm no expert but the folly sounds didn't always seem quite on par with the actions. Finally, if you're the type that likes to lean your head on your companion, the 3D IMAX version may not be the best version for you. This is because the polarized lenses only work when you keep your head straight. Enjoy and watch out for the flying blood, arrows, arms, gory, arrows, spears, and great effects. A good movie to hold hands and experience an extra palpitation! <br/><br/>I wonder what a 3D movie with the only setting being that, and imitating, of a theater play would feel like!"
"super-cow","5","1","3","22 November 2007"," Gayowulf...
","To start off, I have a few spoilers in this review which are well marked so don't be afraid of me throwing in anything important without warning. I was very neutral about Beowulf when I went to see the film. I was skeptical when I saw the trailer, however, a lot of positive reviews had made me think it might be pretty good. I saw the 3D version which was about the best thing about it. Where to begin? Beowulf was completely in CGI, which was a huge surprise to me when I actually sat down to see it. The animation was very well done for the exception of a few of the characters. The 3D effects were at some parts very enjoyable, and others it was pretty much a joke. I imagine watching this at home and wondering why there is a spear head that takes up the entire screen, then remembering this movie was tailored for 3D. The only really horrible moment to me in the animation was the scene with Grendel's mother, and Beowulf. Beowulf looks fine on his own, however, Grendel's mother looks so much more realistic that it makes for an awkward clash in contrast. This was honestly the only moment a normal person could complain about as far as animation goes.<br/><br/>Onto the plot and characters... I really don't like Beowulf in this movie. He's pretty much portrayed as a boastful liar which makes for a horrible hero if you ask me. Everyone has flaws, but to have a character where his only sense of heroism is in physical prowess is difficult to identify with. Anthony Hopkins character really fit well into this movie as well as most of the other protagonists. The only problem was I felt like they all wore their personalities way out there so you could get to know them very quickly because there was absolutely no story telling in this film at all. To appreciate a film you don't have to like all, or any of the characters but it really does help. The plot was pretty weak I felt. It was more of a troubled love story, and less of an epic story of a hero which seems to me to fit the title better. In a movie just full of action this kind of thing really doesn't matter because its more like filler for scenes with no action. Unfortunately for Beowulf there was not enough action to carry this empty plot and make a decent film out of it. The setting didn't change much at all, it was basically taking place around a small village. I will give them that at the end of the movie it really transformed from small and pathetic to pretty vast.<br/><br/>The directing was excellent if you ask me. The action sequences flowed very nicely, and I really did enjoy the soundtrack written for this movie. There were some amazing shots of Beowulf performing slices on sea monsters and a dragon. Overall a well shot film and I can see why they went CGI.<br/><br/>Overall Beowulf felt very empty. I felt like I watched a whole lot of nothing happen on the screen. There were only 2 significant action sequences, and a few very brief mentions of action. The plot was very bland and I felt like there was not much that actually happened throughout the whole movie, and the resolution if you can call it that when the credits rolled made me want to punch someone. The soundtrack from the beginning to the end was spot on. I feel like this is a great movie for 3D, however, I feel like 3D can really cheapen a film. Look at Friday the 13th part 3 that film was pretty ridiculous. Beowulf is worth a single watch in 3D because there are some good moments, however I don't imagine this ever appearing on my DVD shelf. There were quite a few laughable moments (**SPOILERS** the butt naked fight scene, him bursting through a sea monsters head screaming ""BEOWULF!!!!!!"", and my favorite was when he cut his own arm off and it didn't even seem to work out that well. Personally I would untwist myself or something so I could manage to kill the dragon and land on that bridge...**END OF SPOILERS**) 5/10"

"musichawkeye","7","2","10","14 November 2007"," The story behind the legend...
","If you've never heard the story, ""Beowulf"" is the tale of the legendary warrior Beowulf who comes to a distant land to conquer Grendel, a monster annihilating the countryside. After being told countless warriors have lost their lives trying to defeat this monster, Beowulf fearlessly declares he will be the victor against this foul beast. The mighty warrior keeps to his word and defeats Grendel in hand-to-hand combat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the city is soon attacked once again by Grendel's mother, who is enraged by the loss of her son and wants revenge. To make a long story short, Beowulf defeats her as well. The story then picks up years later when Beowulf is now king of his own land and must deal with a dragon terrorizing the town. Once again, to make a long story short, Beowulf is defeated by the dragon but his trusted companion comes out victorious and saves the land.<br/><br/>So how was Hollywood going to turn this paragraph into a movie? I must say, I was quite surprised. Figuring the makers of the film would simply take the basic story and add pointless extra scenes, it turned out the idea of the film was quite different. Basically, this is what really happened to Beowulf. The story that has been around for a reasonably long time turns out to be simply stuff of legend and bards' tales. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away anymore, but I will say right away that this is not for the weak of heart. Although it is an animated feature, there is gore galore. The animation is stunning with some scenery that looks almost real.<br/><br/>As for the characters, they look just as realistic. Speaking of the characters, the character development in the film is done excellently as well. Beowulf is a hero and he knows it. So, like any other hero would be, he is full of arrogance and likes to stretch the truth. <br/><br/>So if you're looking for a legendary adventure filled with action, Beowulf is exactly what you're searching for. It arrives in theaters everywhere Friday the 16th of November."

In my honest opinion, I felt that this movie tried too hard to beat out a movie that came out earlier this year, 300.

In fact, in the poem Beowulf neither has an heir nor marries. His fatherlessness is a source of regret on his deathbed.

","If you've read Beowulf as I have countless times (both in the original Anglo Saxon,as well as the current English translation by Seamus Heaney),you pretty much know what to expect from the grand epic poem. Okay, I will admit that Beowulf looks fantastic on screen (the digital 3D-CGI is absolutely eye popping!). This is pretty much where it all comes to a screeching halt. With respects to Neil Gaiman (who penned a fantastic screenplay for 'Mirrormask',which blew me out of my shoes),and Roger Avery (responsible for the finer than fine debut 'Killing Zoe' some years back),their collaboration on Beowulf is a crashing disappointment. I never once brought into the concept that Grendel was Hrothgar's illegitimate son by his dally with Grendel's mother (why do you think Grendel slaughtered just about everybody else in the Mead hall except for Hrothgar?). I also didn't buy into Beowulf also going for a tumble between the sheets with Grendel's mother (thus resulting in the dragon in Beowulf's senior years). Honestly,you would do far better than to snap up a copy of the Seamus Heaney translation (especially if you can get ahold of the bi-lingual edition),or even a recording of Beowulf that I got ahold of some time ago (spoken in the original Anglo Saxon),than to subject yourself to this beautiful looking mess of a movie.

"moviegeek310","8","1","4","28 December 2007"," Breathtaking and weird
","Two years ago ""The Polar Express"" was released and it was done entirely in 3-D motion capture. The result was amazing landscapes but the people looked glassy and their eyes were soulless and lifeless. Two years later the same thing has been done for ""Beowulf"" and this time the result is even better. The landscapes, people, and creatures all look better than real life, but the eyes still look soulless, which is why the motion capture idea will never fully work. You can never animate that look in our eyes, that little twinkle, and since they can't it takes away from the realism. That being said this movie is stunning, amazingly well done, and a man's movie. Sure, girls will like it, if they like seeing a guy battle eight sea monsters, simultaneously flying from monster to monster. So this is defiantly for us geeks. Another sequence features Beowulf battling a dragon for a good seven minutes, and it is one of the best action scenes this year. Geek-out time! <br/><br/>Though there are many battles, some parts in-between do drag, all you can think while the characters chat away is, ""How are they going to blow me away in the next scene?"" And they always do, ""Beowulf"" will fry your senses. This is not the ""Beowulf"" you remember reading though, the only thing that remains the same is Beowulf battling Grendel. <br/><br/>And the character of Grendel is a huge achievement. He is so grotesque and yet at the same time you feel pity for him. Props to the designers for making a creature that beats even Gollum of ""Lord of the Rings"". Ray Winstone as Beowulf does a great job making a regularly bigger, older guy into a muscular warrior all thanks to CG. And of course there is Angelina Jolie as Grendel's serpent like mother, and that's all I'll say. And when you see it, be sure to see it in 3-D, because unlike other 3-D films released lately where they fry your eyeballs, this one doesn't hurt your eyes. And it is so cool seeing snow and arrows fly in front of your eyes, and buckets and buckets of creature blood that dump all over you. <br/><br/>Battles, monsters, and Angelina Jolie, what more could a guy want?"
"Robert_duder","8","1","4","20 December 2007"," Visuallly stunning saves the film from obscurity
","I suppose I had decently high expectations for Beowulf as it did really look impressive and I enjoy period/historical films or mythical in this case. Beowulf will and is doing very well and for good reason. First of all I think the phenomenal Robert Zemeckis is really on to something with this style of film making and I think over the next few years we will see some incredible developments with CGI film making like we have seen with this film, Final Fantasy films, and Polar Express but Beowulf captures it and makes it it's own and does it brilliantly. The film is jaw dropping to look at. The characters are seamless (most of them) and it's just incredible the detail and movements and setting. You just can't even get over how stunning this is considering it is animated at heart. The characters (again most of them) are spitting images of their counterparts. This could lead to some great advances in movie making including the idea of perhaps putting late great actors back into films...controversial but very doable. Marlon Brando could return to the screen, Harrison Ford could do action films into his nineties....and so forth. So the unfortunate part of how stunning Beowulf is that the story lacks something...passion perhaps, a steady and intriguing story? I mean of course Beowulf is classic Urban Legend but there just was missing something....it wasn't the action, there were some incredible battles and sword play. Some of the characters lacked depth or story and just left you feeling like you wanted more from it.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone is Beowulf (as he tells us approximately eight times according to my count.) Still Winstone does a terrific job capturing this character. He's a man's man hero, rough, rugged, masculine, and very naked for a good portion of this film. And it's not sexual naked because he's battling Grendal (the beast) during his scenes of nudity. If I were Winstone I'd be quite proud of my animated counter part. Still he adds style, class and real rugged heroism to the part. I think Anthony Hopkins truly steals the show as King Hrothgar. His character is startlingly real and resembles him in every way and such detail in the face and his voice and emotion is truly incredible. This is a terrific highlight of the film and Hopkins makes the movie worthwhile by himself. Robin Wright Penn is his young Queen Wealthow and she is one of the few characters that has such little depth that she looks like a zombie through most of the film. She shows little emotion, even when she sings it sounds robotic and her character looks far more cartoon-y than any other. She was almost a pointless character except for the object of Beowulf's affections which doesn't even blossom into anything at all. If you look closely enough you can literally see Crispin Glover in the beast that is Grendal. He does an amazing job which is either in part to his acting and voice performance or to the creation of the beast which is hideous and yet somehow you feel pity for the beast and illegitimate son of the King. Brendan Gleeson is terrific and yet another one of those sadly underused and underdeveloped characters as Beowulf's right hand man. Finally Angelina Jolie's chilling voice and mysterious demeanor definitely adds to the villain that is Grendal's mother. Mostly she is used for pixel-ated eye candy...but they did a decent job on that as well.<br/><br/>The film relies almost entirely on it's two main battles. The first one is Beowulf's naked battle with Grendal which is an intense and well done battle and the second is the edge of your seat incredible battle with the Dragon in Beowulf's later life stages. Both are incredible and just grip you into your seat and leave you breathless but there is hardly any story in between the two battles to hold it all together. There is no romance or character exploration or any real story besides these I have mentioned. It doesn't make the film unwatchable at all...it just means that the film could have been a mind blowing ten but unfortunately sits around average good film for me with an eight. Still it's worth seeing again and again for it's stunning reality in animation, the amazing performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins and some really beautiful scenery and the winter stricken Denmark. Not the greatest film out there but a decent action flick for adults. 8/10"

","I didn't really expect much out of this one - I mainly watched it cause there was nothing better to see in the cinema that week - and was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps it isn't very accurate compared to the original work, but tells a great legend of its own. The movie is not a typical Hollywood flick - not too many clich√©s, not too much romance - which I find very refreshing and totally appropriate for the theme. The movie isn't very ambitious in its scope and doesn't take itself too seriously, but still succeeds in creating proper setting and atmosphere. This is very much helped by the language Grendel uses - I don't know if it's actual Old Norse (or Old English), but at least the distorted pronunciation is really fitting. The CG itself is, of course, top-notch and, quite surprisingly, very realistic looking. Believe me, the trailer doesn't make this one justice - it's not only flashy action sequences and doesn't look that cartoony. Highly recommended."

And just like traditional animation has developed several techniques (like Rotoscoping), 3D animation also developed its own styles, like photorealism, which attempts to mimic real life employing techniques such as motion capture. Director Robert Zemeckis has been working with this style for a while, with his first animated film being 2004's ""The Polar Express"", which showed the potential of motion capture. His next animated feature was also based on the motion capture technique, but this time he used it to recreate England's oldest epic narration: the Norse legend of ""Beowulf"".<br/><br/>Following closely the epic poem, the movie chronicles the story of how a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover) terrorized the famous mead hall Heorot, slaughtering the people of danish King Hrothgar (Anthony Hokins) and bringing death to his lands. Hearing of the problems at Heorot, a Geatish hero named Beowulf (Ray Winstone) arrives to Hrothgar's mead hall with his men, claiming to be the world's greatest hero and the only one able to kill the monster. King Hrothgar decides to give Beowulf and his men a chance to prove their courage and allows them to battle Grendel, however, this fight will prove to be decisive in Beowulf's life, as not only he'll face a monster beyond his imagination, he'll also be forced to confront his inner demons when he meets Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and to make things worse, he'll fall in love with the King's beautiful wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).<br/><br/>As written above, ""Beowulf"" follows the Old English poem quite faithfully, in the sense that it covers all the major battles and challenges that Beowulf faced. However, writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary use the poem's outline to add a back-story that ties all the poem's events, and at the same time explores the theme of the difference between man and myth in heroic tales. This adds an interesting complexity to the poem's characters (which are more archetypes than real persons), as while we do watch Beowulf as the mythic heroic warrior the poem talks about, we also see him as man whose greatest wish is to be remembered as a hero, and often falls in the temptation of exaggerating his feats. It's a take that many purists of the poem may dislike, but personally I found the script to be the strongest part of the film. The touch of sly humor is also another welcomed surprise in the screenplay.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis makes a good job at making the Norse legend come to life again in animated form, recreating in a very detailed way the atmosphere of myth and magic that the epic tale conveys. While Gaiman and Avery's script takes some liberties with the original story, Zemeckis makes sure to keep that sense of thrill and adventure that has made ""Beowulf"" to be a captivating story for over a thousand years. The technology employed in the film is definitely a big improvement over the work done in ""The Polar Express"", and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call ""Beowulf"" the best motion capture film ever done so far, however, Zemeckis' decision to use an extreme photorealism in the design (to the point that some actors look exactly as their real counterparts) isn't really as fortunate, as the closer the characters look to real life, the easier it gets to to spot flaws in them.<br/><br/>Now, this is not really a problem of the cast, as while they aren't all excellent, for the most part they all make an efficient job in their roles. As the heroic and proud Beowulf, Ray Winstone is very good and makes a very human portrait of the mythic warrior, taking advantage of the fact that the script has humanized his character a bit. As his best friend Wiglaf, Brendan Gleeson shines despite the small size of his role, and he gets some of the best lines in the film. Anthony Hopkins is good as Hrothgar, but nothing really surprising, and the same could be said of Robin Wright Penn as Wealthow. However, Crispin Glover steals the show as Grendel, as he manages to deliver a poignant performance behind the his computer generated facade. Angelina Jolie is also very good in her role, although her accent wasn't really the most appropriate.<br/><br/>With a very good cast, the best technology for computer animation and on top of that a solid script, one would think that ""Beowulf"" could be a flawless example of animated art, but sadly, something just doesn't work completely. The problem, in my opinion, is that once again Zemeckis seems to be too enamored of his technology, and in his choice of making an extremely realist animated version, he has put the animation's flaws on display to everyone. What I mean is that this search for realism brings to the spotlight a major problem: the quality of the animation doesn't look constant, as while some characters do look amazingly like the actors that play them (Grendel's mother being the most notorious), others look extremely fake (Wiglaf and Hrothgar for example), so the contrast between them is glaringly obvious, and that's really bad.<br/><br/>And this leads to another problem, or more precisely, a question: if Zemeckis wanted such an extreme photorealism in his film, why not use real actors to do it? But despite this, ""Beowulf"" is not only an interesting experiment, if one gets over the idea that it's an animated film, one will find that behind the flashy graphics there's a powerful story, a story that has been thrilling our imagination for centuries. And still can do that and more.<br/><br/>8/10"
"barrys82","9","1","4","1 December 2007"," visually incredible, excellent animation, and epic movie.
","Beowulf is the proof of what can be done with animation nowadays, a movie that seems to be acted by real people but that is actually made completely by cgi. A film that follows the same line as 300. Beowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar which is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel, help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf, it is his job to slay the monster, but with the death of the monster comes new problems to the powerful hero, the story is very interesting, with a lot of action and adventure that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The cast is just wonderful, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn and Ray Winstone everybody with their animated character and giving stunning performances. This is a movie definitely worth to see for the story and the animation."

","Actually, I liked this movie. I think I would have liked it even without the 3D effects that are peppered throughout this movie. It tells a good story and sets up the plot for an energetic finale where the movie really earns its price of admission. I did find Beowulf a bit over-the-top bombastic at times (hence my summary line), but this eventually gave way as his character evolved and I was able to write that off simply as character development. That annoyance aside, I should mention something about the CGI, which was marvelous. Note that The ENTIRE movie is CGI...there are no live actors present, although the CGI characters look like their real-life counterparts in places (i.e. Anthony Hopkins' character looks like Anthony Hopkins). I found this funny since I usually associate CGI with creating brand-new fantasy characters (Grendel? Also played by an actor but nothing you can recognize), not with attempting to model actual actors. I'm not sure if I really like that aspect of the CGI...if I wanted to see Angelina Jolie somehow I expect the real thing. But that's just IMHO, and it really doesn't take away from an otherwise good movie...."
"TTA_mod","7","1","4","21 November 2007"," Good, but not for everyone
","Let me start by saying this: This movie is not for everyone. A lot of people will fall in love with this film and a lot of people will smite it to the depths. First, let me start with the 3D aspect of it. In my opinion, it looked like one of the Shrek movies. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can prove to be a distraction at times. The previews do not really do this film justice, as it is a lot deeper than just ""let's kill Grendol!!!"" Grendol is a pretty sick and twisted being, however, and was one of the more interesting characters. Another part of this movie that strikes me as odd is the fact that it can be laugh out loud funny at times, which seems out of place. I enjoyed the movie wholly, though, despite some flaws. It is not the greatest epic of all time, but far from the worst. All I can say is to go out there and see it for yourself. It is worth the $9 and everyone will get at least something out of it, whether it is the deep, underlying themes or the thrill of seeing some guy that is animated like Shrek getting ripped in half."
"MovieZoo","7","2","13","16 November 2007"," Beowulf barks and sometimes bites beautifully
","I went to Beowulf because of the animation and Anthony Hopkins. Here's what I got: A beautiful piece of art spiced with the voice of one of the best performers in movie history.<br/><br/>The story is a wonderful piece of lore. Too bad that masterpiece has to compete with another masterpiece, which is the CGI. So you have the classic story working against visual splendor. What a weird thing to happen. It was not bad, I gave it a 7, it was just almost irritating. I was dodging things thrown at my face and blood dripping into my eye. I lived to tell about it though, thank God.<br/><br/>Here's the problem with the CGI. The faces often didn't stay the same. It wasn't a matter of facial expression, they just changed so it looked like more than one person had his/her own impression how the face should appear. It wasn't a major problem, it was just noticeable. BUT, one big problem with the CGI is they still cannot make a beautiful woman look like a beautiful woman. Sure they have no problem getting Hopkins' aging wrinkled skin right but they still make young women look like plastic Barbie dolls. Yes it sounds picky and probably petty but it is a fact. They will get it right one day I am sure.<br/><br/>As far as they have come with CGI, this movie deserves credit for its historic achievement. I applaud everyone for a job well done. But I want to say, they just need to learn to stop trying to overwhelming the viewer with art so other aspects are not drowned out.<br/><br/>See it for the CGI and you will not be disappointed."
"McFrogg","1","1","5","19 April 2018"," Garbageowulf
","This movie is an insult to the original poem.<br/><br/>I have to wonder why some people make movies based on stories or characters they hate (as the director himself has admitted). I also wonder how anyone can hate Beowulf, one of the greatest stories ever told. How is that even possible?<br/><br/>When I first heard that they were making a movie based on Beowulf, I was so excited. I could almost picture it in my head. Misty landscapes, dark, scary forests...I looked forward to the epic battle between Beowulf and Grendel, and the heroic (and tragic) fight with the dragon.<br/><br/>What I got instead was a soulless CGI movie made by people who really hate Beowulf. A deconstructed version of the epic poem, full of politically correct nonsense. Beowulf isn't portrayed as a hero in this movie. Instead, he's a lying manwhore who sleeps with everything that moves. Grendel is just a poor misunderstood creature and King Hrothgar's illegitimate son. Almost every male character in this movie is stupid/evil/perverted/cruel and likes to have sex with female monsters.<br/><br/>What's the point? Why make movies like this? Movies where the hero is as bad as everyone else, or worse. It's immoral, mean-spirited and dangerous. It's cynical, anti-heroic, anti-Christian, anti-male and extremely boring. What a nihilistic piece of trash.<br/><br/>I hope someone'll make a good version of Beowulf in the near future, but I really doubt it. This should have been made much earlier, when someone like Ray Harryhausen lived. Modern filmmakers aren't interested in heroes like Beowulf, they only want to deconstruct and politicize everything.<br/><br/>Someone should make a movie where Robert Zemeckis life is deconstructed in the same way he deconstructed Beowulf."
"derdriui","Null","1","5","3 April 2009"," Shockingly crap
","AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.<br/><br/>I watched this a long time ago. Not even the greatest fans of bad movies can appreciate this. Gone was the lovely flowing rhythm of the poem - gone was any potential message.<br/><br/>Instead, they managed to make you go ""PICK ONE. LIVE ACTION OR CGI. PICK ONE."" and somehow made Angelina Jolie look unattractive.<br/><br/>It's creepy, but in a Zack Snyder sort of way. AVOID.<br/><br/>It looks like a lot of effort, and it has a good cast billing. And Neil Gaiman helped write it. How they went so wrong I do not know. Even that racist, homophobic idiot Zack Snyder could blame the comic book 300 (although the fact that he made it and made it worse is a stunning accomplishment), the source material for Beowulf was BEOWULF.<br/><br/>Guh. Idiots."
"Elswet","9","1","5","4 December 2007"," Tragically Lovely
","The tale of Beowulf was told in an epic poem by an unknown 8th-11th century author. It tells of Beowulf, a Geat (Goth) hero of what is now known as Sweden, and his three equally epic battles with Grendel, Grendel's mother (known here and there as the Black Queen of Midguard), and an unnamed Dragon (thought by some to be the Midguard Serpent).<br/><br/>While this film tells the tale somewhat differently than the author's original interpretation (the author, for instance, lays the hero to rest beneath a sacred mound), it tells Beowulf's story in a way never before told...with an obvious love of the tale itself, a love of the medium in which it is delivered, and a love of the artistry herein employed.<br/><br/>This is a lovely Friday/Saturday night's viewing, as there is something for everyone: While some scenes are not suitable for children, they will be drawn by the awesome animation quality, men will (no doubt) enjoy the raucous behavior of the men and the monsters, and women should identify with the plight and innate dignity (even in the face of what some would consider shame) of the Queen. There is ample action herein to keep most fan-boys happy, and enough story to make what CAN be dry reading, a great adventure.<br/><br/>It rates an easy 9/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"LazySod","7","1","5","26 November 2007"," Not entirely bad
","Once every few years the poem of Beowulf and Grendel is made into a film. Some get aired on television, some make it to the cinema, and some get edited so that they work well on the IMAX format. This one falls into that last category.<br/><br/>The story is so old that it is known to almost everyone. It is the classical tale where a hero comes to save the day by defeating a demon that has been terrorizing the lands for some time. It's also the story of the hero that makes a most dreadful mistake.<br/><br/>So, story wise there is nothing new here. What makes this Beowulf different from the others that have been out there is that this one features a few things that make it work well in IMAX theaters. It also differs from most others because it uses a sort of CGI acting method where real actors get smudged into the CGI instead of the other way around. It works out well enough, looking more or less like an adult animation film.<br/><br/>Most of the effects are done well enough, only a few are of the toe curling bad stuff that makes for films like Jumanji All in all, not quite the worst to be in the cinemas this year.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 demons from the other world"
"highland-9","7","1","5","23 November 2007"," Not a fan of this kind of CGI, but story twist pretty good.
","CGI with LOTR and 300 was entertaining - not so much so in Beowulf 2007. Of the 4 recent Beowulf movies (within the last 8 years or so), I have seen 3. I have not seen the 1999 ""Beowulf,"" but have seen The 13th Warrior, Beowulf and Grendel, and Beowulf - 2007. I have enjoyed each of these in their own right, as I did this one; however, the CGI use threw me for awhile on this latest version.<br/><br/>The main distracting element was that some characters' images seemed more ""real"" than others. Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) Queen (Robin Wright) seemed more like an X-box character than even a CGI-like actor depiction (Ms. Wright was best in Forrest Gump). Anthony Hopkins, on the other hand, came across fairly well (except for some audio synch and wooden movement glitches). It might just be that Wright had trouble acting (voice and movement) for this style, but this contrast was distracting between not only those characters, but with regard to others within the film, as well.<br/><br/>The additional story element was unique, and indeed, rescued the last part of the movie for me. These Beowulf twists (in all the movies I've seen) make for some interesting story-telling, and this was no exception."
"rparham","7","1","5","23 November 2007"," A sumptuous visual feast
","In the ever evolving medium that is the motion picture, director Robert Zemeckis has thrown down the latest gauntlet in the arena of visual wonder with his computer animated adaptation of the epic poem Beowulf. Released in IMAX 3D, REAL-D 3D and standard two dimensional projection simultaneously, Beowulf is nothing short of a eye-popping marvel that proves a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The fact that it is not a masterpiece in other areas, but still a decent entertainment, does not dull its ability to provoke wonder for the audience.<br/><br/>Alternately an adaptation and a deconstruction of the tale most of us have had to tread through, to some degree, in grade school, Beowulf opens in Denmark in 507 AD, where King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has emerged victorious from an ongoing conflict with a neighbor. Reveling in his Mead Hall, Hrothgar and his people are attacked by Grendel (Crispin Glover) a rather pathetic, yet powerful creature who's ears prove sensitive to sounds of merriment. Hrothgar sends word that he needs a hero to defeat Grendel, and Beowulf (Ray Winstone), a warrior in search of glory, answers the call for help.<br/><br/>He fights Grendel and eventually finds himself face-to-face with the creature's mother (Angelina Jolie), where he makes a deal with her that proves to be his undoing later in life. The film's final act finds Beowulf, now the King of Hrothgar's lands, fighting a dragon that is praying on the populace.<br/><br/>Beowulf, is, first and foremost, a film that is designed to be looked at admiringly. Zemeckis had previously worked with the performance-capture animation technology for his 2004 Christmas epic The Polar Express, which was an equally impressive visual achievement, but Beowulf is definitely the superior on this front. From the detailing on the character's skin to the vistas and environments that the story inhabits, Beowulf is an impressive achievement in animation. The decision to attempt to replicate reality, to some degree, does place Beowulf in the unenviable position, unlike animated features that adapt an approach that chooses to stylize their environments, of being easily compared to the ""real world"", and in that respect, it does prove difficult to not occasionally come up wanting, or sometimes cause the characters to have a plastic look to them. But the very detailed nature of what is on display overcomes this limitation and Beowulf does not disappoint in the visual category.<br/><br/>Outside of the visual splendor of the production, Beowulf exhibits traits of drama, action, comedy and tragedy in mixed degrees. The screenplay, by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, isn't afraid to have a little fun with the proceedings, featuring some cheesy, yet humorous dialogue, not to mention an extended sequence in which Beowulf strips naked to confront Grendel because Grendel will not be facing him with any weapons or clothing. This leads to scenes where Zemeckis has to choreograph the action so that Beowulf's privates, computer generated as they would be, are obscured by objects and environmental elements, such as fog. Beowulf is a film that is not afraid to play it a little loose.<br/><br/>At the same time, Beowulf slowly builds a strong emotional undercurrent that takes hold in the last third of the film, and examines the frailty of heroes, the accuracy of tales of adventure and conquest and the weaknesses of men in general. While the material is not quite as emotionally resonant as it might be with real actors, Gaiman, Avery and Zemeckis do manage to leave you thinking. Much like post-modern horror films such as Scream, Beowulf wants to not take the epic tales of heroes at face value, but also look at the reality underneath and the cracks in the armor.<br/><br/>It is difficult to judge the performances in a film such as this. The actors ""filmed"" their scenes themselves on a empty stage covered in tracking markers, so the actions are ostensibly theirs, but the images have been adjusted by the visual artists after the fact. Even so, based on what is on display, Winstone is appropriately full of vigor and bluster as the younger Beowulf, and then melancholy and reflection as the older version. Angelina Jolie displays a seductive side as Grendel's mother, and Crispin Glover manages to realize a Grendel that is much more pitiable than frightening.<br/><br/>Beowulf is just one more example of the encroachment of technology on film-making, as the lines between animation and live-action continue to blur. Beowulf is a stunning-looking production, and is worth seeing in a 3D venue if possible, with some substance beneath the surface, although it is not quite up to Zemeckis' other works. If you are looking for a film that stimulates the senses, Beowulf is it."
"valzguy","7","1","5","22 November 2007"," Classics Comics, but the pictures move and they're in 3D
","Neil Gaiman started out writing plots for graphic novels (the ""Sandman"" series, followed up by ""Good Omens"" and other text novels that play with occult themes). That sensibility is plastered all over the screen -- not a shot that wouldn't fit on an EC comic book page (including the ones in which Anglina Jolie's character is on screen). Great Literature it's not -- you won't hear the rhythms of the original saga nor will you hear sparkling dialog, and you won't see depth of characterization. But you will see feats of derring-do and well-directed visuals and some remarkable examples of applied compute-power (though why the artists gave Robin Penn Warren's Queen the lips of Merrill Streep is beyond me). Accept the work for what it wanted to be and enjoy."
"mjdemotts","8","1","5","21 November 2007"," Beowulf: A Lot of Butts and Guts
","The movie version of the epic ""Beowulf"" has been released, and it's actually pretty good. For those not familiar with the plot of the ancient Old English poem, it involves the exploits of the hero Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone) and his fights against the demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and a dragon. The animation in the movie is fantastic. The design of the Gothic castles and snowy backgrounds looks great. The fight scenes are very intense and well-animated, especially the climactic battle with the dragon. ""Beowulf"" uses a CGI-animation style similar to ""The Polar Express"", creating lifelike character models and emotions. However, although the main characters are lavishly designed, the characters in crowds or in the background look very dull and robotic. The film's script, co-written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, is very well-written, and adds depth to the rather two-dimensional story. The film gives explanations to Grendel and the dragon's attacks, and their origins. The movie touches on themes of identity, true heroism, weakness, and the price of immortality. It also adds humanity to the characters, showcasing Beowulf's arrogance and lust for power, the jealousy of the king's adviser Unferth, and Grendel's pitiable self-hatred, among others. This retelling of the legend differs from the source material in many ways, for the better and the worse. Quite a few changes have been made to the plot. Deviations from the original work include some of the dialogue, the portrayal of King Hrothgar as a drunken party animal, the amount of time that takes place before Beowulf's battle with the dragon and the relationship between Beowulf and Grendel's mother. Though these differences may bother some purists, the changes to the plot really help add to the story, sort of like ""The Lord of Rings"" movies. Overall, the film is a great adaptation of the tale of Beowulf. With a great cast, excellent animation, very cool fight scenes, and a few well-made changes to the plot, this action-packed adventure is not to be missed. A quick word of warning: ""Beowulf"" should not be rated PG-13. It barely manages to keep within this rating because it is animated, but it should be rated R for the gratuitous blood, gore, violence, and nudity. Many scenes, especially ones involving Grendel, are pretty gross, so be warned if you're squeamish."
"superduperspit","7","1","5","21 November 2007"," Beowulf is a good fantasy film, although not memorable
","It is unsurprising that the the most impressive feature of the Beowulf are the visuals. Ushering in 3-D technology to the masses, Beowulf's entire marketing campaign has been based off the 3-D gimmick and Robert Zemeckis' motion-capture technology. However despite relying on its gimmick, Beowulf is a solid fantasy film that knows where it stands and knows what to give to its audience.<br/><br/>Zemeckis is confident enough in his motion-capture technology that he ""films"" Beowulf much like he would any other. The characters are shot with specific ideas to greater effect, such as with Grendel's mother. Her full appearance isn't revealed until halfway through the film, and up to that point we only get reflections of her skin in the water and shots of her ""hands"" as she cradles her son. Although the revelation of her appearance has been long spoiled in the ads, it is an effective use of suspense over what the creature may be. Zemeckis even goes far enough in the film to include nearly unnoticeable touches like silent facial expressions and reactions on his characters. Like real acting, faces in a good film can tell the story without saying words. As a result many of the conversations and scenes between characters feel as real as a live-action film.<br/><br/>One of those performances is Ray Winstone's, who provides a very steady leading man as Beowulf himself. An interesting aspect of the film is how it plays with the idea of a hero. It begins with Winstone as the most clich√© of great warriors, a man with many speeches and war stories. Over time as he becomes an old man however, all of his glory is stripped away. While the entire world sees him as that great hero, he himself knows now he is not. The film does its best to turn the folklore hero notion inside out. Beowulf's arc is also at times is surprisingly tender, something I didn't expect in such a blockbuster. It's also straight out of Shakespeare or folk myths, though that's not surprising considering the source poem dates back to 11th century Old English.<br/><br/>The most fun character in the film is Grendel. Creepy, disgusting, and insane, he's a killing machine and provides a jolt from the beginning. Grendel's first scene is as frightening and shocking as any moment in the horror genre this year. Grendel's mother(all right, played by Angelina Jolie) is also a strong villain as an equal and probable superior to the great Beowulf. It's clear the biggest portion of the budget went into Jolie's transformation, but it is a success as her signature look is properly captured.<br/><br/>Beowulf is not perfect, some of heroic feats come off a bit silly and and occasionally the dialog is hammy. Robin Wright-Penn as the Queen also doesn't add much to the film, it seems like Zemeckis was considering a feminist statement with the way her character is poorly treated early on, but he doesn't go anywhere with it. Finally, although Zemeckis' visuals are overall extremely impressive, the setting and background sights of the kingdom leave something to be desired. I wished the film spent a little more time outside the drinking hall.<br/><br/>What Beowulf succeeds most in doing, is entertaining the audience. The storyline is fast-paced and engaging, and the battle scenes are pure fun. I can't ask for more. But don't ask me to remember this film in a couple years."
"ElijahCSkuggs","8","1","5","21 November 2007"," Poor Grendel
","Robert Zemeckis has done a respectable job with his version of the oldest tale in literature, BEOWULF, the legendary story of one man who would rid kingdoms all over of the most heinous and foreboding evil. I truly wish however that his telling would have remained accurate, and not been produced as a Hollywood spectacle. But with all that aside, BEOWULF was no slouch.<br/><br/>The story is simple: a giant monster attacks King Hrothgar's hall, killing nearly all his men, and Beowulf and his rugged brutes come to his aid. One or two subplots are noticeable, but they really don't matter since the story never firmly holds true to its source. There are huge monsters and huge cleavage abound, and truly this is what makes Beowulf memorable, though the needless cleavage and sexually driven female characters take away from the film's stoic nature.<br/><br/>If I was to see this film again, it would be for a couple reasons, and no, not to see Angelina Jolie covered in gold again(which was pretty nice to look at), but rather for the incredible finale with a towering golden dragon, one of the best in the history of cinema, and the stirring, incredible and emotional performance of Crispin Glover as Grendel.<br/><br/>Grendel's pain and inability to live in a world that wouldn't see him otherwise was the best attribute of the film, and I found myself stricken as the poor beast was brutally cast down. The voice Glover lends is filled with so much realism and heart, that the anti-hero that Grendel soon becomes is hopelessly taken away far too early. Aside from the dragon, Robert Zemeckis hit Grendel's pitiable nature perfectly.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis has done a lot for voice/motion actors, and Glover has successfully carried the torch. I can only wonder how such inspired acting can go unnoticed by the film community.<br/><br/>BEOWULF as a film is very entertaining with some immense action, but as far as gore and nudity, there are hardly any. Some bare butts, some pus and blood, a good amount of brutality, Jolie could be nude, but are breasts truly breasts without nipples? <br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing for the action and Glover's fine performance."
"LimeyGeezer","8","1","5","21 November 2007"," Awesome - simply breathtaking
","Saw this at the London IMAX on Monday and although I had heard good things from various websites about this film I hadn't expected to be quite so impressed - and moved - by the story and visuals Robert Zemeckis spent so much time and effort bringing to the big screen. Aided by screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary he has taken a story that, on paper, could appear thin and one dimensional and crafted a tale of excitement, pathos and beauty while offering real insight into what it takes to be a hero and the price to pay for being human. The character of Beowulf is shown as a young man being arrogant and boastful ¬ñ already assured of his status as a hero. He even criticises Christianity for replacing real heroes with 'weeping martyrs'. It takes an older, wiser Beowulf to realise that to truly take his place among the immortals he will have to sacrifice everything ¬ñ in some cases giving up the very things he took from others along the way. The characters of Grendal and his Mother have also been revised so that rather than being the purely evil monstrous forms of the poem they are now a necessary part of the world they inhabit and only allowed to flourish due to the failings and weaknesses of men. Grendal's Mother may give birth to demons but in doing so she also creates heroes! If you can get to see this film in IMAX/3D format I would thoroughly recommend it ¬ñ not only do you get a great film but you will also get the chance to see the technical achievement of today's 3D technology which, when applied to Beowulf's sweeping vistas and intense action sequences, serve to draw you in and really make you feel part of the action. The CGI, by the way, is top notch."

Be sure to buy a big bag of popcorn, if you like popcorn cause of the slower scenes till the movie really kicks in, then you better put the popcorn aside or you might be so into the movie like I was and choke on a kennel. Thankful for the soda. Go see it, it's worth the money."

","This movie is worth seeing if you're curious of what 3d animation can give these days.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the camera angles and shots are amazing, and the characters are almost photo realist. Actually, I'd say they are, the only glitch in the photorealism of this movie comes when the different elements are integrated together (environment, characters, particles). But it's way better than what you can usually see in todays short motion animated movies.<br/><br/>The story itself is a legend, so it's got the structure that you'd expect from a legend. A monster, a hero, both fight and then we move on.<br/><br/>Interesting part is that they threw a little bit of subtle humor, so this movie doesn't pretend to be too serious, yet it preserves the mood usually seen in the dark ages movies.<br/><br/>If you have the opportunity to see it in 3D, give it a try, the close shots on the characters face are worth it ;)"

","All in all this movie could have been an epic like lord of the rings or 300, but the movie makers had to make it entirely CG. The voice acting was very good the accents were a little off but that is nothing to be all upset about. Now my complaint of it being CG out of the way (which if it wasn't for that this movie would have been rated R)that does not make this a bad movie. The CG is beautiful and in some close ups look like you are looking at a movie with real people( Mainly in the cave with Anglina Jolie). Now the action,the few action scenes there are(Culminating with the epic Dragon fight) are very intense, a favorite of mine is the first time you see Grendal. Lastly I again want to warn you not to take little kids to this movie for certain scenes namely the naked fight,a completely nude Angelina Jolie, and a boatload of gore."

","This should have been a great movie, a movie on a par with Ray Harryhausen's ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately it was a costly endeavor that only succeeded in proving that an all-CGI movie intended to look like reality can't be produced yet.<br/><br/>-- Or maybe the people who made ""Beowulf"" just didn't have what it takes. Tough to say.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie (in addition to several lesser problems) is that it isn't realistic enough to convince the audience that it is not CGI, and it isn't stylized enough to make the audience glad it isn't just plain old reality.<br/><br/>Add to this the fact that the story is often dull (and it's never really great) and you've got a disappointing movie.

"TOMNEL","6","1","8","16 November 2007"," Great animation, good characters, and a dull, predictable plot.
","""Beowulf"" is not at all what the trailers portray it to be. They make it look like a nonstop action scene. Where there are a lot of action scenes, and they all are done very well, this movie is actually quite slow moving, and has very little plot for the long time it fills.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Beowulf"" is an amazingly simple one. A creature kills many men during a party, and the king needs a hero, so here comes Beowulf. Beowulf slays the beast, but can he kill an oddly seductive animated Angelina Jolie, or will he give into his primal instincts....not a hard one to figure out. I'm not going to go too deep into the plot, simply because I don't want to spoil anything.<br/><br/>The movie is split into two separate times, one a bit earlier than the other. The first half of the film was really enjoyable. I liked the characters I was being introduced to, the action was fun to watch, if not just to show off how much money they spent to make it look this good. The dialog was mildly amusing too. The second half was boring and predictable and led the movie nowhere. Where in the commercials it looks like this movie has nonstop action in many sets...it doesn't. The movie is mostly localized inside the King's mead hall, where much of the action and all of the drinking takes place. It was good that it took place in one area almost the entire movie because it gave the audience an intimate feel with the area, but it also never let us see what beautiful 3D CGI world that could have been created. The animation was lush and detailed, but that didn't make up for lack of story.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" could have been a grand and heroic tale, but instead was merely interesting animation, well choreographed action scenes, and a whole lot of nothing.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 106 mins. PG-13 for animated nudity and violence."
"ThomasTheScot","9","1","8","16 November 2007"," Great film, but the graphics are not for everyone.
","Beowulf is something akin to 300, but with CGI graphics and less constant violence and more plot. The entire plot is simple to understand, this legendary hero arrives and helps the Danish king against demons in his land. What you see is what you get. The film does have some problems but these depend on what you feel about the CGI.<br/><br/>The obvious thing some might think is that the film simply looks like Shrek without a colourful cast and some fighting. It can seem like this as times but there are some points in the movie where it looks pretty convincing, and others where it could be straight out of a video game. If you like CGI, you'll have a ball, if you don't, you should probably give it a miss unless you feel you can get past it.<br/><br/>If the graphics aren't a problem, what you will find is an action filled, sorrowful and at times, humorous film. It's not just about Beowulf saving the day and getting his face on a cereal box, important characters can die and drastic events happen. The violence in it is nowhere near 300 however, as there are not many moments with large scale battles going on, and even then it's more about arrows rather than gore. There are a couple of scenes involving dismemberment, but don't expect a pool of blood and death.<br/><br/>The other more mature factor of the film is obviously the nudity. Beowulf strips off for an entire fight scene against a demon but anything you don't need to see is covered up by random objects, which can either be a relief or simply like a cartoon which you can't take seriously. The other is Jolie but there's nothing much to see except the figure. It's fine for a kid to see as long as they don't start bursting out laughing when Beowulf is naked.<br/><br/>There are a some negative points however. Aside from the CGI which some may not like, the film takes place on a relatively small area. The movie is on a 30-40 year time line and for all this you see the same sets, being the town, countryside and Grendel's cave, with some scenes of the beach. Don't hope for an epic quest like Lord of the Rings. It isn't that much of a problem but you can be very bored when you see the same tavern and cave the entire time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Beowulf is a good movie for those who enjoy it's setting and effects. If you like the CGI, and are interested in either fantasy, history or mythology, Beowulf is an enjoyable outing with some niggles. If you don't like any of these, it's best to steer clear of it. Great film, but limited on who'll enjoy it."

The battles are breathtaking. I saw in digital 3D and I bet that if I hadn't, my vote would have been lower. The story itself you probably have read. It's basically a three part poem and that's basically what the movie is as well. The performances here were fine for this story. My only beef is that they obviously had to add their own dialogue and ideas to make this into a film, I just kinda wished they delved more into his story. He is an awesome character, there is just so much skipped that I wish I knew more about the man. Anyway, see this in 3D with some friends and you should have a great time."
"steeped","6","1","9","18 November 2007"," Senceless and absolutely pointless!
","I go to movies to see masterpieces - stunning and eye catching artwork. This is exactly the approach the director Robert Zemeckis tried to use, but he failed miserably at it.<br/><br/>We all love the movie 300 because every other shot was beautifully done. All the violent fight scenes were stunning to watch - every other camera angle was a piece of art. Now Beowulf on the other hand had senseless and disturbing fight scenes. The first scene consisted of an 8-9 foot monster who randomly, for no apparent reason started killing drunk towns people in a pub. There was one part where this monster ripped a body in half with his own two hands. I was hoping to enjoy this film, but instead I was not having fun. Why would you have fun when your watching senseless and pointless violent action scenes? In 300, you see heads falling off, but it's enjoyable to watch it because of the amazing style. Every kill in 300 was beautiful, and every kill in Beowulf was just sad.<br/><br/>I also find it important to point out that Beowulf, the main character is naked half the movie. He fights that 9 foot monster in the first scene with absolutely nothing on. Talk about awkward. Then there was Angelina Jolie who was absolutely nude the entire film. She said in an interview that she was so nude that she refused to let her husband Brad Pitt and her children to ever see this movie - although every other man will be rushing to see this movie just because of her.<br/><br/>The 3D Motion animation was a good idea for this film. The precision of the characters was amazing due to the electronic pegs places on the actors faces and limbs to get the movement and look accurate, along with special lights to get the perfect shape. The three main reasons they created the movie this way was so it would be easy to integrate the characters with the CGI monsters and background, (I think they learned from the Hulk movie where they used real characters and a fake CGI Hulk. Man was that unrealistic!) They also did it this because Angelina Jolie was pregnant during the production, and having her nude the whole movie with a massive stomach ruins the mood. The final reason for why they used this Motion Animation method was because of the MPAA ratings. If this was with real people, this movie would be rated NC-17... instead with it being all CGI, it was give a 14A. Allowing a larger audience to preview the film mean more money.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good. Anthony Hopkins was very good, along with the guy who played as Beowulf. Every other word Beowulf said was in a really cool yelling voice. ""I...AM...BEOWULF!!"" ""I...WANT...CHICKEN SOUP!!!"" Anyways, if you were to see a movie, go rent out 300, or if you already saw 300, go watch it again. Save yourself the money."

","I saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And had very mixed feelings about it.<br/><br/>The story, and the script undergirding the story, is to me the best part of the movie. The execution of the script was to me partly good, partly not so good.<br/><br/>I think it's the animation that most disappointed me. Maybe my expectations were staked too high based on pre-release buzz. But I'm really just mystified at those who rate the animation nearly perfect. Human faces and human bodies looked like comic book animation to me, except in those sequences in which either darkness or distance, or both, managed to obscure things enough to achieve a vivid genuineness that did indeed give me great pleasure.<br/><br/>Outside views of the Northern Danish snowy fastnesses were uniformly delightful, IMHO. My very favorite sequence was that with the dragon at the end of the movie. What a wonderful sequence. And the end of the movie was true Northern/Norse-mythic in content and execution: I loved it.<br/><br/>Acting was minimal but adequate for character depictions in a broad, sweeping mythic movie like this.<br/><br/>All in all, though, the story ... the amazing mythic story of Beowulf ... carries this movie and gives it what is to me a deeply satisfying telling of a tale that deserves to be told again and again and again.<br/><br/>Now if I can just get to see it in IMAX ..."

","I felt that Beowulf was a decent movie. The movie was depicted in a different way than the book is written in certain ways.

Grendel himself also looked a lot different than I imagined, and I think when I say that I can speak for a lot of people.
I also would rate this movie a little lower bc of the animation, which made the movie seem more like a video game.
Aside from the cons, I felt that overall many aspects of the book were included in the movie and the movie was not too much different. For example, most of the characters from the book were included in the movie and the basic plot of the book was the same as in the movie"
"TheMovieDiorama","5","0","2","9 September 2018"," Beowulf ferociously attacks with brave animation to disguise an uninteresting story.
","After 'The Polar Express', Zemeckis returns to the innovative world of photorealism. This time substituting a friendly Santa Claus, snow and a train with a ghastly Grendel, blood and an enraged dragon. Death, fornication and plenty of testosterone cannot masquerade a blatantly dull narrative that is as tasty as Grendel's rotting flesh (hint: not tasty at all). A small kingdom is tormented by a monstrous creature and his mother, where the king has no choice but to ask the legendary Beowulf to slay them. In terms of technical competence, Zemeckis is among the best. From point of view camera shots gliding through decomposing trees to glorious tundra landscapes, his varying directing techniques encapsulate both the cold dark nature of the mythological world he is creating and the bravery of its population. Once you get passed the jagged animation, that has aged incredibly poorly (seriously 'Shrek 2' had better human animation), the visuals absorb you into Zemeckis' creation. Therein lies the problem. The focus on the narrative's visualisation has become a detriment to the story, characters and pacing. The lack of attention to the plot has produced one-dimensional characters that are ultimately unlikeable. Even the titular protagonist had limited personality, despite Winstone famously bellowing ""I am Beowulfffff!!"". The story itself is forgettable and includes infrequent memorable scenes, such as Grendel's mother slowly seducing Beowulf. The dreadful pacing did not help either, with the entire second act dissipating minutes after it concludes. It picks up during the third act with an almighty dragon battle, however it is too late. Those who have fallen asleep shan't be waking up for its predictable conclusion. Overall, a weak entry in Zemeckis' illustrious filmography. Undeniably littered with technical astuteness, but lacking in other critical areas that amalgamate to create a boring yet watchable fantasy flick."

"ksj870","4","0","1","29 May 2014"," Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time
","The first problem this film has is that it simply isn't BEOWULF. It may be inspired by the classic saga of a Nordic warrior and his battles with diabolical monsters (Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a particularly wicked dragon), but it certainly isn't a faithful adaptation of that seminal poem. The script makes huge alterations in both the plot and characters, resulting in a story that has only vague similarities to its source. Grendel isn't a very formidable monster in this film, and his mother, as essayed by Angelina Jolie's CGI avatar, is transformed from a loathsome goblin to a devilish seductress. As for the CGI animation, I've seen both better and worse. The dragon comes across very well in animated form, and is actually one of the most fearsome looking fire- breathers the movies have given us, but the humans all look quite fake and even rather silly. Beowulf isn't the man he is in the original saga, either, where he is portrayed as an honorable and even God-fearing warrior of Good. In this film, he is not merely flawed, but duplicitous, and certainly no Christian (for whom he has little respect). Unfortunately, the film as a whole shows a similar disdain for the poem upon which it is based. Better film adaptations are the also unconventional but basically honorable efforts of BEOWULF AND GRENDEL starring Gerard Butler and THE 13TH WARRIOR featuring Antonio Banderas. As for this film, it is an unreserved failure, save perhaps as a parody of the great work from which it is spawned."

","This version is the one with Angelina Jolie, in which all the characters are sort of cartoonized, for lack of a better word. The word they actually use is ""made with CGI."" As far as I am concerned, it should be ""made to look ridiculous.""<br/><br/>Other than my observation that Jolie looks fabulous because instead of the stick figure that she has become, they gave her some curves, my main take-away from the movie is that they severely damaged the story. <br/><br/>The whole point of Beowulf is that he is a larger-than-life hero who achieves greatness both with the gifts he has been given by Nature and because of his determination. Yet, in this movie, the first sign of the ridiculous is that he removes his armor and elects to fight Grendel while completely naked. Okay, if they had simply had him face Grendel without armor or a weapon, I would have accepted the alteration of the story line because it would signify he wants to test himself. But naked? It seems that they just want to show the Queen being shocked or tempted by his nudity and tantalize the comparatively few women who enjoy seeing naked men.<br/><br/>Next, and the biggest flaw, is this: In the original tale or poem, Grendel's mother is described by words whose translation is uncertain. She might be a sea hag, or a lake witch, or a nebulous undescribed evil thing or monster, depending on which translation theory you buy. But regardless of her form, it is clear that Beowulf slays her. Then, at the end of his life, his final battle is with a dragon. BUT, in this move, two things occur: First, and this is not such a bad idea, the dragon at the end is tied to Grendel's mother. There might have been several ways of making that connection, but they chose the worst, which leads to my second point: Instead of defeating and battling Grendel's mother, Beowulf is enticed and seduced by her such that he makes a bargain that insures he will become king and gives her a son to replace the one he slew. The dragon turns out to be that son. <br/><br/>As I said, the link between Grendel, Beowulf and the dragon is not a bad idea. They could even have had Beowulf somehow seduced by Grendel's mother, had her give birth to the dragon, and still had Beowulf find himself again and kill her. But instead, Beowulf is portrayed as a guilt-ridden sell-out who lives the rest of his life enjoying but regretting the excesses which his bargain has enabled him to enjoy. <br/><br/>So, instead of merely being a flawed hero, Beowulf turns out to be a deceitful sinner whose sins are comprised by abusing the bedroom privileges of being King and lying to his people about the ""death"" of Grendel's mother. He also has lied to his best friend, who would have done anything for him, about it. <br/><br/>The ending, as to what is in store for his best-friend-become king, is ambiguous but intriguing."

","It feels like some kind of sacrilege to give a negative review of something written by Neil Gaiman, but in my defense, it's not the script that lets this movie down. The story is classic mythology, and if it has stood up for a thousand years it'll stand up today as well - but the visuals. Oh my God, the visuals. I remember this was marketed as revolutionary when it came, and I'm sure it was, but now it just looks like a video game, and not a good one either. I keep getting taken out of the story by the weird way people move, or the Shreck-like faces. The studio probably wanted to make something both cheap and fresh, but today, not even ten years later, it's ridiculously dated, and a live-action movie would have been a much better idea."

","An adaptation of an epic tale has gone epically wrong. First of all there is no story. There are just random events thrown in one after another with no development. There are no characters. There are just random people which never get any depth. The interactions between the... people involved (as I said they can't be called characters) are almost nonexistent. Needless to say that without these elements any film would be a disaster. If that wasn't enough there is more. The dialogues absolutely lack original thought and are only meant to describe what the hell is going on. Many episodes look like they were thrown in just to kill some time, some of them look disgusting just for the sake of being disgusting, and almost all look like they were written by a twelve year old. The action scenes are just... childish, I have no idea how a grown-up can be entertained by that. Overall there are 30 seconds ads that have more meaning and entertainment value than this whole film. You have been warned."

","How the hell is a rock wall on fire? Apparently in the world of Beowulf rocks can burn.I had a great deal of problems with this movie. Several things made absolutely no sense and the story was drastically different from the book. The animation was a little weird as well. The people looked almost real but also completely animated. The textures of the people didn't seem right, everybody had shiny skin.

","Anyone remember reading 'Beowulf' in high school? That was a long time ago for me but I'm pretty sure this film was nothing like it. It took me only a little while to figure out that this was a CGI generated picture, I didn't know that going in. Too many times the human characters actually looked real, but at others, like ones from those better animated computer games. Which tells me that the technology is geometrically developing to the point where someday we'll be watching deceased actors and other entertainers performing once again through the wonders of this type of animation.<br/><br/>There's some pretty grotesque stuff here, not for little kids. A sword to the eyeball comes to mind, along with Beowulf ripping the heart out of a dragon. At times the picture approximated a horror film instead of action/adventure, and Grendel could have been one of those monsters in a house by the lake if you know what I mean. For me it was a little weary.<br/><br/>But the animation is magnificent, if not overdone most of the time. It's also probably why I didn't recognize Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich as the characters they were supposed to be, but Angelina Jolie I did. This probably appeals to the younger movie going crowd who live much more rapidly than my generation ever did. What I might do is go pick up a copy of Beowulf and see how it reads today."

","Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a good start to how realistic computer animation, and then director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump) gave us The Polar Express, using the ""performance capture"" technique, and Zemeckis followed with this. Basically, set in Denmark, 507 A.D., during the coming of Christianity, where the realm King Hrothgar (Sir Anthony Hopkins) lives in fear from the torment and attack from monstrously large troll Grendel (Crispin Glover). The King is offering a reward to whoever can kill the creature, and so arrives boastful and confident great warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone), and he awaits the beast to defeat him and claim the glory he longs for. Beowulf manages to fatally wound Grendel after discovering his weakness, the creature shrinks and eventually dies in the lair of his mother, and the warrior is welcomed into the kingdom with open arms. Next the warrior must face Grendel's supposedly fearsome Mother (Angelina Jolie), however he sees that she is gorgeous and she manages to seduce him, and Hrothgar realises this, being seduced himself, and after saying that he should become king when he dies, the ruler commits suicide. This instantly makes Beowulf king, meaning that he will sit beside queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn), and he is looked on closely by royal adviser Unferth (John Malkovich), but there are more challenges ahead. Next thing the kingdom faces is a dangerous large fire breathing dragon, but Beowulf of course manages to defeat this threat as well, and there are a few other things going on, before the end that sees Grendel's Mother trying to seduce him again, and it is unclear as to whether he gives into this or not. Also starring Brendan Gleeson as Wiglaf and Alison Lohman as Ursula. Winstone, Jolie, Hopkins and the other stars all give good voice and captured performances, the story is reasonably interesting being set in the 6th Century, but of course it is the animation that really keeps you watching, it is such high quality, especially how realistic Jolie looks, I was also surprised by the quality of it during violent and sexy scenes, and also that it is not a 15 certificate but a 12A, overall it is most watchable animated fantasy adventure.

","With motion capture all the rage in Hollywood these days ‚Äì blame Gollum ‚Äì director Robert Zemeckis and his cronies have been keen to adapt the CGI technology for their own needs. BEOWULF follows hot on the heels of the same director's POLAR EXPRESS and a new adaptation of the age-old Anglo-Saxon poem about a hero battling a terrible monster.<br/><br/>As a keen follower of the literary Beowulf, I was eager to find out how the story had been adapted from the original. The good news is that this is the complete version, including flashbacks to Beowulf's swimming challenge and the climax with the dragon. The bad news is that the stuff with the dragon has been linked to the earlier Grendel story via a whole new subplot. Clearly a consequence of the desire to tie up loose ends in favour of neater storytelling, but I didn't think it was required.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Neil Gaiman's script is above average in paying homage to the original. As for the mo-cap, I'm not so impressed. For me, this film looks like a cartoon, albeit an expensive, 3D-style cartoon. The look of flesh and hair is spot on, but the eyes are dead and soulless, which means even the hardest-working voice actors struggle to breathe life into their on-screen creations.<br/><br/>Zemeckis isn't a favourite director of mine. His emphasis is always on the superficial, and this film follows a straightforward action-adventure template by providing plenty of spectacle and not a lot of depth. Although it misses out the bit with the dragon, I found the Gerard Butler starrer, BEOWULF & GRENDEL, to be a much more atmospheric and engaging adaptation of the heroic poem."
"Tweekums","7","0","1","5 December 2010"," A modern version of an ancient tale
","Although Beowulf is one of the oldest stories I'd never seen an attempt to film it before. The story seemed basic enough: monster called Grendel attacks a country, a hero slays the monster and becomes its mother's enemy then slays her. It turned out there was more to the film version than that though; for a start who is Grendel's father and is the hero Beowulf telling the whole truth about his monster slaying exploits? <br/><br/>This film version of the story was fairly exciting and the CGI used seemed far more real than that used in many films I've seen even when it involved fantastic creatures. It was nice to see such a flawed hero as the star; I was expecting Beowulf to be the sort of hero that defeated his foes and told the truth but it was clear that he was prone to exaggeration from the start and was never modest about his claimed feats. Early on it looked as if Unferth was going to be an antagonist who would more than likely betray the hero but as it turned out this character merely exposed Beowulf's lies which was a nice twist that avoided the usual clich√©s. The actors did a good job although because of the use of motion capture CGI not all of them look like themselves which was a little disconcerting at first especially as other characters look very like their actors.<br/><br/>While purists may be upset with the changes to the story people looking for an action adventure should have little to complain about. While it is full of action there is little gore and no offensive language so it is suitable for younger teens as well as adults."

","The 3D glasses and a group of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture enthusiast really made me enjoy the movie. The arrows were flinging, the coins were showering, the branches poked my face and while other people laughed only at the weak sex-related jokes we laughed at every change of the original story and every cheesy bit of dialog, so in fact all the time.<br/><br/>To make it clear to all of you who are not that much into history of literature: Beowulf was most probably written by an Anglo-Saxon poet-monk in England about the pagan heroes from somewhere about today's Denmark/Sweden. I imagine he just loved the simple legend about a fight of good vs. evil so he adapted it and skilfully imputed that it was the good God who help the good-willing pagans to fight the evil monsters even though they didn't know Him. It was written in a beautiful style and was appreciated by numerous generations.<br/><br/>Contemporary world, however, seems not to be a place for heroes anymore. People go through moral and psychological struggles, the monsters that we fear are not outside, they are in us. However, making the characters the monsters' fathers in the most literal sense is a bit of overdoing in showing this.<br/><br/>For the creators of the movie the ideas of good and evil were not attractive at all. It looks as if they tried really hard to make a point against Christianity even though it didn't fit the historical settings at all.<br/><br/>Putting an actual date at the beginning made a funny pseudo-historical introduction. The Dark Ages are dark, but then you have late medieval strongholds and renaissance music. Pretty indeed, but pure nonsense, just like Angelina's Old English. She pronounced it perfectly, so did Gollum, er, Grendel, but it's most illogical! Everyone speaks modern English and the monsters apparently Old English. I would guess that the characters spoke Norse and West Germanic dialects and monsters didn't speak at all, because they were monsters, not golden Lara Croft with stiletto shoes and her bastard son. Only our poet-monk spoke Old English, but if the whole movie was in Old English with subs it would have been awesome.<br/><br/>The movie rather looked and sounded pleasant and the 3D was entertaining. The humans were a bit doll-like and there were a lot of idiotic ways to ""cover"" their private parts. The panoramas were beautiful, though mountains and stone walls don't do justice to the original swamps and woodwork of the times and place given.<br/><br/>Apart from lack of consistency in recreating the settings and atmosphere of the Dark Ages it is mainly the change of the whole story and turning the back on the very idea of a hero that makes me so critical about this movie. We really need to hear a legend about a good hero who kills an evil monster from time to time to have the strength to deal with our inner struggles. The creators of the movie wanted to outsmart it and made something hysterically funny instead.<br/><br/>I give as much as 4/10 since 2 is for a movie that I managed to watch at all, +1 for pretty visuals and 3D effects, +1 for hilarious anachronisms and Angelina :)"
"johnnyboyz","5","0","1","14 April 2010"," Dull and stupid when it isn't just unnecessarily disgusting, Beowulf is a puerile and aimless film without an audience nor much of a brain.
","I think amidst the corny script; odd looking human-being/CGI animated character processing and daft action sequences, the makers of Beowulf had most fun rendering and toying with Angelina Jolie's semi-naked body as she slithers out of a pool of water in some cave half way through the film. They had more fun rendering it and patching stuff over what I presume to have been a green-screen suited Jolie than I did watching it ‚Äì like Halle Berry's weaving; swaying; slinking; decked up like a fetishists wet-dream Catwoman from a 2004 film of the same name, the most remarkable thing about the whole sequence is the sense of just not caring what it is that's being presented to you on screen, despite the promise on paper of something slightly eye-catching. Such is the reaction to the text, or indeed the particular bringing to life of the text, that the people making it had a better time in making and messing around with it than we did watching it.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis can often be a curious director, his blending of content fit for both grown-ups and kids alike have seen him take on an array of past projects; ranging from the typically noir-infused shenanigans of 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit? which blended this with the persistent inclusion of cartoon characters; to the romp that was 1985's Back to the Future, yes, a somewhat child orientated time travel romp about a high-schooler, but one that saw a younger edition of the lead's mother fall in love with him: a premise, I read, deemed too risqu√© by Disney at the time whom promptly rejected the project. This, as well as 1994's Forrest Gump; a film that shoots along at a merry old pace under a grandeur of sweet natured comedy but taking time to encompass some pretty adult orientated material ‚Äì most of us saw said film when we were younger, but how many of us really understood or knew what was going on during Jenny's sequences of downward spiralling through drug addiction and all things nasty? But I like these three examples, and Zemeckis' direction in his ability to mould all these things together worked.<br/><br/>Then comes 2007's Beowulf, a film too adult most of the time for younger viewers in its scares; humour; imagery and sexual innuendo but just too adolescent at others for adults in its stupefying action sequences; bodily function orientated humour and general sense of childishness. Unlike past attempts at this hybridising, Zemeckis falls well short and by the time the credits ran, I just felt embarrassed for all involved. Based on a centuries old poem-come-story, but penned by way of Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary, the film covers the exploits of Ray Winstone's Viking warrior Beowulf in the 6th Century, as a sort of one time mercenary whose skills are recognised enough so as to pass on into royalty. In Denmark, a drinking hall full of individuals led by Hrothgar (Hopkins) sing and display characteristics of lust, gluttony and greed as food is devoured; riches casually distributed and women rendered prizes as they're leered over. Enter twelve foot or so man/demon Grendel (Glover), who promptly massacres all involved before retiring to the cavern in which the aforementioned Jolie, his mother, resides. This raises the question as to whether his mother appears in front of him in the same form as she does to Winstone later on. If so, it's no wonder the kid's got issues.<br/><br/>In true pantomime fashion, ""We need a hero!"" is the cry. Cut to man of the hour and title Beowulf, standing nonchalantly on a boat in a terrible storm; those around him struggling to deal with the conditions; but Beowulf merely cackles at the wind and rain, establishing in a very basic manner a sense of masculinity and fearlessness. ""I've come to kill yor' monsta'"" so says Beowulf upon arrival, and the ensuing fight with Grendel is a would-be interesting sequence that brings you right out of the picture by persistently reminding you of the Austin Powers censoring sequence as naked individuals waltz around in a film that doesn't allow nudity. As the film rolls on, it wants to think that it has a fascinating and tense pot-boiler up its sleeve involving Beowulf and Grendel's mother after a meeting and agreement between the two, but the resulting suspense born out of this item that's gone on for years is about as enthralling as watching a CGI axe meekly splash down into a shallow puddle on a gravelly beach. Where the film ought to be tense and unnerving, it merely carries an uncanniness born out of observing these semi-CGI Vikings mope around in next to nothing on.<br/><br/>Throughout, since I'm nowhere near interested in what's going on, I wondered if other people in other nations around the world existed, and if they did, I wondered if they have too had any issues with monsters and beasties terrorising them. But in essentially aiming the film at a younger based audience, Neanderthal attitudes towards women and the general behaviour of most of the characters are made to look 'funny', as this filtering through crisp animation is played out in what is a rather disgusting; ill-advised and irresponsible display of film-making on Zemeckis' behalf. Shame, as intense and adult dramas such as Cast Away are not beyond the reach of the man; in the meantime I guess we'll have to settle for bizarre amalgamations designed to make money and con people into thinking they're seeing something more interesting than what it is by way of special effects and three dimensions."

","""If you shoot a dinosaur in the brain on Monday, its tail is still waggling on Friday. Cinema is brain dead."" - Peter Greenaway <br/><br/>Long before James Cameron's supposedly ""revolutionary"" virtual performances in ""Avatar"", Robert Zemeckis was motion capturing his heart out in a series of exorbitantly expensive 3D films.<br/><br/>His first attempt was ""The Polar Express"", a film with wonderful ambiance and gorgeous art design, 200 years of Christmas iconography distilled and spat back out as a kind of super-concentrated, high gloss, Norman Rockwell simulation.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is a blast, Zemeckis' virtual camera dancing along all angles, whizzing between small spaces, looping back and forth. Combine this with some moody lighting effects and you have a pretty gorgeous animated movie. Unfortunately the film's second half reveals Zemeckis' message, and we suddenly realise just how insidious ""The Polar Express"" really is. An ode to materialism, greed and irrational belief, we can no longer forgive the film's ethnic stereotypes and creepy facial animations.<br/><br/>Dubious messages were rectified with Zemeckis' ""Beowulf"", though the uncanny facial expressions still remained. Packed with fine tuned action scenes and zany camera work, ""Beowulf"" is a fun action movie with enough sleaze and gore to compete with most male-oriented action blockbusters. The film's tale of temptation, greed, revenge and corrupted bloodlines, works well in a Shakespearean way, but mostly the film is a celebration of hyper-aesthetics and virtual camera work.<br/><br/>Zemeckis followed ""Beowulf"" with ""A Christmas Carol"", a story so well known that one sees little point in watching his CGI sculpted remake. With the story so familiar as to be pointless, one instead savours the film's Victorian architecture, Zemeckis' enclaves of light and shadow, his free-floating camera and dizzying choreography. It's fun in bursts, but why not just re-watch Bill Murray's ""Groundhog Day"", a superior re-imagining of Dickens' classic? <br/><br/>Ultimately these three films, and later ""Avatar"", herald the onslaught of a new kind of hyper-cinema that looks set to be our future. The virtual cameras of tomorrow ‚Äì no longer bound by the laws of physics - render everyone from Hitchcock to Welles to De Palma obsolete (whilst paradoxically negating the spectacle of camera movement), whilst the ability to render super-mediated environments means that audiences will increasingly find ""real lighting"" and ""real spaces"" to be thoroughly banal. But the real future of all this is not film, but video games. Already cinema audiences have begun to cluster around the 30-60 age range, younger audiences increasingly dying out. Kid's are turning to interactive media, and increasingly theatre advertising is drifting away from promoting films and onto promoting X-box and PS3 titles.<br/><br/>What the likes of Lucas and Spielberg created was not ""film as amusement park"", but rather ""video game as cinema"". Cinema, unable to offer immersive experiences in a world overrun with mediated experiences, a world where thousands of youtube videos are uploaded every second, in which every film can be torrented at the click of the button, in which massive multi-player games can be played instantly through the television, in which an abundance of images has left images virtually affectless, has no choice but to regress further into a kind of super inflated parody of itself.<br/><br/>7.9/10 ‚Äì ""Beowolf"" <br/><br/>6/10 ‚Äì ""The Polar Express"" <br/><br/>7/10 ‚Äì ""A Christmas Carol"" <br/><br/>""The Polar Express"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" are the weakest films here, one better off hunting down the Charlie Brown Christmas TV specials. ""Beowolf"", despite being ripped to shreds by critics, is a pretty good action movie, with some real emotion behind those creepily rendered faces. Incidentally, Zemeckis' motion capture production house (ImageMovers Digital) was shut down due to the poor box-office performances of these three films, studios embracing instead the performance capture technology of Cameron's ""Avatar""."

","I watched the Director's Cut version of this; I understand that the only real difference is in this not being censored. Nothing else is added or removed. I did not see this in 3D; I can imagine that portions of this are more impressive that way, but it also seemed to get excessive at points. That's the main problem with these things; those making them get carried away, forgetting that CGI is a tool(like numerous others available to film-makers), and show off the technology, and far too many reward them with ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"", neglecting to take into account if they remember how it was on the whole, afterwards. The camera flies and does tricks like a well-trained pet, and a good deal of them are superfluous to this. With that said, this does set and maintain moods, and it certainly is visually impressive. The eyes are dead, as has been pointed out. This has gorgeous ""sets"", art and design. It feels like a realistic depiction of the Vikings(*no horns* on their helmets, that was made up by Christians to demonize those not of the ""right faith""), with plenty of crudeness and raunchy details(and yet it doesn't come off as hostile towards them... well, not only that). This uses old English words and phrases some, and even a little of what is apparently the actual language spoken at the time. Yes, the accents are pretty atrocious. I don't really know the legend, so I can't say how close this stays to it. This is a fun ride, and it makes sense to animate it, since it is an adventure(as opposed to A Christmas Carol, a story that was never ""epic"" or fast-paced). It is action-packed, and the fights are awesome. There is a bit of ego-stroking, which is logical enough for a myth taking place in that period and environment. That explains the eye-candy for both genders, as well(Jolie is *hawt*, whether it's literally ""real"" or not). The cinematography and editing are excellent. This has marvelous music and songs, too. It's engaging and thrilling, and doesn't overstay its welcome(certainly not by much). Dialog is well-written and well-delivered. All in all, I'd say at least a single viewing, if it appeals to you. There is a lot brutal, bloody and gory violence, occasional sexuality, infrequent moderate swearing and a little nudity in this. The 2-Disc DC DVD holds six featurettes(that I will review on their individual pages here on the site) and 11 and a half minutes of reasonable additional scenes(note: all in pre-vis state, not completed), and comes with a comic.

","I rented a DVD of this movie without knowing anything of the story told. Overall, I have found this movie full of good surprises although the plot turns a bit disappointing in its second half.<br/><br/>The fact that the whole movie is presented in CGI suites perfectly well to the telling of a legend as it contributes in providing a unity to this imaginary world. The look, facial expressions and movements of monsters stand on equal terms with those of human characters, and monsters thus appear fully integrated in human settlements and not just as pieces of CGI ""added to the reel after shooting"". Likewise, human characters stand on equal terms with monsters in being integral components of the fantasy world. To my opinion, this is one of the strengths of comic books (and more generally books) over cinema, and Beowulf transfers this advantage to cinema by its wise use of CGI. <br/><br/>During its first half, the story is very interesting and attractive because, although the hero is brave and physically strong, he is also flawed and, most importantly, can be bought. The plot gradually provides some evidence that a strong motivation for the main character to kill monsters and demons is getting fame (and what comes with, i.e. money and women). But because this is a Hollywood movie (and also because I knew nothing of the legend before watching this movie), I was not expecting that such flaw would lead the ""hero"" to loose the most important confrontation of his life with a demon. Yet, where one would expect a both physically and mentally fierce fight between two strong opponents, one can only watch the main character being tamed and seduced by a demon in a few minutes. <br/><br/>To this moment, I was really enjoying the movie and thought that the plot was quite original. However the second half of the movie became, again to my opinion, lazy. We are told that, thanks to his pact with the previously cited demon, Beowulf has now become (thirty to forty years after the pact) a famous and rich king who can easily fill his bed with young ladies. However, sooner or later, he must pay the price for all these earthly pleasures. The bill comes under the form of his son that Beowulf sired with the demon, and therefore that has developed the bad habit of terrorizing and slaughtering human beings. To protect his wife and his mistress (and secondarily his people), Beowulf has no choice but killing his son. This second part of the movie is quite straightforward and mostly devoted to action. Very little is shown of the evolution of Beowulf personality, which makes this character looks quite insensitive and unresponsive to what happens in his life. <br/><br/>Independently of what the original legend describes, the plot would have better kept my attention had it (a) explored the evolution of Beowulf personality following his pact with the demon, the slow deterioration of his relationship with his wife and his feelings toward his son, and (b) developed a bit Beowulf son's history and feelings toward is father (after all, although it was sired by a demon, part of him is human)."

Unfortunately there is no God of War movie. But Beowulf is closest thing we have.<br/><br/>Beowulf is an old medieval poem about a Northern hero, Beowulf, who came to help the people get rid of menacing monsters. And that is pretty much the story here. Grendel (Crispin Glover), a demon with sensible ears, turns a grand feast into a blood bath. King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is in luck: a man who calls himself Beowulf (Ray Winstone) and his men arrive, claiming that they can defeat the demon. After a hard-earned success, Beowulf has to face an even greater challenge: Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), while his influence and power grows.<br/><br/>The plot has little to no subplots, is linear and very solid. That's not the problem of the movie. The problem is that it doesn't manage to impress. Yes, it's based on a legend, but that doesn't mean it could rival the Lord of the Rings. Certain elements are keeping Beowulf away from the 5 star milestone.<br/><br/>First of all, the voice acting and acting are great, the actors are well-known, no complaints. BUT there still are two actors who stick out like a sore thumb - Malkovich and Jolie. John Malkovich plays Unferth, a Rasputin-like counselor of the king, who is at first sceptic about Beowulf. He's so stiff, I don't know where to begin... Then there's Jolie, but here it's not about acting, but about choice. She just isn't right as Grendel's mother, I couldn't buy it. I was like "" Lara Croft is confronting Beowulf?"". There are tons of actresses who could have had the role. By the way, since when do medieval demons wear modern-day shoes? <br/><br/>But the most obvious oddity is the full CG. Everything is CG, from actors to landscapes, and honestly, it looks incredibly well - photo-realistic, superb effects, fabulous animation. But you still know that it's artificial. They went to such lengths to animate and create everything, when they could have just used the REAL actors and just made it live-action. Okay, this isn't a flaw, it's the director's style and whether you like it or not - it depends on taste.<br/><br/>The movie is full of gore, nudity, epic music, great acting and marvellous effects.

I understand that everything takes a lot of money so it's all good. But like, why all of this nudity? I love blood and gore, so that was a great little treat, but all the nudity was, a little unnecessary. We all know Angelina Jolie's beautiful. :P Anyway, I have to say, the voice acting was pretty good. However, I found that there were a few minor flaws. When Beowulf spoke. It seemed like he had his mouth full or something. Now no, I could understand him. Err, here, let me give you an example.<br/><br/>""That monster.....is.............no match.........for.........me"" Like, gosh, could you make your dialogue go any slower? Stop it with the pausing! The way he, and amongst other characters in the film, delivered dialogue like that was a huge bomb on my rating. Which is what brought the rating down :(. Also what was a big bummer for me was the fact that the movie just....ended. Like, come on. I understand that not all movies usually end with the hero killing the bad guy. But seriously, I honestly wished there was a huge fight between Angelina and... whatever his name was... ha-ha. Sorry, I am bad with names. But yeah, I would have loved a final fight.<br/><br/>But I sort of understand WHY they ended it there I suppose. People are greedy, and therefore they do whatever they can to get it.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough of my rambling. It was nice, don't know if I'd see it again if I had the chance. :/ It wasn't too spectacular.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I am a big fan of the epic film genre, but from the start this one just didn't get me into it.<br/><br/>First for the life of me I cannot understand why every film has to completely change the plot of these epic poems/stories that have been around for ages. I do not care how some writer interprets the story, I want to know the story of Beowulf the way that it is written. The story is a compelling one of one of the greatest warriors that the world has ever seen, why change it? Adding details here and there to bring the actual man to life rather than just the hero are understandable, but the story is completely changed from the three actual fights that Beowulf had into one long battle in this rendition.<br/><br/>Next the CGI or whatever they used to actually make the movie just didn't work for me. I have played numerous video games that actually have better looking and more realistic characters than this. Now I realize that realism may not be the look that they were going for, but to me this turned out more like Shrek than the epic that it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Although I complained about the change of the storyline, I can live with it if it works. But for me the plot just sort of jumps all over the place. Everything is flowing quite nicely and then suddenly it is way in the future and then five minutes later the plot jumps out of control again with another major plot point that is not explained and not shown. The film just never really finds its pace and it is too jumpy for me.<br/><br/>Other than the flaws above, the voice acting is pretty good. One thing I like is that they are not constantly trying to hit a home run with every line that is delivered like some other films in the genre (300). I can't say that I particularly liked any of the characters, and that is probably because none of them are developed in any way shape of form. Unferth for instance, suddenly out of nowhere changes his stance on Beowulf without the audience really seeing why this happens.<br/><br/>To me the story of Beowulf deserves a great film, and this just did not do the story justice, not by a long shot."

","I'm so tired of filmmakers not trusting themselves. Beowulf at times is shooting for an honest swords and sorcery epic about a troubled hero, but at other times seems to apologize for the audacity of making a fantasy film. For every moment of awesome battle and refreshing character moment, there's a shoehorned in moment to destroy the characters we've just started to like for no other reason then because it's hip nowadays to believe all mankind is scum. Ridiculous squalor and gratuitous sexuality creeps in to ruin the fun also, as well as a incredibly confusing rant about Christianity. I'm not sure it's fair to call the utter empowerment of Grendel's mother a feminism message, but it seems like that's what they're going for at time, and that too bewildered me. Oh, and they ruined the original story too. It felt like I couldn't enjoy this film without abandoning all faith in humanity and enjoying one self destruction after another. I was left wondering, who was Beowulf, the movie and the character. It seemed to be snatching at something for it to be about, and ultimately failed. There are other inconsistencies. Why do the vikings sometimes speak Danish, sometimes English? Why does Grendel's mother have high heels? Why does everybody doubt Beowulf's story about sea monsters, when they're being attacked by a real demon, and their king slew a dragon? Why can Beowulf see things in his dreams? Why is Grendel different from the dragon? Watch it on mute, and enjoy the only thing it offers...incredible visuals. Sadly, all it comes down is just a blustering tale with nothing inside it."

The filmmakers did well limiting the serious aspects of the movie and turning Beowulf into a character half-hero/half pompous braggart, who doesn't know where the line is drawn himself. CGI is the typical '300' thing, with a lot of Harryhausen moments, but thoroughly enjoyable. Even Beowulf looks more like a CGI video game character than a human being, but it's alright. A couple A+ actors ( definitely this is NOT some B production ) who aren't bad but make little to no difference and good overboard acting by Beowulf. Take it like your next super-CGI cartoon movie.

","It seems to me that movies that tell ancient stories are in general taking on a more modern approach to telling them. Some may think that may devalue the original story, however it's up to us to decide how much such stories are changed before they are written down in the first place. My point being that stories are changed through out the ages to better fit the societies they are told in. To appreciate the story in its ""original"" form or should I say, the form it was originally written in, you should no doubt read it and get a glimpse of the kind of myth that compelled people of that time and place.<br/><br/>I always try to view stories like this for their metaphorical meaning and the value of what's being told. In this version of the story the hero has to battle with and finally overcome what I would call his own demons in order to ""be set free."" The end I believe is a symbolic representation of the temptation that looms in the background of all our lives. This is why this movie stands out for me. It is a classic representation of the trials and tribulations that we all have to face. Even if it does not follow the original, it is still a good story."

","This is by no means a classic, but it was a very entertaining piece of cinema. About 4 years ago I was given a copy of the poem, I'm not big on books but I did find it more interesting than doing nothing in my cheap motel room. Last year I saw Beowulf and Grendel (2005) and was not disappointed but slightly annoyed at how it didn't feel like the people were Vikings. With that said Stellan Skarsgard was brilliant in it.<br/><br/>This movie I enjoyed more. The characters seemed more like I had imagined when I read the book even though the story was different. I can break it down into 3 reasons why I liked this film.<br/><br/>1. Ray Winstone is one of my favourite actors and he gave Beowulf's voice real power. By that I mean Beowulf sounded tough.<br/><br/>2. The characters were slightly more like Vikings, everyone wanted to be a hero, lots of boasting and the lust of women was there.<br/><br/>3. The story is epic and compared to Beowulf and Grendel this is a real epic.<br/><br/>In the end I would only buy this film when it was on special, but if you like historical action films, know the story or are interested in getting to know the story then you should rent it."

","Note: the version that I saw was the Director's Cut, not the theatrical cut, and it was not in 3D.<br/><br/>Finally there's an epic that stays true to the roots. While told in a linear fashion like most epics, director Robert Zemekis has decided not to Hollywoodize the structure. Instead he leaves the story just as it is, and by doing so he gives his version of ""Beowulf"" a slightly unique feel. Instead of an adaptation, ""Beowulf feels like it was directly lifted from the page.<br/><br/>King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has a problem. His kingdom is being terrorized by a hideous monster called Grendel (Crispin Glover). So he sends word out to any hero who will be willing to kill the monster. Beowulf (Ray Winstone) answers the call.<br/><br/>I have not read the epic poem, but the movie doesn't feel like a movie adaptation, it feels like a movie come to life, which is interesting, since this movie is completely CGI. If you don't understand what I am talking about, watch Hollywood's previous endeavors of putting epic poems to film (say ""Lord of the Rings""). When done well, the Hollywoodization can work (""Lord of the Rings"" again). But if you pay attention closely, the trilogy and ""Beowulf"" FEEL different.<br/><br/>The acting is solid. The actors know that this is not the place to showpiece their thespian skills, but all of them do what they are required. The most interesting performances are Angelina Jolie as Grendel's Mother, who is as creepy and mysterious as she is beautiful (she still looks strikingly similar to her human form), and Anthony Hopkins, who is helped by the animation to move much more freely than he probably can in real life.<br/><br/>Now the big kahuna that is on everyone's mind: the animation. It's great. While it's brilliant in some places, it's less so in others. The detail is amazing, but some of the faces don't look realistic (especially Wealthow, the queen). In actuality, it looks very similar to the ""Shrek"" movies, only a lot more detail is apparent, and it's less cartoonish.<br/><br/>The success of this is hopeful. Maybe in the near future, animation won't be limited to family friendly movies, because as proved by Zemekis, animation provides a lot more freedom, and there are plenty of things for audiences over the age of 12 that only animation can provide."

","Spectacular animated action scenes turn the ancient epic poem Beowulf into a modern fantasy movie, while motion-capture technology transforms plump actor Ray Winstone (Sexy Beast) into a burly Nordic warrior. When a Danish kingdom is threatened by the monster Grendel (voiced and physicality by Crispin Glover, River's Edge), Beowulf--lured by the promise of heroic glory--comes to rescue them. He succeeds, but falls prey to the seductive power of Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie... and as Jolie's pneumatically animated form rises from an underground lagoon with demon-claw high heels, it becomes clear that we're leaving the original epic far, far behind. Regrettably, the motion-capture process has made only modest improvements since The Polar Express; while the characters' eyes no longer look so flat and zombie-like, their faces remain inexpressive and movements are still wooden. As a result, the most effective sequences feature wildly animated battles and the most vivid character is Grendel, whose grotesqueness ends up making him far more sympathetic than any of the mannequin-like human beings. The meant-to-be-titillating images of a naked Jolie resemble an inflatable doll more than a living, breathing woman (or succubus, as the case may be). But the fights--particularly Grendel's initial assault on the celebration hut--pop with lushly animated gore and violence.

","I was absolutely sickened to my stomach after just seeing the first few minutes of the unrated film during the Grendel sequence. It's strange because I was able to sit through 300 with all the dismemberment's and only feel entertained, but for some reason the whole thing with the torn up dude screaming that bloodcurdling scream while tearing other people to shreds just made me feel ill. Of course maybe it didn't help that I was listening to an ICP greatest hits CD while this was on. Some of you are probably thinking why was I listening to a CD while I was watching a movie and to tell you the truth I wasn't expecting too much out of this film. It was my dad's idea to buy it. I took one look at the cover and thought to myself ""... oh great, another sword and monsters, CGI obsessed fantasy movie to keep the nerds occupied."" Man was I in for a jolt. This movie is not for children... especial children. Honestly I was afraid of getting nightmares and I'm 17. The footage is intense the first time I saw it. Let me give some examples; in the first Grendel scene the Grendel rips a dude in half throws one half away then slurps up the blood a guts in the upper torso then throws it down and the dead body looks like a deflated balloon, in the second Grendel fight scene he slowly bites a dudes head off then starts munching it, in the last minutes of the fight scene between Beowulf and the golden dragon Beowulf partially slices off part of his left arm to better reach the dragon's heart and you can see it barely hanging on by a thread. (That scene was just ill.) At least the film makers took this project seriously and just might have succeeded in making a classic. There are some unique and memorable scenes like when Beowulf beats the Grendel to death naked. Sometimes I wish I could beat a terrifying monster to death without wearing any clothes. The special effects are actually quite realistic despite the fact that it's all CGI. In the dragon fight you can actually see the liveliness of the dragon by the way the dragon's wings glisten in the sun. When the dragon set someone on fire it would look so haunting as if someone actually was being burned alive and in here lies the seriousness of this movie. It gets a lot of criticism because of changes it made in contrast to the poem. But the characters are so cool at play it off it becomes forgivable on some level."
"setanta-","Null","0","1","22 May 2008"," Amateurish, rotoscoping fiasco . . . A missed opportunity
","""Beowulf"" is a mildly interesting retelling of the classic story that is rendered virtually unwatchable by the CGI motion capture technique used to ""film"" the actors. The result looks like second-rate animation or third-rate photography. It's actually quite shocking to me that the movie was released in the state that it was. I don't know how any artist with even a semester of an art-school drawing class under his or her belt would be satisfied with that work. It looks like a second draft pre-visualisation for what the film might look like when completed. Whatever their budget and time-line was they obviously needed to double it.<br/><br/>I suppose what it most resembles is a poorly drawn version of ""Shrek"". But quite frankly that is insulting to ""Shrek"", because the makers of that film would never put their stamp on characters with such vacant expressions, lack of detail, childish shading, and wooden movement. However there is still a visual similarity between the human ""extras"" in Shrek that are painted with less precision and the characters in Beowulf. This makes for a creepy experience when you see them in sexually suggestive scenes or using coarse language. It's like a pervert's transformation of a child's film.<br/><br/>Two questions popped into my head when watching the movie. The first question which occurred about five minutes in was, ""Can I actually sit through two hours of this crap?"" Well, I was able to answer that question with a begrudging, ""Yes"". The second question was, ""Why on Earth did they choose this technique?"" That I cannot answer.<br/><br/>The fact is that if they had chosen either pure animation or live action filming, the result would have been incalculably better. John Malkovich is a great actor, but I found myself staring at the face of his character at one point trying to get some clue about his motives, but it was a completely blank slate. It was like watching a mannequin. What a waste of a fine cast. Watching the DVDs extras you get to see Anthony Hopkins in costume or the beautiful Robin Wright Penn on the set and it hammers home the point, ""Why?"" Why, did they throw away those potentially magical performances for this dreck? <br/><br/>I could go on for pages but due to the space constraints I suppose I need to capture the essence of my objections and it is this: I felt absolutely no emotional connection to any character or event in this film. This is quite rare for me, as I'm an easy sell. So as a piece of art it was a complete failure. It is a quirky oddity that may one day be remembered as the most ambitious example of an abandoned technique. Let us hope so."

This is a huge step forward for CGI-animated movies, as its ambitious scale helps the depth of this vision come through, there aren't any look-at-me-compositions here, only subtle choreography. The intimacy of the story is largely confined to three locations, and the plot revolves around terror-from-the-mountains, but all eyes are on Beowulf, as supposed to. And director Robert Zemeckis allows the third act of the movie to grow, giving it a true heart and soul, as we see Beowulf as the King of the Land he once came to save from monster Grendel's merciless attacks. Now, he ain't the man he was, he's filled with poignancy as he realizes what it really takes to be a true hero. BEOWULF is entertaining throughout, and it's off course candy for the eyes - still, at times its rather po-faced and too much for its own good. Apart from that, this is a rousing experience."

","Motion capture movie making is of course still in its very early stages. It shows some potentials for the future of film-making but it's not really good enough at this moment to make a great and convincing movie with. Still the most convincing computer animated movie was ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" and that movie proved to be so costly that the studio went bankrupt soon after the movie its release. Who knows, maybe in 10 years from now it will be perfected and people will be able to make this type of movies faster and cheaper and above all also better. I'm actually looking forward to the day they start making movies with the likenesses of already deceased actors, complete with voice impersonating techniques. Wishful futuristic thinking or the future of film-making? Who knows, time will tell, although I'm sure that there always be need and demand for actors and 'normal' film-making, so all those crew and actors wont ever have to go back to school to learn a different profession.<br/><br/>""Beowulf"" is already a big step up from Robert Zemeckis his previous motion capture movie attempt ""The Polar Express"" but still it also suffers from the same problems. It still remains hard to bring the right emotions to the screen on the character's faces and their skins look way too smooth and perfect to consider the look a full 100% realistic. And overall the movie really makes you think at times why did they have to make this movie completely computer animated? Couldn't they had done basically just as good with live action movie making techniques with live real actors in front of the camera? <br/><br/>Overall the look of the movie is good but at times it still feels as if you're watching a cut scene of a Playstation game. Especially during some of the action sequences. Of course the beauty of computer animated movies is that you can go just as far and over-the-top with its action as you want to, since there are no limitations to its possibilities. Notmally I'm not a big fan off silly over-the-top action in animated movies but in this case it didn't bothered me since it seemed to suit the story and the character of Beowulf right.<br/><br/>It also makes this movie more or less look like a 'children's' movie, which ""Beowulf"" definitely is not. While it looks seem to be made for the younger ones, the story is definitely one for adults. And also the movie features quite an amount of graphic violence. <br/><br/>But of course a movie is not all about its looks. The story of Beowulf seems like a pretty entertaining and strong story on its own. However this movie gives you the feeling that it isn't giving you halve of its story. At times the movie makes to big leaps into time, which makes you wonder what happened in between. It was as if they ran out of time or money or both halve way through the production of the movie, which forced them to cut a large portion of its story. It therefor isn't the most coherent movie to watch but this only becomes more of a problem in its last part. The most part of the movie and its story does entertain but it also knows to build some more depth and brings some layers into the story, that focuses on the nature of mankind. It doesn't all work out and not as effective as it could had but the right intentions for it are definitely there.<br/><br/>Some of the possibilities of motion capture movie making already shows in the look of its characters. Ray Winstone is a far from muscular or heroic looking actor but thanks to the wonders of technique he looks like the perfect super human with amazing strength. On the other hand some actors look the same way as they do in real life, such as Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Brendan Gleeson and Angelina Jolie, which again in a different way also shows the possibilities of computer animated movies.<br/><br/>Still I hope that Robert Zemeckis will also return to 'normal' film-making again. His last 'normal' movie ""Cast Away"" already dates back from 2000. Don't forget that this is the guy that once brought us the Back to the Future-trilogy, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Contact"" and the earlier mentioned ""Cast Away"", among many other great movies. We need some more movies like that Robert! He already however is working on another motion capture movie at the moment, ""A Christmas Carol"", based of course on the famous Charles Dickens novel.<br/><br/>Nevertheless ""Beowulf"" remains a perfectly watchable, entertaining movie, for in between to watch.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","At first viewing this film looks like Shrek without the humour. Tendentious, predictable and overly sonorous in its soundtrack, Beowulf fulfills the light end of the various interpretations of the original Old English poem. Zemeckis comments that he disliked the poem at school and this certainly comes through in his treatment of the material.<br/><br/>Beowulf is a complex poem and one that could lend itself easily to film. It has, after all, been an absorbing and entertaining oral performance for over a thousand years. Yet various recent treatments follow on from Jackson's heroic version of Tolkien's classic and fail to get past the adventure/monster epic appeal. <br/><br/>Firstly, Grendel is not a troll or a Neanderthal. He is a dark and magical cannibal, a descendant of Cain, an outcast and every Anglo-Saxon's worst fear. Outside the warmth of the hall everything is a nightmare. Nature, weather; everything is ruled by a the inexirable course of wyrd...an Anglo-Saxon word badly translated as fate.<br/><br/>Zemeckis and his script writers fall back on pat interpretations. Making Grendel sympathetic is like trying to make Richard III tragic. A sure formula for cheap pathos rather than imaginative character development. In the poem, when Beowulf and Grendel wrestle in the hall, they become almost indistinguishable from each other. They represent not just light and dark or good and evil, but the uncertain striving of ambitions and male sexuality. Theirs is a very uncomfortable enmity because their oppositions begin to resemble each other in the violence of their actions. <br/><br/>Beowulf the character is heroic because he seeks to create the heroic in a flawed society. Which is not the same as being a flawed hero. As a poem, Beowulf, like other great poems and narratives, still waits for a treatment that responds to and recgnises the deeper subtlety of its characters and plot rather than handing over its translation to a pair of uninformed scrptwriters."

In some moments, I believed some things were real while in others, I thought it was complete crappy animation so that kind of took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>Fifth, I've seen so many other movies before this that uses the same action scenes used in this film, like 300 and Alexander. In the end, I thought the film was decent for what it was. I've never read the play or was familiar with anything from Beowulf, but as an outsider, I guess it would be okay to kill 117 minutes..."

","I was not familiar with the story of Beowulf before I saw this movie, so I really have no qualms about what was changed in the story (since the tale itself had undergone through many changes though the centuries anyway).<br/><br/>The main problem here was really the animation. It distracted me from the movie, and that's the last thing you want as a film-maker experimenting with FX. Like so many, I felt like I was watching a really long cut scene from a Playstation 2 RPG instead of a movie. Actually, ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children""'s animation is a LOT better and that came out first.<br/><br/>I get the idea, this is an experiment in motion-capture and CG effects, but it did not do this movie any favors. However, once you give up and accept the movie as it is, it's a lot of fun. It's not for little kids though, as there's a lot of violence, but it's all so unrealistic and exaggerated that you don't really care.<br/><br/>And at times, this is a bizarre film. Sometimes the characters speak in Old English, in others with Scottish accents, and in a very funny scene (but completely out of place), the vikings sing songs using modern (and offensive) slang. So this movie is clearly not for purists.<br/><br/>The one great thing that this movie had was the music. Alan Silvestri did a great job here, and the soundtrack is worth buying. From the opening theme to the Queen's lovely harp chanting, the music is awesome and worthy of an epic. Unfortunately this is not the case with the rest of Beowulf. It's a fun action-fantasy story and an enjoyable experience, but instantly forgettable."

This usually works, but as with Polar Express the facial expressions of the humans look more like a snazzy video game than anything approaching realistic.<br/><br/>Most Americans learned about the tale of Beowulf in high school, about how the young hero slayed the creature Grendel and became a legend. Here, Beowulf's tale is expanded and clarified; what really happened when he strode into that cave to take on the murderous demon? Turns out that Grendel's got a mom, and she's not the forgive-and-forget kind, and before you know it, Beowulf's sliding down a slippery slope of his own device.<br/><br/>Voiced by Ray Winstone, the youthful Beowulf and his band of warriors arrive in Denmark to slay the beast that's been terrorizing the towns. King Hrothgar (Anthony Perkins) has offered half the riches of his kingdom to whomever can lift their curse. Grendel does come, and after slaying some of Beowulf's men (including biting off a head and chewing it), he's finally taken down by Beowulf himself with his bare arms - but that's just the beginning of Beowulf's troubles, as Grendel's mom is a bit unhappy.<br/><br/>The voice characterizations are top notch. It's good to see the gifted Winstone get some work as the hero, because he doesn't really fit the mold of matin√É¬©e idol; he's more of a craggy, rough-looking character. But here, he's as smooth as Russell Crowe, thanks to the wonders of CGI. Hopkins is his usual Anthony Hopkins self (sorry, I mean Sir Anthony), lending gravitas that a king should have. Jolie, it should be noted, was a bit unhappy with the resulting CGI for her role, which showed perhaps a bit more skin than the actress had intended to have shown. (Sure, it's not actually her body, but it looks like her, so...) But she's silkily cruel as the water demon out to avenge her son. Offering stout support as always are Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich, as Beowulf's right-hand man and the king's top commander, respectively. Robin Wright Penn is merely okay in a rather important role as the queen; amazingly, she doesn't look nearly as gorgeous as the real-life Wright Penn does.<br/><br/>But it's the CGI of the humans that I found a little off putting. Rather than looking seamless in a pseudo-comic-book style, as in 300, the people here look a bit creepy, as if they were originally created to appear in some cheesy 3-D porn. I mean some cheesy Flash animation. As with the earliest Pixar films, the animation of humans just doesn't look right; with The Polar Express (directed by Robert Zemeckis, as was Beowulf), the people looked almost creepy and lacked a large range of expressions.<br/><br/>Beowulf is an exciting action movie and contains plenty of intense, well-animated combat scenes, but it falls a little short of being the technical marvel or full-bore sweeping epic that it wants to be."

","A well rendered computer generated fantasy inspired by the epic anglo-saxon poem Beowulf, from which it derives its title. Pedants will argue over the deviations from the classical text but, frankly, I couldn't care less.<br/><br/>The voice acting is generally very good, although it takes a little while to get past some of the accent choices, and it's easy to become immersed in the film and become less conspicuously aware that your watching CGI.<br/><br/>It's not a film without its share of minor frustrations either. Robin Wright Penn's portrayal of a jaded, world-weary queen did not translate well to her computer generated character on screen, which seemed annoyingly bland and wooden among an otherwise very charismatic cast.<br/><br/>Overall, a very enjoyable movie that is worth watching.<br/><br/>Note: Although most computer generated PG-rated movies are child-friendly, note that this is PG-13.

Angelina's accent was pretty weird, as was many of the other actors.. Considering where they were supposed to be, I would have expected more consistency between them.<br/><br/>Some people have said there is lots of nudity, this is not the case, most of it is implied nudity as you don't ever see anything.

","This is my very first review but of course not my first movie. I've seen it in 3D and it looks great that way. That said a movie is not becoming better when more effects are thrown in. This counts for the beginning which is a little dull. Sure, the movie needs intro and you will be drawn into the story once the monster arrives but the beginning is more to enjoy the first effects of the 3D glasses. 3D adds to the movie but in my view 3D has not to be the future of movie watching. Story and the way it is presented should be the main factor at all times. So when the monster arrives the movie begins and it's entertaining to the very end. I like computer generated movies and Beowulf is crafted very well. Motion Capture is an excellent method but the only thing I did not like were the stiff mouths of the woman characters. They were talking as if they had a visit to the dentist. The sympathy you will get for Beowulf will be mixed. He is not a flawless hero and he is quite full of himself but I like these kind of hero's as they stand above the average hero characters in other movies. This plays a main aspect when his weakness appears when confronting the mother of the monster. I think I would be weak too at the point when ultimate beauty seduces you! It's a mature movie and the sexual oriented scenes are not overdone. Beowulf has a body that wants you to stay away from Mac Donalds the next time and Angelina is the ultimate perfection of woman shape. Also if you want to see Anthony Hopkins bum then here is your chance. I don't believe the real actors would go that far but it is all done with taste. The last scenes are spectacular but the movie does not end with full closure. All in all the movie is good and entertaining!"

","Mixed feelings, see it in Imax and 3d if you must, the experience of watching a 3d movie kinda wanes after the first 30 minutes or so but picks up again the last 20. I thought the re-telling actually wasn't that bad, it a lot of funnier and more emotionally involving the poem, and it managed to include ideas surrounding the original text as well, the layover of Christianity onto the pagan society whether Beawolf is a story of Jesus, or Revelations or a pagan pseudo-history of a warrior king, in any event it's a boring myth, become one of the better ""fantasy"" films of recent memory, though visually it still looks pretty stiff, and I don't see this style as the future of film making, as it didn't really work in Final Fantasy or the Polar Express and it don't work here. Animation might do better to imitate our animated and unphotographable mind, as opposed to our literal world which is captured quite accurately by camera."

","The only reason I am not making it close to 9 or 10 is because film makers can never make a perfect film version of literature. However, I enjoyed watching Beowulf. Yes, there are different elements that Neil and Avery threw in or sorta switched around to bring other dramatic substances into play. My only big problem was that the lead female role (not Grendel's mother) seemed life less in some scenes. Also the ending should have just stopped with Grendel's mother going down with Beowulf.<br/><br/>I guess one could call this a comic book version to be honest with you. That's what I interpreted it as. I thought it was fun to watch, and I wish my local theater supplied the 3D version. But to read people claiming it was awful and one of the worst films made this year,...you are full of yourselves! I take it you did not think that maybe the newest addition to the SAW franchise would be more deserving to be in that category. Oh, maybe another date movie should be considered better since it does not take long to make those types. Honestly people, there IS unique quality within Beowulf.<br/><br/>I am glad they made the challenge of making it in full CGI. Having a live action film version would make non fantasy. I applaud the film makers for accepting this challenge and creating a well deserved version of the epic poem.<br/><br/>...and yes, I have read the poem many times and I have found this very enjoyable to view."

"mike-3313","6","0","1","3 December 2007"," My Review on the Movie
","The movie ""Beowulf"" is based off an old English poem which is also known as ""Beowulf."" So which is superior? That's up for you to decide. The movie is full of action and medieval humor.<br/><br/>But this review will consist of my opinion and my feelings on the movie. I have read the story of Beowulf a few times, and when I first saw the trailer for the movie, I was a little disappointed when I saw then Grendle's Mother took the shape of a human, let alone a seductive one. When I entered the theater, I was hoping that would be the only thing different from the story. Alas, I was wrong. The movie is almost a mockery to the actual story. Granted that it was action packed, and in some places humorous but it just didn't feel the same.<br/><br/>Another thing I'd like to point out is that, like the story, this movie's target audience was guys, with the fighting, the glory, the riches and so on. However that doesn't mean it was without things that would draw in women too. There were plenty of scenes with young, fit men wearing nothing but a headband (The sex organ was always blocked by fog or a cleverly placed object). There was also a naked Angelina Joline (or at least a digital version of her) for the guys.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I request that nobody should mistake me for somebody who approves of sex being a way of drawing in audience. Because I don't approve of it as it is demeaning and a clear sign of bad writing.<br/><br/>So I'm going to wrap it up here and give my final opinions. If you're a person who loves ancient literature and are hoping to see the story of Beowulf acted out on screen, you may be disappointed. If you wish to see this movie so you don't have to read the story for a book report or whatever, this movie will lead you to a failing grade. But if you're looking for an action packed movie, with a good story, this movie may be right for you. While I was disappointed in how the movie was so different from the actual story, I do feel the did a decent job on their version.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, I give this story a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, but that's mostly because I was looking forward to a visual version of the ancient tale of Beowulf, only to be let down."
"joestank15","6","0","2","26 November 2007"," Flat, cold take on a classic story.
","Beowulf - From the maker of Polar Express Roger Zemeckis and writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery (who I'm still sore at for sinking the Silent Hill movie), we have Beowulf, a hero archetype come to life, well sort of. Everyone is layered densely in CGI, and the film exploits the usual weaknesses and strengths of CGI. It's awesome when used to show sea monsters being slaughtered (highly reminiscent of the God of War video game, and if a movie is made of that too, this is likely the formula that will be used) in some fairly cool bloody ways, but just cannot show human emotion as well as the real thing.<br/><br/>A monster Grendal (name inspires terror doesn't it?) whose sole power is being bat-s*** hideous (not scary, just really ugly) looking and sole-weakness is slightly stupider that that of the aliens in Signs, comes to town and wreaks havoc in an apparent desire to make the story interesting. Beowulf stops him relatively easily in a pretty cool fight scene, and the rest of the time we have to listen to some mildly boring dialog and some awkward character decisions. Best line? ""There have been many a brave soldier come to taste my husband's mead."" <br/><br/>John Malkovich's character beats a cripple at least twice with a stick and repeating in a monotone that the boy is spilling mead, in a scene I'm pretty sure was meant to be comical but comes off as cruel. Why? I didn't really sympathize with anyone. It's too cold in this fantasy world. The CGI gimmick kinda worked against them there. Robin Wright Penn was pretty bland as both eye-candy and in acting. Anthony Hopkins fans should avoid this as his character is frankly embarrassing. Crispin Glover ""plays"" Grendal the same way that Hugo Weaving did a voice-over for Megatron in the Transformers movie earlier this year; completely unrecognizable through a mask of effects to the point where anyone could've played the part. The only person well cast (typecast?) was Brendan Gleeson, as Beowulf's sidekick. Oh, and Angelina Jolie, as seduction itself in as close to a nude-scene as fanboys will get now that she's got all her kids going to see her films.<br/><br/>It's got a cool bit with a dragon at the end, but what does it all really matter when I don't care about the characters? Beowulf has an interesting story and one or two decent action scenes, but is mostly forgettable. a C+"

If I take out the rich visual details, I might drop it to a ""4.5"".<br/><br/>The one thing that happens with great animation and effects is that after a while, you kind of get used to them and they fade to the background. That's what happened here. What one is left with are the characters and story.<br/><br/>I can't speak for anyone else, but I really didn't relate to any of characters. Given that the story is based on a poem, it's clear why the characters might be very limited.<br/><br/>The same is true for the story. I can see how it stems from a good tale, but the story was delivered in only a ""slightly above average"" manner.<br/><br/>The positives are all about the effects: great 3D effects, great action scenes, stunning backgrounds and fantastic facial details. The people behind this aspect of the movie did an amazing job. I also applaud the filmmakers in finally introducing some animation material that goes clearly beyond a ""G"" rated audience.<br/><br/>If you're a 3D enthusiast, you need no recommendation - see it!

","Hmmm, an exciting proposition. The director of some of the most enjoyable films of the last three decades in Zemeckis, the writer of some of the most original material in the last three decades in Gaiman, a crop of talented and award-winning actors and a source material so strong that they've been talking about it for a thousand years or so. A winning proposition? You'd think. But, overall, only Gaiman held up his end of the deal for me (neatly covering over the less than cinematic portions of the original text) as this all came together in an oddly flat and somewhat pointless exercise. I think maybe the much vaunted motion-capture performances were what turned me off, as I felt no connection or sympathy with any of the characters. Oh, it was all beautifully rendered and all of that malarkey, but I like my special effects to have a point and I'm not really sure what the point of mo-cap is. It took the heart out of this piece anyway (like tearing the heart from a fabled dragon), leaving a pretty but pointless two hours behind. Oh, quick footnote: Grendel, as portrayed by Crispin Glover, is an absolute show-stealer, and is almost worth the price of admission alone."

","I just saw Beowulf and can say that if I had not ever read or taught the poem, I would think it were great. The CG is great, and many times I forgot that I was watching characters created by a computer and not the real things. However, the movie of course does not consistently follow the poem, and the movie makes Beowulf out as a weak-minded character. Sure, the Beowulf in the poem is a boastful one, but he truly does care about his people and those he has promised to help. He would never have let a woman deter him from a race (with Brecca) or from defeating a menace to the Danes. The Beowulf in the movie is a fraud and a liar. In fact, the battle scene with Grendel even portrays Beowulf as weak. If the creators had followed the poem--and not focused on hiding Beowulf's male member--the scene would have been better. I wanted to see Beowulf use his own strength to rip off Grendle's arm! Speaking of Grendle, I cannot believe that the creators made Hrothgar Grendle's father and Beowulf the dragon's father! I also found Wiglaf to be somewhat of a weak thane, unlike the Wiglaf in the poem. One last problem with the movie is the pronunciation of the word ""Scop."" Anthony Hopkins, please pronounce it as ""Shope"" not ""Skop!"" So, what did I like? I liked the CG, the dragon battle scenes, the introduction of the Christian elements, and Unferth. I thought that John Malkovich was perfect for the role. I understand that some parts of the poem had to be ""updated,"" but I think that using most of the battle scenes from the poem would have made this movie a better one."

The actors, whom I understand were filmed in motion-capture suits and the animated give good vocal performances. The movie action scenes wouldn't have looked out of place in some live action movies.<br/><br/>So why doesn't it quite work??<br/><br/>The answer lies in it's greatest strength : the animation. The look of the film is stunning. It's one of the best-looking CGI-animated movies ever. It raises the bar for whatever follows it. HOWEVER, the animation robs the story of it's magic and heart. In trying to look great (which it does), it leave behind characters that you don't connect with. The magic of, for example Stardust (another Gaiman story), The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, Excalibur is missing.<br/><br/>As I said, the actors do their part well, even if the computer animated version of Ray Winstone as Beowulf looks more like Sean Bean, and Angelina Jolie looks sexy as hell in animation as in real life!

","Before I start, yes, I HAVE given the film a 7/10. And before I am doubtlessly lampooned by Beowulf purists, yes, I HAVE read the original source, and enjoyed it immensely. Not counting the countless potted children's versions supplied in my old primary school, I have read the translations by Seamus Heaney and Peter Dickinson, and have also read John Gardner's ""Grendel"".<br/><br/>I continuously hear the same complaints, which really come down to this film being Hollywood trash. How is Hollywood defined though? Predictable, unoriginal plots? Well, Beowulf is widely taught in both primary schools and universities, therefore the events in the story should never have been in any doubt, regardless of a film adaptation. Blank two-dimensional characters perhaps? And how would the characters of the original poem be defined (not counting John Gardner's novel)? I concede that maybe to call them two-dimensional would be an exaggeration, but so would stating that they were well fleshed out and complex characters. The film at least did manage to add some humanity to the characters, something to identify or connect with. And now for a few spoilers...<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I'm surprised at how many critics seemingly missed this, but it is repeatedly implied that the film, rather than an actual adaptation to the poem, is actually a fictitious reconstruction of how the poem came to be, implying some inevitable distortion through the embellishments of glorifying bards, generation after generation until the truth is lost. As a European, I also could greatly identify with the character's resignation to the historical fast growing cult of Christianity washing away the culture of their ancestor's, which I think is a subtle parallel to modern Europe's spread of Islam.<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I am not saying that the film is an improvement to the poem. I am simply stating that it is possible to enjoy it even if you've read and appreciated the original source."
"jaredmobarak","6","0","2","20 November 2007"," Sins of the father¬ÖBeowulf
","Let's start this out with the fact that my College Professor of World Civ had us read The Epic of Gilgamesh rather than the one adapted here with Beowulf. So, I went into the film without really knowing anything of the story besides the monster Grendel and the obligatory pride as a curse, creating your own demons, etc. As shown on screen, it is obvious that the yarn is an ancient one. Besides the archaic traditions¬óQueens are inherited as the wife of all who take the crown?¬óit just feels dated and plods along as a result. I like the whole idea of our hero being his own worst enemy, but I would have enjoyed seeing a bit more conflict. The fight with Grendel and the dragon are both magnificent to behold, it's a shame then that the true orchestrator of the chaos, stunningly played by Angelina Jolie, is ultimately lacking in depth and competition. It actually feels like how I'm sure most students do when reading the epic poem¬Ölong-winded, repetitive, and missing the nonstop action our MTV-cultured minds love.<br/><br/>If I were to compare the animation to something, I would not go to 300, as most seem to be doing. Sure the whole ""I am BEOWULF!"" thing is a direct rip-off, but the aesthetic and story is not. In my opinion, 300 blows this one out of the water, no question. To think of something similar, my mind goes to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, a great little gem from almost a decade ago. The technology has come far since then, most notably with the fluidity of character movement, detail of liquids/hair/textures, and emotive ability in those moments that succeed with it. However, as far as looks go for the humans, I have to declare Final Fantasy the winner still. The faces in Beowulf continue to keep a plastic/rubber feel, giving the impression everyone had a facelift. Besides the hair on each face, especially the noses, the pores and skin quality so lifelike years ago looks creepy here, as it did in Robert Zemeckis' Polar Express, (I don't fault Monster House because it was stylish and cartoony, not attempting to be realistic).<br/><br/>Those faults withstanding, it was a pleasure to view the film in IMAX-3D. Zemeckis utilizes the technology well, giving us moments of true depth. Whether flying through the tree branches, having a spear frozen in front of our eyes, watching bodies fall and flip towards us, and seeing blood splattered in our faces, we are thrown smack dab in the middle of the action. Water and blood are realistic and, along with fire and smoke, shown with nice field of vision, never seeming like a flat plane placed on top of the layer beneath it. The effects are so good, it might have been the best film I've seen using the gimmick. Having seen only three others, however, I'm not so sure that is too bold of a statement.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, I think most performances are a bit too over-the-top. I almost wish all the characters were devoid of any likenesses to their real-life counterparts like our lead. It is just too distracting, leading my mind to wander and think of how the cgi person differs from the actor. This is especially true with John Malkovich's Unferth. They try to make him different enough, but the face is still there and the horrible Danish accent is just too much. The only really good turns, to me, were Ray Winstone, Brendan Gleeson, and Crispin Glover. I would add Robin Wright Penn to the list, but her smooth/taut face didn't allow for any nuance to go with her voice's portrayal. Winstone, as Beowulf is the best. With very little likeness, he is allowed to create a full figure. The facial are expressions genuine and moving, especially when he realizes the pact he made with the devil and later on when he puts his life on the line for those he loves. Gleeson is a stalwart of the craft and comes across much like he would if it was really he on screen, and Glover proves to be a master of elasticity and quirky movement. No one else could have been the stand-in for Grendel.<br/><br/>Artistically, the film is stunning to behold. Everything seems to have been lifted from the story correctly. Jolie's devil is a disgusting creature only shown as beautiful through the warped minds of men¬óthe use of reflections to show this fact is great. Also, the fact that our original King's curse of an heir was his shame, manifested by a hideous creature made to hear every word spoken about him through super hearing, and Beowulf's was his vanity, displayed by an Adonis of an offspring, showed the detail that went into the artistic direction. Unfortunately, while it visually held true to the tale, it might have adhered to the source a bit too much script-wise. It is a morality tale that drives its point home too forcefully, repeating itself often, leaving the audience cold and annoyed. If you want to see this film, do yourself a favor and spend the extra cash on the IMAX-3D experience. Without the visuals to preoccupy you, the film doesn't quite deliver. Our hero says to his wife, ""Don't remember me as your King or a hero, but instead as a man, fallible and flawed."" He could have said it about the movie itself, but instead of being modest and touching for his character, it is ultimately a derogatory view for the work, something I'm sure the filmmakers hoped would be seen as glorious."

","Though familiar with the story on which the film was based, I was lost on several occasions or merely lost interest in the plot line. Use of unintelligible dialogue only served to confuse the telling of the story and the fleshing out of the characters and their motivation. The various British dialects, faked or otherwise, did not help with the Viking characters actual or mythological.The film does not compare favourably with the 2005 live action story ""Beowulf and Grendel"" filmed in Iceland. The animation/graphics were innovative but it got stale quite fast. I guess I expected more especially from a rather stellar cast like Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winston and even Angelina Jolie. Could have been better all round!!"
"susan-391","6","0","2","20 November 2007"," Don't expect the poem dressed up in CGI flesh, expect an adrenaline rush, but not much else
","This is an entertaining movie with well produced special effects. However, don't go expecting to have a reasonably accurate introduction to the poem or to satisfy your desire to dig a little deeper into you're Anglo Saxon Heritage and If your child is reading the poem as part of their school curriculum this film will confuse, not help them.<br/><br/>The narrative of the film differs greatly from the poem, changing the place and people to which key events happen. Yes the hero is called Beowulf and he's a Geat, if you know the poem, don't expect too much more than that. Most of the key themes of the poem are either turned on their head, given little reference or ignored completely. For instance, the poem carries the themes of brotherhood amongst warriors and of not turning to dark sacrifices and superstition to find relief from your troubles, but instead to Christianity and to the determination to succeed against all odds.<br/><br/>This movie in fact frequently finds opportunity to hammer home another theme, i.e. 'This new religion' Christianity being the cause of the peoples sadness and sorrows. In the Poem Beowulf was a Christian, but in the movie only the jealous, cowardly Unferth is portrayed as following this 'new' religion. Since this narrative and theme are nothing to do with the poem. I presume these changes are to suit the opinion of the film makers who created the movie.<br/><br/>That aside, if like me, you enjoy a bit of swash buckling and monster mashing, this movie delivers. However, based on the constant exposure of naked torsos and the sexual undertones of the movie and the violence, it really cannot be seen as a genuine attempt to treat the legend with respect. It is a commercial venture aimed at achieving a box office smash. Peter Jackson would have trodden more gently on the bones of the great hero and still made a movie that was manifestly better."
"tanicich","5","0","2","20 November 2007"," Not fulfilling if your a fan of the original story
","If you have ever read the famous poem written by an unknown author and are expecting this movie to follow it and give you a good visual interpretation then don't hold your breath. Although it is a unique interpretation and the visual effects are amazing yet at sometimes overly dramatic and unnecessary, Beowulf disrespects the themes of glory, pride, and loyalty that are displayed in the original poem. Some of the faults are making the father of Grendel Hrothgar, while in the story Grendel's father is not mentioned. Even more disrespectful is making Beowulf a flawed hero in his pride, lying about killing Grendel's mother when in reality in the original story, he does kill Grendel's mother and cuts the head from the dead Grendel to bring back to his people. Beowulf never becomes King of Hrothgar's kingdom or marry Wealtheow, and Wiglaf is supposed to be only have Geatish and make an appearance as Beowulf's rescuer in the end of the poem rather then follow him throughout the entire movie. Beowulf's band of warriors are supposed to be loyal and respectful instead they are lude and cowardly. i am normally a fan of Zemekis' work but this one does not pay tribute to a classical piece of literature."
"jake-179","6","0","7","19 November 2007"," The Grendel wants his neighbors to turn the music down!
","Great 3-D animation, good to see the first story ever written in the English language to graduate to such a high degree of technological incarnation. Some of the 3D computer shots actually looked like real pictures of real people. I definitely recommend the movie, and it was entertaining, but it did not follow the original story all that closely, which was a bit of a disappointment for me.<br/><br/>Also, the first half of the movie seemed a little odd to me. It really seemed to me that the Grendel was like a person who had noisy neighbors. Ya know? Like, have you ever had neighbors who played loud music at all hours of the night? And all you wanted to do is sleep, but they are partying all night long and you can hear them, so they keep you up? And you just get to a point where you are so frustrated with them and you want them to just shut up, so you bust down their door and start biting all their heads off? That is pretty much how the first part of the movie plays out. And then, after the Grendel kicks everybody's ass and kills the party so he can finally get some peace and quiet, he leaves kind of like, ""Keep the music down or I will come back again and kill you all!"" I've had neighbors like that, so I totally understood where the Grendel was coming from! But Beowulf is a great hero and it is good to see a good movie about one of history's greatest heroes."
"jemps918","6","0","8","18 November 2007"," Despite all the Gaiman gore and humor, Beowulf surprisingly still feels empty.
","Despite all the Gaiman gore and humor, the Robert Zemeckis-helmed Beowulf surprisingly still feels empty. The still-evolving CGI effects should not be blamed, since the first two installments of Shrek successfully delivered the warmth necessary to emotionally connect with its audience.<br/><br/>Beowulf is a famous epic poem set in Denmark about the warrior Beowulf, who paints himself as a larger-than-life hero. He successfully defeats the monster Grendel, who has been going on a killing spree, however, beautiful women like the monster's mother is his ultimate weakness.<br/><br/>Big stars like Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn and Anthony Hopkins headline this movie. But even with that and all the digital 3D hype it's brought (the level of detail is amazing, the blending of what's real and CGI is almost undetectable), what makes it still feel flat? There is nothing specific to pinpoint except for a ""feeling"": that the time spent watching it was not worth it.<br/><br/>Also, while the horror portions were indeed frightening, more shocking is how the film was able to get away with just a PG-13 rating despite all the violence, gore, nudity and adult themes. Probably because it was mostly animated, but even when the animation was so close to reality? Just strange, that's all"
"syndrome477","5","0","7","18 November 2007"," wasn't bad but wasn't as good as I had hoped
","This was not my first choice at the movies, but my family really wanted to see it. Although it was done in CGI..it wasn't too exciting. My daughter thought it was exciting and she thought I was crazy not to like it. I just barely saw it in the theater. It was a cool movie, lots of surprises in it. The high intensity graphics made it more fun to watch too. Graphics or not, it was easy to recognize the actors...just like if there was no computer imaging. I think anyone who enjoys a lot of fantasy in their movies will love this. I can imagine that a lot of people will rent or buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. I know it was very popular with my daughter and my husband!"
"tblankinship","6","0","6","17 November 2007"," Still prefer The Thirteenth Warrior
","The movie was overall good but i still liked the Thirteenth Warrior better. yes even though the thirteen warrior doesn't exactly follow the Beowolf story as well as this i found it more entertaining. Beowolf's CGI though for the most part was excellently done with a few minor exceptions. i felt that i needed more from the actors though, some of them were a little lackluster. Still its an OK movie. Yet, it would be one to take little kids to in my opinion. the movie does involve a little gore even though its ""cartoonish"" i still think that the little kids would receive nightmares from it. i haven't had the chance to see the 3-d version but for me this is a one time watch in the theater.<br/><br/>overall go see this movie at least once but if your not that hyped about it i'd wait for the DVD."
"imdb-6133","6","0","6","15 November 2007"," Eyes with no expression and the first pair of stilettos
","The 3D effect is fantastic, and only for it, it's worthwhile to see the film in the cinema. The worst thing by far is the fact that none of the characters' eyes have any expression. They look as if they were thinking, looking at the background instead of the person they are talking to. It took me too long to get used to it in the film. The flames and the seashore also suffer from looking as it they were made ten years ago, technologically speaking. The camera angles created, give great fun to the 3D effect. Angelina appears to have grown a pair of stilettos that don't fit at all in the film, and I did find over the top how many times they childishly hid Beowulf's ""talents""."
