","Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable ""wolfpack"" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other ""wolfpack"" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous ""wolfpack""). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the ""pack"" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required ""hair of the dog"" if you will."
"ThePhantomMovieBuff","7","31","36","6 September 2013"," The Hangover becomes Mission Impossible
","Not so long ago in the year 2009, The Hangover exploded onto the scene and was praised as one of the funniest films of the decade, with its witty cast and the hilarious ""re-tracing our footsteps to find out what we did"" routine running as the main plot. The Hangover Part II simply changed nothing at all, and offered nothing new with the attitude of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" What will please fan's the most with The Hangover Part III, is that is does not follow the same formula that the first two did. However, a lot of fan's will be headed into disappointment when they realize that this third instalment decides to take a completely different change in direction than that of its predecessors. And by completely, I mean very much drastically.<br/><br/>The story follows the Wolf Pack yet again as they try to help Alan (Zach Galifianakis) get back on track due to him being off his meds, and soon enough they get thrown into a Mission Impossible-esque mission to save their friend Doug (Justin Bartha, who yet again takes a miss on all the excitement) from Marshall (John Goodman), an angry gangster who wants' the Wolf Pack to find Chow (Ken Jeong, who has a much larger screen time in this instalment) and return to him to them with 21 million dollars in gold bricks that he stole. If not, Doug gets the offing. <br/><br/>A major plot point is the development of Alan. His friends Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) are mature and grown men who have happily settled down, but he is still very much stuck as a spoilt rotten teenager within a man's body, and his life is going nowhere. Throughout the adventure, it really is a tale about Alan and watching him grow into the man he should have become years ago. Fans of The Hangover owe it to themselves to watch it, whatever their final opinion of it may be.<br/><br/>Whereas The Hangover Part III doesn't match the quality of its first part, it definitely doesn't deserve all the negativity it has been getting. The film does a good job of balancing the well known Hangover humour with the Mission Impossible-esque set pieces, and all the recurring stars do well reprising their roles. One of the biggest changes that The Hangover Part III entails is that there is no actual drinking/hangover sequence. There's also no wedding or no missing person (or a pot smoking monkey). Instead, it plays it much straighter and it knows what it wants to set out to do, which is to stray far away from the formula of the first two chapters. And by doing so, it makes the finale to The Hangover Trilogy one to remember.<br/><br/>My Verdict: The Hangover Part III is a fitting end to the trilogy, but despite its changes in directions fans will be divided, resulting in a love or hate for this final chapter."
"snapsnjays15","8","28","34","25 May 2014"," Do Not Listen To All these Negative Reviews!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!! While it was not as good as the first, It still was a very funny and enjoyable movie! If you Like the hangover series, you will like this film. Zach Galafinakis once again stole the show, and MR CHOW was also brilliant. Again I do not know why there are so many negative reviews. Of course this is no Oscar winner, but it was still a great comedy movie in my opinion. I enjoyed it a lot, and have watched it several times since first seeing it! Do not listen to all of these negative reviews, go and watch it! I have come on IMDb so many times to check a movie and see all then negative reviews, and almost pass on watching a movie. Don't let this happen with hangovver 3! Excellent film. 8/10"

","Really?? Terrible?!?!?! it was amazing! If it was even about a Hangover, then you guys would be mad saying ""It's exactly like the first"" that's what the whine on number 2 was about! It has a great plot, a great story, great actors HILARIOUS ENDING AFTER THE CREDITS!<br/><br/>And a great ending to the wolf pack journey. It doesn't has a lot of sexual material, so it goes where the average R rated hit movie dares to go, with hilarious material without being fully sexual. And it has a lot of fresh new jokes that wasn't from the first (unlike number 2)<br/><br/>It's like 21 jump street! Just don't listen to what we think, watch it for yourself!<br/><br/>Then, you can fuss about it OR enjoy it, completely your mind ;)"
"Troy_Campbell","3","255","377","24 May 2013"," Almost completely humourless.
","I'm not going to sugar coat it: this movie stinks. After the gut-busting hilarity of the 2009 original, this comedy franchise has been struck down with a severe case of sequel-itis. The carbon-copy second instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a handful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of Zach Galifianakis' socially demented Alan; this episode however, is almost completely devoid of humour. The writing has become increasingly reliant on the natural charisma of the headlining star trio - with the plot here being laborious and woefully lazy - and the irritating Chow (Ken Jeong), the weakest link in part one, inexplicably gets even more screen time to screech and make our eardrums bleed. If it weren't for an amusing set piece atop Las Vegas' Caesar Palace hotel and a best-for-last gag during the end credits, I would've given this the one star treatment. I was desperately hoping this series would regain some form and finish with a bang, but unfortunately the wolf-pack's last adventure barely makes a whimper."
"joeybachor","10","22","28","17 October 2013"," All the hate???
","I thought this movie was 2nd best possibly 1st in the trilogy. I hear the term ""no hangover"" that's why it sucked or it was lazy or unfunny but it was a serious drama/comedy the hangover series has a deep story in 3 it all comes together the movie was great I have no clue why people hate it but I recommend it. its a good time. also the hangover part 3 had a lot of original things from the first one so when people say it what out of plot or unoriginal then there Solly mistaken great movie though I hate all the hate on it doesn't deserve the hate it was well done. it even had done good at the box office and some decent reviews so are these hate reviews all from one spam mer or?"
"StevePulaski","3","60","88","26 May 2013"," Lazy, cynical, and mean-spirited - the end could've come sooner
","I watched Todd Phillips' original Hangover film in theaters under normal, unassuming circumstances and walked out believing I had just witnessed a comedic masterpiece. It had the luxury of appearing just funny enough from the trailers and the fact that it was released during the time where the Apatow-esque comedies began to take way after something of a comedy recession. I loved it and believed it was one of the strongest comedies of the last decade. Its sequel, released in 2011, was, to say the least, a colossal disappointment. It featured mostly the same premise, with slight location and plot changes, and wasn't assisted by creativity and curiosity in terms of where the plot was going to go, unlike its predecessor.<br/><br/>And now the inevitable Hangover: Part III is out, which is unworthy of bearing the franchise's name and certainly isn't good enough for the Roman Numerals in its title. This time the film doesn't amplify something that was done previously only significantly better, but instead makes this a cynical, mean-spirited follow-up featuring characters we grew to like in the original but now sort-of can't wait to see gone. The posters for the film boldly claim ""The End"" and my only response is ""You're Late."" The film reunites Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the notorious ""Wolfpack"" who decides that after Alan's recent stint with a giraffe on a freeway that he needs to be taken to rehab and put back on medication. The four decide to travel to Arizona together, when they are run off the road by Marshall (John Goodman, in perhaps the strongest performance of the entire franchise), a gangster who has been robbed off $21 million worth of gold from Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). Being that the Wolfpack were close with Chow, Marshall kidnaps Doug and demands that Chow and his gold be returned to him. Cue the barrage of silliness and misunderstandings now.<br/><br/>The main difference between the two previous Hangover films and this third installment is that this one takes an approach more in line with an action film than a comedy. I see something more reminiscent to a Bad Boys III rather than the final installment to a long-running comedy trilogy. Actions scenes evoke the quickest and most irrevocable kind of monotony and with a series that is already beginning to feel like it has been carried out way past its prime, this only cements it.<br/><br/>And if that doesn't turn you off, the belittling mental illness subplot and the animal cruelty will likely do the trick. With Alan being off his medication, the character is given the most screen time in the film. Not to mention, Chow is given much more as well, and if we learn anything, it's that these two characters were better in small doses. Alan's dim-witted comedy and Chow's drug-related witticisms were at one time fun and fresh, but now, stale and flavorless. Furthermore, this is by far one of the most aggressive Hangover pictures in terms of what it portrays as comedy. It must be something of record that a one-hundred minute mainstream movies features the decapitation of a giraffe, the smothering of a rooster, and the poisoning of two dogs in an attempt to create humor. It's a sick, deplorable tactic that Phillips, who has shown his talent for giving characters something fun to talk about, uses in order to drum up either controversy or laughs or both.<br/><br/>Had the original Hangover stood on its own, not possessing sequels of lesser quality leaching off its name, it could've very well become a classic in the next several years. Not only that, it could've been seen as a studio marvel, one that didn't need to ""push the envelope"" with sequels and redundant attempts to break taboos. Alas, it is too late and it's a shame the untold millions the previous sequel grossed and the final installment will inevitably gross are put to two lesser films. I end with the the encompassing hope that the taglines for this film prove prophetic.<br/><br/>Staring: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, John Goodman, and Mike Epps. Directed by: Todd Phillips."
"umer_uf","5","65","97","24 May 2013"," Only good for few Nostalgia-laughs.
","You know that one joke you tell at every party? It was hilarious the first time you told it. So you kept telling it over and over again. You told your mom, your friends, your wacky uncle and heck you even told it to your baby sister. Each time you tell that joke it lost some of its charm and you know this in your heart, but you keep telling it because it made you someone who was at least bearable at the office party. The Hangover Part III is THAT dreaded, self-destructive joke. <br/><br/>The first The Hangover was a surprise to everyone. It was a smart, engaging and an all-around funny move. It made the three protagonists into overnight stars, along with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. It's no surprise then that The Hangover made these guys in demand, and had the audience craving for more. So what better way to give the masses what they want than bringing the Wolf Pack back together for two more subpar movies. The Hangover Part III brings the crew back together for yet another wacky adventure, this time getting them to go to Tijuana and back to Vegas. There isn't really much to tell you about the plot that you can't figure out yourself. So it makes very little sense to go in any further detail about it, and I can move on to things that worked.<br/><br/>By far the funniest moment during the movie for my money's worth was when some girl in the theater screamed out loud after seeing one of the main character dangle for his life. The whole theater roared, and it was a genuinely hilarious moment. Too bad the same can't be said about the rest of the movie. No doubt there were some funny moments and personally the best bits of the movie were when Melissa Mccarthy was on the screen. Some of the other funniest moments were throwbacks to the original. I found myself doing a lot of ""ooh I remember that from the first movie. Ha ha that reference is funny."" Unfortunately that is all this movie is, it's a reminder of how great The Hangover was and we should nostalgia- laugh (is something I just made up) because we once thought there was no one funnier than Zack Galifianakis. Other than that any original content was drab at best. <br/><br/>The best laughs came from all the supporting characters, and the 'Big 3' it felt like were just there to collect the pay check. Bradly Cooper was by far the worst of the bunch. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who was nominated for an Oscar not very long ago. Ed Helms and Zack Galifianakis were at least trying.<br/><br/>It was the overall chemistry of the three characters that made the original so great. The Hangover was a perfect recipe of Mac and Cheese where you threw in random ingredients and IT WAS THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE YOU EVER MADE! You tried replicating the original time after time, and tasted nothing but cheese and disappointment. It was just another Mac and Cheese. Sure it was served its purpose of feeding your broke student ass, but you yearned for that perfect gourmet Mac and Cheese fit to serve Gordon Ramsay himself. <br/><br/>The Hangover Part III is not a movie for people who are looking for genuine comedy. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones. If you're going in expecting a repeat of The Hangover then don't waste your time and money. If you were disappointed by The Hangover Part II this movie will only throw salt on your wounds. It's sad to see such an initially brilliant trilogy end like this. Hangover 3 was nothing but one last attempt at squeezing every last dollar from the franchise. The Hangover Part III gets 5 nostalgia-laughs out of 10."
"rkRusty","2","129","202","25 May 2013"," A waste of time
","You can't deny the success of the Hangover trilogy and its notoriety, and yet typical of many sequels before it, The Hangover Part III fails at almost every hurdle. From humble and I dare say somewhat original origins from the first Hangover, out is produced a loud-mouthed, vulgar and humourless successor. Little in this film captures attention in an admirable light. Abundant is the nonsensical, violent drive that paved the way for a series of good jokes in the first film, yet now no longer we see the laughs, merely the stupidity left in wake. There is no humour, no sense of longevity beyond a month or two, or even the mildest gesture towards good entertainment. Instead, a monotonous undercurrent of rushed scenes, placid dialogue and exaggerated violence carried throughout makes ""The End"" quite well a heavy thud into in-existence for the Hangover franchise.<br/><br/>Did anybody really expect brilliance? Likely not. Which is good, it should just make this final flick a forgettable yet entertaining encore to the previous films. But it's not. It's just a mess of too much money and a desire for more.<br/><br/>Nothing about this film appeals, nothing makes it worth seeing. Go to the park. Walk the dog. See something else. Just don't waste your time. One day everything will come to an end. Prolong your success with a final, exciting goodbye, or keel over into nothingness as one of the many forgotten films of Hollywood. The Hangover Part III likely won't dent the enjoyment most people think of at the first film, but it has formally announced that this, truly, is ""The End""."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","192","315","23 May 2013"," One of the Laziest Comedies in Recent Memory
","The Hangover Part III (2013) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Man, if you thought things couldn't get any worse than THE HANGOVER PART II then sadly you were mistaken. The Wolf Pack are back and this time a gangster (John Goodman) are after them because Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) stole forty-two million in gold. I'm really not going to waste anytime writing out everything going on here in regards to a plot synapses because why should I? It's clear that director and writer Todd Phillips along with stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis just made this thing either for the money or they had some sort of contract that required them to do so. While watching this thing it became rather sad because there simply weren't any laughs but what was worse is that it didn't seem the group were trying to make anything funny. This here is without question one of the laziest comedies I've ever seen because the filmmakers don't even bother to even attempt any laughs and what laughs there are are usually just winks to the first picture. It's really amazing to see how this series has fallen after a clever first film but the old saying that sequels usually end up poorly is certainly true. Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis fit their roles just fine but there's just no energy to be found here. Perhaps even they knew the screenplay was lackluster. Jeong is good in small doses but putting him into so much of this just made his character annoying. Goodman was good in his part but sadly he wasn't given much to do, which is the same for Mike Epps and Heather Graham. THE HANGOVER PART III claims to be the final in an epic series of films and lets pray that it really is. Bad movies happen sometimes even when everyone had their hearts into the project. There's just no evidence here that anyone cared about anything other than money. Part two proved that people would show up no matter how bad it was and the filmmakers got even lazier by delivering something worse."
"generationfilm","Null","157","257","23 May 2013"," The Hangover Pt. III: The End- A Whimpering End to the ""Adultolescent"" Trilogy that has Very Little Amusement but Loads of Ugliness and Cruelty
","More often than not people end up learning the hard way that it's usually better to leave a good thing well enough alone, which might be a lesson truly lived in regards to the quality of what can be deemed as The Hangover trilogy. When the exceptionally lazy Hangover Pt. II was released two years ago it highlighted the immense limitations of director Todd Phillips' storytelling capabilities as it traveled a carbon copy of the first film's intoxicated mystery and amplified vulgarity to different scenery but forgot to bring the laughs along for the trip. Now it seems the Todd Phillips created Hangover trilogy has taken to unintentionally embodying the stages of an actual hangover with the first installment's introduction serving as the party, the dirtier and lazier sequel acting as an unconscious blacked out sleep, and the newest final part becoming a nauseous, unbearable aftermath. The Hangover Pt. III: The End promises the conclusion of what could have been a respectable ""adultolescence"" comedy franchise and after experiencing the third installments descent into darkness and bitterness let's hope it's a promise that is inevitably kept. Todd Phillips and co-screenwriter Craig Mazin (Identity Thief, Scary Movie 3) have tossed aside all sense of wit, surprise, and genuine humor this time around replacing those qualities evident in the first Hangover with sociopathic cruelty, foreseeable plot changes, and zero sense of amusement diminishing any admirable attempt to change up the plot formula. All the fondness audiences have gained towards the characters of Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms) will be tainted in this final chapter as a mixture of performance idleness, poor script follow through, and a lens focusing on their purely sober qualities makes these three characters less than sympathetic, even bordering on incredibly unlikeable. What's ironic is that Todd Phillips has gone out of his way to appease the vilest of criticisms towards his uncreative writing and yet ends up highlighting his true creative limitations by not being able to drift away from a familiar structure. Unfortunately for fans of the series and audience members hoping for a strong summer comedy The Hangover Pt. III: The End ends this less than comedic trilogy with a desperate whimper and through its mean-spiritedness becomes a barely recognizable thread to the humorous and delightfully ill-mannered film that started it all."

All is well until Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) appears back on the scene. This time he is a man on the run and this makes for another mayhem adventure. Lots of actions pack scenes where the gang gets close to the edge and back. Doug even sparks a new love interest in Cassie (Melissa McCarthy). Lots of funny scenes and low brow references that have become a hallmark of the Hangover series, there is even a bit of a teaser for a continuing of the series in the end credits, so stay tuned.

","I decided to go and see this film as I am a fan of the first film in the franchise - the second was not enjoyable, but I had hoped the conclusion would be a return to form. I was hugely disappointed by the lazy script, cruel tasteless gags, and the predictability of the film. I love comedies, I have a sense of humour, but I only laughed once or twice. The cruel animal death 'jokes' killed the mood of the film. They were cheap and quite shocking. I know these films are supposed to be shocking, but it is not clever or witty to make jokes out of serious issues like cockfighting - I didn't want to watch a rooster get slowly smothered by an imbecilic Asian man. I wanted to enjoy a fun experience like I did with the first Hangover film. Mr Chow is a hugely irritating, monotonous character, whose only purpose seems to be to hurl out nonsense at every opportunity. The Hangover Part III will ruin the experience of the first film for you - if you want a film that is original, and good fun - avoid this shameless grab for cash. I can honestly say this was a chore to watch. 1/10"

","What a disappointment. As someone who actually thought Hangover II was even funnier than the original, I was looking forward to seeing the third installment which promised to take us back to where it all started ""Las Vegas"" with more of the same humor?? How wrong I was to believe that! Gone was the spontaneous feeling you got from the Wolfpack waking up not knowing what has happened to them, which I felt was the most interesting part of the first 2 movies as you followed the characters as they hunted for clues into the night before! In this 3rd serving we get a boringly flimsy storyline that dragged on, very few laughs, a short visit to LV and a script that could have been written by a ten year old! Stu (Ed Helms) has few interesting scenes and is for some strange reason constantly put down by Alan (Zach Galifianakis, who has now been given the central role of the movie along with Leslie Chow(Ken Jeong) who's antics were bordering on childish stupidity. Bradley Cooper who plays Phil was given more time and lines but failed to be convincing in the delivery of the character. Sadly this was a movie too far for the writer/s as it was totally unimaginative and as I said at the beginning extremely disappointing."

The pace needed to be more faster! Todd Phillips has Directed the film, he captures the wildness & absurdity of the film, very well. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is sharp.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: The Wolfpack of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms & Zach Galifianakis are back & they deliver superbly, yet again! Ken Jeong is given a lot of importance this time, but he's very over-the-top. The Always Excellent John Goodman rocks in his portrayal. Justin Bartha supports well. Heather Graham & Jeffrey Tambor are fair. Melissa McCarthy is hilarious in a bit role.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Hangover Part III' is one good laugh!"

It was truly awful and easily the worst movie of the year. The only laugh it got was when my wife and I both looked at each other and laughed that the movie was so unfunny. Shame on you cast and Director of the Hangover III. I want my money and time invested back. I texted all the people I love and care about and told them not to see this movie. This isn't even a rental. The title should never be mentioned in public ever again. THE WORST! As I am writing this I am still amazed how unfunny this movie was.

","I just got home from a pre-screening of this movie (guess it pays to know people with connections to local movie theaters) and decided I would throw up a review. *please note I am not a professional critic of any kind and this is my first review* First off let me say that I am a 19 year old college student who has loved the past couple of Hangover movies (the first much more than the second, though). Right off the bat I noticed that the third installment of the series, though filled with awkward moments and hilarious one liners, has much more of an actual plot than the previous two seemed to have. It revolves around a drug dealer/business man who is hunting down Chow (who did a spectacular job in his role as always) to get back 21 million dollars in gold that Chow has stolen from him. The drug dealer kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him if the rest of the wolfpack are unable to bring Chow (who is in hiding) back to him in three days.<br/><br/>The crew worked well together and the movie, though still fresh in my head, was very enjoyable. I wouldn't go out to say it's the best Hangover of them all, but I also wouldn't say it was the worst. Full of moments, hilariously awkward scenes, and Zach Galifianakis, this Hangover gets a 8/10 rating from me.<br/><br/>It's a movie you're going to want to go see, and a movie you won't mind spending a few bucks on. If you're easily offended, you'll hate this movie (even I thought they pushed the limit on a few of their jokes in this one, but hey, it's an adult comedy). I thought the near 2 hour run time felt much shorter and I thought the acting was great. Though I didn't have to pay to see it this time, I'd fork out 10 bucks to see it again with friends. It'll definitely be another movie that you'll be quoting the one-liners for quite a while."

"themissingpatient","4","36","66","25 May 2013"," Where the comedy fails, the action will keep you entertained
","The now infamous ""wolf-pack"" needs no introduction. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis return for the third and final sequel of The Hangover. Breaking the pattern of the first two films, the story doesn't begin with a bachelor party and morning after hangover wherein the pack is left to try to recall what happened the night before and find the missing wolf. The Hangover III begins instead with a funeral.<br/><br/>A funeral is a good way to introduce it's audience into this much darker world the wolf pack finds themselves in. Thankfully the comedy doesn't seem as desperate, trying to squeeze laughs out of us with shock and disgust, as the previous sequel did. No, Part III focuses more on a revenge story filled with almost non-stop action.<br/><br/>The original Hangover film is a classic and introduced the world to the genius that is Zach Galifianakis. It was fresh, original, shocking and hilarious fun. The Hangover II was not only one of the weakest sequels ever made but also one of the saddest excuses for a comedy. It lacked any originality and came off more as a bad remake than a sequel. For instance, instead of Las Vegas it was Bangkok. Instead of a baby, they had a monkey. Instead of a rooftop, it was an out-of-order elevator. The only bits that weren't the same as the original, as I mentioned above, were additional low-brow shocks.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part III, though not nearly as bad as the second film, still doesn't stand out as a great comedy. In fact, it's more of an action/thriller with some very dark comedy mixed in thanks to Zach Galifianakis' character. What truly holds the film back is the character of Mr. Chow, who, as in the previous films, is as irritating and degrading as a character can get. He only works as a villain yet it seems director Todd Phillips isn't sure whether to make us hate Mr. Chow or glorify this cocaine-loving, sexual deviant with absolutely no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>The funniest part of The Hangover III is that as an action/thriller, it is better than anything else Hollywood is currently producing in the genre. So where the comedy fails, the action and thrills are guaranteed to keep you entertained. It's also refreshing to see a Hollywood film with action that doesn't seem to be secretly funded by the CIA."

","The Hangover Part III Review <br/><br/>The truth is that Part III of this decent trilogy was pretty good, but not great, and definitely not awesome.

"Karl Self","10","9","13","4 June 2013"," What's with all the flak?
","OK, so I actually loved this movie. Hangover 3 manages to pull off the near impossible (and super rare) feat of being true to the original while presenting a fresh story. In part one, I'll remind you, four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, but instead of a few pleasant antics involving alcohol, recreational drugs and maybe a one-night-stand they wake up with their lives in complete disarray and without a clue as to what happened the previous night. Part 2 was kinda the same deal, but this time in Bangkok. Part 3 starts off completely differently: Alan has finally lost it, and the wolfpack sets off to take him to the looney bin. Then they end up in Tijuana, Chow turns up, and it looks as if we're in for another Hangover, this time in the Mexicali. Then things take a completely unexpected turn.<br/><br/>I would bet good money that you will love the third installment if you were partial to the humour of the original film. If you're not into its innovative but very physical and crude humour, then you should obviously steer well clear of the sequel.<br/><br/>What I don't get are all the highly negative reviews, both on and off IMDb. Much of what I read is just plain wrong. The jokes a spot on. The plot is anything but a sad rehash of Hangovers one and two. There is no obvious or excessive product placement (if there is any). And so forth. Hangover 3 is bound to be one of the best comedies of this year, and even my girlfriend liked it. So there."
"Likes_Ninjas90","1","18","30","24 May 2013"," A limp, unimaginative, charmless, joke-free action movie, pretending it's a comedy, and one that should be shunted and long forgotten
","Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover series, Starsky and Hutch) said that he felt there was freedom in making R rated movies and that it provided energy and aggressiveness. There has been a lot of testosterone and energy used in the revival of the 'man-child' films made by Judd Apatow and Phillips recently. Some of these are throwbacks to the raunchy comedies of the 1980s, where teenagers could watch raunchy, adult entertainment. When similar films embrace rather than critique the man-child syndrome however, they reveal how outdated and archaic they are because their target audiences are now older and smarter and deserve more. <br/><br/>The bromance subgenre could be traced back as far as any Western but today it echoes Hollywood's fixation on male friendships and reveals the general misogyny of the studio system as it hinges most of its resources on male orientated films. The reckless stupidity associated with not all, but many of these bromance films, amounts simply to wasted energy, aggressiveness and chaos, still in search of the word adult. <br/><br/>In spite of racist and misogynist undertones, the first Hangover movie drew appeal from the fact that its story seemed shrouded and mysterious, as its central characters uncovered their idiocy from the night before. It was about them coming to terms with their actions. If the sequel was a poor, laugh free cash-in, this third film challenges it to lower the bar past juvenile and into a new zone of painfulness. <br/><br/>Lame, unfunny and poorly made, this is not simply a question of juvenility or gender politics, but how far a director and producer is willing to sell-out a popular cast and franchise name for something that displays his own ineptitude. <br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis' opening scene, where he drives along a highway with a giraffe in the trailer, is an example of the attention-seeking, mean- spiritedness found in The Hangover Part III. What isn't shown in the film's previews is that when the giraffe reaches the overpass its head is knocked clean off and it smashes into a windscreen, causing a pileup of cars. <br/><br/>Animal cruelty features three times in this movie and like everything else here it's grimly unfunny. Who would have thought? The writing in Phillips' screenplay, co-written by Craig Mazin, is generally awful. The jokes aim low and still miss and there are three or four long, laboured transition scenes where the characters stop to signpost the next lurching stage of the plot through lazy expositional dialogue. There's no mystery or actual hangover till an end credits scenes, which means the title is now redundant too.<br/><br/>The story structure is dull and rigid, now resembling a heist action movie as the Wolfpack search for gold. After the giraffe incident and the death of his father (Jeffrey Tambor), Alan (Galifianakis) is forced into an intervention by his Wolfpack friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha). They prepare to take him to a clinic, only to be ambushed by Marshall (John Goodman) who kidnaps them. He reveals that Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped from prison and has stolen half his gold. He wants it back and says that he will kill Doug if they don't comply or contact the police. <br/><br/>Todd Phillips' dependability on Galifianakis is the sum of why the film is so unfunny. No one else is allowed to try and be funny, unless you think a grotesquely exaggerated Asian stereotype counts, but then I've never liked Mr. Chow. Bradley Cooper, after his career defining performance in Silver Linings Playbook, is called to do so little that Phillips seems utterly daft about his comedic talents. Once quirky and original, Galifianakis' mentally strained man-child act is now irritating and sad, with every quip line foreseen, which robs the jokes of their unpredictability. <br/><br/>If anyone were to say that the lack of growth in these cartoon characters is the point then it would be to excuse the dunderheadedness of this achingly boring and hopefully, but not definitely, last entry from what it is: a limp, unimaginative, charmless, joke-free action movie, pretending it's a comedy, and one that should be shunted and long forgotten."

","Welcome to the one of the most unpleasant motion picture viewing experiences you are going to have this year or any year for that matter. This movie celebrates the principle that by simply writing checks, you can avoid accountability and responsibility for causing a massive freeway pile up of cars and trucks that probably resulted in fatalities or in numerous life threatening injuries of many innocent people.<br/><br/>The movie tries to build laughs by depicting two scenes of astonishing cruelty to animals involving a decapitation and suffocation by pillow; there is also a reference to the fate of two other animals that takes place off screen which does not make the knowledge any less unpleasant. A scene with an invalid elderly person in the span of a few brief seconds amply illustrates the selfishness and self absorbed nature of most of the characters populating this movie. <br/><br/>There is no comedy or humor in this movie or any laughs. There is a total of 3 minutes of glorious film in the 100 minute run time. This is 90 seconds of Heather Graham's luminous presence and artful grace and a 90 second sequence inserted into the end credits scrawl. The latter in a bitter twist of irony is a laugh out loud funny sequence that belatedly hints at what this movie could have been. <br/><br/>My negative opinion of this movie is not about my lacking a sense of humor or tolerance for outrageousness or edginess in a film. It is simply about wanting to see a decent comedy made by intelligent filmmakers. Instead, this movie is what you will find in abundance floating in the sewers of Bangkok where the movie begins and should have been left to rot.<br/><br/>Save your money and do not allow the howls of derision from genuine comedy lovers to be drowned out by the laughter of the filmmakers and actors with lucrative back end deals tied to the box-office gross as they strut their way to their banks to cash their checks. My 15 bucks is a goner, yours does not have to."

","Moviegoers want sequels, that's why they are made. As fans, we want to see more and learn more about the characters we know and love, but no matter how good that sequel is, not all of the fans are going to like it. If the movie is too much like the first one, the fans say it's the same movie, but if it's too different, they say it doesn't fit the story. The only place the writers/producers are going to win is at the box office, because no matter the reviews, they know people are going to come and see it. The Hangover Part III is getting terrible reviews from fans, because it's not what they expected. It's not as funny as the first one or even the second one, in fact, this film is much more dramatic than the rest of the films in the series, but it not necessarily a bad thing. Alan may not have had a ton of funny lines and Stu's girlish screaming may have run it's course, but this was still a really good story. Using flashbacks from the original, Todd Phillips introduces us to a part of the story that we didn't even know existed until now. This time, they skip the hangover and the wolf pack needs to go on an adventure to capture Mr. Chow. Four years ago, Chow ripped off another gangster and that gangster kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the wolf pack can bring him Chow. The story was solid and included some of the comedy we love along with dramatic elements and even a couple of really exciting chase scenes. No, this film was not the hangover we've come to love and expect. The clever one-liners aren't there, there's no wedding to prepare for, and the stakes are much higher this time, but all in all the story was very solid and the performances were fantastic. This film was a great way to end the story of the wolf pack, yet many fans and critic alike insist on comparing it to the first one. This film is much different than the original, too different in the opinions of many. If you want to compare Part III to the original Hangover, than no it's nowhere near as good, but if you look at it based on it's own merits, it's a pretty solid film, albeit much different from what was expected."
"MovieAddict2016","5","10","17","9 June 2013"," Too much Chow kills this cash cow.
","Todd Phillips and Zach Galifianakis are both cynical, bitter filmmakers. This is essentially their middle finger to the fratboy crowds who swallowed up the first two films in the franchise. ""Hangover III"" is less comedy, more dark action thriller, and much of the comedy that does exist here centers upon sociopathic behaviour. Alan (Galifianakis) was always a somewhat disturbing manchild, but the first film played most of his laughs on the naive side. When he made inappropriate gestures with the baby in the first film, for example, and tried to show off to his friends, it came across like a little kid who's being naughty and is taking delight in being naughty, without fully understanding what he's actually doing. In the second film, however, when he sabotaged everything, he took on a more demented, decidedly self-aware tone. And in this movie, he's a borderline sociopath. His fascination with Bradley Cooper has gone full-on homoerotic (he suggests that he remove his shirt at one point), and his relationship with Chow is likewise odd. He cracks up while reading his rap sheet at a police station, chuckling at his charges for public masturbation and lewd behaviour. <br/><br/>All of this, I assume, was of great delight to Galifianakis, who can finally bury his Alan character after four long years. He's never been afraid to make it clear how much he loathes the success he's had with this film, mainly because of the type of people the films engender themselves to (he spoke on Conan about the frat bros who come up to him in public and ask him to come get high or quote lines from the movie). Galifianakis is a talented actor and was an alt comedian whose stand-up basically thrived on darkly subversive material mocking easy mainstream targets, not far from David Cross' blend of humour, so one gets the feeling that he and Phillips -- who has a similar distaste for the public at large (he did, after all, get his start with a documentary about GG Allin) -- really delighted in their free-ranging ability to turn the Hangover franchise over and basically just bury everything that made it appealing to audiences in the first place.<br/><br/>Cooper and Ed Helms look lost here, in it solely for the paycheck; the story is pretty insulting and doesn't really push them together in a believable way. It's not feasible that these men would still be having adventures together after the last two films, but where there's $1.5 billion dollars in worldwide box office, there's a way...<br/><br/>The film's biggest mistake also contributes to its misanthropic edge: giving Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) more screen time, effectively bumping him up to a 4th Wolf Pack member. He was the worst part of the first film, and probably the second as well: only tolerable in small doses and funny only in the scene where he randomly (and nakedly) jumps on the Wolf Pack in that first installment. Chow is a miserable, weird, uncomfortable character, not funny in the least bit, and Phillips decides to make him a central plot point of this sequel.<br/><br/>This wasn't as bad a movie as critics would lead you to believe, nor is it as unfunny -- some of the sociopath bits with Alan, despite their disturbing nature, are quite funny (I liked the scene where he asks Cooper's character if his shirt is from Diesel). I give the team behind it props for having the guts to completely depart from the formula of the first two, as well as the tone of those other movies, even if they took it the wrong direction as a result.<br/><br/>But it is the worst of the franchise, a clear death knell for the series, and not the 'epic conclusion' I was kinda expecting it to be prior to the reviews flooding in. The second film was the typical '80s style sequel that rehashed all the elements of the original (monkey instead of baby, tattoo instead of missing tooth, etc.). This movie doesn't do that, but in Phillips and Galifianakis (the two I pin the blame on the most) delightfully mocking their audience so flagrantly, it's pretty clear that this movie isn't really going to find much of an audience with anyone. I'm glad I saw it, it's not the worst movie of the year, and it's at the very least somewhat interesting because of its departing tone, but it's not really successful as action film or as a comedy, so it just kind of exists for no reason other than easy money for all involved."

Now you have people complain that it's different. You can't have it both ways. That being said, yes it was better than the second but by no means better than the first. Instead of flash forwarding to after the hangover and retracing their steps, the wolf pack go on a more traditional ""beginning to end"" journey. It wasn't predictable (Chow made sure of that), it had some pretty dark content/humor (hello it's rated R), but most importantly it was FUNNY. I was laughing literally the entire movie. Appearances by John Goodman and Melissa McCarthy were just the icing on the cake. All in all - go see it/rent it/buy it.... Whatever.

","The epic conclusion to one of the strangest trilogies wasn't as epic as I had hoped. The Hangover 3 opened and I was excited because the Hangover 2 was a giant disappointment due to the similar antics as the first movie. I got to say, this movie was different but different was far from better. The Hangover 3 was no better than the Hangover 2. It was less of a comedy and almost more of a B rated action movie. I hope you are ready for a rant because I got a good one. I can feel it in my fingertips, here we go. This movie is called THE HANGOVER. They don't get hangover. There is no drinking and all the changes made from the original didn't work. All of the actual funny parts were shown in the trailer. The only funny parts were the giraffe, the singing, and well that's really it. I can honestly say I laughed more during Evil Dead then I did in the Hangover. I don't know if that makes me a sick person. Somebody please comment and tell me they agree with me so I don't feel crazy. The main problem with this movie was Chow. I like the actor who plays Chow but I hate his character. I don't find him funny and he is over used. He is like a bottle of ketchup. You don't give up on that bottle until every last bit is out. You keep tapping on the bottom until you physically give up. He was perfectly used in the first movie but I didn't like him there either. He was at least funny in the original but I still thought he over did it. In this movie he is a main character and that drove me nuts. The focus on the movie was mainly on him when it should have been on the wolf- pack. Other than him all the comedic material was focused around Alan. Alan is supposed to be a lovable idiot who has witty jokes and makes you laugh. He pulled it off se well but in this movie he lost his edge and turned into a jerk. His jokes were flat and most of the time he just made fun of Stu. Stu is supposed to make fun of Alan, that is where his comedy originates from and he wasn't funny at all in the movie. All he does is complain and whine. Bradley Cooper was flat as well. He gave little to no effort in the role and you see it in his performance. He was boring and not funny either. Something was missing in the wolf pack and they tried to fill that with the silliness and over the top actions of chow and for me it didn't work what so ever. I knew the story would be crazy and overall it would not be a good movie but I didn't go in expecting a good movie. I went on to laugh. I was really hoping for a strong opening scene with a lot of laughs but it failed to impress. It was focused on Chow and it spoofed Shawshank Redemption, which I did not appreciate. When Chow wasn't on screen the movie wasn't that bad and it was decently funny. Most of the theater wasn't laughing either. I set myself up for the best chance possible for s good time and even the audience was flat. They were just as bored as I was. The occasional burst of laughter but it was a full theater and laughter usually builds off of others laughing. I know people and critics won't like this movie and that is a shame because the first one was so good and different. It is a shame a great title had to come to this. I hope and pray there is no Hangover 4, but knowing Hollywood there will be. John Goodman was in the movie and he was great. He wasn't funny but his addition to the movie saved me from hating it. Evert time he was on screen I was satisfied and happy. He made references to the first movie and little bits and pieces like that I liked. Black Doug comes back along with the stripper and baby from the first. There are a few cameos from the first movie any huge fan will appreciate. I liked that and it put a smile on my face. The best scene was when Alan reunites with Carlos and they have the cutest conversation. It was funny and adorable at the same time. It was a nice break from the crazy antics for some good ole fun. The main thing that aggravated me the most was the 90 second scene during the credits. It was hysterical and it showed a little glimpse of what the movie could have been. I won't spoil it but they wake up hangover, and it was another night they couldn't remember. That 90 seconds was funnier than the entire movie. I burst out into laughter the point where my sides hurt. It was funny but added to my frustration towards the fail this movie really was. Overall, The Hangover 3 blew it. This movie could have been really good and hilarious. The script was poor, the focus was messed up. Chow and Alan needed to be rewritten and it needed to be funny. This movie was not funny. The car chases and gunshots needed to be cut and added with witty comments from Alan and funny reactions from Stu and Phil. Should you see this movie? Sure, why not. It wasn't a disaster but it was close. If you saw the first two then go ahead but don't expect anything to great. The Hangover 3 gets the Willyt A for Effort, better luck next time. Mark my words, there will be a next time."

","Kudos to director Todd Phillips (who should really be directing action flicks) for not giving audiences another carbon copy storyline of the original; even though this movie is set in Las Vegasagain. In saying that, Phillips seemed to have had only one goal in mind when making ""The Hangover Part 3"". And that was to make something better than the insanely lazy and disgusting retread that was ""The Hangover Part 2"". But while this isn't as offensively gross or vulgar, it is offensively tame and dull and uneventful.<br/><br/>The Synopsis: Like one of those stupid Fast & Furious sequels, the gang's all back. This includes the likes of Zach Galifianakis as Alan, Ed Helms as Stu, Justin Bartha as the other guy and Bradley Cooper, as the guy who can't put these movies in his rearview fast enough. In this final installment, the guys stage an intervention for Alan becausewell, maybe because it took them three movies to realize how mentally unstable he actually was. They plan a trip together in order to get Alan some treatment, but, through a series of lazily plotted events, they end up getting mixed up with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) again inYou know what? Instead of writing my usual long-winded review, I will mix it up a little and do something a bit unconventional. Just to preface this next statement, I usually take notes while watching a movie. But, since this was touted (from the trailers) to be the epic finale to these inexplicably beloved comedies, I decided to keep a tally of laughs instead. That is to say, instead of notes I counted all of the times ""The Hangover 3"" did its job and made me laugh. Here are the results of my experiment: During this comedy, which had a runtime of 100 minutes, I laughed twice and smirked once. Review over.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","I'm still angry at the 2 hours of my life lost and the fact I threw $5 out the proverbial window. The Hangover Part III is without question one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. What an absolute travesty of movie making this heap of rubbish is. How did this happen? How the hell did this script get past all the Hollywood executives? How did Ken Jeong's character get to be the main character and the center of the plot? Are you kidding me? This is not a comedy - let's get that straight. No movie that starts out with a giraffe getting decapitated on a highway can be considered a true comedy. Can it? That's in the first few minutes - later, dogs are killed, roosters are smothered - always a funny moment there! Bradley Cooper should be ashamed of himself. He seemed uninterested and it's obvious he was not enjoying himself. Ed Helms was, oh well, Ed Helms. Ho hum. Justin Bartha must have really, really, really, really needed the paycheck because his role is embarrassing and non-existent. Zach Galifianakis' role put him front and center as the man-child idiot savant who has a bigger role being more aggressive, arrogant, and dare I say, assertive. John Goodman's role as the bad guy heavy who got robbed of $42 million in gold bullion by ( applause, whistles and klieg lights please ) none other than Ken Jeong's ""Mr. Chou"" is mean, ugly and disturbing. Well, I saved the worst for last - Ken Jeong. His character is the main character. That right there is enough to know this train wreck is going nowhere near comedic enjoyment. He is a nasty, evil little punk. How's this for comedy - he blows Goodman and his associates head off with a .45 auto. How funny!! I laughed for hours! No. I was disgusted. I firmly believe 100% , that anyone can write a script that can be get made into a movie - anyone. I wouldn't watch this steaming pile of wretched refuse again if it was the last movie on Earth."

"rockandhockey","6","9","18","23 May 2013"," Not too bad but interesting concept
","Honestly, I thought that the movie wasn't as bad as I had heard going in the the premier. I think it was way more original than part 2 but not quite to the originality of part 1. The fact that they changed up the story line so it wasn't just the characters getting drunk and retracing their steps was a nice addition to the series. Specifically, I thought of the movie as a transition in Allen from a very juvenile version of Allen to a Allen that is growing up. But overall the jokes were dumb humor which should be expected from this type of movie where most of the humor is centered around one of the characters being significantly less intelligent than the others. I also liked that they brought back some of the very minute characters from the first movie and actually expanded on the things that they said. I also loved how they did the same kind of reference to the old movies at the very end after the credits, I thought it was funny and also was a good way to end the movie while leaving the audience to interpret what happened.<br/><br/>The characters themselves were an interesting change. I didn't like that again Doug was not included in the majority of the movie. I did however enjoy John Goodman's character, Marshall. As always the banter between the three main characters was humorous, but the humor was the same as the previous movies.<br/><br/>The one major interesting little detail that I was not sure how I felt initially was the references to other movies. In specific parts of the movies, such as Chow escaping from prison in the beginning of the movie in the pretty much the exact same way as in Shawshank Redemption, it was a bit too copied. I enjoyed the reference but at the same time, it reminded me of the way that the Scary Movies reference movies, and because I don't like those movies, I didn't like that style.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the humor was on point with good references to the relationships of the characters. Rating the movie, I would probably give the film a 6 or 7, with the added point because of the final scene after the credits. Through all of this though, I do not believe they should make a 4th movie."

Let me tell you, we wish we would have used our free passes on another movie it was so bad. I oscillated between boredom and WTF throughout the entire movie, which is not something I expect from a Hangover movie. (Sorry, I just don't find beheading a giraffe and killing chicken and dogs funny. Chow smothering a chicken = CREEPY and definitely not funny. And I thought Stu getting laid by a male stripper was funny last movie.) For me, what this movie really lacked were the one-liners/scenes like the ones that I can still quote from the first Hangover. I couldn't tell you any line in particular that I found funny, and I just saw the film yesterday. My boyfriend and I felt like we were actually looking for lines to laugh at. And unfortunately, the only parts I laughed at were parts that I had already seen in the trailer, or flashbacks from the first Hangover film. I also thought some of the acting was actually BAD this film. I actually enjoyed the second film more than this one. <br/><br/>I really regret saying this because I had been looking forward to this movie for months, but this movie was just plain bad.

","Anyone who's suffered a real hangover has probably moaned the words, ""Never again."" Well in a cinematic sense, the same mistake has now been made twice, first with the limp HANGOVER PART II that borrowed much too closely from the original's template: three guys, having partied too hard, wake up with no memories of the night before and the complicated backtracking begins. Now part III has shoved the whole blackout device under the carpet. This time ""The Wolf Pack"" is sent on a mission by a mobster (John Goodman) to recover gold bars stolen by Mr. Chow. <br/><br/>That's the basic plot in a nutshell, and we start off with the three friends Bradley Cooper's reluctant leader, Phil; Ed Helms as the group's guinea pig, Stu; and the flaky bearded man- child Alan played by Zach Galifianakis venturing into Mexico to find the elusive wacko, more of a formidably indestructible secret agent than a second-tier comic relief – and is given way too much screen time.<br/><br/>Most of the capers from robbing (what seems to be) Chow's mansion in Mexico to, once the boys return to their roots in Las Vegas, climbing down the Caesars Palace Hotel penthouse using tied-up towels could have made up several decent trailers for a non-comedic thriller. Which is exactly what this third (and supposedly final) HANGOVER has to offer: a few action sequences and nothing more.<br/><br/>So why waste time knocking the movie for not being funny when it never really tries to be? That is, until about fifteen seconds into the end credits: If you paid to see a comedy, this is your best bet."

","Just came back from watching the advance screening of Hangover 3. Overall the film has a much different feel to it than the previous two entries but still as good. The original is still the funniest, but Part 3 changes the structure of the film and instead plays looser with the characters and the plot. The jokes are still there but there's also a few more serious moments. Also the film contains deaths but i won't spoil anything more. The film also involves the 3 members of the wolfpack with Doug yet again being sidelined. However there's also enough Hangover cameos like Black Doug, The family and of course the best being Leslie Chow. All in all the film is a great way to end the trilogy. It's a must see for those who enjoyed the first two films as it is a perfect closure to the series. For those that didn't enjoy the first two then this ain't gonna change your mind about the franchiser."
"Jackkrsk","1","5","9","28 May 2013"," ""It's one of the worst movies to end a film series just like The Matrix Revolutions!""
","I watched The Hangover Part 3 in the movie theaters the day before yesterday. This time the main plot of Part 3 doesn't involve with a bachelor party & wedding but, in the aftermath of Leslie Chow's escape from maximum-security Thai prison and the death of Alan's father, Phil, Stuart, and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) a.k.a The Wolfpack( that of course includes Alan) made a decision to take Alan to the mental hospital to get his mental issues treated. But things start to go wrong on the way to the hospital as The Wolfpack is assaulted and Doug is taken hostage by a gangster Marshall (John Goodman) and Black Doug (Mike Epps), who was from the first Hangover film. Marshall made them aware that, during a $42 million gold heist, Chow stole half of the gold and has escaped from the Thai prison. In order for The Wolfpack to save Doug from Marshall, they must find Mr. Chow again and get the stolen gold. The film takes place in L.A., Tijuana and Las Vegas again just like in the first film. Heather Graham reprised her role as Jade, the sexy stripper who married Stu from the first Hangover movie. The film also stars Melissa McCarthy as Lathe pawn shop owner Cassie, who is the first women that Alan immediately falls in love with. <br/><br/>I honestly thought the movie was awful. The motion picture pretty much did not made me laugh at all except the beginning and the post credits scene. If you are all curious about the post credits scene you all have to see it for yourselves, if you all want to. The rest of the film definitely had poor comedy & acting and it wasn't as really funny as the previous two Hangover films.In some ways, The film had two out of place genres Dramadey (Comedy-Drama) and Crime thriller. The film also had some dramatic acting that is also out place of the comedy genre of the film and it did not amazed me at all. <br/><br/>If the main plot of the film involves with a bachelor party and wedding it would still be terrible of course because it would pretty much repeat the same related plot and jokes from The Hangover part 1 and 2.Even The Hangover part 2 pretty much repeat the same related plot and jokes from the first one. That's the reason I think The Hangover should of have just been a stand-alone film with no sequels at all. Another problem that I have with the film is that it takes place in Las Vegas again just like the first one. The Wolfpack went to Las Vegas again just to look for Mr.Chow and the stolen gold in his condo in Caesar's palace hotel & casino and bring him to Marshall.<br/><br/>Here's my advice for the film: ""Do not watch this film in theaters, if you buy a ticket to see this movie it would be a waste of money!"" I would have to say it's so far one of the worst films of this decade."
"jordan2240","4","6","12","26 May 2013"," No charm here
","They should have stopped after 1, though 2 was not terrible. This one, however, was simply a way of sucking more money out of the series, and they got some of ours (though fortunately at matinée prices). There are some laughs, but not nearly as many as you'd expect, and they've turned Chow into too significant a character. He was much funnier in the shorter role in the original. They've also put too much emphasis on the suspense portion of the plot (an it's not particularly suspenseful at that). Alan's character moves from being that of a naive innocent to something far crueler and darker, which I didn't enjoy either. The funniest part of the movie, and the one that takes you back to the appeal of the original, occurs after the credits start to roll, so don't run out in disgust once they do.<br/><br/>If you really want to see how the series ends, save yourself some cash and wait for the video release. Wish we had spent out money on something else."
"The-Sarkologist","3","4","7","8 November 2013"," Is there any point to this movie?
","I really don't know why they even bothered with this movie? It seemed to be so far away from the originality of the first two in this trilogy that it seemed to simply exist to tie up a couple of lose ends that really didn't need to be tied up. Granted, the second movie was a carbon copy of the first movie, but the fact that it was a carbon copy, and also was set in Bangkok, and brought out the sleazy nature of Bangkok, actually gave it some charm. This movie had absolutely none of that.<br/><br/>In this film Doug gets kidnapped because it turns out that Chow has stolen a bunch of gold off of an American Crime lord and the wolf pack is the only ones who can get their hands on them. As such what they seem to be attempting to do is to throw the woefully unequiped and inadequate Wolfpack into a scenario that they manage to stumble through once again. However, the thing that set the other two movies apart – the fact that they cannot remember a thing and must spend the entire movie piecing their fragmented memories back together, is gone, and because they take that away, this movie becomes nothing special.<br/><br/>Further, part two seriously pushed the boundaries of what can be considered to be acceptable in a modern movie (such as the full frontal shots of the Ladyboys, which as it turns out, aren't even edited in certain versions). Okay, I am not really impressed with that, but this film was so much tamer, and in a way, quite dull, pointless, and probably should never have been made."

","The end of one of the most unnecessary film trilogies is finally here. First, I have to say I never was a fan of the first Hangover. I never understood why such a mediocre comedy is getting so much attention and praise. There are so many more better comedies who would deserve more attention and praise, or a sequel. The original spawned two more follow- ups, where the first one got a lot of backlash for bringing the same narrative structure and plot. Critics disliked it and fans disliked it. Although I enjoyed the Bangkok adventure more than the first. Mainly because of the direction and the situations the characters found themselves were actually funny. While watching the first movie I just couldn't find the situations funny, the plot seemed too serious to me. That wasn't the case with the second one. Director Todd Phillips even said himself in a recent interview that all the hangover films are not straight-up comedies and they never have been. The second one went a step further and became a black comedy which appealed to to me much more tan the bland first one. The Hangover Part III goes even further, but not probably in the the right direction.<br/><br/>It was obvious from all the previous Todd Phillip's movies that he desperately wants to make an action movie. In every single one of his films there is at least one actions usually involving a car. Warner Bros. studios probably didn't let Phillips make an action movie so he jammed a gangster story involving kidnapping, robbery and dead bodies into this so-called comedy. <br/><br/>What worked in the previous films was that there wasn't a main character, all three of them were main characters. The story didn't focus on neither one of them. This time the story focuses on Alan, played by Zach Galifanakis, who again plays the man child, which he is famous for playing in every movie he is in. His annoying mentally retarded fattie worked the previous movie for his limited screen time. That is not the case her. Part III is his story only, but luckily his character goes through some development here and in the end he there is an catharsis waiting for him. The rest of the Wolfpack, Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) are reduced to supporting characters this time. In most of the scenes they just stand by and watch Alana and his crazy escapades. Unfortunately the man who shouldn't be allowed near a camera, and a very unfunny man, Ken Jeong (originally he was a doctor but then he became an actor) as Chow gets more screen time to the point of being quite unbearable. Doug (Justin Bartha) once again disappears from the story right in the beginning, which is a pity. I wish he would be present at least once in the Wolfpack's adventure.<br/><br/>In the previous Hangover films lot of the humor came from these shocking moments, this time the shock value has reached a new high. There is a lot of abuse to animals - dogs, chicken and mainly a giraffe. This film features a giraffe decapitation scene, you have probably seen it in the trailers but in the movie you see much more. You see the decapitated head flying through the air. I know it is CGI so I shouldn't be offended but I don't find this funny. <br/><br/>If you are a die-hard Hangover fan then go and see this movie, but if you are looking for a comedy that will make you laugh,then keep looking because this one will just bring a few smiles.<br/><br/>P.S. Since Old School Todd Phillips has such great cinematography in his movies, I dare to even say beautiful cinematography, this film is no exception. Also he has an excellent music choice using here once again Billy Joel or Harry Nilsson. Every song he uses in the film fits perfectly to the mood of the scene or as a great joke."

As I had expected a lot of those laughs came from Zach Galifianakis. His characters are always so stupid and random and i just love that kind of thing. That being said his co stars Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms were also very good in this movie. They are a very good counter to Zack Galifianakis's naive childish character.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie once again revolved around getting their friend Doug back who was kidnapped rather then lost. Instead of having to retrace their steps in order to find Doug the wolfpack had to find Chow so they could trade him to John Goodmans well played character in exchange for Doug.<br/><br/>So overall its much more original and more entertaining then the 2nd movie and well worth checking out. It was a satisfying end to the trilogy and a fun enjoyable ride. The post credit scene was one of the funniest in the movie and hinted at a possible 4th installment but as for if that would be a good idea or not I really don't know.<br/><br/>8/10"

","We have now come to the conclusion of Todd Phillip's Hangover trilogy four years after the Wolfpack took on Vegas and won.<br/><br/>The film begins in a prison in Thailand were a guard sees a riot in his prison. The guard walks through the prison to find that Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped through his cell, a direct Shawshank Redemption reference. Chow is running through the sewers where he gets away and ends up in the water.<br/><br/>After the opening credits, the films transitions to Alan (Zack Galifianakis) driving on the freeway with a giraffe he just bought. Alan is enjoying his life until the giraffe hits a bridge and gets decapitated, which then causes a wreck. Sid (Jeffrey Tambor) is not happy with Alan and tells him that if he doesn't get back on his medicine that he quit taking, he'll get cut off. Shortly after, Sid has a heart attack and passes away. At the funeral, Alan does a wonderful job of singing ""Ave Maria"" and gives a eulogy that insults both his mother and sister. His pals, their wives, and his mother meet to discuss getting him to a rehab center and know Alan won't comply unless Phil, Stu, and Doug take him there after holding an intervention.<br/><br/>On the way to the rehab center in Arizona, Phil's minivan is hit repeatedly and the Wolfpack are tied up by Black Doug (Mike Epps), who turns out to be working for a man named Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall stops them because of their association with Mr. Chow. Turns out that Black Doug selling the wrong drugs to Alan set off a chain of events bigger than they realized, that resulted in Mr. Chow stealing $21 million in gold from Marshall. After telling the Wolfpack about this, Marshall forces them to bring Chow to him or he'll kill Doug.<br/><br/>Alan convinces Mr. Chow to meet up with him while Chow is in Tijuana. They try to drug Chow to pass him out, but to no avail. Chow helps them get the gold he owes Marshall, but turns on the Wolfpack and steals Phil's minivan and takes it to Vegas.<br/><br/>The story is very entertaining with interesting plot twists that make this finale one to remember. Todd Phillips's direction here is not as good as the first, but he does a great job at keeping Part III entertaining and hilarious. Phillips also co-wrote the script with his longtime writing partner Craig Mazin. They do a great job of keeping the story moving forward and keeping the story entertaining and hilarious.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Justin Bartha all do good jobs, but it's not much more than what we've already seen from them in the first two Hangover movies. Zack Galifianakis steals the show as this film is Alan's show. Zack does great at showing a wider range of emotion, even more than what Phillips got out of him in Due Date. Zack does great at conveying Alan's happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety. Ken Jeong is an even bigger laugh riot as Mr. Chow, proving once a criminal, always a criminal. John Goodman is awesome as the angry Marshall, who wants what Chow stole from him. Also doing a great job is Melissa McCarthy as Cassandra, a pawn shop employee who is what Alan would be like if Alan was a woman.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see Mike Epps come back as Black Doug and Heather Graham return as Jade, Stu's stripper ex-wife. I also enjoyed the cinematography by Lawrence Sher, who got some amazing shots of Tijuana and Las Vegas, especially the night time shots."
"n-mo","1","5","10","9 June 2013"," A failure
","About the only good thing that can be said about ""The Hangover part III"" is that it did not repeat the error of ""The Hangover part II"" in rehashing a very funny story (from the original ""The Hangover"") whose comedic timing depended entirely on elemental shock and could offer nothing to up the ante except more raunch and more violence. The problem is that what it had to offer in this stead was completely stupid and pointless.<br/><br/>Alan is the foil, the deliberate but well-intentioned anti-hero of this movie, as he is in the first two movies. The difference is that the character in the first two is static, never progressing and just being his plain old dumb dangerous lovable self, hints but never express data communicated with respect to the psychiatric malaise that makes him the oaf he is. The third film attempts to transform him into a dynamic character, one who becomes conscious of the evil he does, but this time the evil is entirely unforeseen and there is no intention.<br/><br/>The problem is that once we understand Alan's real problem and lose the ambiguity, the original concept is retroactively destroyed and we forget all about the humor that made us fall in love with these characters in the first place. We end up just flat-out NOT CARING in the end. The simple fact is that the universe of ""The Hangover"" was not set up to handle the sort of drawn-out, complex emotional melodrama that this film wants to be without killing the quirky charm that made the original hit such a crisp note with so many people the world over in the first place.<br/><br/>A few people have suggested that simply expanding on the cliffhanger ending, which resembles the initial rising action moment in the first two films in the midst of the hangover after a Very Bad Trip (the title of the franchise in France), would have made for a more entertaining film. There are two problems with this suggestion. First of all, there is no reason to think that doing so would have ended up producing something funny, unless you are the type who thinks that Part II was on par with the original. Second, the very premise on which the scene turns depends on the climax, falling action and dénouement of Part III as it is made, so deleting this development would make such an expansion totally incomprehensible.<br/><br/>But as it is, the ending is problematic as an extension of Part III, because it suggests either that Alan is at fault, in which case the preceding dynamic action on his character is entirely negated, or that this happened despite and not because of him, in which case we conclude that either he or the group is cursed and that therefore nothing he does to change will ever make a difference, thereby negating any meaning of the preceding dynamic action.<br/><br/>Basically, to make a long story short, as is sometimes the case with great, spontaneous fiction, the creators of the first film hadn't a clue what they created, or how to handle it without breaking it. We suspected as much with Part II, and were it not for rent-seeking Hollywood speculators who by necessity line up to cash in on popular franchises, we would wonder how they could have had the shamelessness to prove as much once and for all in Part III. But even this plan seems to have backfired when Part III took in $30 million less in its opening weekend than originally expected.<br/><br/>And that little piece of trivia inspires me to write this little note to Los Angeles: you no longer have a quasi-monopoly on the film business, and the experience of other brands-turned-commodities (think the broadcast trio, think Kodak, think Microsoft) strongly suggests that once your commanding lead begins to fade, your share can go downhill much faster than you anticipate. The ordinary consumers who pony up for the tickets the sales of which make movies into blockbusters might well be stupid, but they're probably not as stupid as you think. Probably a good time to stop being so dismissive toward your breadbasket, huh? For example, by not re-exploiting a tired franchise."

","First of all, this is the first movie my wife and I have been able to watch together in along time-we have 4 young kids. We have loved the Hangover movies but this one was a real let down. Come on, I could have made a better movie than this. It was by far the worst of the series and I would not recommend watching this if you enjoyed the others. There was only a few moments that made us laugh. I just don't understand how much money that is spent and this being the third installment that the writers, directors and producers could not have come up with a better script. This is called the Hangover and the Guys don't even end up with a hangover. Shame on the guys in charge of this movie for wasting our time and money.

I could come up with better story while sitting on the toilet, writing it out on the back of a cigarette packet.<br/><br/>All the laughs seem to try to be around Mr Chau and Alan, but neither of them made me even let out a little titter, let alone a belly laugh.<br/><br/>If you loved number 2, and have the mental capacity of a goldfish, then this film is for you, anyone else avoid it like the plague."

","Bradley Cooper while sitting in a Tiajuana Bar says ""What the f**k am I watching"". And that sums it up.<br/><br/>If this were a stand alone movie and there was no ""Hangover"" it would be judged as an mediocre action comedy. Because ""Hangover"" set the bar and ""Hangover 2"" lowered the bar, this effort runs a distant third.<br/><br/>After a few jokes and light hearted moments of killing the giraffe, and Alan's father dying which you know from the excellent trailer, things turn. It is hard to remember anything funny once the fighting cocks are introduced. The smothering of one under a pillow set the tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The charm of the first ""Hangover"" is missing. Alan adds a few moments in a forced scene with the child that was the baby in the original.<br/><br/>If shooting people is your idea of funny you might find a laugh. There is one anti-Semitic joke attempt that just thuds. If you miss the wolf pack look for the original on a platform that comes into your home. It is amazing how good this makes the original ""Hangover"" look."

","The Hangover Part III is a funny comedy that concludes the trilogy perfectly. It's not as good as Part I, but it was definitely better than Part II. It's definitely not as bad as the IMDB user ratings suggested it to be. I thought it had funny and comical moments that made me laughed. Sure, some of the humour didn't land well, but it didn't bother me that much. Overall, it's an enjoyable movie that perfectly wraps up the trilogy."

","I thought this one was better than the second sequel but of course, the first one is still the best. This movie doesn't even have a ""hangover"". It's just about the same characters and revolves around Alan. The movie begins in a disgusting way, with Alan decapitating a giraffe. They really shouldn't have showed that.<br/><br/>Any ways, Mr. Chow has stole some money from a gangster and the gangster believes the Wolfpack is the way to find it. He holds Doug hostage and wants the guys to bring him Chow. They track down Chow and rob a house and get back stabbed and then go back to Vegas. And even more hi-jenks ensue. Alan even meets a lady.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, had some funny moments, but I don't think anyone expects it to be as good as the first one."
"callanvass","5","2","3","30 October 2013"," Better than the second, but that's not saying much. I hope this is the end for the series
","Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is off his medication, and continues to disappoint his parents, with his immature ways. Alan's father dies from a heart attack, and The Wolfpack gives Alan an intervention. It doesn't amount to much. They try to take Alan to a mental hospital, but the Wolfpack gets assaulted on the way, and Doug (Justin Bartha) is kidnapped. The Wolfpack is forced to try and track down Mr. Chow, so they can save Doug's life<br/><br/>I loved the first movie. It was hilariously raunchy, with many memorable laughs. Then this series succumbed to sequelitis (my made up word) and ruined the original's impact a little bit. This sequel is far better than the dull second movie, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm exalting this movie. This movie has very little laughs, and it's clearly here to cash in on the franchise's immense success. Much of your enjoyment might depend on how much you enjoy the characters. I can't stand Mr. Chow, and his part seems to increase with each film, much to my chagrin. I hate Ken Jeong himself. He's got this irritating laugh, and I don't understand why people find him so funny. I've also gotten tired of Zach Galifiankis's childish character. He was hysterical in the first movie, and then he starts becoming like a lot of hilarious characters do, a caricature of himself. Am I supposed to find antics, like buying a giraffe, and watching it accidentally get decapitated on a freeway funny? It just seems like they tried to get more and more shocking with the gags as this series went on. I liked the original because it was genuinely funny. This one exploits heart attacks, and funerals, all for the sake of cheap laughs. I don't get offended very easily at all, but I was a bit irked by some of the stuff in this one. Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Bradley Cooper all seem to be on autopilot here, especially Cooper. The charisma that they oozed in the first one is long gone. Bradley Cooper has that boyish charm about him, but he seems to be phoning it in. Zach Galifianakis is the main focus here for the most part, and he becomes a bit exposed. At least his character gets closure, with an admittedly amusing, glorified cameo from Melissa McCarthy. John Goodman is great, and I wish he had more screen time. <br/><br/>Stay tuned for the end credits. It's by far the funniest thing involving this movie. I laughed my ass off. It might mean a sequel, but I truly hope not. If you're a wrestling fan like I am. There is a scene where Melissa McCarthy is watching wrestling on her T.V. You'll probably find CM Punk wrestling John Cena to be a hoot as well<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I'd recommend it over the second one for sure, but its average overall, and lazy as well. Watch the original, and call it a day. The sequels only remind you of how great the original was<br/><br/>5/10"
"alwaysplanb","6","2","3","13 August 2013"," Chow's the only saving grace
","I heard both positive and negative reviews for this movie, and decided to give it a watch. Here's what I think - <br/><br/>Is the movie funny? Yes <br/><br/>Is the movie funny as Hell? No<br/><br/>This time around the directors wanted to reap the popularity of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong)and decided to give him a larger than life role. To tell you the truth, Chow doesn't fail you. Ken Jeong gives the best performance till date in a Hangover movie. However, the key problem is this movie seems a lot focused on Chow and not on Wolf pack. If you have seen the movie, think of it in this way -- How many scenes can you remember from the movie that weren't funny solely because of Chow. Okay so you found few. Now remove all the scenes that were funny for Alan's solo act. Yup, now you can count them on fingers.<br/><br/>I was okay with the plot and all the dark humor. In fact, I liked this new plot. However, what I wanted was -- Wolf Pack takes a lead and Chow be in backseat. Somehow, many (not all)would be feel that this movie is more of a spin off of Hangover movies with Chow taking the lead. I'm not saying that this is solely a Chow movie. What I'm saying is whenever Chow appears, he seems to take the lead and he appears a lot! <br/><br/>On a bright side, the movie manages to string together events of all the three movies (again via Chow)! But the title doesn't seem appropriate as there was hardly any hangover (save for the awesome end credits scene!)<br/><br/>The movie was quite funny, but the wolf pack was hardly funny anymore. If you remove Chow, the movie wouldn't be half as amusing. And thats a disgrace to the Wolf-pack. May be if this was an individual movie (not from Hangover franchise), I'd have liked it a little more."

","While I think Hangover 1 is absolutely a masterpiece and work of genius, but Todd Phillips seems to have a troglodyte's view of people who are...'different'.<br/><br/>I know the movie makes fun of everyone, but it lampoons Alan's character as typical, stereotypical guy who is socially awkward with shelves filled with books who says the most inappropriate stuffs at the wrong time. While all his friends seemed to have hot girlfriends, this idiotic director somehow thinks he can't and will not do better with the most unpalatable match in a cringe worthy lollipop sucking scene.<br/><br/>I would have given it a 3 star but Todd Phillips - it seems without watching the new Joker movie- is carrying on his schtick as if mentally ill tends to be loners, incels, socially awkward...<br/><br/>""But...but...look how FUNNY Alan is!! They made him the hero. He can recall everything in a cool meditative session and jive with kids. He is almost a lovable, fat Buddha whose statue you see in a laundromat.""<br/><br/>Well STOP making him a hero then. Stop trying to make 'them' - the people with vague, subjective illness (and trust me I know everything about it first hand) into some sort of stock character. This director is probably the type who will invite a bunch of Italians and go: ""Hey!! Welcome! Came a bit late. So what do you Italians love? Pasta? Right? Great. I made some meatballs.""<br/><br/>Well STOP ffin trying to make them/these character and these people quote unquote better. You are not helping and only muddling and messing the whole thing up.<br/><br/>They made Alan so desperately begging for friendship that it is just pukeworthy. I know Zach Galafanakias.. or however the hell you spell his name is a total stud and amazingly funny and creative and can help himself as he is a big boy and he doth get all the ladies and Oscar stars... but that is beyond the point.<br/><br/>This moronic idiotic director thoroughly detached from reality and sees everything in frat party black and white eyes as if people like Alan craves and needs attention and are so pitiful and woe-is-I and poor-little-me who will die otherwise without a social touch is disparaging, insulting, degrading to people who are deemed by society as otherwise aberrant and what not.<br/><br/>This guy wouldn't find nuance if it was giant sledgehammer in a donut store. And he gives me extra reason to deliberately hate on the Joker movie and gladly pass it on without getting on with the bandwagon and hype as if we should celebrate HIS distorted view (and albeit a butchered image of the iconic villain) that mentally ill people are loners who needs a little hug.<br/><br/>Finally, without veering onto his new crappy movie and Alan, the movie in general was 'ok'. Had some funny moments, Chow was overdone and over milked and it broke the template which was refreshing. It was a bit dark and had some crass humor but that was to be expected. Would've given it a 3 or a solid 5/6 but this person seems totally out of touch with reality.<br/><br/>Here's an idea Todd Phillips. Maybe go to your local group therapy session of a psychiatry department and find how totally normal we people are and we don't need to have people pitifully patting us ending up ffing an old, fat, dyed hair hag.<br/><br/>Thanks."

"dierregi","1","3","6","9 November 2014"," Deranged Alan steals the movie with disastrous results
","The third and last installment of the Hangover franchise gives far too much screen time to the increasingly obnoxious Alan character. Erroneously described as a ""man-child"", Alan seems to be a borderline narcissist psychopath.<br/><br/>In the opening scene Alan causes the death of a giraffe and a series of motorway car crashes without batting an eyelash. He then proceeds to cause his dad a heart attack. At his dad funeral, Alan states that he'd rather see his mum die, with mum listening horrified. All this is not funny, lack of empathy being a trademark of psychos<br/><br/>Enter the ""Wolf Pack"" and their attempt to get Alan committed. The attempt is thwarted by the return of Mr. Chow and his criminal activities causing another foolish series of events. These events include additional cruelty against animal, abuse of elderly and a very gross ""courting"" scene involving Alan and an overweight, rude shop clerk.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed The Hangover I and II, despite the second being a carbon copy of the first, I found this one completely humorless. The only slightly funny moment is the theft of gold, with a little bit of a twist. Unfortunately, even that half decent scene derails into more violence and stupid behavior.

The least member of the Wolf Pack, Justin Bartha, lucks out yet again by being safely escorted off-screen for most of the duration. Clearly, he has a more influential agent than the other actors.<br/><br/>The movie might have been better - and certainly more honest - if it had just been titled ""The Chow Show,"" since he pretty much takes over every scene he's in - and not always to the movie's or the audience's benefit.<br/><br/>If Hollywood had any mercy at all on its paying customers, it would immediately announce that there are currently no plans for a ""Hangover Part IV,"" nor will there ever be."
"flicklover","2","3","6","16 August 2013"," Todd Phillips owes me a refund!!!!
","When I saw The Hangover in 2009, it was the funniest movie I had seen in years. I went to see it multiple times. It was crude, but very funny, but also there was an odd sweetness in seeing these 3 guys looking for their friend that made it more enjoyable. When the second one came out, I like most of the original's fans was disappointed. It was a carbon copy of the original but set in Thailand. It had its moments but overall it wasn't close to being as funny as the first one. One of the reasons that it wasn't as funny is that the movie felt more ugly, almost cruel. There were laughs but much fewer and far between.<br/><br/>Then on to the 3rd one. Todd Phillips and company had learned from the lessons of the past film right? They would return to at least the tone of the first film and finish the ""trilogy"" on a high note, right? Well the answer is a resounding NO! The Hangover 3 is so off putting and unfunny that I think it shouldn't be called a comedy. The Wolfpack find themselves again in a situation looking for Doug. They meet a drug dealer that is looking for Mr. Chau and tasks them to find him. it all sounds like it would be funny, but it isn't. First I think that the problem with the 2 sequels is that they weren't written by the same team as the original. Second, Ken Jeong as Chau is one of the most annoying character in a long time. In the first one, he stole every scene he was in, but he was not a focus. This film he becomes a main character. Ken Jeong is an actor that is fearless, and can be hilarious, but this character is cruel and unfunny, and is the biggest negative about this film. Bradley Cooper does nothing but react to the craziness, Ed Helms does what he can, and Zach Galifianakis has a few moments as Alan that remind us of why the first one was so good. I don't understand how anyone thought that this was funny. Todd Philips wrote this script and I think he has shown to be a one trick pony. He became a hot director because of the first film, but has done nothing good since, except cash in. There is one moment at the end of the movie that is outrageous and hilarious and definitely proves how unfunny the rest of the film was.<br/><br/>This was in my mind by far the worst film of the summer and one of the worst sequels ever made.<br/><br/>Grade: D- (not an F because of the final scene)"

The movie did not provide any fresh or new ideas, it lacked a good plot and it when it ended I said to myself this is it? I was expecting more out of the movie. It seems like they just rushed to get it done and finished and collected a pay check no passion in the movie at all.

"TheSquiss","2","3","6","5 June 2013"," No hangover, no laughs, no point.
","I attempted to clean my brain out after the dire waste of life that was The Moth Diaries. Only humour would help.<br/><br/>Alas, humour was in very short supply in The Hangover Part III.<br/><br/>So were hangovers, for that matter, but perhaps that's just being picky when there are so many other issues to be riled about. However, I don't care. I lost the will to live, or at least explain my life, somewhere after the tenth minute. This turgid film follows the law of diminishing returns.<br/><br/>The Hangover (2009) was inventive and funny; a true sleeper hit that took the world by storm and entertained enormously.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II (2011) was crass.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part III is just crap.<br/><br/>This time round Doug (Justin Bartha), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) take Alan (Zach Galifianakis) on a road trip to the funny farm as he's losing the plot. And not in a funny way. Rather than being more eccentric, more extreme and more bizarre, Alan is just unpleasant. And, no, that's not funny either. Along the way they get dragged into Marshall's (John Goodman) underworld and must locate his missing millions and the equally missing Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong).<br/><br/>Oh, and Jeong gets his willy out again just so we can be sure it really is that tiny. How I split my sides...<br/><br/>That's pretty much it. The plot of The Hangover Part III is as thin as Patrick Stewart's hair and only marginally more amusing. It never goes anywhere (the plot, not Stewart's hair), revisits old scenes, squeezes in the characters and situations it feels obliged to and bumbles along until the end wanders in from the wings and plonks itself down in front of us.<br/><br/>Rather than give us something new, writer/director Todd Phillips prefers to stick with feeble tradition and dispense with Doug early on. He then rolls in Heather Graham, as Jade, again but forgets that she is a funny and engaging actress and squanders the opportunity to brighten up his dull thud of a film.<br/><br/>To be fair, the obligatory post-film credit scene raised a smile but we shouldn't have to wait 90-odd minutes for the first real bout of humour. The funniest sequences in the actual film (i.e. the bits I smiled at) are in the trailer and were far funnier for being shorter: Alan singing at his father's funeral (dealt with in the first five minutes) and the decapitation of the giraffe (tragically over-egged in the film) both worked far better in their severely edited form.<br/><br/>Todd clearly has yet to learn that less is more. But that's pretty much the way it runs in The Hangover Part III. At least it doesn't have the racist undertones of the second installment.<br/><br/>Take it from me, if you've seen the trailer of The Hangover Part III, you've seen just about everything worthwhile. Save the price of your ticket, buy some beer and watch the original The Hangover again instead.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

Did Bradley Cooper even want to do this movie? He acted as if he was just going through the motions. Melissa McCarthy is showing up everywhere, so I understand why they added her to the movie, but she didn't add anything to it. The movie focused way too much on Chow, portrayed by Ken Jeong, and NOT the ""Wolfpack.""

","I went to the cinema knowing that I shouldn't have high expectations, but I did (unfortunately). First movie ,best comedy of the previous decade; second movie, a very good comeback; the 'epic ending' movie, a really bad attempt to copy the first two. <br/><br/>Alan and Mr Chow were the centrepieces of this story, mostly because there isn't really a story. They try reproducing the stupid events we like 'oh so much' from the first two movies , but they fail completely. I can't blame it on the actors, they did what they could. Can't really blame it on the producer or director either because it's not their fault. The script was poor, the story is simply ...simple, no more could have been done with it. <br/><br/>I loved the beginning, it really was to my expectations but the trailer shows most of the interesting sequences of the movie (unfortunately). The post-ending video, with which we've been made used to see, was great and I truly hope that it represents the start of the 4th Hangover story, otherwise its a bad ending of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Leaving all the bads aside, I am still a fan of Hangover and always will be and even if the movie is not as good as the first two I still recommend it as a get-together way of spending some time while having a couple of good laughs."

","Back in the States after the events of Part II, the friends try to take Alan off to some sort of treatment centre, but get sidetracked by crime boss Marshall who holds them responsible for Mr Chow relieving him of millions of dollars in gold bullion. With Doug held hostage and threatened with imminent death, Phil, Stu and Alan have 3 days to try to find Mr Chow and recover the gold.<br/><br/>As with its predecessors, Part III is built around hugely improbable events which trail along in the wake of the path through life taken by the hugely unbelievable child/man Alan (Zack Galifianiakis), and this is both the the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the series. In the first film, the character was funny and what happened was funny. In Part II, less so. Part III is actually quite dark and, while there are some laughs, mostly this could have been filmed as a straight crime drama. Alan was never credible, but by this point he has started to become tiresome and, with a relative absence of laughs (and several fairly cold on-screen killings), this works against the film. I'm sure this won't affect its box office.<br/><br/>It does at least bring the series to a satisfactory conclusion, and I hope they will resist the temptation to roll out part 4. Do hang on past the first section of credits, and make sure you catch the coda which is by far the funniest part of the film - I thought ""Now THIS is what I wanted to see!""."

Unfortunately Zach has his worst outing of the series.<br/><br/>The film goes straight down faster than you can fall off Ceasar's Palace. <br/><br/>I haven't see Chow like this since Purina. They forgot that America runs on Dunkin.<br/><br/>Where is Mike Tyson? We need him chewing on Chow here. Beheading a Giraffe would be clever except Zach does it for no real reason other than to cause Jeffrey Tambor to drop dead.

I think they have tried to be different with this approach but they have failed badly. <br/><br/>What I like about the first two films is that they are funny, Alan can actually make the audience giggle. In this film he tries too hard and my facial express didn't change one bit.

(spoiler: how could he lift the bags full of gold when he couldn't swing a sledgehammer? ... then. why didn't they immediately use said sledgehammer to drop a wooden door while he was dragging 21 MILLION dollars worth of gold bars to the car?)<br/><br/>The movie doesn't hold true to the title, which is the format of the first two. Actually, the title is misleading in and of itself. It's never been about hangovers. It's been about black-outs. ... But that isn't the point. This movie didn't have a black-out scene until the very end, and I refuse to accept that I watched that whole thing as just a build up to that final scene. (another spoiler coming up) Speaking of that final scene: if you know anyone who ever got a boob job, and you were around during that first week, you were probably watching the end scene with a raised eyebrow. It is clear that they were trying to out- do themselves from the second one, but ... do it in a way that makes any sort of sense. That was just dumb.<br/><br/>I didn't find the 2 fat people mating funny. It was just awkward and ... whatever. Two social rejects who talk horribly to their mothers and have Type-2 diabetes. Not comedic gold to me.<br/><br/>I gave it a 2 because it could have been worse. Not by much, but I DID chuckle when they realized they were going back to Vegas.

But anyway, now they try something different and people are mad, because it's not a rehash of the previous movies.

","Well, as a good cinema fan I get very disappointed with the Part III. Part I and II were really great, excellent, original and they deserved a big 10 for elevated the comedy films to a new and higher level of quality. But Part III that's nothing to do with the truly essence of Hangover film concept. For me the best scene of this Part III is after the first credits in the end! Can you believe in that? That's a scene truly Hangover! I'm sorry to the producers but the rest of the film is bad with only a few little things of the genuine Hangover because there weren't no surprise scenes, it was very forced jokes. They could keep the same story and do a better End with this team."
"TyRawrrnosaurus","5","2","4","26 May 2013"," Not the Trilogy we Asked for, but the Ending we Deserve
","If the movie trailers and the posters live up to their promise, this is the end for The Wolfpack as we know it. Not disliking Part II myself, as much as everyone else, I still held reservations against Part III. Going in with low expectations, I can say that The Hangover Part III makes up for the disastrous Part II, but comes nowhere near the level of the original.<br/><br/>Breaking formula, there is no hangover this time, but there is another missing person. Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) are reunited once again to mourn the loss of Alan's dad (Jeffery Tambor). Alan's outrageous antics and almost cartoonish behavior have elevated to the point that his friends and family make the executive decision to banish him to a special home until he is deemed fit to reenter society.<br/><br/>Before The Wolfpack can even make it to Arizona with Alan they are ambushed by Marshall, a drug kingpin who has direct connections to ""Black"" Doug (Mike Epps) from The Hangover. Six degrees of separation brings Marshall to reveal that Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) has stolen $21 million from him. Marshall kidnaps ""White"" Doug and forces Phil, Stu, and Alan on a merry chase to find Mr. Chow and his money.<br/><br/>The tone is set in a much darker place. A real life is in serious peril with Marshall threatening to kill Doug unless they bring him Chow. This plot development is a fantastic way to tie all three movies together, but it rarely finds a way to works itself in with the subplot of Alan needing mental help. Drifting away from the trouble with Alan to focus on finding Chow, there is never a feeling of urgency to anything that makes us care for Doug's safety, which ultimately lessens Alan's story.<br/><br/>As Part III begins as a cry for help from Alan, we never see a progression of his change until the very end when he meets Melissa McCarthy. Her scene with Alan makes more sense as a gag than an actual instrument to influence the character. This moment is way too forced and is resolved too quickly. However, it is nice to see Phil and Stu bring a calm balance to the overly exhausted random acts of words that spew out of Alan's mouth. These actors have a great chemistry together, but nothing in this story helps grow these characters from what we know of them already.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Chow is a greater force to be reckoned with this time around and you can actually tell how threatening and sly he can be. And although Jeong works well in Part III, his atrocious accent and Asian caricature is still unbearable. John Goodman is a decent commanding villain, but is never given much to do. What irritates me about his threat is that since they are in the U.S. The Wolfpack never bother to call the cops or are given an ultimatum by Marshall, which lacks tension.<br/><br/>For a sequel that no one really asked for, Part III does a reasonable job at clinging on to audiences that have not lost faith in the franchise. Unfortunately it was an uphill battle from the beginning after Part II left its mark. You could, however, skip Part II and hardly miss a beat aside from one joke. Almost every element of the first film is re-introduced in the third to bring the trilogy together in a neat little package. Even little Carlos makes an appearance, and it happens to be the most genuine scene in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is visually slick, like any under Todd Phillips' belt, he uses every ounce of his budget to his advantage. With what comedy there is, the timing from every actor is just as smooth as ever. Again, Phillips makes use of a killer soundtrack and fits it well into each scene. There is a rendition of ""Hurt"" from Nine Inch Nails that would make the band cringe, but it is timed perfectly for this film. ""Dark Fantasy"" by Kanye West, ""Down in Mexico"" by The Coasters, and many others work in favor of the film keeping up a high energy.<br/><br/>Helms, Galifianakis, and Cooper have gotten their character dynamics as The Wolfpack down to a science. As much as it hurts to see these actors fill the shoes of these characters again – because it feels like they're in it for the paycheck – they all do a great job running through the motions. I did have a good chuckle here and there, but most of those moments have been easily forgotten. There are some clever elements that I enjoyed, but for the most part this movie is bland and fails to elevate the franchise one inch.<br/><br/>And even though the stakes are much higher this time, it never really appears like anyone cares about the safety of Doug and his kidnapping is one more annoyance they have to suffer through to find a happy ending. Doug's kidnapping is basically used as a running gag at this point to keep him out of the film. What I would have liked to see is for Todd Phillips to completely depart from this franchise, maintain the same rules, and try something daring to give us something fresh for these characters to do.<br/><br/>Fans of The Hangover won't be entirely disappointed by Part III as much as they were with Part II. By no means does it reach the same caliber of the first, but it is coherent enough to work as an subpar sequel. At no point does Part III feel like an enjoyable farewell experience, and that's a shame. The actors make this film entertaining enough to get by, but The Hangover Part III never succeeds in being anything more than a way to cleanly tie up loose ends."
"paulsrobinson","7","2","4","23 May 2013"," A decent ending, but please no more.
","Did the First Hangover need a sequel, the answer is no. But we have two and i have thoroughly enjoyed both sequels. The second i found very funny but did not love as it was a repeat of the original. But Part 3 definitely goes in it's own direction. It may not have given me the belly laughs of the others. But i was giggling for most of the film. <br/><br/>The story contains, this time NO hangover, NO piecing together of the night before. what happens is the Wolfpack are taking Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who is off his med's to a treatment facility. When they are accosted by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman) and the returning black Doug (Mike Epps) , and they force the Wolfpack to find Mr Chow (Ken Jeong) who has escaped prison in Thailand. And kidnap Doug (Justin Bartha) for insurance. <br/><br/>It is refreshing that the story is different on this occasion. Going in much darker and much more dangerous places. Zach Galifianakis is excellent as the overgrown spoilt man-child Alan. With Galifianakis and Director Todd Phillips taking the character in even stranger and more awkward directions. Alan is now effectively the lead in the movie with Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms having surprisingly little to do. But react to Mr Chow and Alan's antics, and give typical eye rolls at the situation. Also this time the film adds a little more heart to the proceedings with a minor characters death, and a intimate moment involving. In usual scene stealing form Melissa McCarthy. <br/><br/>The Character Mr Chow in this does become almost the second lead in the film, and I personally was never that bothered about the character and found him a funny nuisance for the gang. I know some really really hated him and his increased prominence in this may alienate some people from liking the movie. Also I was disappointed in the lack of use of Helms and Cooper. Who are both talented comic actors and also grounded the films comedy in response to the craziness of the other characters. Credit has to be given to Justin Bartha in possibly the most thankless role in any franchise in movie history. <br/><br/>In the end this is a decent way to end the series and gives the characters a decent send off. Supplying enough silly laughs to make this worth a viewing. Stick around for a funny bonus scene, which hopefully is just the last hurrah and not the indication of a fourth."

","Contrary, seemingly, to everybody else, I didn't care much for the first two ""Hangover"" films - the sheer volume and all the charging around had them feel like more was going on than actually was... It was to my tremendous surprise, then, that I took to the third film of the trilogy, which is certainly enjoyable if you try to put the first two films out of your mind and enjoy it for the rather daft causality driven thriller that it is. If you gave it a tweak here and there; kept the overarching plot devices and other content, ""The Hangover: Part 3"" becomes a little like an Elmore Leonard story or one of Westlake's 'Dortmunder' novels - luckless characters on the wrong side of some even worse people depicted as trying to get out of the jackpot whilst having a hard time obeying the law.<br/><br/>The film, unlike the other two, chooses not to revolve the story around the aftermath of a night of drinking - the characters here are not relegated to attempting to piece together the remnants of a botched boozy fiesta from behind the veneer of a seemingly incoherent set of clues. Rather, the film grants them sobriety and lucidity: they know exactly what the score is and are otherwise in a state of able-mindedness to go about fixing it. The 'Wolfpack' remains unchanged: Bradley Cooper; Ed Helms; Justin Bartha and Zach Galifianakis are back playing Phil, Stu, Doug and Alan, respectively. In sticking to tradition (sort of), they lose Doug and even, for a brief few scenes, reacquire a familiar face played by Mike Epps. <br/><br/>The reason for Doug's disappearance this time is the very real and very dangerous threat of a gangster named Marshall, who puts the wind up our established foursome and is played by John Goodman with satisfying gusto. For reasons not otherwise entirely convoluted, events dating right back to the first film linked to an off-screen a drug deal one of the Wolfpack was inadvertently involved in have caught up with them, and they must find the irresistible force of international man of mystery Lesley Chow (Ken Jeong) in order to put things right. <br/><br/>Much of this is a cue for mayhem, particularly when Chow himself tricks the gang into stealing something for him which they really ought not have done, but mayhem which just seems to be under a tighter rein that before. Perhaps it is because I am too often a sucker for films such as ""City of Industry"" when they come along that I enjoyed this Part Three, which essentially depicts (sort of) the aftermath of a heist and those on the wrong end of a betrayal during said heist who then strive to get their 'share' back. Broadly speaking, American critic Christy Lemire is right when she writes that the film ""...runs a different sort of risk by going to places (different) than its predecessors, both artistically and emotionally. It dares to alienate the very audience that made 'The Hangover' the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time."" <br/><br/>In a move which should, for all intents and purposes, have made me dislike it even more than the first two, the film combines the elements of its predecessors: the espionage and action-orientated fluff of the second, which is interwoven, partly, with the locale and the players of the first. The tone seems more grown up - there is more at stake; none of our characters is having fun in this particular adventure. Gone is that sense of it being a bit of a romp or a bit of a laugh, and it stays on a track that stops it from veering off into the nightmarish territory of the second. In a crucial moment which represents, more broadly, the maturing of the series, the film dares to have its characters express both disgust and exasperation when their misadventure forces them to roll back into Las Vegas to find what they're looking for. <br/><br/>The film is far from anything fantastic; it is no tremendous experience, neither moving nor affecting. It possesses little-to-no especially attentive character study beyond the crew's lamenting of being forced into confronting old hunting grounds and crossing paths with old enemies: Galifianakis' character opens the film with a sequence you will not have previously witnessed involving a sports car and a giraffe - from here, his day gets worse when he suffers a bereavement at home and then faces being carted off to a psychiatric institution. In terms of individual film characters having a bad day, rarely does it get much worse. But where does any of it go? By the end, he is still a liability. Has he changed? We can't say, as the film terminates just as a new chapter in his life opens up. If there is never again another ""Hangover"" film, it would not bother me in the slightest, although, to my minute shame, I did enjoy this one."

","Whereas the second 'Hangover' movie was more of a rehash of the first adventure than a true sequel to it, this third 'Hangover' entry does some decidedly different things with mixed yet mostly positive results. Most notably, the film taps into several of the original's subplots as the drug dealer's unseen boss from the first film gets a face with John Goodman in a performance that delightfully references 'The Big Lebowsk'. The fact that Goodman decides to hold on to Justin Bartha (Doug) while forcing the rest of the Wolf Pack to work for him never quite feels like the right move (a more ambitious sequel would have had Doug finally share his friends' adventures) but there is little disputing how well the three main players interact with each other and Ken Jeong gets more screen time than ever before, as well as scattered character growth. Mike Epps and Heather Graham also make welcome returns to the story with the film possessing some truly touching moments as the friends visit Graham's baby from the first film, now at an age at which he can walk and talk. The less said about Melissa McCarthy's extended cameo here, the better though, and some gags (giraffe) push the boundaries of good taste, but in general there is quite a lot here to like with the film actually building on the events of the first two movies rather than just aping them."

","I'm usually not a fan of comedies that have trilogies but this one was funny. This is an Alan (Zach Galifianakis) centric film and if you didn't think he was funny in the first two Hangovers, then you won't like him in this film. I understand why some people were not a fan and its mainly because the plot was darker than the first two films. *spoiler alert* there were at least three deaths in the movie. Also, Bradley Cooper was very serious throughout the movie. I believe it's because he's done so many dramas back to back that it's hard to snap back into comedy. Plus, Stu (Ed Helms) didn't have any craziness (i.e. missing a tooth, face tattoo, marrying/ sleeping with strippers) happening to him either (unless you count the ending credits). <br/><br/>I should rephrase this, the dialogue in this film is funny but the scenes were not set up to be funny. For example, there was not a lot of physical comedy nor craziness but the way that Alan and the other cast members interacted with each other was hilarious. In the first film, they had a hangover and that whole movie was them retracing their steps. In this film, it picks up from a small part in the first film and *spoiler alert* there isn't a hangover, they aren't retracing their steps but they are using clues to track people down in order to save Doug. <br/><br/>This film has good cameos, and the writers do a good job with tying up loose ends and concluding everything. I highly doubt there will be a fourth film but if there is, I doubt Bradley or Ed would be in it because their performance seemed like their heart wasn't into it like the first film."

","When The Hangover came out, I thought it was just another sex comedy movie, not realizing how funny the movie was. Here with number 3, this isn't a bad Hangover to end the trilogy, though I guess a 4th, wouldn't go astray somewhere down the track. In ill favor of a lot of other people's responses, I found this one the funniest, though I guess there were certain bits lacking in it to the first. Looking back on the third one, the only one I saw at the cinema, me and my friend, the only two at this session, I would kind of pass it off as kind of cheesy cheesy, but this has everything, some twists, some rather serious moments, hand gliding, and many many laugh's. Check out Allan's operatic voice, an undiscovered talent, or the unforgettably priceless start when Alan's illegally hauling a Giraffe. I won't tell you what happens to the Giraffe, but it's not pleasant. Why transporting Allen to a mental facility, on the count of him being a recluse, sponger, or just being a plain 42 year old idiot, The Wolf Pack encounter some trouble with some big guns headed by John Goodman, an actor who just keeps impressing me now. They are after Mr Chow, who's escaped from a tight prison (ha ha) where they kidnap one of the pack (have a guess which one) so we must find Mr Chow. Not an easy thing. I couldn't understand why so many people panned this one, honestly, I was querulous. Alan even finds his love, and to the final goodbye between Mr Chow and Alan, almost brought a tear to my eye. If a Hangover fan and haven't seen it, don't be put off, though I still know you gonna see it, or get around to it, and you should. Too, another wedding awaits."

","The third and final installment in the Hangover franchise has to be looked at as a slight disappointment. Due to the lack of a positive critical response for the last film, director Todd Phillips decided to change the formula. I think that may have been a mistake, because I loved the first two films because they were incredibly hilarious. While there are some funny scenes in this film, this is more action-packed and the jokes are far and between. It was nice to see everyone back and while the film is entertaining at times, it doesn't live up to the first two films.<br/><br/>Phillip's film has the Wolfpack returning for one more adventure. Alan is suffering from a mental crisis and the rest of the crew decide to get him help. While on the road, they are taken by a crime lord named Marshall who is punishing the crew from the events of the first film. Now they must capture an escaped Chow or else one of their own will be killed.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, depending on who you look at. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms continue being great as their respective characters of Phil and Stu. Zack Galifinakis is beginning to be annoying at times. He is funny at certain points, but his antics are growing old. The same can be said for Ken Jeong. Funny during some points, annoying in others. John Goodman makes a great villain, but he could have used more screen-time. Also, Melissa McCarthy makes a small cameo and she was pretty funny.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hangover Three is not a bad film, but it lacks in comedy and real depth compared to the first two. People complained about the same formula, but I really liked it and it would have been a lot funnier that way. Some of the noticeably funny scenes involved a giraffe and I'll give them credit for that. It's a good movie at times, but it's certainly mediocre for the rest. I rate this film 6.5/10."

","OK, I'm not a really big fan of the hangover series but I like it for the entertainment it provides to the audience.let's coffee top the point:<br/><br/>This movie started off like any other typical comedy movie, wait did I say comedy? Well that's not actually the word to use here. Being a part of the hangover series one would definitely expect comedy but I must say this movie made me think thrice whether it belongs to that genre or not...This movie was centered more on the characters and action that it barely seemed to belong to the series, they tried to use a different formula which the character didn't get a hangover...reminds me, this movie should even be called the hangover part 3 , maybe just The Return of Chow or something.<br/><br/>However, if seen from another point of view than a comedy(which is quite difficult) , the movie doesn't seem as bad as it is made to look...if we can forget the previous installments, then this movie could be enjoyable as well. Something that bugged me was that, Mr.Todd Phillips was trying to create something memorable or nostalgic but it didn't quite seem to work out(their return to Vegas, jade, Carlos etc) . It's just not that bad as it seems, nothing great to blow your mind but just a few laughs with nothing new to offer but entertainment and satisfaction. Watch out for the great performance of Zach galifianakis, John Goodman and Melissa McCarthy."

He had high expectations for this movie, but when I went to the cinema to see it, hoping for more, do not say that was not good, but I missed most of history argument. The film film still managed to get the whole room to laugh, not to mention the actors that are a spectacle. But I was curious to know what happened at the end. The actors are comic, where during the whole movie make us laugh, the story is very basic, but not counting on it makes us laugh, Chinese is a mesh, which makes us laugh so stupid, and I am just writing all gibberish to fill sausage, because it is ten lines need to be able to pass it, if it has some connection.

","The first surprise about ""The Hangover III"" : there is no hangover. Secondly, ""The Hangover III"" is not very funny. What happened? A little Mr. Chow and Alan go a long way. And there is way too much of Ken Jeong and Zack Galifianakis in H3. Director Todd Phillips strategically miscalculates focusing them in the foreground instead of the back. I actually thought ""The Hangover II"" set in Thailand was hysterical, even though it was criticized for being a clone of ""The Hangover"". ""The Hangover"" was inspired originality—one of the funniest movies ever. Amazing Bradley Cooper returns as solid Phil. He is the straight man relegated to saying, ""What the f***?"" Granted seeing nominated Cooper in ""Silver Linings Playbook"", he has outgrown this, and I acknowledge his loyalty. Anyway, I am in complete agreement with Phil.<br/><br/>""The Hangover III"" comes full circle and concludes the trilogy in Las Vegas. Mercifully, what happens in Vegas should stay there. In a bizarre twist H3 is more an action movie than comedy—very disappointing and totally baffling. This is not the comic equivalent of ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Promisingly, John Goodman enters as mob heavy Marshall who again takes kidnapping steady Doug (Justin Bartha). This vendetta relates to Mr. Chow (Jeong) stealing money from H1. Philips and Craig Mazin's erratic script douses whatever possible hysterics. Stu (steady Ed Helms) is not the butt of the thematic joke. Heather Graham reprises as Jade, the stripper single Mom, but her talents are not at all leveraged. We are mostly left with Alan and Chow's bewildering bromance. Again, this gets old after about 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Dark comedy abounds in the beginning with a gruesome giraffe highway sequence and a really disturbing family death all surrounding clueless Alan (Galifianakis). This summons The Wolfpack to intervene on Alan's behalf and well-being. The tragic flaw is that Alan is vastly unsympathetic. The best narrative consequence of it all is Cassie played by uncompromisingly funny Melissa McCarthy. H3 does have its moments particularly with Alan's man-crush on Phil. In a ridiculous exchange Alan ask Phil about his shirt, ""Is that from Diesel?"" Risking his life scaling down the hotel balcony, Alan takes a Smartphone photo of Phil. Phil asks, ""Did you get that?"" Too bad there isn't more of that instead of chases and shooting.<br/><br/>The funniest scene of H3 occurs at the very end. Stu is the object of a visual joke that is laugh out loud hysterical. Seems to me that should have been the premise of ""The Hangover III"", where the Boys seem completely at home. What a squandered opportunity. I guess we can take solace that they were funny before."

","When the closing credits hit, I felt cheated and sad. The magic that surrounded the first 2 films was non existent and the closure given to the series was deflating.<br/><br/>Relying on Allen's immaturity and continual involvement with Chow, The Hangover Part 3 left out the fun and over focused itself on transforming Allen into a real man. From staging an intervention at the start, to ending the series with his wedding, Part 3 left creativity at the door. <br/><br/>Chow Breaks free from prison, and a villain from season 1 emerges to kidnap the Wolfpack with the hopes of leading them to Chow. With the Kidnapping of Doug, the remaining 3 must journey from Tijuana, Mx back to Vegas to capture Chow and save their friend. <br/><br/>Departing from Part 1 and 2's amnesia adventures, Part 3 was spoon fed to the viewer. The mystery was simply missing. Chow himself plays a more central role and the movie is dependent on every action he takes. This intimate view of Chow spoils the character's idiosyncrasies, and lowers his value along with the entire movie. Any bond or trust between the wolfpack at this point has been sadly broken at the expense of having a plot for Part 3. When Chow escapes death to kill Marshall, the movie quickly ends without a party or a tribute to what the series, for the most part, represented. <br/><br/>With all the post credit pictures, Mike Tyson special appearances and wildness that the first two films embodied, watching part 3 felt like a never ending Hangover. The writing on the wall is clear. There will not be a Part 4."

","I mainly watched this film because I loved the first one, enjoyed the second and I'm a huge Bradley Cooper fan. Don't get me wrong I thought the film was good, but most people expected it to be bad, which if you compare it to the first it was. <br/><br/>There were a few really funny moments like when Phil and Alan were climbing down into Chow's hotel room, but none were hugely ""laugh out loud"" funny. Most of the best jokes were shown in the trailer, therefore spoiled for the movie. <br/><br/>The best part was definitely the ending. It ended with a montage of the ""Wolf-Pack"" walking in slow motion with the song ""Dark Fantasy"" by Kanye West playing in the background. The song has been played in all 3 films, so it helped connect them together and it went well with the film. <br/><br/>I also thought the scene between Alan and ""Carlos"" was quite cute, especially when he put the sunglasses on him which if you remember the first film you'd recognise as the same ones he put on him as a baby.<br/><br/>A lot of people think they should make a 4th even though this was supposed to be the ""epic finale"" to the trilogy because it left you hanging a bit after Alan got married,they didn't really explain things very well.<br/><br/>Rated 7/10, for the as usual great acting, and a few funny scenes but just not as good as the standards set by the first one."

","2009's The Hangover was the surprise hit of that summer, and it went on to be the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all. Then in 2011 came The Hangover Part II, which wasn't boring and had a few moments but was a bit lazy. Basically, the writers assumed that audiences would be fine with watching the same movie all over again, but set in Thailand. We were not fine. <br/><br/>Now, two years later, we have The Hangover Part III, which is entirely different from the first two. Yet, people still hate it. I, on the other hand, am the rare person who didn't hate it.Yes, it isn't quite as funny as the original, and it is sort of missing that craziness that gave the first one energy. Instead, Part III is a funny, occasionally hilarious and still mildly wild adventure that ties the series up nicely.<br/><br/>This time, the movie is not centered around a wedding. Alan(Zach Galifianakis) is sort of going crazy. He is off his meds, his father (Jeffery Tambor) just died, along with a giraffe he just bought. So, his friends Phil, Stu, and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Justin Bartha) and family give him an intervention, and soon the Wolf Pack is on the road to a rehab center in Arizona.<br/><br/>But the trip comes to a halt when a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman) kidnaps Doug and forces the gang to track down Chow (Ken Jeong), who apparently owes Marshall a large amount of money. But if you know Chow, then you know that hunting him down is not as easy as it sounds.<br/><br/>I laughed a good bit during The Hangover Part III, but yet I did find some notable flaws. It is a little too safe, but that's fine. I admire what director Todd Philips did this time around. I realize that it truly is hard to give the people what they want. Well, screw them. I had a good time.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part III is just as fun as the original. But I wish there was less of Chow. In the first film, Chow was hilarious. Then by the next two movies i just got tired of him. Also, why must Justin Bartha miss out on all of the fun? Bartha, who was the comic relief in the two National Treasure movies, is actually talented. But yet in these Hangover movies they always bench him. It just sort of bothers me.<br/><br/>As I said, it's not as good as the first one. But it is a step-up from the uncreative second one. I thought it was a nice addition to a series that needed a boost. It's not the funniest movie of the year so far, but I liked it. Sue me, I don't care. I had a good time at The Hangover Part III. <br/><br/>For what it is, it' worth seeing. I'm sure that everyone else will disagree. But for the record, not every comedy has to be absolutely hilarious every twenty seconds. When people watch comedies, they over-look the actual quality of the movie itself (myself included occasionally). But with this one, I judged it from both, and both worked. See it for yourself. I liked it.<br/><br/>B"
"odderah","5","0","0","27 June 2013"," The Missing Ingredients
","The first installment of The Hangover trilogy was hailed as the ultimate guy's movie of the year 2009. After watching the final installment of the trilogy, I have reason to believe it will not be the ultimate guys' movie this time round because it is missing a few ingredients that we got used to from the first two movies:<br/><br/>1. No Hangovers: None of the characters in H3 actually experiences a hangover and I think this works against the movie. It is just like calling a movie ""Penguins of Madagascar"" yet the movie has no penguins and no scenes from the serene island of Madagascar. In the first two installments, the characters suffer from a serious hangover and they try to reconstruct the events of the previous night to help cover up their mess: many guys find themselves in this situation from time to time and that is why we could relate to these movies.<br/><br/>2. No Physical Injuries: Unlike H1, where Stew plucked out his own tooth and Doug got baked in the sun when his friends carried him with his mattress to the rooftop and forgot him there, or H2 where Stew got a tattoo (which we learn he had to have removed in H3), Allan shaved off his hair and Stew's brother in law lost a finger, there are no injuries worth noting in H3. Dudes get injured and carry such scars with pride, its part of being a man.<br/><br/>3. No animals: Apart from a few seconds with Allan's giraffe and Chao's cockfighting chicken, H3 lacks significant roles for animal characters. H1 had Mike Tyson's tiger and H2 had a drug dealing monkey which liked to smoke. Guys like animals, a man-cave is incomplete without a stuffed animal hanging on the wall, we name our teams after animals (Chicago Bulls, Super Eagles, Raptors, Cubs.The Wolfpack.!)<br/><br/>4. No Mike Tyson: The first reality check in H1 occurs when Allan gets knocked out cold by Mike Tyson as Mike sings to Phil Collins' ""I feel it coming in the air"". And in H2, he sings at Stew's wedding and we learn that he has remained in contact with Allan. Furthermore, Stew gets the same tattoo across his face that is a Mike Tyson trademark. I think that most guys are boxing fans and having a boxing legend like Mike Tyson boosts the movie's credentials as a guy movie.<br/><br/>5. No Photo Slideshow: Both H1 and H2 have a segment at the end that features a slide show of photos they took the night before. The photos are then deleted after one viewing to avoid trouble with their spouses. They could have at least shown Allan's bachelor party as a slide show. Which leads to my last point:<br/><br/>6. No Bachelor Party for Allan: I believe that Allan was the real star of The Hangover trilogy and it was his blunders that made the story in the first place. The first and second part of the story revolve around bachelor parties, which is usually the most unforgettable night of a soon-to-be-husband's life, but the most interesting character in the whole story doesn't get one. I think most guys will find this disappointing.<br/><br/>That is why I say it will be hard for the movie to cut it as the ultimate guy's movie for 2013. Other movies like The internship (Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson) might beat it to the top."

What's funny in small doses isn't necessarily funny in bigger ones. At least the guy isn't annoying. Also, I didn't think Zach or Melissa had any chemistry here.

","The first Hangover movie, released in 2009, was a breath of fresh air in the comedy genre. It was clever, funny and original, and people really seemed to enjoy it. Since the first one was such a big success, it was obvious that it would spawn some sequels. So, The Hangover Part II was released. The second Hangover movie was almost identical to its predecessor – it had the same formula, same setup, the same narrative structure, the same plot points; even though it was considerably less funny, it was also still an OK movie. The third movie completely disregards the famous franchises' formula and goes in a different direction.<br/><br/>This time there is no wedding, no a bachelor party, no party, nor do the members of the Wolf Pack get drunk/high. This time the plot is very straightforward – Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) have to find Chow (Ken Jeong). Apparently, Chow stole 40 million dollars worth of gold plates from some mafia guy named Marshall (John Goodman), and so in return Marshall kidnapped Doug (Justin Bartha) and blackmailed Phil, Stu and Alan to find and bring him Chow, or else he will kill Doug.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie lacked the elements that made the first Hangover so good. Of course, the classic Hangover formula needed some experimenting but if you completely abandon the ideas that made the first movie feel so fresh and original, there is a decent chance you'll just end up stuck with an unoriginal, bland movie. Which is exactly what happened to The Hangover Part III. In a nutshell, Hangover Part III pretty much fails as a sequel to The Hangover. But hey, that doesn't mean that Hangover Part III fails as a movie, does it? Well, sort of. First of all, Hangover Part III is – once again unlike the first two movies – a much more action/thrill-packed movie. By no means would I call it an action movie, but it definitely shows overtones of one. I didn't really like these kind of scenes since they didn't seem vital to the plot and they were far from spectacular. Second of all, Hangover Part III isn't that funny: I chuckled here and there but the jokes were far from the first Hangover. So I'm not quite sure whether I would give this movie a passing grade. It wasn't terrible but I feel I could have spent 100 minutes of my time doing something better – like watching some other movie.<br/><br/>But what do I know? The audience, whom I watched the movie with, really seemed to enjoy it as they were laughing quite often. However, in the credits there is a scene that shows the Wolf Pack waking up from what is implied to be yet another bachelor party. Of course, the setup is classic – they don't know what happened the night before and are shocked by the mayhem that is surrounding them. This scene was very short and the audience laughed more during those few minutes than throughout the whole movie. Their reactions portrayed my emotions towards this movie very accurately.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

","The Wolf Pack is Back! Four years after the 2009 film ""The Hangover"" that set the trend of bachelors party gone awry, which was in turn copy- pasted in a Bangkok sequel in 2011; now comes the grand finale to the trilogy! <br/><br/>Contrary to what one would expect, the story has no bachelor parties, no one gets drugged or goes missing and there are no tigers or monkeys. Just the good old bunch of three best friends reprising their roles and the amusingly criminal Chow.<br/><br/>The film opens with Chow staging a prison break in Bangkok. Cut to Alan who off his meds and letting his mind take off on its own as he grabs headlines for causing a highway accident. His stressed father passes away and his family decides to put Alan into a rehab in Arizona. Obviously, the duty falls on Phil, Stu & Doug to drive him there. <br/><br/>Enroute, they are intercepted by a drug lord Marshall and Doug is taken hostage. In return, they are told to find Chow and retrieve the gold that the latter stole from Marshall. The film then turns into an adventure-comedy as they find Chow and participate in a heist, which predictably goes wrong. <br/><br/>Since we know that the other films in the series have happy endings, the third one too ends with everyone being happy. But, it is the journey that makes the film interesting. While not being an outright comedy, it dabbles with deliberate drama to deviate from the predictable styles which marred the second film. And they succeed at that.<br/><br/>Shock value, which was the key theme in the series has also been toned down. There are no mind-numbing 'Oh My God moments' like the photographs in the credits we are used to either. By the way, if it is not much of a spoiler, Alan finds his true love in the end! But well, yeah, be prepared for one surprise from Stu in the end. <br/><br/>With the same star cast, the acting efforts are the same and convincing enough. Zach Galifianakis is definitely the funniest of them all, playing the man-child we are so used to seeing him as. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms & Ken Jeong as Phil, Stu & Chow do a good job. But, it would have been a nice experiment a bigger role for Justin Bartha and allow his character to develop. And, Heather Graham makes a brief appearance.<br/><br/>Verdict: The second film had definitely disappointed us by aping the first. But the film makers have shaped up their act with the third installment. 'The Hangover Part III' is not extremely funny as one would have wanted but still qualifies as a decent finale."

Meanwhile, the infamous Leslie Chow has escaped from prison and has a long list of enemies, including a particularly ruthless one named Marshall (Goodman) who demands the Wolfpack find Chow or else suffer dire consequences. Contrived, protracted, and barely funny, this is only likely to satisfy viewers who enjoy seeing that same zany group of characters from the first two films reunited for more strange shenanigans.

","When ""Hangover II"" came out some people we're pretty angry about it, mainly because they felt like they had paid for the same movie twice. Same plot, same jokes, same ""surprising"" twists, I still enjoyed it but at the same time I wasn't blind for its lack of creativity. Luckily, the third one is very different. Somewhat less luckily, this movie is just all over the place. The other ones have clichéd plot(s), but at least they were as coherent as this genre is ever going to get and had a clear structure to them. This one well, even after you've seen it entirely you're still not sure what the hell it was about. It just doesn't gel that well, it's very fragmentaric. On the other hand though, it does do something that's rare for a part 3 these days: it actually adds something to the franchise. Not only does it have a lot of funny new set pieces (the burglary is definitely one of the best parts of the entire franchise), but it even sorta develops its characters and provides some very decent closure. I particularly liked what they did with Alan, he isn't just a gimmick anymore but actually tries to change his ways here and there (if he feels like it, obviously). The ambiguous relation between the Wolfpack and Mr. Chow is also explored very well, the question whether Chow is a friend or foe pretty much fuels whatever little story there is. I also liked the throwbacks to the previous ones, this can be seen as a standalone movie but probably shouldn't. And lastly, John Goodman is incredibly under-used but at least he's there for a brief while to be hilarious as ever. If you hated the other ones, you'll probably hate this. If you liked the other ones, well I honestly don't know. All I can say is I quite enjoyed it."
"ironhorse_iv","6","0","0","3 June 2013"," Time to sober up, for this film is no longer a hangover.
","While this film still has the same title, it's not the hangover formula that people love or hate. This one is a little bit more nausea. Two years after the events at Bangkok, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) escape out of jail and now it's the job for the Wolfpack members: Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis), Stu Price (Ed Helms) and Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) to find him or Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) will get murder by the ruthless drug mob leader Marshall (John Goodman) wanting Chow. The movie feels less than a comedy, and more of a dark humor crime drama. I know director Todd Phillip took a lot of criticize for 2011's The Hangover Part II for recycling the same plot as 2009's The Hangover. Now he is getting criticize for delivers a film so different from the first two, which in my opinion, I'm pretty OK, with, but I think he forgot to add more humor to it. I didn't see much people laughing in the theater at any of the jokes. I don't think a lot of people were laughing at all the animal deaths in the film such as giraffe, the chickens, or the dogs. There was an even a jab at PETA. The point is, the killing of animals just kills the mood - it's mean spirited. I know it's weird in a way that people care more about a dog dying in a film, than a guy getting shot in the film, but in my opinion, the animal killing joke was just awful. Still, I was kinda depressed that two of the original characters met their maker in the film. The movie pretty much suck the fun out of the room, by having endless amount of death and violence on the screen. I would have thought the film would be funnier since giving more screen time to both Alan and Chow, but it wasn't. Most of the humor in the film was dumb man-child humor or crude jokes. Both of them were just annoying to the point that I stop caring about what happen to him. I just want them to go away for good. I would have like more smart jokes. Even if it had smart jokes, it was still missing something. I don't know, maybe like 'an actual hangover'. I do think the movie strayed too far from the formula of the original Hangover. I do have to say, the post-credit sequence does deliver that for the fans, but it might have been too short and too late. Having them return to Las Vegas was pretty awesome and work as a nostalgia feeling for long term fans of the comedy series. It would be fun to have more of that, with another other original characters returning such as Officer Franklin (Rob Riggles) or Mike Tyson. At less, they got Heather Graham to reprised her role as Jade the Stripper and Mike Epps as 'Black Doug' even if they are the two characters in the original film, I didn't want. News character like Cassie (Melissa McCarthy) and Marshall had too short of a screen time to make the film any funnier. I know Melissa McCarthy and John Goodman could have milk more into their scenes. I was just waiting for Walter from 1998's the Big Lebowski to come out. Now, that's how you make a funny dark comedy, the Big Lebowski, not this. I think the best thing about this movie is 'Hurt' by Nine Inch Nails. I just wish, it wasn't use for humor. It was awkward to hear the song, butcher like that. It kinda turn me off of the movie, and made me want to listen to good music instead. Absolutely beautiful cinematography in the film. Overall: It was an entertaining movie. There seem to be a lot of scenes cut out that makes me wonder what happen. What happen to the storyline that involves the boys rescuing Alan from a mental hospital? How on earth did Stu get the drugs out of the pharmacy? As for this movie being the end of the Hangover series. I doubt it, if there is money to be made. The studio will make another one for sure. I don't see this series ending anything soon, but if this is the end. Thank God. It's over. One less mindless sequel comedy, I have to review."

","Well, in order to enjoy this 3 installment I thought I should get the first two DVDs. I did and enjoyed them for the most part. Gotta say, Bradley Cooper only gets better looking so the eye candy factor was worth sitting through some of these movies.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to #3. I found it to be the smartest one with regard to the comedy aspect. Some of the physical comedy, glances and lines were really good. I liked the storyline, too. Totally unbelievable but entertaining. As the movie was coming to an end I was feeling happy and satisfied...and then came the ending. Really? Did he have to do that? Did he have to show that? And frankly, that was not even funny...not the line, not the delivery, not the uh, er...well, nothing was funny about the ending.<br/><br/>For me that took this movie and put it right in the corn-ball trash category.

They got in trouble again and of course Mr. Chow is the mastermind behind the trouble, as in The Hangover and The Hangover part II. A very common storyline but a little twist in there so the story didn't get so boring.<br/><br/>This movie's genre is mainly comedy and I must admit that some of the scenes are really hilarious and can make people laugh a lot.

This time, there is no bachelor party and no hangover that requires them to recreate their lost time. Instead there is a road trip, a kidnapping, and a life threatening adventure for 4 familiar faces. The story is filled with adult humor, offensive language, and references/flashbacks to the previous Hangover movies.<br/><br/>""Chow"" is back and shares top billing with his new best friend ""Alan"". Chow has stolen some gold bars. Alan and the wolfpack are forced to hunt him down and find the gold or face dire consequences. The search leads them to Las Vegas where they all have bad memories from their first Hangover. <br/><br/>Hangover III is more drama than comedy. The story was well told and easy to follow. The humor was accidental and infrequent. People who expect a hilarious movie will be extremely disappointed. Those who want to see misfits take on a challenge will be entertained. <br/><br/>The credits begin to roll and there is additional footage which leads us to believe that there will be another Hangover to deal with. This added segment is the best part of Hangover III and is absolutely worth the price of admission. This segment is laugh-out-loud funny and the most unpredictable part of the movie. <br/><br/>III was the weakest of the Hangovers, but still worth a look--best to view on cheap movie night or when out with the guys. I give it 6 out of 10 stars."

","The first Hangover film was a irreverently funny film that unexpectedly made a lot of money in 2009. Strike while the iron is hot, so a Part II came two years later, with practically the same story set in another city. Despite that bad sequel, there is now this Part III another two years later. I still say it should have ended with the first movie.<br/><br/>The Wolfpack, namely Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), decides to help Alan deal with his mental problems by bringing him to an institution. However, on the way there, their car was attacked by a gang led by Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall told them that since Chow had been in communication with Alan, he wants the Wolfpack to get back the gold bars Chow had stolen from him before.<br/><br/>The movie went by so fast that when the ending comes, you will wonder where the time went. The plot here was so thin. Part III was more about Alan (Zach Galifiniakis) and Chow (Ken Jeong), two side characters in the first two films who end up with the biggest roles in this final installment. The Wolfpack were just supporting here. Bradley Cooper hardly did anything substantial to deserve his top billing. I do not know what the producers were thinking to make that disgusting Mr. Chow practically a lead in this film. He was okay as a minor comic relief in the first film, but his role here is just too much. Seeing Chow suffocating a chicken is simply too annoying for words.<br/><br/>The humor is pretty dark. An animal loses its head in a cartoonish fashion in the very first sequence. Then, someone's dad died. There was NO wedding with a disastrous honeymoon hangover to recover from at the beginning, so at least they tried to change things. Unfortunately, this new formula was hit or miss, with very few hits. The guest appearance of Melissa McCarthy as Cassie from the Vegas pawn shop is quite cute though, despite her brief screen time. It was good to see Heather Graham there again, as well as the baby in the first movie now a big boy.<br/><br/>Ironically the biggest laughs were reserved for an extra scene in the middle of the ending credits, and no, it was not only a funny photo album this time. So stay seated for that one in order to make up for the feeling that you got ripped off watching the rest of this shallow film."

","A few chuckles here and there, but THE HANGOVER PART III is mostly stale and unfunny ""comedy"" that feels like a bad leftover.<br/><br/>For the record, I always thought that the first HANGOVER was overrated. And then came the inferior sequel, THE HANGOVER PART II, which was basically more of the same formula. But at least, those two HANGOVER movies have its fair share of outrageous fun and entertaining cast. Finally, here's the so-called ""epic finale to the HANGOVER trilogy"" which is -- surprise! surprise! -- neither particularly outrageous or fun. Instead, THE HANGOVER PART III feels strangely subdued at which returning director Todd Phillips takes different path this time around. How different, you say? Phillips is daring enough to ditch its very premise that originally shaped the success of the first two HANGOVER movies -- the concept of hangover itself. What's left here is nothing more than an uninspired B-grade action caper.<br/><br/>At the very least, the three principal cast -- Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and especially Zach Galifianakis -- remain reasonably entertaining to root at, even though they are no longer as fun as they used to be in the first two HANGOVER movies. In one of the subplots, the brief scene between Galifianakis and Melissa McCarthy (who plays a pawn shop owner) has a surprisingly tender moment rarely seen in the HANGOVER movie before.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips' direction is lazy and lackluster, while his script co-written with Craig Mazin, is mostly witless and dreary at best. Even most of the profanity-filled humor feels uninspired and repetitive. That supposedly crude joke about a pet giraffe gets accidentally decapitated at the highway? Well, I have tough time trying to laugh at that either. Then there's Ken Jeong, who becomes the main focus of a HANGOVER movie for the first time. It's not that he is unfunny, but his character somehow works fine when he is just a minor role in the first two HANGOVER movies. However, the expansion of his character feels significantly annoying this time around.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm glad that THE HANGOVER series is finally over with THE HANGOVER PART III. It looks obvious that this third and final installment was made for the sake of attempting to cash-in the brand popularity rather than coming up a worthwhile entry at all. This one is strictly for die-hard fans."

","For me the Hangover Part 3 was simply the WORST installment of the hangover trilogy. It made me realize just how great the first two hangovers were because the ideas were just so much better and funnier.<br/><br/>The first Hangover is not the funniest R rated comedy I've ever seen, but the whole idea of three groomsmen losing the groom during a bachelor party in Las Vagas was such a clever idea that lead to a great plot and tons of fun that made it such a damn good movie.<br/><br/>The Hangover 2 was just the same rehash as the first, but what made part 2 so good is that it took the same idea from the first one and put different twists into the plot that at least made an attempt to make it as good as the first one. In fact, I thought it was almost just as good as the original. <br/><br/>The Hangover 3 on the other hand was nothing more than a conclusion film that told the audience that this was the final adventure. We all knew Phil, Stu, and Allen couldn't possibly lose a bachelor party friend for the third time, so what we got here was a darker more action- themed Hangover movie. Hell there's no bachelor party or anything to get hung over from in this one.<br/><br/>What happens is that Chow escapes from prison after being captured in the 2nd one, and heads back to the United States. Meanwhile Allen's father passes away and his friends and family decide its time to have him put in a mental hospital after he stops taking his meds. Phil, Stu, Allen, and Doug on the way to the mental hospital get run off the road by a group of thugs and are captured. Marshall the head thug, tells them how Chow stole a large amount of gold from him during a heist, and because they are close friends to Chow they have to bring Chow to Marshall or else they will kill Doug...again... And that's basically the short intro summary to the Hangover 3. Boy that all sounds like it escalated quickly didn't it?<br/><br/>Everything else from that point on is nothing more but boring R-rated comedy humor that drags on. The Hangover humor is just dry and old by now. I got a few chuckles and that was it while I was laughing much harder at the other two movies. The other two hangovers were so much more fun and exciting while this one was a more epic-themed action flick that was too predictable. Chow was actually just starting to get old in this one to the point were he was actually annoying. He was funnier in the other two because he just played one of the minor characters. In this one, he is an essential character to the plot who you see all the time and all the dialogue he says is just so Unfunny. Who ever wrote the script for Chow was really trying to push some desperate laughs. They should have just called this movie ''The Changover part 3.''<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you enjoyed the first two hangover movies, chances are you will be quite disappointed by this one."
"autisticadvocate","Null","0","0","27 May 2013"," On humor, Hollywood, and autism
","This weekend I went to see the final installment of ""The Hangover"" with some neurotypical (those who most would call ""normal"") friends. Actually, there's nothing really typical about them. Can't say they are really great friends, nor are they particularly wise, but I feel relaxed around them. They don't seem to understand much about autism, nor how much the movie portrays some of my characteristics when I was younger (they have been involved with schizophreniics), but at least they are open-minded. <br/><br/>I probably laughed harder than anyone in the theater at the character ""Alan"", who is played by a very funny comedian. Alan is a 42-year-old man who lives with his parents, holed up behind the walls of his room, and he couldn't be more of an abusive ass. He also exhibits nearly all of the characteristics known to people these days of Aspergers Syndrome (good and bad), plus some traits which aren't associated with autism at all. Nobody actually used either word aspergers or autism, but it was more than implicit.<br/><br/>Although I laughed, I have found much of this movie (and the current direction of Hollywood comedy in general) to be no laughing matter. I can laugh because I have learned to laugh at myself, being one who has had to live with some of the symptoms which the movie characterizes (albeit grossly exaggerated). If I couldn't laugh, I doubt very much that I would still be alive today at 46. This may be just a comedy, and of course I know better than to look to any movie for education or vindication on anything - still, I've been on this earth long enough to see just how influential even a slapstick production can be on opinions. <br/><br/>What isn't funny about Alan is that he is implicitly portrayed as autistic, he has very little trouble expressing himself verbally, yet he is an insensitive bum. I have always worked hard for what I have, although my parents provided college funding and I stayed until I was ready to go a few years later, I never, ever asked them or anybody for money! The portrayal of the adult aspie as one who is intentionally nasty, and won't do anything for himself is extremely unfair and defamatory! Alan doesn't understand appropriate self-regulation of his social behavior - fair enough, but I haven't met any autistics who would do anything particularly manipulative, much less drug their friends! Adding to this the implied pedophelia is just sickening, and completely unfounded. <br/><br/>What was mostly lacking was Alan's pain, with all the crushing shame that would haunt a typical autistic adult when he makes social mistakes. Autistic people are highly intelligent, and this does not spare them (myself included) the perception of insult or emotional harm if they have caused that to another person. They can be deeply empathetic regarding any pain which they may have caused - the problem is with not understanding how they have caused others to hurt, thereby making their social navigation profoundly confusing and accident-prone. Well, of course there's nothing funny about pain!<br/><br/>I realize that we must be able to laugh in order to be healthy, and that means we need something (and usually somebody) to laugh at. But when Jack Nicholson spoofed Tourette's Syndrome in the seventies, he didn't attempt to portray the underlying personality of his character, therefore any misrepresentations had to be far less egregious. There once was enough creativity in Hollywood to produce characters who which were very funny, but not too close to anybody who would likely exist in the real world that it would influence real-world opinion. What causes me feelings of despair is the fact that this modern-day comedy went too far in exploiting the aspergers condition, and it went almost entirely uncensured (as the Google evidence makes it apparent). In a time where child aspies have never been more the target of bully hatred, the comedians have picked the aspie as their new whipping boy, and they are inspired by a culture which tends to believe that the line between that multimillion-dollar-joke and cruel defamation is wherever they decide to plant their feet!"

","Todd Phillips third and final installment to The Hangover franchise is undoubtedly the third best. Its much darker plot takes it from being an comedy driven laugh riot like the others to being a grimy hard action film that struggles to find humor.<br/><br/>The story does not in fact revolve around a hangover like the title and previous movies suggest, but instead opts for an action vibe centered around the search for the infamous Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) character. Chow has stolen money from the wrong guy and it is up to the wolf pack to find him and hand him over before the man after Chow kills Doug (Justin Bartha). <br/><br/>The acting in this installment seemed like it had been put on auto-pilot, the characters seem a little stale and don't share the same lovable chemistry we see in the previous films. The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't feel like it belongs in the franchise. Too many eggs were put into the basket of Ken Jeong as he was made a main character and his style just doesn't work for a full 100 minutes the way it does in the 10-15 minute chunks of the other movies.<br/><br/>All this said, the movie does have some good points, Zach Galifankis is not as fine tuned as he's been in the past but he does create the bulk of the laughs in this one, as he did in the others. Cooper and Helms are also lesser versions of their normal selves but they do occasionally break through with some funny material. <br/><br/>It's darker, less funny, more rude and less of a good time then its predecessors, however it is still nice to see the gang back together one last time. The movie uses a solid soundtrack, decent homages to the other films in the series, and a few laughs to keep it from being a failure and for that it gets a 6.5/10."

I was sitting in a very packed movie theater tonight when the ""Thai strip club"" scene caught me completely off guard. The strip club owner was offering to sell a ""young kid"" for $2000. Then he said, ""Maybe more, depends on how young you want."" This got a huge laugh from the packed house. I felt like I was going to be sick.I had to leave. I have to believe that these producers simply don't understand the ugly reality of the situation. The fact is, in Thailand, and even in America, you can certainly buy a little child if you have the money...you can purchase somebody's precious little child as young as you like who has been raped up to forty times a day, drugged and often beaten into submission. I assure you, it is the most wicked thing I have ever encountered and American filmmakers using this as comedic fodder is just unacceptable. Is nothing sacred? The issue of human trafficking is incredibly serious. 1.8 million children are sold against their will and sexually abused, transported throughout our world each year and held captive at the hands of people who treat them like animals. It is a huge problem and how incredibly insensitive to make a joke like this. If you ever have the pleasure of meeting a child who has been rescued from this atrocity, I assure you, you won't think it is funny any longer. It takes a lifetime for these kids to recover from their trauma and abuse. I would just ask you to please consider the incredible power and influence you have been given and use it wisely. You have the extraordinary privilege as film makers to impact the world. Please consider the thousands of men and women around the world who have dedicated their lives and resources to rescue and rehabilitate children who are bought and sold in modern day slavery. Please educate yourselves and exhibit some grace and respect for their lives. People have given up everything to fight against this horror show and here comes America, glamorizing evil yet again.

The Wolf Pack, which consists of his friends Stu, Doug and Phil, takes Alan on a road trip to Arizona to get some help, only for them to get stopped by Marshall. Marshall is after his half of precious gold that Leslie Chow stole from him, and taking Doug as insurance, he tells the rest of the wolf pack that they must get Chow and his half of the gold to Marshall in three days or else Doug will die. How are the Wolf Pack involved, you ask? Well, you need to watch to find out. That's if, you can survive the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The Hangover 3 is probably the worst in the trilogy, even losing out to the lack-luster 2nd instalment that everyone found to be too dull and boring. The Hangover 3 manages to take away most of the comedy aspect of the first two and turn it into a dark thriller, which some may find a little bit too much to handle. The film manages to let you know what your in for in the first 5 minutes, with Alan driving with Giraffe on the highway only for him to decapitate it and cause a big accident. The scene is probably the funniest thing about the film, but even than, the scene wasn't even funny.<br/><br/>The first hangover is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so to top that would be impossible. The Hangover 2, while at least tried to be wildly funny, was basically the same as the first The Hangover, but had nothing much to offer. The third strays away from ""The Hangover"" formula and goes into a less comedic, more thriller type film. The film fails in that aspect and makes us wish the series ended after the first.<br/><br/>I bought this film thinking I was going to get something funny. I love the first Hangover and could tolerate the second, but I didn't know this film would be this dull.

What kind of message do they think they are sending to the world--which accounts for more than half of the eyes on the screen for any U.S. flick--when they denigrate American manhood in such a fashion? Perhaps it would not be so bad if such a bon mot came out during the first five or ten minutes of a feature. But when it the very last image of the entire film that the audience is left with, it is underlined with an importance that otherwise might not be attached to it. Further, when such a joke from Mother Nature involves one of the five main characters, it carries a lot more weight with the rest of the universe than if it was just some extra's lame inch.

"advaitkamat","3","2","5","7 June 2013"," Unbelievably bovine.
","I don't profess to be much of a sucker for the films that really value your popcorn but ""The Hangover Part 3"" is a tiresome experiment of an age-old concept. A concept that had come and should've gone with ""The Hangover"" a few years ago but unfortunately did not. The first installment was admirably zingy and surprisingly original, and worked solely because it fleshed out its characters so wonderfully well. The second one was basically ripped-off from the first one, but the repetitive and derelict gags and the familiar situations ended up getting the better of your patience. A greatly optimistic person would've believed that a third part would actually make sense when the second one clearly missed the mark by miles, and that's why, I presume, they've made a third one. <br/><br/>After the death of his father, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), a troubled loner, decides to take up therapy on the insistence of his family. Driving him to the rehab facility are his three friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), but get ambushed mid- way by a group of gangsters headed by Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall tells them that their friend Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), who had escaped from the Bangkok prison he was in, conned him out of 21 million dollars worth of gold bars and now wants it back. Though they protest about not knowing Chow's location, they're told to get the loot in three days time and take away Doug as bait. The rest of the plot focuses on their attempts to reach and outsmart Chow of the loot and the things that eventually happen when everything predictably goes wrong.<br/><br/>""The Hangover Part 3"" is nowhere as hilarious as the first installment, and the few weak gags that are thrown to us doesn't even classify it as a comedy. What it really is, is some kind of a farrago that doesn't know what it wants to be and ultimately settles for an unpropitious crime-comedy so lame-o that it's hard to guess which quip merits a laugh. One of the most vacuous instances in the film is Alan taking a smiling picture of himself at his father's funeral. If that was supposed to be a joke, it was either very mildly funny or completely doltish. There are a few more instances like these when we feel that the film begs us to laugh, or to be amused in any way, but the gags are often so feeble that we can only manage a weak chuckle. Somehow, ""The Hangover Part 3"" doesn't feel like an installment that deserves to be placed as a sequel to the wonderful first one, partly because it tries to tell a story convincingly, and a story that had the wheels to go the distance and redeem the makers of the shoddy second, but it's lost somewhere when it desperately pretends to be a comedy. Perhaps the most amusing thing about the film is how director Todd Phillips pulled out a small link from the first film and squashed and jabbed it to produce some kind of a dim-wit story that served as its plot. The lack of attention to the little details cannot be overlooked entirely, which were clearly perceptible because the makers want you to focus more on the plot, which in turn makes it hard to invest into the story and the characters. <br/><br/>On the flip side, though the film is too stodgy to be a good crime story and too unfunny to be a comedy, it is seldom boring, thanks to the little twists that the plot keeps throwing up every ten minutes or so. My favorite moment in the film was when Alan placed his sunglasses on the eyes of the character of the boy, who was the lost baby in the first part, now grown-up. The moment was, in some way, wickedly moving and the makers deserve some credit for weaving the character into the plot for a small sequence. <br/><br/>Of the performances, Galifianakis, who plays Alan, is as likable as ever and though the plot revolves around his character more, he effortlessly carries the film throughout its runtime. Jeong plays the sassy Chow with his usual flair, and provides the much needed energy to the sinking film. Cooper sleepwalks through his role, a role that must've been absurdly easy and undeserving for an actor of his stature. Helms, on the other hand, is largely unconvincing as Stu, the twitchy dentist who shone in the first installment, but is a mere distraction in this one. He serves absolutely no purpose to the plot and the Stu he plays is so radically different from the one we knew for so long. And, as always, it's enormous fun to see the terrific John Goodman play the bad guy.<br/><br/>""The Hangover 3"" is easily the worst installment of the three, and a film that should've absolved the makers of making the scummy sequel to the fine first. If you are a fan of the first two installments, then you might be allured by the third. For me, it was nothing more than a wearisome end to a franchise that could've been so much more."

","'THE HANGOVER PART III': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The third, and supposedly final, chapter in the blockbuster comedy series that began in 2009 with the surprise sleeper hit 'THE HANGOVER'. That film launched the movie star careers of it's three leads Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis. They all reprise their roles in this film (for the third time) and Todd Phillips once again directs. Phillips and Craig Mazin took over writing duties from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore in the second and third films (along with Scott Armstrong for 'PART II'). This time around the three buddies (along with Justin Bartha, reprising his role again for the third time) are taking Alan to rehab when their attacked by gangsters and Doug is kidnapped. It's a different formula than the first and second films (which we're almost identical) this time around and not nearly as funny. Like the second film it's a major disappointment from the classic original. <br/><br/>The story focuses around Alan (Galifianakis) who's been off his meds for several months and keeps getting into lots of trouble. His father, Sid (Jeffrey Tambor reprising his role), dies as a result of the stress from Alan's actions. Alan's buddies Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Bartha) decide to take him to get the treatment he needs for his mental issues when they're attacked by a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall wants revenge on the drug dealer, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong reprising his role), who recently escaped from prison. He kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the other three friends bring Mr. Chow to him. Sid, Stu and Doug come up with a plan to drug Chow and take him to Marshall but things go horribly wrong. <br/><br/>The original 'HANGOVER' is one of my all time favorite comedies! I was so disappointed with 'THE HANGOVER PART II' for merely imitating the original film (almost exactly) and not coming up with any new laughs of it's own (a lot of the old jokes felt forced the second time as well). Here the filmmakers came up with a new formula and adventure to get their popular characters into but failed to deliver the laughs once again. For one thing the three leads are sober the whole film; how can you do a 'HANGOVER' film without getting the characters hung-over?! The actors give it their all and Phillips is always a decent director but the main problem with both sequels is Phillips thought he could replace the excellent two writers of the original film. He and Mazin don't know how to deliver the humor and fun that Lucas and Moore did (and the main reason this film isn't funny is it's lacking the fun). It's extremely dark, violent and just bizarre. It's hardly even a comedy film.

"nbalive_fanatic","Null","2","5","26 May 2013"," An adventure thriller masquerading as the third Hangover
","If you stayed away from the news on it, (like I did) then fans of the raunchy comedy series (like myself) may find it a bit surprising that this installment plays more like Lethal Weapon than Old School. Director Todd Phillips built himself up on films like the aforementioned Will Ferrell vehicle, as well as the original Hangover and Road Trip. However, instead of going the ""more of the same"" route that was used on The Hangover II, he veers off the beaten path. He deviates from the backtrack formula that help make the first film and, to a somewhat lesser extent the second, so successful. Yes, Doug does get kidnapped again, but the rest is unlike the familiar drug induced forays.<br/><br/>Instead, the final product is an amalgam of genres; becoming part gangster, part heist, part mystery and part chase. The disappointing thing is that a lot of laughs seem to have been lost along the way. This time around, the gang goes looking for Leslie Chow at the request of a crime figure named Marshall. Once a throwaway mention in The Hangover, He emerges here to reveal that Chow stole half of the take in a gold heist to tune of $20 million or so. On cue, he keeps Doug as collateral and orders The Wolfpack to bring back Chow and the money or their friend gets it. Double crosses ensue, f-bombs fly and things end where they all began.<br/><br/>My biggest grip with The Hangover II was the shift in tone and darker humor. Yes, the first had some pretty sick humor as well, but it never came off as mean spirited. It was good, clean (subjective, I know) fun. The second sucked a lot of that fun out of things with the shootings, missing fingers and FBI busts. This is the nail in the coffin. This movie is devoid of almost all of the silly magic that made the first one click. It pans out more like an action thriller with some attempted laughs peppered in because, oh yeah, that's kind of what the core audience came for. It's as if it forgets to be funny sometimes amidst the chase sequences. People die and get killed. Innocent animals get killed. Heck, even Alan has become more jerk than lovable goofball. Where did the fun go? There's not even a ""hangover"", for goodness sakes. Not even the injection of the female Zach Galifianakis (a perfectly casted cameo by Melissa McCarthy) helps shine light down this film's dark tunnel.<br/><br/>Jeong and Galifianakis trade off the best lines in what would have probably been better suited as a Hangover spin off. Perhaps, The Chow Adventures: The Hangover Continues. I will give Todd Phillips a hand here for his directing. This might lead to him getting big budget action jobs because he handled himself quite well here. It's just that the twisty-turns seem better for an Ashley Judd flick than the brain scrambled antics of the beloved Wolfpack. If you're looking for laughs that match the first outing or even the second, you'll be sorely disappointed. However, if you're looking for a movie that ties up some loose ends, features a few good quirky comedy bits and some entertaining set pieces then The Hangover III might be your cup of tea. Even if it is a bit bitter."
"nesfilmreviews","3","2","5","24 May 2013"," In honor of our recent loss Ray Manzarek, ""This is the end...""
","In ""The Hangover III,"" the mystery comes from a reinvented formula; there is no wedding or missing groomsman. No actual hangover to speak of, and a lack of scenarios fueled by alcohol from which to recover. Instead, the film is produced as more of a caper than a comedy. Despite not being 'good' movie: a litany of crude humor that becomes repetitive that falls flat for a majority of the film, the third act does provide a few moments of genuine charm and appeal. And yes, this is a real stretch, but I'm trying. <br/><br/>The latest misadventures by the antisocial man-child Alan (Zach Galifianakis) cause buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) to stage an intervention. But on their way to hand deliver Alan to a mental health clinic in Arizona, they experience an intervention of their own. The group is captured by crime kingpin Marshall (John Goodman), who needs their help in tracking down the fugitive Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Mr. Chow stole $21 million in gold bricks from Marshall, and pressing the ""Wolfpack"" into service may be the only means of recovery. In the meantime, he'll hold Doug for safekeeping.<br/><br/>""The Hangover III"" is the most sentimental, (hence the finale), and yet the darkest of the franchise where the eccentricity doesn't always work as well as it should. To it's credit, there are some escapades and plot twists along the way (from Tijuana to Vegas), and it's never out right boring, all set to a bizarre soundtrack that incorporates Hanson, Danzig, and Schubert.<br/><br/>You get the feeling director Todd Philips would rather be making a straight-up action movie, as opposed to creating a string of comedic episodes. The on screen disaffection of Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms reeks of paychecks already spent, leaving Zack Galifianakis to fill the void with material that works better around the margins. Ken Jeong reprises his role as a lunatic criminal with the bare minimum of effort. He appears more animated in the Bud Light commercials when compared to this outing. The post-credits epilogue does provide a truly twisted array of images, a fitting send-off for a series recognized as being the highest-grossing R-rated comedies of all time. This is in fact the end - and it is what it is. We've had some good laughs. Let's part amicably."

The crazy drunken shenanigans have been replaced with beheading a giraffe, suffocating a chicken, snapping the necks of dogs and witnessing a heartless murder. Blatant animal cruelty aside, this ""comedy"" lacked laughs and general entertainment, thus resulting in a boring conclusion to a mildly humorous trilogy. ""The Wolfpack"" are forced to find Mr. Chow who has escaped from prison in Bangkok ('Shawshank Redemption' style) and stolen a vast amount of gold from a criminal kingpin. Understandably, director Phillips and his crew altered the direction that this film would take in order to prevent a carbon copy of the original (much like its sequel was). However, in doing so he has removed the essence of mild hilarity that made its predecessors so watchable. There is no hangover, there are no regrettable decisions and there are no laughs to be had. The consistency in characters remains adequate, with the narrative focusing on Alan in an attempt to further develop the character who was (emphasis on ""was"") the funniest of the bunch. Cooper looked like he couldn't be bothered and Helms, as I've said in my previous reviews, still remains irritatingly dull. Aside from Goodman who was strangely captivating, the lack of new characters makes this crime caper even more monotonous. And no, including McCarthy did not help. Yet again, the inclusion of Chow felt forced just to provide a few laughs that were had in the original. The pacing was decent though, the story moves along at a brisk pace visiting locations of new and old. But overall, this third chapter lacks the humour from the previous two and, to an extent, is so purposefully changed that it loses itself. Atleast it concludes satisfyingly, so hopefully there will not be another sequel. Yet much like the stench of any alcoholic beverage, I'm sure it will come back..."

Part III is severely lacking in ideas and originality and, while it did occasionally crack me up, the laughs just don't flow like they did in the first film.<br/><br/>If this was a stand alone comedy movie, judged in its own right, it would have probably gone down a lot better.

","I'm not quite sure why 'The Hangover Part III' was called 'The Hangover Part III'. The first two films in this series actually dealt with four friends who had epic hangovers and crazy exploits and adventures. This third installment doesn't even include a hangover, and oddly leaves a lot of the comedy at the front door to focus instead on violence, murdering animals and action sequences. I'm sure this will score a giant opening weekend box office reward, but bad word of mouth should prevent this third and final act from making any more money past the next couple of days.<br/><br/>The first 'Hangover' film was a fun, nutty comedy that garnered gut-busting laughs with its witty dialogue and entertaining characters who got themselves into some off-the-wall situations. Then 'Part II' was released and was virtually the same thing all over again, but in a different setting. Despite the many similarities, the sequel offered some genuine funny moments from time to time. However, this third movie is the bottom of the barrel. Instead of making a raunchy comedy with some action beats, director Todd Phillips decided to make a deplorable action-crime film with occasional bits of comedy, and it almost never works.<br/><br/>In the first few minutes, we see a prison riot that leads to the escape of Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) and two deaths, one of which is an adult giraffe that Alan (Zach Galifianakis) purchased for reasons unknown. In a trailer towed behind Alan's car, the poor giraffe dodges a few highway bridges until one is too low to dodge. The giraffe is decapitated into a bloody mess that causes a giant highway pileup behind him. This third go-round tries too desperately to push the bounds into more depravity. And no, this isn't the only act of killing animals. You can add drugging and neck-breaking a few dogs and smothering a rooster with a pillow, to name a couple of other instances.<br/><br/>From Alan's behavior and actions, it's clear that he needs some intense help. His family and the Wolfpack decide to stage an intervention and take Alan to a nice rehab facility in Arizona. To sweeten the deal, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) agree to drive Alan together to the facility. However, the guys don't get more than a couple hundred miles before they're run off the road, kidnapped and tied up by a ruthless mobster named Marshall (John Goodman).<br/><br/>Marshall had over $40 million in gold bars stolen from him by Mr. Chow a few years ago, and can't seem to locate Chow's whereabouts. But he knows that Alan has kept in touch with Chow often over the years. Therefore, he kidnaps Doug and forces the other three to locate Chow and his gold. Thus begins our third adventure, which takes the three best friends to jail in Tijuana, a basement in Mexico, and ultimately back to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where this whole franchise began.<br/><br/>One of the few likable scenes in the movie comes when Alan meets the female version of himself (Melissa McCarthy), who runs a pawn shop in Vegas. Their banter, body language and love-at-first-sight is engagingly awkward, yet sweet. It's definitely one of the highlights of the film. The rest of the 100 minute run-time, the entire cast seems to be bored and phoning it in. Cooper is still fun to watch take charge of the situation and is witty enough to receive a pass. Galifianakis takes in a meatier role here, but his usual quirky characteristics come across more rude than funny. Jeong's Chow is much less funny here and more aggressive and murderous. Poor Bartha only receives a few minutes of screen time once again, while Helms' Stu is off-camera a lot and not as animated as he was in the first two movies. Some of the minor characters from the previous two films return for a few minutes, but no instance is fulfilling.<br/><br/>If this is the final chapter for the Wolfpack, it's a sad and unfortunate way to go out – not with a bang, but with a whimper and a slap in the face. The filming, dialogue and characters feel one-note and vague throughout. The only good thing to come out of 'The Hangover Part III' is the end credit sequence that showcases a familiar scenario and sets up a possible fourth film. That part was met with giant laughs by the audience I saw it with, at least."

This is the only one that I can think of that does so and still comes out the best.<br/><br/>Alan has ditched his medications and Doug has thought about taking him along with Phil and Stu to and intervention. When they are double crossed and Doug is kidnapped by crime boss, Marshal (Goodman) he summons them to find their crazy friend Leslie Chow so Marshal can destroy him.<br/><br/>This is the only one that was not about being hungover or wasted and trying to find someone. Trying to find Chow, which slips in and out of their grasp is the only thing remotely related to that topic. The laughs fly right in at the same level in the other movies, but the whole movie has a change of style, so the laughs may have a different feeling. I saw most critics poking at the lack of hilarity that this one ensued. I found this to be a bit of a dark comedy. I laughed my ass off throughout the whole thing, but this did have a darker and grittier tone. The danger is at an all- time high and I was actually scared that Phil or Alan would die in some scenes. But when they go to Las Vegas, that is when the nostalgia comes back. Jade (Heather Graham) returns and her son Tyler (as Alan call Carlos) at age four is the same baby from the first. That was probably the coolest.<br/><br/>The Hangover III is the last movie. I doubt there will not be a Hangover IV in another ten or fifteen years. Look at The Godfather, Indiana Jones, Scream, Wizard of Oz, Terminator: they all feature instalments decades after saying the series is finished. If this stays the last one, I will always see Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifinakis, Justin Bartha and Ken Jeong as Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, Alan Garner, Doug Billings and Leslie Chow.<br/><br/>4/4"

","Trust Hollywood to take a good movie and wreck it by making mindless, craptacular sequels. <br/><br/>The first Hangover movie was good: hilariously funny at times, and more intelligent than your average Hollywood slapstick. It did seem to run out of new ideas and steam at about the 1 hour mark though.<br/><br/>That concluding lack of steam and originality carried through to The Hangover II. It was pretty much a copy-and-paste of the first one. Different location, but very similar plot (and, obviously, the same characters). Interesting at times, but mostly fairly predictable and mundane.<br/><br/>The Hangover III is even worse. Stupid, pointless, not funny at all. Zach Galifianakis' character, always the worst and most irritating aspect of the Hangover movies (or any movie he is in) is even more irritating than before.<br/><br/>Hopefully there is no Part IV.<br/><br/>Avoid."
"aciessi","3","1","2","29 December 2013"," An inconsequential end to a deteriorating franchise
","The Hangover Part III is one of those movies that I forgot about merely seconds after the end credits started to roll. I thought what I had just seen was a mirage of some sort. A comedy so unbelievably weak that it cannot simply serve as the end to one of the wildest saga of comedy movies ever made. But alas, there is just no way around how bad this final Hangover really is. <br/><br/>When the first film debuted in 2009, it opened to mixed critical reviews but to a strong word of mouth consensus amongst its audience and became one of the biggest unexpected hits of the year. It launched the careers of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifinakis from comedic players to top billing superstars. It was an even bigger hit on DVD, and a sequel was already in the works. The future really did look bright for comedy, and for Todd Phillips as his directorial career had now found itself in a massive resurgence. <br/><br/>Then, when the sequel debuted in 2011, audiences from across the country piled into movie theaters in hopes of another summer laugh riot. These hopes were quickly dashed when it was realized that the Hangover Part II was a carbon copy of the original. It was one of the biggest disappointments in comedy since Ghostbusters 2, but it did supply us with a few memorable quotes and inspired insanity if nothing else. <br/><br/>Now, we have The Hangover Part III. The question remains, why does it even exist? Who was asking for it? I couldn't name anyone who wanted anything to do with the Hangover after its disastrous second part. But, there it was, Hangover III. Whether you like it or not, your getting it. Whats more is that it isn't even remotely similar to the two movies prior to it. In fact, there's no hangover to be found at any point in this film (minus the end credits). Quite contradictory to the title, or even the WHOLE PURPOSE of the franchise! <br/><br/>Yeah, I guess Todd Phillips and co. were so terrified with what they received with the second movie, that they insisted on abandoning everything that constituted a Hangover movie and instead leave the memorable characters to revel in black comedy and senseless melodrama. If you can believe it, this movie is even more black than its sequel (and that movie included jokes about cocaine overdoses and the victims of the Vietnam war). Yes, we are forced to focus on the mad inner workings of Alan's mind, and why he is a burden to society and everyone close to him. Alan was once the most lovable inappropriate man-child the world has ever seen. Now, I wanted to strap him down and pluck every last whisker from his beard. We also focus on Leslie Chow's crazy antics again because. well LOOK ITS CHOW AGAIN!!! He's so crazy, right? <br/><br/>Everything else is just flavorless and boring. Even Melissa McCarthy can't save this mess. I'll admit that a few of the jokes made me laugh in a twisted Terry Zwigoff sort of way. But other than a few of the dark jokes. there's nothing really that enjoyable about this Hangover. So we bid thee, farewell. I don't think we'll miss you, Wolfpack."
"Kevbo1985","4","1","2","9 November 2013"," Did We Need Part III? Yes. Did We Need This Plot? No.
","There's just no way around it: The Hangover could have used a third (and final, hopefully) installment, but this is NOT good enough, in any way, shape or form, to match up to the excellent original and solid sequel.<br/><br/>The main issue is the plot, which feels as hashed together as I can imagine the entire film was. The performances of the main characters are still as solid as they've ever been, but Bradley Cooper has come a long way in between Hangovers and his presence is almost...overbearing? It's hard to pinpoint, but none of the actors (including a more involved Ken Jeong as Chow and a unnecessarily involved John Goodman as the film's antagonist) are helped by the thin and void story.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it, I'll just say that the plot itself chokes the humor out of the film. Each of the previous Hangovers worked by creating situations that were, in and of themselves, hilarious, and then adding the reactions of a handful of excellent comedic actors. A bit of improv must have come into play as well, and even that feels cut off for most of Part III. The potential danger that created the tension in the first two films is diluted to the point where it doesn't work how it's supposed to work: as a platform for the humor. Nothing is better than a good laugh when you might be expecting things to go wrong...and even when they go wrong in Part III, you can't seem to find it in you to care as you once did.<br/><br/>In the end, you'll most likely wonder, like myself, why any of this had to happen in the first place. I'm not talking about the film, but the story within, which is absolutely ridiculous to begin with and gets no better as it continues to unfold. There are some truly funny moments...with such an impressive cast, it was an impossibility to completely avoid that. But these are too far between a shoddy script to justify itself. A poor idea laced into a great overall idea (concluding the series with a bang) makes the entire thing...below itself as a franchise installment."

","I found the first 'Hangover' film funny, but somewhat overrated. The sequel I found less funny, but conversely underrated. The third (and reportedly final) chapter... well, let's say that it deserves its reputation.<br/><br/>'The Hangover Part III' ditches the ""What happened last night?"" formula for a more straight forward story. On the plus side, at least it's not a re-hash. On the down side, the mystery aspect was the best part of the first two films.<br/><br/>The cast all seem fairly bored here. Cooper, who has become a legitimate movie star in the interim, seems downright embarrassed. Even Galifianakis and Jeong seem like shadows of their former alter-ego selves this go-round.<br/><br/>Darker than its predecessors, 'The Hangover Part III' is a sporadically funny, but ultimately disappointing note to end this saga on."

","First off i wanna start this off by saying, This is a more personal opinion review I'm only saying that because this movie has got a lot a Bad reviews and i understand why but its not as bad as every one says. Hangover 3 has been criticized a lot for its change plot which is the first thing i disagree with this because after two the plot already feels dull because you already know what happens and its just rehashing the idea of the first one. When i first heard the plot would be Alan focused and not involve a hangover i was like aww yeah cool man it sounded like interesting way to breath new life in the series but that obviously wasn't the case The second thing i hear a lot of is the film is not good because its not funny and that the movie isn't really a hangover movie because it isn't a comedy, this is true because the film isn't really about the comedy its about the characters. The problem is the hangovers target audience is people looking for a laugh and not those who are looking for a real coherent story just raunchy jokes and cheep laughs, I'm not saying i wasn't apart of that audience I'm just saying i still enjoyed the movie for what it offered. It sucks that film was given really low reviews because it wasn't terrible the lowest the ratings should be 5-6 or 3- 3.5 depending on however you review its somewhere in the middle but me personally i give it a 7 great tunes great nostalgia in small doses good jokes and pretty satisfactory conclusion too the series could be funnier but the way the tone is it works sorry for the poorly written review but it gets my point across - Ethan"

","Events of the past two parts of the franchise come around to a close in what is (hopefully) the final movie of ""The Hangover"" series, when misfit criminal Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) escapes Bangkok prison (with a reference to ""Shawshank Redemption"") bringing a dramatic blow-back from events past. After the death of his father Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is to be sent to an intervention camp to deal with his latent adulthood issues (worsening after being 6 months off of medication). Accompanied by Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), the Wolf Pack is out for one last ride. Unfortunately for them drug-lord Marshall (John Goodman) holds them personally responsible for the misgivings of Mr. Chow, who several years ago in Vegas stole 20-odd million worth of gold from him. Marshall takes Doug hostage and tasks the remaining threesome with recovering the gold. Or else...<br/><br/>Thankfully the screenwriters decided to ditch the concept of retreading worn down paths of the original story (as was the key issue with the Bangkok excursion), instead tying together the knots of previous parts to deliver a new take on the matter. Unfortunately however the comedy is totally lost on the way and save for a few forced laughs, this is the most unfunny and laboured effort of a sequel I can remember. Most of the cast just seem feed up with the characters, playing them to minimal effect, only Jeong and Galifikalis milking it out the best they can. Cooper especially seems to have moved on and sleepwalks through the movements of a story lacking invention and punchlines. At times a couple of ideas and jokes manage to work, but overall it lacks freshness and even Bangkok outdoes it in terms of humour. Which unfortunately speaks volume as to how poor this final part of the series is. Hopefully this means good riddance for further follow-ups, as evidently the joke has run its term.<br/><br/>Funnily enough the only truly spot-on part of the movie comes with the end credits, when a wedding ends in another bout of debauchery and memory loss with some hysterical consequences. A suitable ending to the series, which probably should have never transgressed past the original in the first place."
"gt-thereelword","6","1","2","8 August 2013"," When it's funny, it's hilarious. When it's lame, it's painful.
","The Hangover Part III is pretty different from the first two films. The comedy remains vulgar, crass and rude. There are scenes of murder, animal cruelty and racism, so it's another day at the office for director Todd Phillips and his team. The difference with this one is the fusion of the action-thriller genre. Some scenes are surprisingly serious and intense. Don't get me wrong, this is still primarily a comedy, but there's a certain level of malice here that makes it feel both fresh and uncomfortable. It isn't easy to find the comedy in the suffocation of a rooster or the cold-blooded execution of a man into a pool. At least the plot-line here doesn't repeat the blueprint from number one.<br/><br/>The thriller element aside, the comedy is mostly still here. Zach Galifianakis once again takes the spotlight as the juvenile Alan and Ken Jeong gets a much bigger role this time round. They both provide laughs, but they're also both quite irritating. The great thing about the first film is that Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms provided a relief of sorts from the moronic actions of these two characters, not any more. Their collective craziness get thrust into the foreground and it becomes a little exhausting.<br/><br/>In terms of comedy, The Hangover Part III does provide laughs, but it isn't consistent. When it's funny, it's hilarious. When it's lame, it's painful. Todd Phillips can certainly direct comedy well (he has also directed Road Trip and Old School) and he delivers some pretty funny moments. He has definitely upped the style in his direction this time round. Some sequences are stylishly directed and choreographed, others are annoyingly self-absorbed.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hangover Part III is a mixed bag. There are things to enjoy and there are things to dislike. It's better than the second entry, but it still isn't close to the first. Kudos to the team for attempting to do something a little different with the last film in the trilogy, too.<br/><br/>www.thereelword.net"

","(spoiler alert!)I will be honest, I didn't like it at all. I was a fan of the first one, I haven't watched the second one and for some reason I went and watched this one. I feel like it was made for no reason at all. It doesn't have clear punch line. Not to be all negative, acting is great, there are some funny parts, but overall I am quite disappointed. Bradley Cooper is amazing, as well as Zach, who stayed true to his role. Somehow, I feel it was quite boring, not really believable, honestly, almost fallen asleep in the theater. On the other hand, there are some great landscapes of Vegas and desserts, which you would like if you are not really paying attention on the main action."

I thought it was good they did something different and I'm glad they didn't do another hangover, because it would just be too similar. Even though it being called hangover, and there being no hangover in it (except the end) it was awesome. I loved that Leslie how was more of a major character in this! He's so funny! I think this movie was a good closure to the series, but I still think that the first one was the best, the other two are still very good and amusing. I would have been disappointed if they haven't made one more, so now I am content. They also provided closure the the story of Alan, which I think was really necessary and it was a happy ending. :)"

As if unless the movie has some message to give or is a revolutionary comedy piece, it is not worth seeing. As if unless you can really analyze the movie and come out thinking ""this movie made me a better person"", it is not worth seeing.

","Hangover III is a kinda pointless film with an astoundingly shallow plot, whose sole purpose is to be as nasty and crass as possible in an attempt to humour us. The result - we rarely rejoice this Hangover. <br/><br/>Unlike everybody else present in the theatre hall, I haven't seen the previous instalments in the Hangover series. And yet I felt throughout as though I was watching not a film but a season of Hangover; littlest thought has been given to the plot, and the characters have simply been thrown into a couple of pretty straightforward situations and given some silly sketches to perform. And it doesn't help that our three leads sleepwalk their parts, totally unenthused by the material. Even as a non-fan, I can clearly sense that Hangover has jumped the shark.<br/><br/>What writers Todd Phillips and Craig Mazin do here is expand a few loose threads from the previous films or rather 'episodes'. It begins with our jailed Korean lunatic Leslie Chow escaping Klong Klem prison after creating a prison riot to distract authorities. On the other side, rich bum Alan seems to live his life leisurely, buying a giraffe and accidentally killing it and indulging in similar misdemeanours. That's when Alan's family and his buddies, including fellow 'Wolfpack' members Phil, Stu and Doug, decide that he needs an intervention. <br/><br/>And so our four heroes embark on another journey, expecting nothing to bother them this time. But soon their journey turns to another wild ride when a couple of guys in pig-faced masks ram their vehicle and kidnap them in broad daylight. They are taken to an isolated spot, where we learn that their kidnappers are Marshall's men, which includes Doug; Doug had a minor role in the first film and Marshall's name was only mentioned by him once in that film. <br/><br/>Marshall informs Phil, Stu and Doug that their friend Alan has been in constant touch with Leslie Chow via the internet; the two crazy net-pals loved sharing the inane and insane misdemeanours they committed, it seems. Marshall wants to hunt Chow down and get the gold-bricks (worth millions) that Chow stole from Marshall's men (they in turn had stolen it from the bank) years ago. Now that he has found the only link to Chow, he gives Phil, Stu and Alan the task of finding the madman and bringing him to Marshall. If they fail, Doug, who shall remain with Marshall's men, will be killed. <br/><br/>It doesn't take much time to find Chow as the guy tells Alan via internet to meet him in Mexico. Chow is really a disgusting piece of sh*t who shall, for Christians at least, die a horrible death in hell! The insane guy who speaks very much like Hannibal Lecter, brags how he spends his time in Mexico (you know the way most people do) cockfighting, giving men blowj*bs etc (certainly going to hell!... According to Orthodox Christians, at least). The four make a plan to retrieve the stolen gold from 'Chow's mansion' in Mexico, and they succeed, except that it's not Chow's mansion but Marshall's and the 'stolen' gold was Marshall's half that wasn't stolen by Chow before (but it is now, obviously).<br/><br/>Now it would hardly make sense for Marshall to rely on Phil, Alan and Stu but the makers of Hangover need an excuse to harass our trio further. So Marshall orders them to find Chow, get gold or Doug's dead. The makers also need to come up with an 'intervention' for rich bum Alan, so there's a 'what-can-at-least-in-this-case-be-deemed- as-touching' moment between him and Jade's son Tyler (Jade is recurrent character from Hangover 1) plus his romantic connection with Cassie, a pawnbroker who rejoices in treating her mom like sh*t. All roads finally leads the three to Vegas, where it all ends indeed.<br/><br/>There are a lot many times you'd hear the f-word in Hangover III, usually in flat and unimaginative dialogues like 'F*ck!' 'What the f*ck's going on?' 'Motherf*cker'. We chuckle a couple of times, then start wondering whether it's really funny. Do the filmmakers want us to guffaw like an idiotic teenager whenever the 'f-word' is spoken? Is being nasty all the time real comedy? <br/><br/>Even the situations in which the characters are thrown are given very less thought. Consider the scene where Chow and Stu enter the mansion to disable security cameras and buzzers before the rest can proceed. Except for Chow acting like a mad dog (literally), crawling on his fours, sniffing Stu's butt and later saying he's color-blind while instructing Stu which color wire to disable, nothing else is done to make the situation more interesting. Hangover III has one-dimensional situations, and that's just sad.<br/><br/>The trio of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are barely risible and act like they've been given a chore. On one hand, a cardboard would've looked more excited than the disinterested Bradley Cooper and on the other hand, Ed Helms does bad comedy. With more focus given to Zach's character Alan this time, he fares better yet totally fails on occasions. Like the part where Alan complements Phil's body in a Diesel t- shirt (never include product placement in a joke): a total FAIL. It's only fresher (to the series) Melissa McCarthy as pawnbroker Cassie who injects some freshness to this feeble film. <br/><br/>The movie says 'It all ends here' but Tyler's and McCarthy's introduction plus the post- credits scene hint there's more Hangover in store. Wish these guys would hang up their boots and retire and say ""Nevermore!""."

Animal-related scenes are not to everyone's taste, but the share of dirty sex jokes has significantly diminished (in order to widen the audience?).<br/><br/>As for the cast, the 3rd movie is focused mainly on Zach Galifianakis' character Alan Garner (ZG outperforms all his co-stars); Ken Jeong as Leslie Chow and John Goodman as Marshall provide catchy performances as well. The other characters are less elaborated and even a splendid actor like Bradley Cooper has to strain to the utmost. Female characters are sketchy and nothing special, they appear seldom on the screen.<br/><br/>If you at least tolerated Hangover I and Hangover II, then you could watch the final series as well as it rounds up the trilogy in a nice manner."

Okay maybe a little bit more than the right amount but I could handle it. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it wasn't the best film out of the trilogy and didn't follow the normal pattern of a bachelor party gone wrong, but it was a great laugh. <br/><br/>I recommend you watch The Hangover I & II before you see III, you don't have to but for those people who like a story-line, The 3rd film would make more sense if you did. <br/><br/>P.S Watch out for the surprise at the end. Brilliant cliff-hanger. <br/><br/><ul><li>xoxo</li></ul>"
"toddatthemovies","5","1","2","11 June 2013"," Hangover III: Chowabunga!
","The movie opens with Alan in the midst of transporting a giraffe in a trailer he is pulling. I don't need to elaborate that this trip does not end well. As the result of Alan's mishap we see the gang first appear together at a funeral for Alans father played by a scene stealing Jeffrey Tambor. The fact that the film starts at a funeral instead of a wedding is a not so subtle hint that this hangover will prove to be even darker than the first two. The introduction sequence ends with the gang driving Alan to a mental health spa after an intervention.<br/><br/>The film takes another tangent and the set up for the inciting incident comes from a gangster out of the past that kidnaps one of the gang and sending the wolf pack back into action to rescue their own. This is quite a bit different than the initial two films. There is not hangover and they didn't do anything wrong...yet. The gangster is played by John Goodman and there are not many actors that are such a sure thing as he is in any role. There is even a surprise character here from the past that while this may not have been the most creative plot, they were a stickler for detail and a lot of attention is paid to the details. if you keep your eyes open there are shout outs and homages throughout. <br/><br/>The movie here really focuses on Alan and Mr. Chow as not only the main characters, but really the only characters. Stu, Phil and Doug could have just been cardboard props for the movie and you would have saved a ton of money and lost very little in the way of acting. Ken Jeong, as Mr. Chow, absolutely steals the show. His character should have a place in all time best character anti hero. This film would not be watchable without Mr. Chow. he takes a film on life support and gives it a level up to a pretty decent movie. It's not a great film, it's a pretty decent movie. It's shot wonderfully, lit perfectly, great audio, decent to really good acting and enough plot twists and nostalgia to be worthwhile. Make sure you wait to watch the credits. It's a steal at redbox or the Dollar show and if you get your tickets at costco like I do it's a fair deal. Big screen is always best. Support the craft by seeing it in theaters and support the theaters by buying some concessions. Till Next time.<br/><br/>Todd at the Movies, on twitter for your entertainment"
"fenevar","7","1","2","11 June 2013"," Nothing great, but enjoyable.
","The Hangover Part Three initially didn't draw very much excitement from fans of the series, but when it was announced that John Goodman would be in the film, that stirred up interest from people who weren't even fans of the original. However, the film didn't seem to make very good use of the incredible actor. He gets very little screen time, but for what he does have in the film, he is fantastic. The Hangover Part Three is most certainly an enjoyable ride, recalling scenes from the first Hangover, and adding in a sense of conclusion to the series. Don't get me wrong, the movie is nothing great. It most certainly will not go down in history as one of the great comedies. But it is easily better than The Hangover Part II to say the least. And not as if it really matters in the quality of a film, but the film is certainly far more appropriate than it's two previous films. The acting is hilarious, especially on the part of Galifianakis, who is fantastic in each role he has ever been given. Cooper is also a great actor in the film. I would suggest the film to anyone who watched the other two, or even just the first one. It doesn't live up to the great originality of the first, but it's certainly fun, and has a few laugh out loud moments."
"raggzycj","3","1","2","11 June 2013"," Dull, random, poor quality plot.
","None of the three Hangover movies have been spectacular, but the two first ones were quite amusing. The Hangover part III however, is another story. The movie started off very dull, and the supposed funny scenes were by no means amusing, its was just stupid. The part about the giraf could have been funny, if it hadn't been used in ever SINGLE advertisement for the hangover!. However the plot does develop, just not into anything good. The whole concept of hangover, and the feeling of ""shit, that's happened to me"" does not apply to this movie at all. There is nothing anyone can related to, unless they have been involved with gang-people ofc. I know I laughed three times during the movie, once it was actually genuinely funny, and the other times I laughed because I felt stupid having wasted so much money watching this movie. It is simply just a fail. However, based on the ending of the movie, there is potential for a 4th one, but the 3rd one should never have been made. It dragged on, had little funny content, and the actors seemed bored as well."
"faiz-can","Null","1","2","10 June 2013"," A big disappointment.
","From hangover 1 to 3, it is a constant downward graph of entertainment. I loved the first movie and somehow accepted the second as an average but this is truly a disgrace. The storyline was very weak, although acting was good but that was not enough. The plot was too stupid and short, hard to believe that it came from same brilliant minds who made the first movie. It seemed like everyone in this movie were forced to work on this project. <br/><br/>Although there were some funny moments by Zach, who was the main character in this movie. Other characters like Bradely and Helms were merely a supporting cast in this movie. Everyone can easily skip this movie and watch the first Hangover movie again!"
"Alexey_Maximov_King","5","1","2","10 June 2013"," Inevitable, but unnecessary and lazy.
","So I came to a movie theater, sat through this film for 100 minutes and when the credits started rolling I was like, ""OK guys, the joke was too long, and now show me the real third 'Hangover' that I came to see. It turns out that there is no real third 'Hangover' and we have to get what's given. And what's given is too little. Yes, the first two films did well in the box-office so the third part was inevitable but it's not an excuse for this film being such a lifeless comedy. There is no drive, no epicness that were in parts 1 & 2. The Wolf Pack look tired and absolutely not interested in being in this film, some other characters appear just to show a familiar face and don't have memorable scenes and the storyline feels superficial and concocted out of thin air. Yes, I did have a couple of good laughs and maybe it would work better as just another comedy but you expect much more from a Hangover movie.<br/><br/>5/10"
"ricardopthomaz","4","1","2","9 June 2013"," Unfunny... 'till the credits roll.
","OK, this one... I don't know, maybe it's me, but I thought it was one of the most unfunny ""comedy"" I ever saw these last years. And it disappoints me, because the first one was so funny, and even the second one, even being a bad sequel, a little forced, seeming like a rehash of the first, and very inferior compared to the first, had it's bits. But this... I was at the theater and I was like being Mr. Ice, you know, just small giggles here and there stashed in the whole thing... I mean, is this it? Terrible!<br/><br/>The movie is terrible as a comedy. And it really shows, because we don't have a decent joke 'till the very end of it. It's more like an adventure film where three regular guys has to help their friend. I got myself thinking all the time, ""ok, when will the jokes start popping?"" But no, no... no jokes at all, no laughs. Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>And on top of that, the movie just seems to forget that it's a Hangover movie! There's no hangover, all the wolfpack are sober as hell, there's no marriage, and you know what? I found these changes a little riveting! Contrived, but still riveting! I really respect Todd Philips in his initiative about going to a different direction, because it tries to give you something different! But it could seem a little bit more like a comedy, that's inexcusable! And that's where the movie fails to attend your expectations. It worries so much about wrapping up and finishing this bigger story than to give you something really funny which should be concern number one! And it doesn't even work to give you a decent moral in the end. What did we learn at the end of the saga? What was accomplished? Nothing!<br/><br/>So the movie closes with scenes from the last two movies to show you that it really ended and you're left in the dust.<br/><br/>But then, when the movie ends and the credits roll... something happens! The movie suddenly remembers that it should be a Hangover movie and a COMEDY in first place and gives you the funniest sequence on the entire movie! I'm not kidding! The credits roll and in one minute we see what the movie should have been the whole time! And you laugh like crazy! I was telling my brother ""c'mon man, let's go, this blewed!"" and all, but then... I was laughing!! I was finally laughing at something! I want to know what happens after that extra scene! C'mon, mr. Todd Philips, show me!!<br/><br/>But that's it, it ends... I mean, really? When it was finally returning to the bullshit we know and love, you just decided to stop and halt the whole thing?? What a rip off!<br/><br/>You really wanna check this movie? I cannot recommend it, as I am so disappointed, but if you're really curious, then go! At least it still provides 100 minutes of some escapism and you can ask for someone to wake you up in the last sequence. And I beg you, if you're really seeing it, stay until the end, because it has a final reward that saves your day!<br/><br/>My recommendation? Wait for it to show on TV, or rent the DVD when it comes out."
"ticolys","5","1","2","7 June 2013"," Could have been a lot worse...
","The movie isn't a total failure after all... Although they have changed the formula from the first 2 films, the movie would have been somewhat better in my opinion if it was more like the first 2, making the scene at the end the only thing that stayed true to this franchise. The plot was pretty stupid and the whole film is pretty much only based on only 2 characters, Alan,played by Zach Galifianakis and Mr Chow, played by Ken Jeong, making the others rather forgettable.<br/><br/>Overall.. This movie could've been a lot better if they thought of a better plot. <br/><br/>Rating: 4(+1 for ending scene) = 5"
"omega_work","8","1","2","6 June 2013"," Glad I got to see this film in the cinema
","My rating of 8/10 was a bit generous, but my thinking was that in my small way I want to off-set all the negative reviews.<br/><br/>It might have been a benefit to have gone into the film with low expectations, but in the end it was a funny film and I'm glad I went to see it.<br/><br/>First off, the format is different from the first two films, it's a much more linear time line. The second major difference is that Mr. Chow plays a much larger role in this one (which was a positive thing from my perspective).<br/><br/>The premise of this film is that some of the events from the first film -- the drug mix up, as well as Alan's on-going relationship with Mr. Chow has a crime boss using them to get to Chow. To be honest, it seemed a little bit contrived, but they made it work pretty well (unlike such debacles as the Scream movies).<br/><br/>Chow perhaps has the greatest character arch, although Alan is more the focal point of the film. One of the things they seemed to bring out more in this film was the animosity between Alan and Stuart, which made for some enjoyable bickering.<br/><br/>I have to say that I'm glad I got to see this film in the cinema. For a film that could easily be seen as a ""buddy flick"", or a rental it actually had some moments that were really enjoyable in the theatre due to the scope of it. Specifically a sequence on the roof of Caeser's palace with some well choreographed and filmed vertigo-inducing moments.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to compare this to the first two films because I enjoyed both, and having gone in with low expectations, they were exceeded. So all I will leave you with, is that if the humour of the other movies appeals to you, I'm certain you will have an enjoyable time at this movie."
"ivern-326-711636","7","1","2","5 June 2013"," It Needs To End!
","The Hangover Part III is the ""conclusion"" to the Hangover trilogy. Well, let me tell you something: If it's marketed as a conclusion and you even give it the tag-line ""the end"", then why don't you end it?!<br/><br/>The story is that Doug is held hostage by a fat guy played by John Goodman. So the rest of the Wolfpack have to bring him Chow in order to save their friend. But it all turns into a tug- of-war with the Wolfpack between John Goodman and Chow.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to The Hangover Part III, mainly because I surprisingly enjoyed The Hangover Part II. I don't know, I guess I have a thing for repeated formulas. Another reason I was looking forward to this movie was because the tag-line said ""the end"", and the commercials even stated ""the epic conclusion to the Hangover trilogy"". I always like when series end, because I always look for satisfying conclusions. Hell, Toy Story 3 is one of my favorite movies. I have at thing for conclusions.<br/><br/>However, The Hangover Part III is nothing of what I expected. I hoped it would end. It doesn't. There is no conclusion in this movie. And don't worry, this is not spoiling anything. This is just a fair warning for those whose expectations are high. This is by no means an epic conclusion to the saga, leaving you satisfied thinking ""man, we had a great run"".<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the good stuff. First off, Hangover Part III is pretty funny. However, it is not as funny as the previous movies because of two reasons: One is that there is no hangover in the movie. Two is that it's more of an action thriller rather than a comedy. Now don't worry, it's still pretty funny. But it's more like those buddy cop movies where there's an equal amount of action and comedy. The best example I can think of is Beverly Hills Cop.<br/><br/>However the biggest problem with The Hangover Part III is that it's just so incredibly bland and uninteresting. It doesn't leave you with any thoughts about it really, other than that it was a huge missed opportunity.<br/><br/>There is a pretty touching scene during the last half of the movie, but I won't say anything about it, other than it was probably the only time it lived up to the name ""the epic conclusion of the Hangover trilogy"". It took the series in a nice full circle, but nothing significant or anything. It doesn't qualify either way.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hangover Part III is a fun movie to watch if you don't have anything else to do. I mean, it's still a funny movie to watch with friends. But it's by no means the best comedy of the year so far, and you probably won't be satisfied with it."
"Laakbaar","5","1","2","5 June 2013"," Just going through the motions
","I chuckled a few times, but this third film in the Hangover franchise didn't really work for me. It just wasn't as funny or as original as Hangover I and II.<br/><br/>It was like everyone involved was just going through the motions, including the writers. They were obviously trying to add more depth to the Alan and Chow characters. At times, it all became too serious, forced, and even awkward. The plot felt contrived.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that there was no hangover this time. I'm sorry, but this franchise sort of requires it.<br/><br/>The fun in I and II was partly based on the craziness of Vegas and Bangkok, but here they didn't set the movie in a third crazy city. They just went back to Vegas (via Mexico). OK, they were in Tijuana for a bit, and could have set the craziness there, but for some reason they passed.<br/><br/>There were a number of rather phony male bonding scenes in this movie. We are led to think that they are not just idiots who got caught up in stupid antics in Las Vegas and Bangkok; they are now men who -- often and openly -- say in rather strong terms that they are very close friends. (""I love you Alan"".) But at the same time, there were quite a few jokes relating to Alan's and Chow's attraction to men, specifically Alan's man-crush on Phil. The two half-witted girls two rows back were guffawing every time. (I suppose the movie was made for them.) <br/><br/>After the third joke, it started to bother me and I became uncomfortable with it. Chow and Alan just became sad figures, in my eyes at least. So many comments about the Wolf Pack bonding with each other, but the gay aspect is held up to ridicule. By the end I felt I was watching the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The oafish anti-Semitic joke and animal scenes didn't work for me either. None of it did really. It just wasn't funny."

","This movie starts out lame...I mean a giraffe getting beheaded? It would take a master of scripts to make this somehow funny. It's a foreboding because the rut this digs the rest of the movie wallows in.<br/><br/>The four ""buddies"" had chemistry in the first installment of ""The Hangover""...So, what the hell happened? A money grab, pure and simple. No creativity in the writing and what director could save this screenplay is beyond human understanding.<br/><br/>The fat bearded guy needs an intervention. The three other ""Wolf Packers"" volunteer. They never get where they're going because of ""circumstances"" involving Chow and some garbage about his gold brick heist. John Goodman plays a mobster whose henchmen run the Wolf Pack down and kidnap them. The sweet guy ends up a hostage until the others find Chow and the missing loot.<br/><br/>Let's go to Mexico and find Chow because The Mob always hires idiots to do this kind of work. You know the Wolf Pack, in it's sophistication, are experts at not only finding Chow when The Mob can't, but retrieving the gold...Yeah! Well, just in case this doesn't prime the machine isn't it a good idea that Chow double-crosses The Wolf Pack in order for the movie to shift to good 'ol VEGAS!<br/><br/>Sad to say, but nothing works here. There is so little humor that hits this is more like a study ""why sequels suck""! This is the rare movie that probably will have a blockbuster first weekend and won't last three. Not only that, it's so lackluster on-demand and DVD sales will likely tank too just due to word-of-mouth. Yes, it is that bad. This is the ""Heaven's Gate"" of sequels (pure $#!+). If you must see it find a way to do so at no expense to yourself...That way the only thing you've wasted is time."

","I went into this film feeling optimistic, as I loved the first two films; they were both funny and original. Hangover part 3 on the other hand in not. I don't remember coming out of a comedy, even if its crap, and not laughing at least once. This film felt very long and lacked everything a comedy like this should have. They also ruin the character Alan in this movie, which I thought would have been an impossible job but they managed to do it. He comes over, yes as a retard, but also as an ass and a character that I loved in the first two movies I now dislike in this film. The only good thing about this film was the plot line. I thought the plot was actually stronger than the other two movies and I know I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had any funny bits at all. Todd Philips brings us a disappointing and humourless ending to his trilogy. This film in my opinion is a waste of time and it is not one I will be watching again. <br/><br/>2.5/5- poor!!!!!"
"dutchtea-322-789530","8","1","2","3 June 2013"," hangover part 3 my review
","The Hangover movies always had a mean/dark streak to them.( I mean the way Alan treats his mum isn't nice to say the least) The 3rd one is no exception. As usual it's Alan and Leslie Chow who are the instigators. Phil, Stu and Doug have moved on with their happy uneventful lives. Alan has gone overboard not taking his medicines which makes him even more unpredictable and mean that ever before. After a freak-accident with a giraffe, his father confronts him which doesn't end well for him because he dies immediately after-wards. On the funeral the Wolfpack reunites and after seeing some of Alans antics they decide to stage an intervention. So they get on their way to New Horizons which is supposed to make Alan a changed man. They never get there of course, because they get run of the road by a gang of thugs led by a guy called Marshall played by John Goodman. He lost a lot of money because of Leslie Chow and he figures the wolfpack has the best chance of finding this oddball. He takes poor Doug hostage and forces the others on their way to find Chow and his money. While it's true that the gags are scarce that doesn't mean the movie isn't funny. Also a lot of loose ends from the first movie get a fitting end. Especially seeing Jade doing really well is kinda gratifying. There's a very nice cameo by Melissa Mc Carthy who turns out to be the one for Alan. So while this isn't laughs all the way through it's still fun to watch and nowhere near as dull as the reviews had made me believe. Don't go away after it ends...there's one after credits scene which has to be seen to be believed."

I stopped the 2nd film after 10 minutes from the start: it just seemed a bad cover of the first one; I just could not watch it. I succeeded watching all this 3rd installment and I have to say that you should watch it just if you feel you'd like the story to go on. The story in fact goes on: there're new elements, there's some little fun and there's some action. But in the end there are 2 sceneries:<br/><br/>1) You didn't watch the series: then you won't like the film overall since it's just an average action/comedy linked to previous installments that you won't enjoy since it recalls a lot of previous episodes. 2) You watched the series: then you won't find the hilarious moments of the first HANGOVER (in the second I expect you won't find any).<br/><br/>Oh forgot another scenery...<br/><br/>3) You watched the series and you care for the characters: my advice is to watch it and then... rehab maybe...<br/><br/>4,5 to 5.

","Hangover plays into all the clichés of great films with little to no humor. To start of, in the beginning of the film the director make a parody to Shawshank's Redemption. What a disappointment....my question is why start of the film that way. Not only was it not funny it felt like a mockery of one of the greatest films of all time. Throughout the film there were a few chuckles here and there especially at the end. If you watch this at the theaters make to stay to was the ending credits, that was the funniest part of the entire film. With so much hype about the film I expected more. The plot and storyline was too scattered. Las Vegas should have been the center point to culminate the film and it just became a backdrop to a lackluster ending. To simply put it...what a shame I expected better."
"lilantman10","4","1","2","28 May 2013"," How the Mighty Have Fallen
","I liked Hangover. It was a cool movie with a really fun story and a great cast with a damn good script behind them. One of my least favorite aspects was Alan and Chow, the two characters with the least amount of actual good writing. Now the actors worked with what they had, but overall outside of anybody in high school they weren't that funny.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Jack Sparrow , essentially a side character in the original pirates movie, was modeled sort of like Han Solo. Start of as a side character and then given a prominent role. Now anybody who watched Return of the Jedi will attest to the fact that Han Solo is actually the weakest part of that movie next to the ewoks. Same as Jack sparrow until the series was actually tailored around him he made the series worse the more he was there. Case I'm trying to make LESS is MORE.<br/><br/>Alan might be funny to some people, but he essentially ruins any believability in the movies. Granted in the first one he was a nice guy and was loyal. He was dumb, sweet, and awkward, but there was redeeming qualities about him. <br/><br/>Now he's just a jerk. There's nothing to like every problem the main characters have is because of him after Hangover 1. Now this wouldn't be such a big problem except all the jokes in Hangover Part II are tailored around him and Chow. <br/><br/>I love a lot of things about both this and Hangover Part II. They are significantly darker and have a lot more realism then the first movie. Which totally gets undercut by having alan and Chang in ever scene acting impossibly over the top and stupid. I like that this is basically a thriller and that the laughs aren't as important, but even then the thriller aspects aren't handled very well. <br/><br/>The Best Hangover movies right now are Hangover 1, Pain and Gain, and Horrible Bosses. There's your trilogy 3 great movies which understand story structure and dark humor and silly absurd humor. We all know these obligatory sequels are impossible to get away from. Catch it at Redbox you might enjoy it more."

","I liked The Hangover(2009) it was funny, edgy, and entertaining. The Hangover part 2(2011) was a rehash of the first one, but it was funny so that makes it passable. But The Hangover part 3(2013), was none of the above. Don't get me wrong, I'll give them credit for trying to go in a different direction, but why call it The Hangover, when there is no hangover, why not just call it The Wolfpack, and people would still believe it was hangover sequel.<br/><br/>The comedy was not even hit and miss, it was just a big miss completely. It's less on laughs, and more on being a crime thriller, and it fails miserably. The cast this time just can't make it work, it does not look like they are having any fun. Ken Jeong as Chow was funny in the first two, but here he is nothing more than a one big headache. I just couldn't wait to get out of there. For a good time, not this one."
"jadepietro","Null","1","2","27 May 2013"," The Hangover III: Charmless and Humorless
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>I don't know at what point I began to truly dislike The Hangover Part III. There were so many opportunities before the film descended into an incoherent mess. Was it when the giraffe was decapitated? When a rooster was slowly smothered to death in the misguided name of comedy? Was it when Ken Jeong's annoying character, Mr. Chow, entered the film and was neither decapitated or killed? <br/><br/>Who knows, but I can tell you this: The film's 100 minute length seems interminable, devoid of any humor or merit. Its sole purpose of existence is making a buck or two million from its undiscriminating fan base who lap up this cinematic swill. The film's disclaimer states that no animals were hurt in the filming of this movie, but the movie-going audience does suffer and needs to be put out of its misery...fast. <br/><br/>The filmmakers take their successful formula and rarely stray from that premise. The formula of vulgar jokes and inane debauchery again follows the mishaps of three closely knit child- men, four, if you count Doug (Justin Bartha) who usually is MIA during most of the film. (Mr. Bartha needs to thank his agent for his lack of screen time here.) The boys, Stu and Phil (Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper, disrespectfully), are united once again to bring Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to rehab. Along the way to Arizona, they encounter a mobster (John Goodman) and are sent on a mission to retrieve some stolen gold and the aforementioned Mr. Chow, landing them back in Sin City, NV.<br/><br/>Mixing the Hope / Crosby 40's road movie format and the Three Stooges slapstick antics, and adding more than a dash of gross-out sophomoric humor and ribald sexual comedy, The Hangover Part III lacks any originality or clever moments. (Even the Wolfpack trio, as they are called, too closely resemble Moe (Cooper), Larry (Helms), and Curly (Galifianakis) in their character hierarchy.) There's nothing new here. The film rehashes itself in a desperate attempt to appear to be hip and cool, but the results are merely contrived and dull.<br/><br/>Misdirected by Todd Phillips and poorly written by him and Craig Mazin, The Hangover Part III is sloppy drunk in its execution. There are no funny lines and hilarious situations, just tired and lazy writing. The sight gags don't work. The decision to give the obnoxious Mr. Chow almost equal screen time as the three lead characters was a major misfire. All of the actors, who have proved to be fine actors in other films, are certainly slumming here. I guess the cast's ability not to look remotely embarrassed spouting off the film's lame dialog and non-zingers does amount to the lowest possible form of acting, but it's such a waste of assembled talent for this movie, although only Galifianakis gives his character some nuance.<br/><br/>This series so proudly wears its gross-out comedy status on its sleeve. While the first installment had some genuine laughs, the second entry had few and was a major disappointment, even with its pot-smoking, penis-nibbling monkey. This third (and supposedly) final chapter is laugh-less and lifeless. What happened in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas, or never have even begun. The Hangover Part III is truly awful. GRADE: D<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com <br/><br/>NOTE: There is an extra segment in the end credits that does produce a grin or two.

","It's the final Hangover to deal with for the Wolfpack, four years after the original film was a surprise major hit at the box office hit making its stars household names in the process the team have reunited to finish what they started. The second film was met with mix reviews, some claiming the film was just the same recycled plot and jokes from the first one and many giving the film rave reviews clearly happy to have more of the same from the WolfPack. Director Todd Phillips has been insistent that this final entry in the trilogy will be different and not another rehash of the first film again. Has he lived up to his promise or is it just the same film for the second time?<br/><br/>Well yes, to give its film its credit the film does deviate from the tested narrative that has been used in the previous two installments adopting a crime narrative in which Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifanakis) have to track down the infamous Mr Chow (Ken Jeong) in order to rescue Doug (Justin Bartha) from a crime lord called Marshall (John Goodman). This plot inevitably sends the group to Las Vegas, whilst tying up all the loose ends that you didn't even remember from the previous films, such as who Alan bought the drugs from in the original (From Marshall). Most of these tying up loose ends are very unnecessary and feel as if they were just added to tie the film back the original in order for them to have some reason to return to Vegas.<br/><br/>Given the new premise you would think that the film would capitalise on this and take the series to a interesting and hopefully hilarious finale, they sadly do not. The humor is still the same gross out OTT humor as in the first two installments, possibly a tiny bit more restrained but they more than make up for that in the final post credit scene (more on that later). John Goodman who even in a film as bad as it could be would still be entertaining is great in his minor role as Marshall is criminally underused and you beg for him to have more screen time then he actually does, criminally underused. <br/><br/>The films main problem is the increased role given to Ken Jeong as Leslie Chow, he was fine in the first film as he was only on screen for a grand total of 10 minutes and his wacky/camp persona was tolerable. In the second he had a greater role and became irritating very quickly, however in this he has equal billing with the rest of the cast and is intolerable including, It's the same joke's over and over again (including the classic small penis gem from the second film) and even though Jeong looks as if hes enjoying himself it just seems this film is just a tester for a Chow spin off. <br/><br/>Where as in the first and second film the cast seemed to be having fun and at least enjoying themselves, in this film it's clear that no one cares about their performance and is there simply because they are contractually obliged to be in this film. The performances are all phoned in especially Bradley Cooper who looks as if he's on autopilot for the film, hoping that doing this won't damage his Oscar chances in the future. <br/><br/>The film ends on a climatic note at Alan's wedding and it seems that the series has reached its conclusion, but then comes a post credit scene that makes the entire film incredibly pointless, A scene plays in which all three members of the Wolfpack wake up after Alan's wedding in a destroyed room, including the monkey from the second film, Stu with breast implants and a naked Mr Chow who alleged sent them a drugged wedding cake. This is terrible for the simple reason that this is the final film in this series and this ending just contradicts the whole film in order to make two or three cheap gags that have been made consistently throughout the previous two films. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Hangover Three attempts to try something new but turns into a bit of a mess recycling jokes and clichés from the first two films, the cast are gliding through this film waiting for it to finally end and they can move onto new projects. This will probably be the last time we see the Wolfpack (until a horrendous remake in 10 years time) and it has to go down as a missed opportunity for the franchise."
"FilmGangster","4","1","2","24 May 2013"," Just another another average flick.
","Let me start off by saying that I am an avid movie, film and TV show watcher and collector. However, as with any review, this is just my opinion. I know a lot about movies, but that does not qualify me or anyone to tell someone what is a good film. I believe that a true movie fan, should watch any and all movies. But that is not possible, so we read reviews to decide what to watch. Just take reviews with a grain of salt, if you want to see a movie... do it. Don't let bad review(s) detour you.<br/><br/>Now I am a fan of the Hangover movies. I have seen the first two, and own both of them. The first one is great, the second one not so much. This one is radically different then the first two in the series. First, the third one has more of a plot than the second and even the first. I think this is a good thing, I love the first one but I wish it had more going on. Second, the film is not as explicit as either of the first two. The second one especially was just a lot of gross out humor. Even the first one had some, but Hangover: Part III goes for more awkward situations. To top it all off Hangover: Part III is not even about a hangover.<br/><br/>In short I thought Hangover: Part III was average and forgettable. I give it 5 out of 10. It is loads better than Hangover: Part II and stills fails to live up to The Hangover. There were a few giggles for me but over all I didn't even find it that funny. I will not be buying this one, and I bought Part II. The director Todd Phillips has shown that he has skill when it comes to comedy with films like Old School and The Hangover. I just wish he would stop making sequels to The Hangover."

","Some time after the events in Bangkok, Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) have turned thankfully towards mundane lives with family, but Alan (Zachary Galifianakis) remains unsettled. The ramifications of a giraffe purchase send Alan's father (Jeffrey Tambor) into cardiac arrest, reuniting the Wolfpack with the intention of sending Alan to a mental rehabilitation facility. On the way, the four are attacked by a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman) who wants several million dollars worth of gold returned to him after being stolen by Chow. <br/><br/>The first film in this series was a breath of fresh comic air - timely, hilarious, a real ""guy movie"" that the ladies wouldn't have any part of. The sequel was a summer blockbuster; not as funny, considerably darker, but still a worthy addition to the Hangover brand. The finale drops the premise of its prequels to focus on three action packed days with nary a mention of the drugs and alcohol that sent our heroes into a memory loss stupor. The third is different entirely from the first two, and therefore can't be compared as the third in a trilogy, but as the sequel to the first two. <br/><br/>One of the most fascinating characters is Stu, the dentist with a dark side who does things that I'm not sure I am able to write about here without being reported. The most tame act he commits is a sham marriage to a baby-wielding prostitute, yet in the third film he manages to drive a limo around. Crazily. Phil, the level-headed macho man, makes the obligatory call to tell the others the trio has give up. Here, he helplessly looks around as Chow plays them for fools. Even Alan, played by the expert comic Galifianakis, only gets chuckles as he hits on the fat girl from Bridesmaids who expertly plays the fat girl from Bridesmaids. <br/><br/>The characters are less developed and do less, which should be expected in the trifecta, but perhaps we expected more out of Todd Phillips and his crazy, drug-addled world. The formula is gone but the characters are there, the hilarity is gone but the situations are there. It's difficult to judge The Hangover 3. It plays out like it has been filmed but not finished; as if this is the bow hastily tied on to the series before the temptation to make more could be unwrapped."
"ZChrisJ1995","6","1","2","23 May 2013"," Flawed, yet worthwhile return
","The wolfpack is back, for the last time apparently. But whilst The Hangover Part III is definitely an improvement over the series' carbon copy first sequel, on the whole it still is just a shadow of its former self. Don't get me wrong though, it does have its moments, and is a worthwhile experience in the end.<br/><br/>After a rather gruesome incident involving a giraffe, it is decided that Alan is to be placed in a mental home. Of course, Phil, Stu and Doug accompany him to this location. Along the way, they are attacked by a group of criminals who take Doug hostage and threaten to kill him unless the remaining trio retrieve a recently escaped Mr. Chow, who has stolen a substantial amount of money belonging to the criminals.<br/><br/>Perhaps after the critical panning that the second film received, Todd Phillips has decided to move in a more original direction plot-wise, completing removing the titular hangover element, in which the protagonists are forced to retrace their steps from the drunken night before. This is quite risky, as it deprives the film of its unpredictability, and instead gives the impression of a standard chase film. Nevertheless, the formula still works, if not as well.<br/><br/>In terms of the characters, Ken Jeong as Chow seems to have taken over the comedic role usually played by Zack Galifianakis, who is now reserved to the odd awkward one-liner or moment. Though I loved Chow in the first movie, it does get quite tedious watching him repeatedly yell out phrases such as: ""I LOVE COCAINE!"", all for the purpose of a cheap laugh. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms aren't given enough comedic focus as they could, which is a shame, as they are both quite talented and capable of such, as shown by the first film.<br/><br/>It's nice to see a lot of references to the previous movies, with appearances from Black Doug, and even Carlos, or Tyler, from the first film. This, alongside the presence of Las Vegas in the final act, is quite a nostalgic turn, inspiring good memories from the original Hangover. The comedy is quite darker than the previous films, which I found worked quite well, even though it sometimes leaned into more of an action-thriller category rather than a standard comedy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, although The Hangover Part III does falter, I would recommend viewing it, if anything to say a final farewell to the characters that we have grown to love over the past few years. Though not as funny or as insane as the first film, it is still decent viewing, and there is the odd flash of brilliance, which is something I can't say as sincerely for the second film. It is quite a melancholy, bittersweet affair, as the final scenes do truly indicate that this is the last time we'll see the wolfpack. That is, until the box office returns are revealed.<br/><br/>Final note: There's a mid-credits scene which in my opinion is the funniest part of the whole film. Make sure you stay back and watch it."

","I didn't expect much of this film and I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. It was hard to get past the opening which was one of the stupidest opening movie scenes since Grown Ups 2.<br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis stars in this while Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms play supporting characters who are fairly unnecessary. Even the character of Chow is more important to the film than Cooper or Helm's characters. <br/><br/>Chow was a fun character in the other movies. In this film he is just dark and bitter like the movie itself.<br/><br/>This film is a comedy without any real comedy. There is just swearing instead of funny dialogue. It is also an action movie without much action. Mostly random violent shootings, however, there is one thrilling scene in Vegas in the vein of Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>On a positive, the film does have some very nice scenery of California.<br/><br/>This movie is trash and you deserve to feed your mind something better."

","""Feels good to be out. Tell no one. I'll be in touch, Chow."" Two years after the events of Bangkok the wolf pack is settling back into normality. Normal for Alan (Galifianakis) is not taking his meds and buying giraffes. After the death of his father the group gets together to take him to rehab. While on their way they get stopped and are given an ultimatum. They must find Chow, who has stolen money from this man, or their friend Doug will die. I enjoyed the first Hangover but didn't go crazy over it like everyone else. The second one I didn't like mainly because it was just a remake and rehash of the same jokes. I was a little leery going in to this one because of that. This one actually has a different plot and that fact alone made it better then the second one. Rather then piecing together the events of the previous night this one is about the events the group gets into trying to catch Chow (who in my opinion is the best part of the series). This isn't really a review that will convince you to watch or not watch since it is the third in the series, but I will say that I really liked this one more then I expected. Overall, if you liked the first two you will love this. If you didn't like the second one you will like this. I give it a B+."

","Obviously, Todd Phillips completely milked the concept of The Hangover dry. He didn't even stick to the same concept, indeed we're not in the post-party morning situation anymore, where the Wolf Pack has to put the pieces together. Here, we're dealing with a little inspired script that doesn't have that freshness and craziness the first two opus had. Most of the scenes are laborious and only a handful of lines barely crack the viewer a smile. As one expected, the quality of the series went decrescendo with a very good first opus, a second one already pretty average, and this third one ending the franchise on a mediocre note."

They just had to make more money off sequels that lacked any great or even good enough ideas to merit making sequels over. I really wanted my money back after watching this atrocious movie they call a comedy. None of the audiences even laughed or even chuckled including myself, except maybe for one joke near the end. None of the cast seemed to be trying anymore except maybe Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong. But even they just try to be overly obnoxious and tries so darn hard to be funny with crap materials.

"DareDevilKid","8","1","3","6 June 2013"," Just like the first ""Hangover"", this one is Destined to Achieve Cult Status in the Pantheons of R-rated Comedies
","Rating: 3.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>The blow hot-blow cold taste of the second installment has been completely washed away and we are fortunately left with evocative memories of the classic comedy of the first ""Hangover"". This film is quintessential R-rated hilarity at its sublime best. The kind of comedy that can even make absurdity look believable and flaws look inconsequential, just because it's so damn funny!<br/><br/>Moreover, the film accomplishes the arduous task of never falling into the trap of vulgarity or going overboard with its expletive words and gratuitous obscenity - a fate suffered by many adult comedies just for the sake of extracting a few forced guffaws. Now I'm certainly no prude, and I love nothing more than some good R-rated fun, replete with abusive words, wicked scenes and a bit of obscenity thrown in for good measure. But good measure is what needs to be stressed on. It's when these gimmicks go overboard for lack of good content, inability to script funny scenes, or a dearth of hilarious dialogs and performances, that R- rated fun becomes an ""Un""-rated torment. Well, that being said, lets continue with the praises for this delightfully side-splitting film. <br/><br/>""Hangover Part 3"" is overflowing with laugh-out-loud moments and hysterically funny dialogs, that are backed by the effortless comic timing of Bradley Cooper, the adorable goofiness of Ed Helms, the pseudo-flamboyance of John Goodman, and the devious wickedness of Ken Jeong (Mr. Chow) coupled wit his one-of-a-kind China-man accent.<br/><br/>But, finally, it's Zach Galifianakis who completely steals the show from the first frame to the last. Make no mistake, ""Hangover Part 3"" is Galifianakis' film out-and-out, and he potently shoulders it, proving, that in the end, its talent that ultimately talks in cinema and nothing else.<br/><br/>P.S.:- Remember to stay back after the end credits start rolling. There's one last sequence you are treated to - like a final swansong to the ""Wolf Pack"". In fact it just might be the best after credits sequence yet, and it plays out more like a minute long short film. You also don't need to wait that long. A little bit into the credits, and this brilliant sequence pops up."

","This film is about the gang who has to bring Alan to a mental facility. On the way, they get kidnapped, and their lives are endangered.<br/><br/>Maybe it is because """"The Hangover Part II"" was widely criticised as a carbon copy of ""The Hangover"", ""The Hangover Part III"" tries to be very different compared to the first two. The plot is loosely related to the first two films, but becomes a silly gangster comedy. The plot is no longer about mishaps after alcohol, and hence people expecting such humour would be hugely disappointed. It contains many one liners that made the whole cinema laugh, but they are not enough to carry the whole film. The plot is senseless and annoying at times, especially Alan whom I have never really liked.<br/><br/>Maybe the filmmakers realise that the plot is a radical departure from the first two films, the during credit scene provides some familiarity. That scene is hilarious, but a little far fetched. Overall, ""The Hangover Part III"" is sometimes fun, at times flat and ultimately forgettable film."

What follows is an action-packed and laugh-filled escapade that takes them from Mexico to Las Vegas in search of Chow and a staggering 40 million dollars in Gold. <br/><br/>Granted, this may not be The Wolfpack's greatest adventure, but it is certainly one to watch.

","The first film was a great funny film, the second film was amusing but maybe not as good, and this was the concluding film of the trilogy, one that was promoted a lot but had mixed reviews, from director Todd Phillips (Road Trip, Old School). Basically Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Stuart 'Stu' Price (Ed Helms), Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) are reunited again when following a pileup involving a killed giraffe Alan's father Sid (Jeffrey Tambor) dies from a heart attack, and they all attend the funeral. The family and friends are concerned for Alan's health as he is not taking his medication, they suggest he should go through some treatment to help him, he agrees to go to a rehab facility in Arizona, as long as ""Wolf Pack"" take him. On the way their minivan is rammed and they are shoved off road, and when they get out they are taken hostage by masked men, they meet mob leader Marshall (John Goodman), referenced in the first film, and his head of security Black Doug (Mike Epps), the boss tells them that Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), who recently escaped a maximum security prison, stole half of $42 million in gold bars from him. He wants them to find Mr. Chow, since Alan often contacts him, so that he can get his gold back, and if they do not find him he will kill Doug who they have taken, so with three days until the deadline the Wolf Pack go in search of him. Alan sets up a meeting with Chow in Tijuana, Mexico, and after a failed attempt to drug him Chow is told by Alan, Stu and Phil the situation, so he agrees to get the gold back, he says it is hidden in a mansion that formerly belonged to him, so they will have to break in to get it. The group successfully disconnect the security alarms and locate the gold to take it all out, but then Chow betrays them and leaves them with the alarm sounding to be caught by the police, and following this they are oddly released without charge and returned to the house, they in fact stole the other half of the gold from Marshall. He kills Black Doug for his incompetence and gives them the further two days to get Chow and the gold back, they know that he stole Phil's minivan and, but the gang are able to track the phone with Alan's detection app, it is outside a pawn shop in Las Vegas. They go into the pawn shop owned by Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), only communicating with Alan who she is attracted to she says that Chow came in and traded a gold bar for $18,000, less than its $400,000 sell rate, and they deduce he must be staying in a Caesar's Palace suite. Since Stu still has the contact of prostitute Jade (Heather Graham), following their unintentional wedding, they meet her and she gets in touch with an escort agency who know a big shot Asian is staying in a barricaded suite, so while Stu watched below Alan and Phil climb down from the roof to reach the suite. They are lucky not to get badly hurt as they manage to reach the suite, but Chow catches them and manages to escape by parachuting to the reach the strip of Las Vegas below, but Stu catches up to him and locks him in the trunk of the limo Marshall let them borrow. With Chow and all the gold in place they arrange a meeting with Marshall on the outskirts of the city, satisfied that the gold is all there he releases Doug to them, and being told Chow is in the trunk he and his henchman shoot their guns through it. Chow however appears to shoot and kill the henchman and mob leader, Alan had helped him to make his way out of the trunk through the backseat, he momentarily thinks of shooting them but changes his mind as Alan saved his life. Alan turns down the offer of a gold bar from Chow and ends his friendship between them because he knows that it is wrong and things go wrong when they get together, the group then return to the pawnshop for the minivan, and Alan goes in to make a date with Cassie. Six months later it is the wedding Alan and Cassie, Stu, Phil and Doug are guests, and knowing that he will have his own life and future responsibilities Alan officially resigns from the Wolf Pack. Following the credits we see the group have had another wild party that they cannot remember, Phil and Alan laugh when they see that Stu has got breast implants, Alan realises there must have been drugs in the wedding cake from Chow, and he comes out naked and laughing, and the Capuchin monkey they met in Bangkok jumps out to freak them out. Also starring Jamie Chung as Lauren and Sondra Currie as Linda. The characters are just about still as likable as the two previous films, the chaotic element is a little lost with this story going back to the beginning and with a heist storyline involved, the only scene similar to the other two is the final sequence, I guess I can see why the critics give it two stars out of five, it is only funny in small moments and it does not feel exactly the same as before, but for me it was a fun enough comedy.

","In this one Phillips really gives us a sequel. The movie reflex on what happened in the prequels and the characters evolve on a dramatic level. It's funny, but it borrows a lot from the action genre. It's not a recollection of ""what happened last night?"", but more about facing the consequences of what happened the last two movies. It smartly uses this to connect it with the leads' journeys, showing a coherent evolution of their personalities and their relationships. And even if it is over the top still, I believe that it all goes back to the first entry levels of plausibility, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>The director shows his touch to let the drama sink in and make the characters more human, with realistic and more natural reactions to what is happening to them.<br/><br/>The script is pretty good, with a reflexive first half that sets up a crazy second. It's funny throughout, but the first 40 minutes are slower and really well written, without the use of outlandish stuff. Well, except for two really lazy and outdated jokes in the first 15 minutes. Other than that, the humor is really good.<br/><br/>Having said that, it doesn't make you fall in love like the first one, with a plot and story filled with action that makes it also a bit more generic."

","When your first movie is so well received you think of turning it into a franchise. And then come movies carrying the branding they got from the first, but with mediocre stuff - this is the inevitable reality with almost all franchises.<br/><br/>And if your franchise runs on comedy, you better be kidding if you think the sequels will meet the expectations. Making a single comedy movie that is appreciated by people with different levels of sense of humor is the hardest act in movie business. I mean there's setting, plot, execution, twists, ending and then the jokes itself - getting all of it right.<br/><br/>So the ""Hangover"" franchise is one of the very few outliers in the history of comedy cinema, where you have 3 movies, and all three are exceptionally good - I mean rib-tickling to the very end. Todd Philips and his writers get credit for that- and yes, they would still not be so successful if they weren't dealing with a genius cast - Zack, Bradley, Ed Helms and Ken Jeong.<br/><br/>These movies are some of those things that make life worth living!!

","For the record, The Hangover is, in my book, one of the greatest comedies of the 21st century. No one has quite mastered the comedic twist of the whodunnit as well as Todd Phillips did in the original smash. I also did not find Part II to be a disappointment - lots of genuinely funny moments (especially from Stu) even if it was sad to see the writers cling for dear life to their proved formula. <br/><br/>Part III should be commended for trying something totally new, and really messing with the formula to try and take this from comedic whodunnit to an edge of your seat, stake-fest. The problem - while striving to be original, they completely forgot about the comedy. So many scenes in this film were just threatening or horrific without any laughs peppered in there - guns in faces, hostages, phone calls. It was more focused on raising the stakes for the Wolfpack then it was making us laugh. This issue was epitomised with John Goodman's ""Marshall"" character - were they even attempting to make this guy a funny villain? If so, no dice...Marshall could have come straight out of a B-grade mob movie without changing any of his tics or dialogue. Sure, it's cool that this was a dangerous situation but it is still a comedy. Gives us a more simple plot for more laughs. <br/><br/>The other major problem was the rudderless arcs of the trilogy's main comic nuclei - Alan and Chow. It was as if the writers sat down and said, ""Hey, people love those guys, let's turn them up to 11,"" without actually considering that what made these two funny was that they were somewhat believable - an, albeit exaggerated, version of the outcast or loony in your own social circles. By taking Alan from a spacey goofball to an aggressive and unhinged mental case made it unbelievable that Phil and Stu would still want anything to do with him. Chow was a hilarious supporting act - as the centre of the film, his profanity got tired fast. <br/><br/>This movie also gave itself a glowing pat on the back that it hasn't exactly earned - the constant self-referential gags, throwbacks and winks sort of made it feel like they were disproportionately elevating the status of the first two films. The post credits sequence is the worst example - a victory lap would've been acceptable if all three movies were comic gold. Sadly, only one of them was so filming the Alan-Chow goodbye as if it were a Michael-Fredo kiss and going for a Deathly Hallows-esque ""everything connects, this is the epic conclusion"" plot really just felt a little congratulatory. <br/><br/>Massive points here for taking some tonal risks (which work best with Chow singing 'Hurt' or Alan's reunion with Carlos) but overall they changed a formula without considering why it had become a formula in the first place - it worked."

","I am disappointed! This movie doesn't share the same concept as the previous ""Hangover"" movies, of having to piece together whatever happened the night before.

","Some film-makers form a trilogy to tell a tale, finding it a unique way to fashion a story and give the beginning, middle and end enough time and breathing space to flesh out on their own, forming stand- alone pieces that work just as well on their own in the process. Others, like The Hangover helmer Todd Phillips, use it to squeeze every drop of money out of a proved formula and fool an audience into thinking that, given the success of a previous instalment, they're in for a guaranteed good time. Only The Hangover Part II was terrible, and Part III is even worse, to the point where the franchise is barely recognisable from the hilarious and charming surprise it was back in 2009.<br/><br/>Ditching the formula that saw our three bumbling heroes wake up from a particularly heavy night in a variety of terrible states to find that one of their part is missing and no memory of what went down, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are instead roped into a plot involving an escaped-from-prison Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and the gangster looking for him, Marshall (John Goodman). But also ditched is any sense of humour or even any actual jokes, and in its place comes cruelty and distastefulness. Opening with Alan towing a giraffe home on the back of a trailer, events take an expected unfunny turn as the animal is decapitated and Alan is convinced that he needs help. It's on their way to rehab that they find themselves confronted by Marshall and Black Doug (Mike Epps), the latter returning from the first film.<br/><br/>Conveniently brushing Doug (Justin Bartha) out of the way again as Marshall holds him captive so the threesome can try and generate some laughs, The Hangover Part III becomes a pedestrian bore; a series of set-pieces that quickly run out of steam. In an attempt to make up for the clear lack of inspiration, Chow's role has been beefed up even more, but Jeong's hyperactive and excruciatingly annoying shtick gets old very quickly. A scene near the end sees Chow parachuting through Las Vegas screaming obscenities, and I was left scratching my head at just how the sleeper-hit of 2009 ended up at this point. When there's a rare chuckle to be had, it comes from Galifianakis and franchise-newcomer Melissa McCarthy, who at least manage to lend a little heart to what is quite frankly an unpleasant 100 minutes."

The comedy was scarce and far in between. I actually wasn't laughing much throughout the course of this movie, unlike parts I and II.<br/><br/>Sure the reprising actors were doing good jobs with their characters as established in parts I and II, but they had very little to work with in terms of plot, script and storyline. And it was a cumbersome anchor around the foot of the movie.<br/><br/>If you stick through the end credits, you will get to the best part of the entire movie, ironically as it is drawing to an end.

","Hangover part 3 is one of my favourite comedy films along with Dumb and Dumber and it's sequel Dumb and Dumber TO, the Ted films, Stepbrothers and Due Date. It is not the best comedy film but it still has lots of laughs. The film is a bit strange because despite the title there is no hangover unless you count the post credits.<br/><br/>Set four years after the previous film Doug gets kidnapped by Marshall a gangster after Chow stole his stolen gold and now the rest of the Wolfpack thanks to Alan getting drugs from Black Doug in the first film have 3 days to find Chow or else Doug dies.<br/><br/>The film was as I said quite funny especially with Alan and Chow. Alan in my opinion is more or less the film version of Peter Griffin as both are obese, dim-wits, laid back, immature and childish but Alan I think is slightly more intelligent but just by a fraction. The film was funny at the start especially the funeral scene and Alan doesn't seem to give a damn that he actually caused his dad Sid to die due to his antics. Chow more or less stole the show and the film more or less was mostly about him just like how the Tigger Movie focused on Tigger.<br/><br/>The film could have ended a bit better though especially as it is the finale of the series but still a funny film to watch."
"Screen_Blitz","4","0","1","11 September 2015"," Unfunny second sequel brings its trilogy to a disappointing conclusion
","In 2009, we were introduced to the wolf pack: Phil, Alan, Stu, and Doug, along with Mr. Chow, who brought the insane hilarity and laughs on the silver screen when they woke up in Las Vegas with no memory of what happened the previous night and their soon-to-be- married friend Doug missing. Two years later, the wolf pack dealt with the same hilarious scheme, only to wake up in Bangkok with the younger brother of Stu's fiancée missing. Apparently, the critical failure of the second film didn't give a clear signal to director Todd Phillips for the series's retirement, and the result is a third film of the franchise that fails to bring the fun and laughter that made the first two films enjoyable.<br/><br/>Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha), and Alan (Zach Galifianackis) are back once again with the film opening up Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) escaping from prison in Thailand, while evading a violent prison riot and guards who are after him. Meanwhile, Alan purchases a giraffe and decides to take it home on a trailer. However, when the giraffe's tall figure is too high for a highway overpass, the giraffe ends up decapitated and causes a major highway pileup. Soon, his family and his friends Phil, Stu, and Doug become increasingly worried about his mental wealth and proposed to take him to a mental institute called New Horizon. The plan quickly becomes thwarted when they are attacked and kidnapped by mobsters lead by crime boss Marshal (played by John Goodman) who assigns Phil, Alan, and Stu go after Mr. Chow who is in possession of half of his money, and capture him. With the three guys on the search for Chow, Doug is held hostage by Marshal and his henchman. <br/><br/>This movie takes the characters to Tijuana and later, back to Vegas where the first film was set. Unlike the first two film, this one goes a whole another direction. Instead of the characters going out for a bachelor party for one of them who is getting married, and waking up with absolutely no memory of the previous night, this film has the characters going on a road trip to capture Mr. Chow who has become an international criminal. So basically, this acts more as a spy thriller than a hardcore comedy, and the results are a lack of laughter and humor to satisfy. The characters are not funny this time around, Mr. Chow isn't even funny anymore. While he manages to choke out a few humorous lines, his character seems warn out from laughter. Alan isn't even funny here either. The film tries to make him funny by simply making more dumb and more absent-minded than ever, but it fails to bring the laughs out. Furthermore, this film doesn't seem to try to be funny. There are many scenes that rather dark, including characters getting shot and killed, and Mr. Chow ends being more sinister than funny as he manages to kill a few animals in some scenes. The plot itself pretty much takes away all the hilarity and deprives the characters from their humor. This film may sound better than the second film for taking another direction, but sadly, it only ends up worse.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part 3 is one of the most disappointing second sequels I have seen. It fails to be funny, it falls under a very poor script, and ends the trilogy on a really sour note. With you thought the second film was a disaster, that one was the only the beginning."

","Alan, Stu and Phil are set yet again to save Doug by finding Mr Chow. So there are three things about this movie that I really didn't like. First, there was the same plot about Doug missing. Damn, that guy must have played only for a few minutes at the beginning and at the end to every movie. Secondly, there were no jokes. Maybe the third hangover was not meant to be a comedy, because it was more like an action gangster movie, which is not necessarily bad, but its the third movie of a successful comedy series, why change that? And finally, there was no hangover. Why call it that and then replace it with a whole new storyline? That doesn't make sense. So, the movie mainly concentrates on Alan, and his character, another puzzle to solve that will never be solved as the movie never goes deep enough to actually deal with its characters. So, 4 out of 10."

","The Hangover, Part 3 (2013): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, John Goodman: While an improvement over the dreadful Hangover, Part 2, that is about its only testament. This begins with an effective prison escape by Mr. Chow who still has connections with the gullible Alan. Alan has just caused a major traffic accident involving a giraffe in a joke that is of many poor taste. Then his father has a heart attack. After the funeral his friends and family decide that Alan needs intervention so he is packed away with Doug, Phil and Stu for a road trip that is halted when they are driven off the road. Doug is taken hostage while the others are tasked with retrieving gold bars from Mr. Chow that was stolen from them. This becomes one big rat race but what's truly off is the total lack of laughs. Director Todd Phillips created a comic masterpiece with the original but all he accomplishes here is avoiding the duplication of the sequel. The principal actors elevate beyond the sequel. Zach Galifianakis as Alan goes through much growth particularly in a potential relationship and his dealing with Mr. Chow. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms also step up in the hunt for Chow. Ken Jeong is also superb as Chow whose lifestyle is reckless and maddening. However John Goodman is a sad waste as a gangster referenced in the original film and he likely wishes that he was in that film as oppose to this one. This is a major step up from the first sequel but otherwise the original is far more clever and hilarious. Now it is time to sober up and move on to better things. Score: 4 ½ / 10"

","The movie seems to be a forced third installment in creating the forced trilogy of sorts. While the second movie only changes the location of the entire plot line from the first movie, this third movie tries to innovate with new plot altogether. The move to still incorporate old elements of the story like Chow and even Marshall is quite nice. But the movie ultimately has to gave up it's main concept of the comedy resulted from the friends having a severe hangoer. Literally, the movie loses the thing that gives it its own title, and relied only on the previously built characters and their relationships. For me that played out quite nice, even the thing with the baby is another nice addition. But by doing so this movie really sacrifices on the humor and comedies. The jokes feel rather dry. Even the opening feels like it's meant for a thriller or sorts. The acting is strangely decreasing in overall. This time it's all about Zach Galifianakis' character, but he doesn't seem to be in control of the depiction. Bradley Cooper acted out just a standard performance here, and so did Ed Helms."

","It's hard to fathom why this ever got green lighted. Even though The Hangover II wasn't as good as the first, it still had its charm. Stu hooking up with the transsexual stripper was truly one of the highlights of that movie.<br/><br/>Hangover III offers no highlights. The humor was cruel and crude below any level of laughter. Ken Jeong's Mr. Chow is pretty much the highlight of the movie, even if some of the humor seemed force and stupid on a Police Academy level. Alan always had a stupid Homer Simpson charm. In this one, he's pretty much an unlikable jerk. He lost that childlike persona that made him so likable in the first 2. Not even the return of Mike Epps as ""Black Doug"" saves this clunker.<br/><br/>The film starts off badly with the death of Alan's father, which was a terrible plot device for the film. Maybe having Sid pay Stu, Doug and Phil to take Alan and try to find him a woman would have been a better choice, if clichéd. Sid's the lucky one, he gets to drop dead and not live though this mess.<br/><br/>John Goodman is wasted as the main villain in the movie. Melissa McCarthy as Cassie is perhaps the most unlikable character in a film since Jar Jar Binks. To have Alan fall for her not only derailed the film off the cliff, but made zero sense. It seemed like they were forced together.<br/><br/>The Hangover series limped out to the back, and like Old Yeller, it was put out of its misery. Or was it put out of our misery. The only way The Hangover IV could ever be made is if the directors decided that this was all a drunken stupor dream by Alan at Mr. Chow's wedding.<br/><br/>I'd go more into detail about some of the funnier jokes, but outside the bit with Mr. Chow and Stu in Gangster Goodman's house, I really can't remember any, and indictment on the writers more than the viewer like me.<br/><br/>Over all, it's best to ignore The Hangover III like it never happened. Just stick with the first two, and treat the Hangover II like it was the final movie in the series.<br/><br/>However, if you seek a blueprint on how to truly kill off a movie series beyond all possible repair, please, watch The Hangover III till your hearts content. The rest of us will blissfully ignore it as if it never happened, sort of like a really bad date or job interview."

","The Hangover Part 3 tells the story with the original crew returning but with a far different outcome and end results. Taking more of the leading role would be Alan, and it is clear from the start. The Hangover Part 3 essentially is more focused on his story- since it first revolves around him needing to seek help. While the original quartet are all present and correct, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the screen is overexposed to their nemesis Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), the dead-eyed, fun-loving criminal whose double-cross triggers the plot.<br/><br/>John Goodman plays it straight as rival gangster Marshall with the result that the comedy curdles into something rancid. The cocktail of Tarantino violence, James Bond stunts and Farrelly brothers humor combines like mud, marshmallows and broken glass.<br/><br/>Lensed like a widescreen epic with extravagant vistas of Arizona desert, forests of wind turbines and the glittering neon cityscape of Las Vegas, it looks like a Tony Scott movie. Unfortunately it sounds like a film made by a bunch of adolescent, self-congratulatory movie nerds after a drunken night.<br/><br/>The script itself is the real hangover. There is an honorable tradition of disreputable behavior in cinema involving the consumption of alcohol. We are lead to believe that since the creators/writers/crew of the film have heard all of the criticism about its second installment being too similar to the original, they decided to change its pace and try a different approach for The Hangover Part 3. What we have here is a film that has lost its touch and we are left with a non-comedy, with several decent actin sequences."

","Alan has been off his medication for the last 6 months resulting in his behaviour becoming increasingly erratic. Following the death of Alan's father, the Wolf pack and Alan's family create an intervention and decide that Alan should get treatment for his current mental issues. Whilst they are on their way to the clinic, the Wolf pack are forced off the road and bundled into the back of a lorry. It turns out that their old mate Chow has ripped off a big time gangster called Marshall. Marshall kidnaps Doug and tells our hapless trio that they must find Chow and bring him in otherwise Doug will be killed.<br/><br/>Even though this was a fairly sub standard sequel, I do think that it at least deserves some credit for trying to create a somewhat original plot - the second film was lazy and essentially re-hashed the same story as we saw in the first film. Whilst, it's good that there was some originality in this third film there were still some problems with this third entry in the franchise....<br/><br/>This film is much darker than the previous two films and as a result it is a lot less fun - the first film was well-written, incredibly funny, and the chemistry between the three leads was great. To me, that was another thing that was missing; the chemistry between the 3 leads felt almost absent in this film - they were almost acting like they'd never worked together before.<br/><br/>There is one aspect of the plot that doesn't make sense which I can only put down to a piece of truly dreadful writing; Chow convinces the Wolfpack to break into a house which he claims was his house, but it ended up being sold off when he was sent to prison. Chow knows the house like the back of his hand, knows how to disable the alarms and knows that there is $21 million worth of gold bars hidden behind a brick wall. The twist with this is that it wasn't his house and that he never owned it as the Wolfpack had assisted Chow in breaking into Marshall's house (the gangster who has tasked them with bringing Chow to him). OK, a few things puzzle me; if Chow never lived there, how did he know that the gold was buried behind the wall? How did he know how to disable the alarm? How did he know the lay-out of the inside of the house? Why did he need the Wolf pack to help him? Unless his intention was merely to frame them. This twist seems clever at first, but the more I thought about it, the more stupid I realised it actually was.<br/><br/>There is one big positive to take from this and that's Galifianakis; he's always been a bit daft, but being off his medication has made him more daft than usual and I must admit it's this daftness that does rescue this film from being a complete catastrophe. His child-like exuberance was a joy to watch and he also managed to be funny in a subtle and charming way. He's daft but he's also quite endearing (compare his performance to that of Ken Jeong who was over the top and irritating).<br/><br/>There are some laughs to be found in this film, but not enough in my book. As mentioned, the writers deserve some acknowledgement as they have at least tried to take the franchise in a slightly different direction. At the end of the day though it's a pretty poor film that is only really saved slightly by Galifianakis."

","When the studio wants to beat a dead horse they sure do kick the hell out of it. The third installment of the Hangover franchise has audiences asking, ""Why?"" ""What's the point?"" and ""Did this really need to be a trilogy?"" The first Hangover film I thought was great. I thought gold was struck with that concept and those actors. Then The Hangover Part II came out to prove that the first film had been a stroke of luck that couldn't be repeated well in the slightest. And then we come to the raging pointless stupidity that is The Hangover Part III. <br/><br/>Part three of this milked to death franchise begins with a scene that sets the absurd slapstick pace of the movie. We meet up with Zach Galifianakis' character, Alan, who has just bought a giraffe, accidentally knocks its block off with a freeway overpass, which in turn leads to Alan's father's fatal heart attack. Jeffrey Tambor ditched the party before things got completely stupid. It's then decided that Alan needs to go to rehab, and it's the wolf pack's job to get him there. So the gang gets together, but are stopped short by gangsters looking for Mr. Chow, the loud and obnoxious Korean dude from the first two films, played by Ken Jeong who I normally really like, but it just got old here. From this point a whole chain of events are set in motion and the typical Hangover shenanigans begin as the film constantly tries to, just as part two did, one up its predecessor.<br/><br/>There really is no point to The Hangover Part III and it's not good for much more than a few laughs. But honestly, what more can you really ask for. My expectations for this film were set dreadfully low, and I think that helped me to not hate this film, but instead just shrug my shoulders and say ""sure, why not.""<br/><br/>Don't expect any great laughs though, expect more in the chuckle range. This movie isn't really all that funny, and most of the time it's trying way too hard. The wolf pack lost their natural charisma and charm from the first film, and now it just feels like actors being forced through three increasingly dumb movies. The comedy is no longer genuine, its all full of scripted and forced laughter. The Hangover Part III wants to be fun, it wants to be wacky, and it wants to take you on a ride. The problem is it's too obvious on where it wants to take you, and I just can't get into it. It's silly and mindless entertainment, but I can't deny that by the end I found myself asking, ""Why did I watch that?"""

","The Hangover Part III receives critical derision for being a violent, dark sequel that has suctioned away all the charm, unpredictability, and hilarity significant to the first film's success. I think the problem with the third film is that at every turn, despite what the film seems to want from us, Chow is a cretin, a creep with no redeeming qualities yet he's set up as this lovable Bangkok nutcase with an ability to leech trust from his victims. I think Chow is a monster, but he's so prominently featured in this third film, I had no choice but to tolerate him. Look what he does to even those who are remotely humane to him: he locks them in the basement after stealing gold he claims was in his own villa basement but is actually kingpin Marshall's (John Goodman) second stash of bars, leaving them to be punished. Two caches of bars were stolen from a sheik by Marshall, and subsequently, Chow took one from him, and then this crazy maniac sets up a con over Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and his close pal, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to get the second! Phil, Stu, and Alan are put under orders by Marshall to find Chow and the gold or else, Doug (Justin Bartha), the brother-in-law of Alan, would be executed! Chow is responsible for all of what befalls the ""wolf pack"", and by film's end, despite what he deserves, Alan sees that he escapes from a harm he had more than earned. People get shot a bunch in this film, and the crimes that intrude upon the lives of Phil, Stu, and Alan aren't as much played for laughs as a necessary custom to how these guys fall prey to horrors of an absurd variety time and again. I think seeing Chow leap from the balcony of Caesar's Palace, as a parachute guides him in the sky, talking about how he loves cocaine, isn't as hilarious as it is telling regarding what kind of waste of space he really is. Is he fun-loving, embracing life and all its jollies, using whatever means are at his disposal, through treachery, chicanery, back-stabbing, and madness supposed to endear him to us? Anyway, Stu spends most of his time under attack from Alan, as the film is damn insistent on keeping its focus and intentions on Alan's crisis (the giraffe incident, going off the drugs he needs to keep him from such incidents, speaking out of turn to his relatives, causing his dad to croak from a coronary, etc.). Phil must be the anchor that keeps everything from totally spiraling out of control. Arizona ends up leading to Tijuana and then to Las Vegas, but the results are the samethe wolf pack are re-acquainted with Marshall regarding Chow. Chow. Chow. Chow. Alan. Alan. Alan. At least Melissa McCarthy shows up as a pawn store owner that Alan fancies. Oh, and seeing Alan near death on the Caesar's Palace light was only a disappointment in that he didn't stay there...that or fall to a very sidewalk-crushing demise. It appears that the third film was supposed to be it, yet the end credits tell us otherwise. I hope I never see Chow's dick again."

","This is what happens when one tries to force a capstone film on a trilogy that really did not need one. The fact is that the first two movies were big because the first one had a refreshing and unique take to it and let's be honest, the sequel just recycled it. This movie eschews that formula entirely. In fact there is no ""how did this happen?"" hilarity but rather a lot of bland, forced narrative. In fact, its biggest mistake is taking the two characters best used as momentary oner-liners and scene-stealers and trying to develop a whole movie around them. It leaned far, far too heavily on the very dry Alan and the 'Chow' character. He was a million times better jumping naked out of a trunk.<br/><br/>They avoid exactly what made them great to force a storyline that 'wraps up' the trilogy. Unfortunately, as many have noted, the last scenes are more like we'd expect."
"bowmanblue","6","0","1","21 June 2014"," Probably should have left it at number two
","It goes without saying that 'The Hangover' (part I) was a great film. Its sequel (part II) was met with a mixed reception (personally, I quite liked it, while thinking it wasn't quite as good as the first one). However, now with Part III, they really seem to be dragging something out simply to make money.<br/><br/>The sad fact: Part III just isn't that funny. There simply aren't enough jokes in there to warrant calling it a 'comedy.' Other people have noted how they've 'changed the formula' with this one, i.e. there's no actual hangover in this one where the cast wake up, not knowing what they did the night before and having to piece together the clues. Of course if Part III HAD followed this rule, everyone would be saying that it was just a second copy of the original, so the film-makers probably couldn't win either way.<br/><br/>Also, coupled with Part III being a little low on jokes, Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan' has completed changed since the last two movies. Before, he used to be a lovable, but dumb sort. Now he's a complete idiot (and not a very nice one at that), leaving us finding it much harder to root for him during this third outing.<br/><br/>However, whether you notice, or are that bothered by, the change in his character, it doesn't make much difference to the script, i.e. it's still short on jokes. Yes, the movie is watchable and short enough not to make me think I'd wasted an hour and a half of my life, but, when you compare it to Part I, it's noticeable how far it's fallen.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","This part of the Hangover let down the series. This part shouldn't have been made. A little or no comedy film of the comedy genre. If u like the Hangover I & II,u will definitely hate this one. I honestly didn't laugh even once until after the conclusion. Even then, a few minor chuckles at best and the after credits stuff is mildly amusing. This was a very strange way to end a trilogy that started with what I found to be comedy gold. The story advanced pretty well, with no actual ""Hangover"" this time.<br/><br/>""The Hangover 3"" is easily the worst installment of the three, and a film that should've absolved the makers of making the scummy sequel to the fine first.For me, it was nothing more than a wearisome end to a franchise that could've been so much more."
"brando647","8","0","1","25 January 2014"," A Fitting End to the Adventures of the Wolf Pack
","Who would've thought the surprise comedy hit of the summer of 2009 would go on to become a full-blown trilogy? It's a baffling prospect because each film became progressively less successful as the series continued until THE HANGOVER PART III found itself lucky to squeak by with enough domestic box office to recoup its budget. I loved the first film, and I wasn't as hard on the second one as most other people were. I was disappointed that the filmmakers felt the need to adhere so close (insultingly close) to the pattern of the first film in an effort to mimic its success for the second film, but I was happy to find it breaking away from the mold for the third and final film. Of course, by the time part three was released in 2013, most people had grown tired of the shtick and it was lucky that it didn't totally tank. The third adventure of the infamous Wolf Pack finds Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) confronting Allen (Zach Galifianakis) about his reckless insanity and convincing him to enter a clinic to help him balance out. En route, they're hijacked by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). You see, Leslie Chow stole millions of dollars worth of gold from Marshall and he believes the Wolf Pack is his best chance of finding him. Kidnapping Doug as collateral (because what's a HANGOVER movie if Doug's part of the team?), he gives the guys a deadline and tells them to bring him Chowor else.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not sure what people hated so much about this movie. I actually liked it. It's a refreshing break from the formula of the first two and takes itself a little more seriously than the second film. Whereas the second movie was sort of a parody of the first movie, taking it to new extremes while rehashing a lot of the same gags with a wink to the audience and an oh-no-not-again vibe, THE HANGOVER PART III is more original and gives it's characters more to do than stumble from one clue to another. Ken Jeong's now iconic character of Leslie Chow has gone much farther than I ever anticipated he would as he's gone from an amusing addition to the first film to being the focal point of the final film. This means we get plenty more of his loud, obnoxious, flamboyant style. So, if Chow was your least favorite part of the previous films, you'll want to skip this one because we get plenty more. And, yes, you get the obligatory full frontal Jeong shot if you stick around too long after the end credits begin to roll. At this point, I think it's written into his contract. Chow must be a fan favorite; I can see them making a movie centered on him to keep the interest alive long enough to profit from the final film. It works well enough. I don't hate the Chow character and he's a little more toned down in PART III, going for more bizarre and threatening and less in-your-face loud.<br/><br/>John Goodman is a nice surprise as the villain, Marshall. He doesn't really have much to do beside yelling and threatening people. Goodman's good at that sort of thing, so he's a nice fit. Melissa McCarthy is on a roll right now, so she's got a minor part as a love interest for Allen. Yeah, you read that right. Honestly, I can't think of anyone else who could've played an odd enough character to match wits (or witlessness) with Allen. And then we have a bunch of returning cameos from the first movie. Director Todd Phillips tries to bring it all full circle with the Wolf Pack returning to where it all began and encountering familiar faces along the way. And he does it all with a fresh approach. I can appreciate that and I think that's why I enjoyed this movie so much more than most other people. The HANGOVER movies, at their best and worst, are redeemed in the interactions between the three buddies at the center of the adventures: Phil, Stu, and Allen. They've got a great chemistry and that's why, even at its lows, these movies are fun for me. Turning THE HANGOVER into a trilogy might not have been the best idea but it wasn't the worst and each movie has enough of it's own flavor to make them entertaining. THE HANGOVER PART III is a fine end to the adventures of the Wolf Pack and I think we can, at the very least, be glad this one didn't start with a bachelor party and roofies."
"dwath","4","0","1","19 January 2014"," Just not funny enough....
","Let's not kid ourselves sequel's that improve in quality are few and far between! and the Hangover follows suit. The original was worth all the hype and more, hilariously funny, nonsensical but surprising with laughs from start to, wedding singer, finish. Number 2 saw the scriptwriters shock more than humour the audience, way too over the top for my liking. As for number 3, well there just isn't the laughs, Alans awkwardness has become just awkward and lost the amusement, Chow gladly keeps his clothes on, that being the best thing about his character in No.3. The story runs out like a poor book that you think you may have read before, one or 2 laughs and the inclusion of a poor run down for those not having seen the first or second installment. Watch the original again and remember just how funny it was the sequels just don't cut it."

","Review: I know that a lot of people wouldn't agree with me, but I thought that this was the worst one in the franchise. I missed the wacky jokes and the mad situations that the 4 of them found themselves in. The first one was the best one for me but this movie lacked the shock value. The Chinaman got on my nerves a bit and the storyline wasn't as outrageous as the others. That's not to say that this is a bad movie. It's good to see the 4 of them back together again and as this is the last of the series, it will be good to watch them all together. The ending was hilarious, which was what I was hoping to see in the rest of the movie, but I'm glad that the director left it open for a, maybe, fourth one. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: There isn't that much to say about the performances because they have all been the same in all 3 movies, There isn't the usual pictures to look through about there mad night, which was one of the really funny bits in the other 2 movies. To be honest there wasn't anything that really stuck out in this film, which is a shame because it would have been good to see them go out with a bang.<br/><br/>Budget: $103million Worldwide Gross: $362million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Hangover franchise. 5/10"

","The first part of The Hangover will always remain as a surprise hit, and one of the favorites. Thats that. After that it was total downhill. The second part was pretty much similar to the first part, except that it contained less humor and more violence. We eventually forgot it,since we were still hungover with the first part. Then came the third part. No one asked for trilogy on the saga of wolf pack, still it can as an asteroid above our head, and by mistake I happened to see it. <br/><br/>Initially I thought they had studied their lesson and they are changing their tracks. This time they hadn't any bachelor party and no more roophies to get hungover. Still, one of them had to be vanished. This time it was a hostage situation, and this time too, it was Doug. I must say that I had a few laughs because they reminded me about the first part here and there, with the visit to Jade and Carlos, but soon, it became intolerable. A useless heist plot and Chow as a villain, and above all, a climax which made no sense at all.<br/><br/>Briefly, if you haven't seen the second part but the first part, be happy with it. You are on a safe zone and further journey will be really bumpy. If you have seen the second part, just give it a try, because it is as bad as it's predecessor. Nothing more to say...."
"VideoMasher3000","4","0","1","22 December 2013"," It was not great....but a good ending.
","I would like to first say that this was not a terrible movie. In fact, it was decent for what it was. Would I recommend it...maybe, just to say you saw it once but I won't be watching it again. I think this movie was a good ending to the trilogy because of the kind ending. Despite that I disliked Allen for the majority of all the films because of his sheer stupidity, it felt rather nice to see that he as well gets married in the end just like the rest of the wolf pack. Now having that said.....This movie should not have been called ""The Hangover III"" because there was no hangover. No one got drugged which should have been the transition point to main plot of the story. In the first they get drugged, have crazy night in Vegas and save Doug. Second, the get drugged, have crazy night in Bangkok and save the brother of the bride. The first 2 had them lose their memories, loose a friend and had weddings to get too, the third one was more of an action film if anything. There were very little jokes, it was more serious if anything and Chow wasn't funny either. The whole film was a chase, there were very few opportunities for some creative comedy. Having them meet interesting side characters in the others was good, like the monk or the hooker. I wouldn't say it was overly boring because it kept my interest enough to the point that I wanted to see them succeed in the end, but there was so much more they could do. This film should have been about having a bachelor part for Allen, if they could have found someway to have done that, it would have been better. This was a poor film all on its own...but for a trilogy being based on 4 guys getting drugged, you can't expect a masterpiece. It did what it could, it ended on a good note and I myself am happy that is finally over. If you loved the first 2, you will hate this one. I didn't complain to much just because it wasn't horrible, just...not really good. I give it a 4 out of 10 for not being the worst film in the world and it kept my interest, but it was unfunny, uncreative and overall could have been done better."

This means that the entire let-us-discover-what-insane-things-we-did part is gone. Instead we are treated to a much more conventional comedy story.

","The first Hangover is one of my favourite guilty pleasure comedies. It is the ultimate in hilarious, raunchy, buddy films and I thought a second one would likely be a disaster. Well, imagine my surprise when I felt like The Hangover 2 was as good as the original and another hilarious romp with the Wolf Pack. So I had high expectations for this third film. I thought if they managed to squeeze two great movies out of a one movie story then just maybe they could do it again. Well, I will give them an A for effort. I do think they honestly tried. But for the most part it feels like they lost focus of nearly every single thing that made the first two films so terrific. I'm not even sure where the comedy was to this third part. The film is incredibly dark compared to the first two. It is gritty and violent and almost disturbing and not in a shocking funny way. I felt like I was searching for somewhere to laugh and not finding it. It was depressing and twisted and didn't fit the tone of the film. The film practically opens with an animal being decapitated, the death of a character's father, a person is shot to death, someone has a serious drug problem, there is an intervention....and it seems to go on from there.<br/><br/>The three main guys in The Hangover had undeniable chemistry in the first two movies. They seemed to just completely embody these hilarious characters each with their own unique flare and quirks. Bradley Cooper has always been the leader of the pack and just the likable popular guy. In The Hangover 3 he seems almost dark and bored and almost looks depressed. He doesn't even have half the charisma he had previously and that is so unfortunate. Ed Helms who was always my favourite as the lovable dentist with the worst luck. Helms seems to have lost all that lovability and bickers with Zach Galifianakis in a really mean spirited way and I didn't like the chemistry between these three guys who previously were just so amazing together. Galifianakis returns as the iconic Alan, only this time he's off his meds (depressing), drug addicted (sad), and more psychotic than funny. Justin Bartha returns doing the same thing he did in the first films so he gets off easy. He's barely a supporting character and gets the same amount of lines as previously. John Goodman is our villain this time around and he's good. I mean Goodman is almost always good but man his character is dark. He shoots a guy dead in the chest and is a great mobster but he could easily be in an action flick. Ken Jeong also returns and I was always afraid they would overuse him in the first two films but they didn't. Well now they have rectified my fears and overused him. As much as I enjoy him in Community, he is obnoxious and just way too in your face in this third one. Watch for other returning cameos like Heather Graham, Mike Epps and Jeffrey Tambor. Melissa McCarthy also makes a cameo appearance in an okay role but nothing terrific.<br/><br/>The good news is that the film isn't a total disaster. There is some definite old school Hangover vibe to the scene where Alan and Phil break into the penthouse suite at Caesars Palace (easily the best scene in the film.) Todd Phillips returns to finish off his trilogy but I'm just really surprised he let the film go into such dark waters. Also in a bizarre turn of events there were a few scenes of blatant CGI that were done pretty poorly (the giraffe, a parachuting scene.) If I had to guess I would say that Phillips felt rushed to release this or even pressured by the studios. It was just missing so much of what made The Hangover the iconic comedy that it is. Certainly the best scenes were back in Vegas and the latter half of the film was so much better than the first (but still incredibly dark.) They tried to wrap up the series by making reference to previous adventures but it felt forced. This wasn't The Hangover and I was thoroughly disappointed in so many ways. If you're going to experience The Hangover then stick with the first two. The Hangover 3 was a DARK, TWISTED, and nearly depressing end to the trilogy. 6/10"

Well... even with alcohol this was a huge disappointment...<br/><br/>As a movie itself its not bad... its OK... but oh damn its SOOO not as funny as the 2 other movies. And even tough the hangover scenario would had look dumb a bit maybe(yeah, can lightning strike 3 times) they actually decided to include it as a post credit scene actually... and it end up being one of the best scene of the movie...<br/><br/>I mean, really overall the movie is not bad at all, its just damn the feeling of the 2 previous movies seem to have completely vanish, not only the ""wolfpack"" ain't on a hangover, but they decided to make Alan a damn huge DOUCHEBAG and this... sadly ain't working at all. I miss idiot Alan who was retarded maybe, but funny and lovable. The only time we can feel something for this character is when he meet the young baby we saw in the first movie. All the rest just make you want to give him the bitch slap he deserve...<br/><br/>Overall Phil was OK, Chow was nicely done(even tough its weird a secondary character from the first movie stole the show), Stew was erased pretty much... and Alan was just a jerk in this...<br/><br/>Overall just a big disappointment for a conclusion to an otherwise good series... I emphasized on ""not that bad"" as people would say... but oh damn disappointing considered what it could had been.<br/><br/>And yes... i missed Mike Tyson... weirdly i tough it would had been cool to see him again in this...<br/><br/>For some reasons i think it would had been hilarious if he was the guy that bough Chow's ""mexico's mansion""s instead of the Marshall bad guy..."

","Believe it or not, while the Hangover series overstayed its welcome with a part III, it still was 10x the movie the bridge film was. Now, that's really not saying much.<br/><br/>I absolutely didn't fully dislike this film. But, then again, nor did I laugh. Hardly at all. Sure, The Hangover Part III was fun, adventurous and got the Wolf Pack back to where they belonged: Las Vegas – if just for a bit. Unfortunately, it just barely had a few lines of comedy. Sad. This is SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY. THIS IS A COMEDY SERIES.<br/><br/>At any rate, again, it's better than the terrible, atrocity and shot-by-shot remake the second movie was. In fact, it was a little bit of fun I've missed since the first adventure in 2009.<br/><br/>Basically, once again Doug is absent for the majority of the film and his friends must track down the flamboyant Mr. Chow for the deadly criminal Marshall who's holding Doug as collateral. They span two countries and try and outsmart the actually-smarter-than-meets-the-eye Mr. Chow to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>The guys looked tired in this and Zach Galifianakis was the only one who seemed to put effort into his role. They were clearly doing this for a paycheck, and maybe make up for the dud the second one was.<br/><br/>It's not a movie to watch more than once. In fact, as I've recommended before, you really should only stick with the first one, which was a great comedy, fresh and fun. No need to venture all the way to part III. (But, if you decide to do that, go ahead and skip over Part II. That movie doesn't even tie in here. Mercifully, so.)<br/><br/>Side Note: One of the biggest things I admired about the original The Hangover, was that they got the Vegas scenes right. In too many movies, like 21 and Con Air, the Vegas skyline or continuity to the locations of the movie's characters is way off and anyone who's ever been to Sin City, will know they have no idea what they're talking about when they showcase the characters on the Las Vegas strip. 2009's The Hangover showed us scenes that made me feel I was right there and that's a rarity. Sadly, Part III, went backwards and got the strip all wrong. For example, Stu is driving southbound on Las Vegas BLVD in a crazed chase scene and moments after he passes the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, suddenly he crashes into the old strip approximately 5.5 Northeast of his location. This is all fine and dandy for the two people left in the world that hasn't visited Las Vegas. C'mon guys; we're not that stupid."
"pcrprimer","6","0","1","29 September 2013"," Some laughs, hopefully they let the series rest for now
","The same cast is back for more shenanigans, but without the same effect. Alan has become a caricature of himself, and it really seems like they're making more movies just for the sake of it. The laughs are few and far between, and the movie simply doesn't have the energy of the first part. The post-credits scene just seems thrown in to leave a possibility of a sequel, and was not necessary. John Goodman's character could have added a lot more to the story, as we've seen him in other comedies. Leslie Chow also has the same problem of Alan, with having become a caricature of himself. I would recommend this movie to fans of the hangover since it has the same cast, but not the same comedic value."

","The fun continues, is it! yeah, kinda. This third Hangover was a different one to the other two movies. There were no more bachelor parties, looked like have they (movie characters) learnt the lessons so. But still the movie had a similar track jokes like pursuing something to get away from another thing. So there's no short for fun but the story was not greater like earlier two.<br/><br/>Yes I enjoyed the movie from comedy aspect but the roles played by the cast, I was little not favour to it. I mean the Bradley Cooper now a big star than what he was when the first hangover movie came. Whenever I see him in this movie I though he was forced to do the role in the movie as he was part of the earlier installments. So there's no surprise this movie is going to end with this third part.<br/><br/>Everyone performed equally good in all the three movies. But Zach Galifianakis was the highlight in all the three while Justin Bartha was the disappointment. No doubt, it is now one of a best comedy trilogy and I can recommend it to anyone if somebody asks for a good dude's comedy theme in near future. Sad that they decided to end the franchise with this but in another angle it feels that was the best option than dragging it to nowhere and making audiences especially 'The hangover' series fans to sloppy.<br/><br/>Like I said the story was told in not the usual stream but we know the trademark of hangover movies so the movie ends with a style. Still I am curious about the fourth from the bean it spelled during the middle of the credit and I am hungry for that as a detailed explanation in a movie. I know you won't love it as much those you loved first two but still worth a watch as it was the grand finale to the trilogy.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Hangover 3 was the worst sequel to be released this summer. Singularly unfunny, unbearably scripted, and unfeelingly acted, thank god the trilogy ended. I do not even see the reason for this being a Hangover film, considering that none of the characters actually have a single drink, forget about a hangover. <br/><br/>Ah, but Todd Philips was seeking closure after all. So we have one last adventure of the Wolf pack, up against their nemesis Chow, Alan finally growing up and only because he finds his lady love. While the headless giraffe at the start pointed to a truly wacky finale, the ride went downhill all throughout. Less of a raunchy comedy and more like a run of the mill action thriller, this is a movie that leads its loyal fans to an endless journey into nothingness. Bradley Cooper sleepwalked through the movie, Zack Galifianikis and Ed Helms put slightly more effort, John Goodman seems to be itching to disappear from every scene he is in, while Ken Jeong is the usual party popper that he is in every movie he acts. <br/><br/>There is nothing to even sum up for The Hangover 3, except to say that I am terribly disappointed, and that itself is an understatement- 3/10"

"slicedbread117","5","0","1","27 August 2013"," The Wolf Pack as been lead astray.
","Remember when The Hangover was released in 2009 and it became the most popular comedy in a long time, being one of the most quoted movie until...well even today. Then Part II was announced, and while it didn't touch the gold that was the first, it managed to piece together enough laughs to be a half decent and worthy sequel. Now Part III. And all I have to say is, as a Hangover movie, this was a complete and total disappointment. <br/><br/>The Hangover is arguably one of the best comedies of the modern age. It was a movie full of gut-busting laughs, and some of the most famous quotes in recent time for a comedy. It was stellar to say the least. All of those laughs, iconic moments, everything, minus a couple parts, is all missing from this not funny comedy. It's almost as simple as that, The Hangover Part III was barely funny, and in the eyes of its predecessors, failed miserably. A few scenes in the very beginning, a return to Cesar's Palace and the very very end are all that got a laugh from me. This movie tries to be an action comedy, and maybe if you view it as its own action comedy, without the Hangover name on it, it wouldn't be half bad. But as a Hangover movie, it did not work one single bit. More bullets than laughs in this movie, literally.<br/><br/>The once hilarious and unpredictably crazy cast has gone almost completely stale. In the first and even second films, Zach Galifianakis's portrayal of the socially and mentally strange Alan Garner was just hilarious and so lovable. That magic that the character once had has gone almost completely away. Nearly all of the things that Alan delivers in this movie are just boring and not funny. I was sitting there waiting for something to follow what he said and then nothing. It was really disappointing to see a once beloved character go stale. The rest of the Wolf Pack, Phil and Stu, played by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms respectively (I don't even include Doug anymore), also have lost their touch. As much as I love Bradley Cooper, you could tell at times that his heart wasn't there anymore and that he wasn't giving his best efforts. Ed Helms is probably the best of the gang, but even so, not the same as the first or second parts. Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) has become the center of attention and the movie's plot, and while he has his funny and insane moments, his magic seemed to have lost it's touch as well. A funny movie can't be funny without great acting or a great script.<br/><br/>I had hopes that the Wolf Pack could return to their former glory with a new and fresh story, and a sort of clean slate from the decent Part II, but what I discovered was that this Wolf Pack has been separated from what it once was. Little to zero laugh out loud moments, more of an action than a comedy, a cast that's lost it's touch, and an overall poor script all spelled doom for this movie and the series. At the very least, stick around for a mid-credits scene that was possibly the best in the movie. The Hangover Part III (which doesn't even have a hangover in it by the way) is a massive let down as the cherry on top to what could've been a terrific trilogy. <br/><br/>5/10"

On the way, the group is assaulted and Doug (Justin Bartha) is kidnapped. Now, the group must find Mr Chow and deliver him in return for Doug.<br/><br/>It has been four years since a record-setting comedy hit the silver screens. Now, in its last part of a hilarious trilogy, The Hangover series finally, draws to a close.<br/><br/>After the first film made $467,483,912 (Worldwide), ""The Hangover"" trilogy continued with ""The Hangover: Part Two"" which was succsessul financially, but not critically. So, a lot of pressure was riding on the conclusion, to a crude, but enjoyable series of much loved films.<br/><br/>Is it good? Yes, it is. ""The Hangover: Part Three"" in fact entertains fairly well. The whole cast have returned (with an exception for two or three characters) and seems to have learned from their mistakes made in the last instalment.<br/><br/>This time round, ""The Hangover: P3"" has chosen to go darker, with a plot line, that is part heist thriller and violent drama. It doesn't feel too much like a comedy, it has some entertaining jokes and some pretty awful atrocities; but nothing that makes you want to laugh out loud, like the first film. ""The Hangover: P3"" digs back into the plot of the first two films and delves a little deeper to try and find something interesting. Who would know that Mr Chow stole twenty one million dollars from a guy called Marshall? I certainly didn't! I frankly don't care!<br/><br/>""The Hangover: P3"" tries hard and receives some interesting performances from Galifianakis and perhaps a star turn from Ken Jeong (who plays the character Chow). You see, Todd Phillips tries hard but not hard enough. If he had a funnier script and better acting, the film might have turned out better.<br/><br/>What started as quite a fun comedy which slightly dipped in the middle; but turns up trumps at the end, left me with a smile on my face and perhaps a small urge for some more antics with ""The Hangover"" lads.

"estebangonzalez10","7","0","1","28 June 2013"," The Wolfpack is back at it again!
","""I told myself, I would never come back.""<br/><br/>I had read so many bad reviews about this third installment of The Hangover that I kept putting off this movie until I finally decided to watch it last night and was glad I did. The second film was a lazy copy of the first (which I had loved), but I was let down by that sequel and wasn't expecting much from this. I guess that my lowered expectations helped me enjoy this film a lot more because I had a great time at the movies and laughed during several scenes what I hadn't laughed in any other comedy I'd seen this year (Identity Thief, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, He's Way More Famous Than You, The Guilt Trip, and This is 40). The Hangover Part III is a lot funnier than any of those movies were, and it is better than the first sequel; just don't expect it to be like the original. I'm glad Todd Phillips decided to take an entirely different direction here and incorporate some action. I didn't find this movie dark like a lot of people are saying it was and I didn't think it was serious either. I laughed several times and enjoyed the new characters. I think the film could have used a little less of Ken Jeong and not have made Zach Gallifianakis's character as mean as he was here, but overall I still think this film worked. Todd Phillips has had several hit and misses in his career as a director, and I would say The Hangover Part III kind of stands in the middle. It helped me that I went with such low expectations for this film and left the theater entertained.<br/><br/>The wolfpack is back together again for a third time, although this time no one is getting married and there is no bachelor party. Doug (Justin Bartha) convinces Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) to help him take Alan (Zach Galifinakis) to a mental institution after he has decided to stop taking his medication. Alan has been having a bit of anger issues, and so the wolfpack decide to get together again to drive Alan to an institution, but on their way they are assaulted by Black Doug (Mike Epps) and his boss Marshall (John Goodman). They kidnap Doug and are forced to find Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). If they don't find him in less than 72 hours then Doug will be dead. Apparently Mr. Chow has stolen from Marshall a large amount of gold, and he wants it back. This is where the madness begins, and the three friends are forced to locate Mr. Chow and bring him back in exchange for Doug.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed John Goodman's performance here although he didn't get much screen time. He was really good in his role as Marshall and set the tone of the film. There is a lot more action and thrills in this third installment. Another new secondary character in this film is Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), although she's barely five minutes in this movie. I thought she was funny, but I don't agree that her scenes were the highlight of the film. I'm not in love with her as most critics are, and have only enjoyed her role in Bridesmaids. Maybe Identity Thief is still to fresh on my mind and it doesn't allow me to enjoy her more. The Hangover Part III is a worthy sequel and I think a great place to end the trilogy. None of these films will be as fresh as the original however."

"michael_the_nermal","6","0","1","13 June 2013"," The Movie Only Gives the People What They Want
","I honestly don't understand the critical and popular dislike for this most recent installment in the ""Hangover"" franchise. What exactly were the people expecting from the Wolfpack? The first movie pretty much exhausted most of the comic possibilities this franchise could produce. How many more variations of ""the morning after the hangover"" as the plot can you expect? I, for one, am glad that this movie dispensed with the whole literal ""hangover"" as the plot and went ahead with a generic robbery and kidnapping caper instead. The first movie was a stupid, gross-out comedy--did the people expect that such a genre would yield veritable masterpiece sequels? <br/><br/>To those who dislike that Leslie Chow and Alan were given expanded roles, with their characters exaggerated far beyond what they had been in the original: this is typical of franchises! Consider ""Happy Days"": Fonzie stood out from the rest of the bland characters, and became the central figure. Also consider ""Family Matters:"" the sitcom was a typical middle-class family with banal problems program until Urkel guest-starred; the producers realized his bizarre character would attract more viewers than the too-normal main characters, and deliberately steered the show from a realistic program into a fantasy involving time machines and Urkelbots. This is what ""The Hangover"" producers did with Chow and Alan: they are trying to turn them into the next Urkel and Fonzie. What? You'd rather they focus on the other characters? Those lame, unappealing losers? Sure, Alan is a huge dork with little empathy or consideration for others, but his eccentric and childlike personality is the only one that might garner sympathy from the audience. Bradley Cooper's character is a smug jerk, and Ed Helms's is kind of an unlikeable wimp. Doug is utterly normal. Only Alan has gross-out comedy potential. Sadly, Alan, like Bradley Cooper's character, is too much of a jerk to become as likable as Urkel or Fonzie; the viewers and critics realized this too late. The producers also thought that Leslie Chow's weirdness would be a huge draw. I absolutely cannot imagine a ""Hangover"" movie without Leslie Chow. The creators did not disappoint. I expected Chow to be center stage in this movie, and the producers fulfilled my expectations completely. The problem with Chow is that he is too weird and too inscrutable to be likable. He has little redeeming personality traits to work as a character; he is just too much of an evil scumbag to become a likable villain. He is just too bizarre to be understandable. He is too perverted to be innocent and childlike. He is too intelligent to be an Alan doppleganger. He is not enough of anything to be an interesting character.<br/><br/>What do you expect for a sequel to a lame-brained gross-out comedy? This isn't Shakespeare, people! The director and producers gave the people exactly what they wanted, and, for some reason, the critics and people weren't warm to it. The film was pretty funny at parts, and Alan and Chow were fairly amusing throughout the proceedings. I can only hope the next movie is simply an Alan and Chow road trip adventure, directed by Tim Burton, and produced by the guys who made ""Cabin Boy."" Nobody would like it save for a few folks, but hey, it would at least be better than the formula followed by the other three ""Hangover"" movies."

","Since the first hangover (2009) came out I thought it was one of the funniest films I've seen in a decade. Part II (2011) was released and I thought the film was OK I found some parts funny but the story was too repetitive. Since the announcement of the third and final film (hopefully) I had no interest in it but because of my curiosity to see what becomes of the wolf pack it won me over. I'm glad to see the film makers take a different approach so it won't be an exact copy of part one but because of the new approach there were no laugh out loud moments, just a few cheap chuckles. Other then Allen & Chow performances and the only ones in the film that were funny, the movie just dragged along. Showing nothing interesting in the film what so ever. I guess because of the new elements they took that's why it wasn't at its best nor funniest but they could've done a complete better job with their jokes.

The film had me laughing a lot and Ken Jeong (Lesley Chow) was brilliant and I loved the fact he was a bigger character in this film.<br/><br/>I loved the twist of how the Wolf Pack (minus Doug as usual)are helping Chow to break into his old house to retrieve the $21 million owed to Marshall (John Goodman) but it turns out that the house belongs to Marshall and they have helped Chow steal the other $21 million. I thought this was a really clever and hysterical twist in the film.<br/><br/>I personally believe that this film would of been better if so much hadn't been revealed in the trailer's i.e. When Chow and Alan are on the bench and he says ""hey fat stuff give me some sugar"" and Alan kisses him, The scene with the chickens/cocks, when Chow parachutes off of Ceasers Palace and sings ""I believe I can fly"" and shouts ""I LOVE COCAINE"", when Alan says ""Lesley we cant be friends anymore, when we get together bad things happen and people get hurt"" Chow ""yeah that's the point its funny"".<br/><br/>The after credit scene was hilarious and capped off the brilliance of the movie for me.

Todd Phillip has improved his screen writing in every movie he gives us right on from old school to H3. And Zach what more we can ask from him? If at all they are planning for part 4, they might lose the charm of the hangover series. On the whole power packed entertainer!!"

","Phil is cool,Alan is funny,Chow is funny,Stew is funny and well Doug is not really in the film...the usual. Everyone loves Vegas bar those who are members of the wolfpack...John Goodman wants his money back from chow...Black Doug still ''hanging out at the Bellogio''...I hate Melissa. The premise is hugely related to the unexpected Box office of the first of the trilogy. Carlos again makes an appearance rocking the shades. Unfortunately no Heather Graham boob this tiMe. Well worth the watch really is entertaining. Can't understand the reason for the bad reviews...no movie follows up to it first!...I hope maybe in 10 years time they realize one more is badly needed."

","It seems to me that Todd Phillips is primarily interested in character- driven stories. Comedy is a part of that, because some of his characters are tragic/pathetic/helpless, which very often can be funny.<br/><br/>But that also means that the characters to some extent decide where the story goes. As it happens, this particular story turned out to not be a comedy. Considering what kind of person Chow really is, that isn't so surprising. Lets face it, he is a full-blown psychopath. He may seem funny at first, he did so in Part I, and to a lesser degree in Part II, but in Part III we get a really close look. He isn't funny. He is actually damn scary.<br/><br/>A lot of people, judging from the user reviews, were expecting a comedy. And since Hangover Part 3 isn't all that funny, they gave it 1's and 2's. I mean, seriously? A rating of 1 means that there was absolutely no skill involved in making the movie. And that simply isn't true in this case. It's a very well made movie: it's well written, well directed, well played, and well timed. It just isn't a comedy. It's a STORY. It's a gritty and realistic portrayal of some pretty messed up people, in some pretty bad situations.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie a lot. I got no promise from Todd Phillips that I would get a comedy. It's right there, on the poster, for all to see: 3 grim men, dressed in black, in a black environment. That's a poster that says: THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!<br/><br/>In fact, one could argue that Part I and II set the stage for Part III to really have an effect on the audience. It certainly had an effect on me, i won't be forgetting it anytime soon. It's an eye-opener, that's for sure."

","The good news is that Todd Phillips and co. figured out the mistakes they made with Part II. The bad news is that they didn't figure out how to fix them. Instead of just repeating the identical plot in a new location, the guys are back in Las Vegas with a plot involving fall-out from their previous actions. That's the good part. The bad part is that it's actually kind of boring and the jokes have become pretty tiring.<br/><br/>Doug, Phil and Stu are delivering Alan to rehab (finally a place where he belongs). However, along the way they get hijacked. Marshall (John Goodman) and his team of thugs including Black Doug kidnap our Doug because the Wolf Pack needs to track down Mr. Chow and his stolen loot. So off we go to Mexico and back to Las Vegas on a ridiculous trail of crime.<br/><br/>Just like Part II, everything is bigger and bolder, and it loses even more of the wit and creativity that we had with the original. There's also way more Chow. If you think Alan and Chow are funny in small doses, imagine how unfunny they become in large doses. The insolent and rude humour usually surrounding Alan that was introduced in the sequel is still very much present. The first off-colour joke that we saw in the trailer, really was just as it was portrayed in the trailer. Alan beheads a giraffe and that is supposed to be hilarious. Nobody laughed.<br/><br/>Luckily Phil and Stu are always alongside the troubled man-child. Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper have quickly proved that they're the stars of this franchise. They're able to add a likable factor to the disastrous Wolf Pack that we're cheering for their success even though it's about time that we all part ways. Phil is no longer just the arrogant asshole who wants all women and everything else in the world to go his way. He has settled down and he does his best to settle the rocky relationships and situations around him.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film takes them to Mexico in an attempt to befriend and then betray Chow. But that part moves surprisingly slow with our only two likable heroes not providing any of the comedy. When they follow Chow to Los Angeles, things do pick up. Alan meets a woman (his soul mate) and Phil and Stu use their smarts and charm to relive the glory days of The Hangover.<br/><br/>This third story really didn't need to be told and we're left hoping that the Wolf Pack and their arch nemeses will learn to just let sleeping dogs lie."

I loved Stu's performance among the three in this installment. Alan's demeanor is lovable and it has lots of twists in store for you. The plot is kinda weaker than the prequels. It slightly gives an impression that it was made-up. The things that Part 3 misses is the originality, humor intensity and adventures. It lacks the latter a bit much. Also, the prevention of nudity, sex & drug abuse is quite a good approach to end the franchise. Nice.<br/><br/>Music is, as always, good. Screenplay is good. The second half being more lively, I enjoyed the movie to the fullest because every time it shows a flashback, I experienced goosebumps. Lovely. I won't reprimand much for its goofs, illogical sequences & timid writing, because the idea itself is worth an applaud. Good job, Todd Phillips & crew!<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: A watchable sequel, but not a laugh riot. If you've enjoyed the series, this is a must watch.

","So this is a film which I was really hesitant to go see as The Hangover II left me with an utter sense of disappointment, But never judging a movie by its trailer (Usually trailers give far to much away) I decided to go watch this film with two of my best friends.<br/><br/>This film has a great beginning which although less chuckle worthy sets the film in motion, which helped drive what plot there was along, This characters are all still there but with more of a focus on the weird and wonderful Alan, Now for this point the film should not have been called the hangover III it should have been called Alan the movie which all in all is not a bad point BUT This film works on more of an Action / Thriller genre with humor thrown in where needed, And as a comedy, the writing has certainly changed to keep it fresh without the constant use of old jokes (Baby masturbating / monkey wenis) The comedy is extremely funny in places but with some obvious cheap laughs thrown in because some of the scenes would seem bland.<br/><br/>On the directing front this is still directed by the same director todd phillips, although with the directing style and the cinematic shots you would not honestly be able to tell. But this also goes to show he is a diverse Director with a good future in action movies in his future too As with all the hangover films the soundtrack is brilliantly chosen which adds to the chaos we usually see in the film Some fresh faces turn up here and there and some old faces that was not quite as memorable and lots of type cast roles (John Goodman) but still with some great acting This film will have you laughing but wishing it was better than the original This film scores a 7 / 10 Not too original but also a better than average comedy"
"mkenyon1978","8","0","1","4 June 2013"," Funny and better than I expected
","I really enjoyed this movie, thought it was much funnier than I expected and definitely worth the ticket price (I am a 34 y/o female, so not exactly the target audience). I loved the first of the trilogy and thought the second, though funny, was mostly a carbon copy of the first. I had not heard good things about this one so went in with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised, it was quite a bit darker and didn't have the standard hangover theme, but did have a good storyline and some excellent jokes and I liked that it deviated from the standard premise of the first two. Although the jokes made me laugh, most of them really skirted the line and quite a few blew that line to pieces, so from that perspective I get that many don't find this movie funny.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Mr Chow escaping from a Bangkok prison and then we witness Alan causing a massive pileup on the freeway after beheading a giraffe driving under a low overpass. His father is furious and after arguing with and berating Alan dies of a heart- attack. After the funeral Doug informs Stu and Phil that Alan is off his meds and that the family is planning an intervention and talks them into participating. This leads to Alan only agreeing to go into rehab if the wolf pack all take him - and so it begins... The guys are just on their way when they are run off the road and kidnapped and tasked with finding Chow or Doug gets killed. <br/><br/>Ken Jeong and Zack Galifianakis are both brilliant in their roles and I think the chemistry between the wolf pack is fabulous as always. A funny and entertaining movie that I would rate above the second installment but below the first."
"jackpace1997","7","0","1","4 June 2013"," Where's the hangover ???
","Part 3 of Todd Phillips's comedy trilogy ends it all on not a low not just not a high one. Part 1 as you should know is the clear best of the 3 and two a good but floored entry it didn't catch the light the first one had and maybe taking it to far sometimes. A problem that I had which others seem not to is that there isn't an actual hangover. The after credits scene is exactly what I wanted them to wake up after a wedding and having stupid stuff happen. Yes it would be just the same thing again but it's what made the first and second in parts so good and popular. I feel that with all that happens in this film it feels like a set up for a fourth film (that won't happen) because without this you wouldn't believe that Alan would ever marry anyone. Speaking of Alan, he and arguably chow are the main points of the film as they are the best they have lines that at times had me Truly laughing but at times just weeping at the attempted rubbish jokes. Bradley cooper and ed helms take back stage in this one as they kinda have through the hole serious. On the hole I do not agree that this is a humourless end to a humourless trilogy. It is an okay end to a funny and original series. And it's a shame that there won't be anymore but I'm glad just in case they truly screwed something up."

","I'm not going to sit here and try to convince anybody. If you love hangover and the characters you will love this movie. It's very funny and the jokes hit the funny bone with references to the past two movies. I loved it just as much as I loved the first two and I wish they would keep making more. The only complaint with this movie is I wish heather graham would have had a bigger role. It is a little darker then the first two as in comedy wise but the jokes still hit home. So in conclusion, this movie is just what you thought it was. A hangover movie with a cocky but calm Phil. A panicked stu and a man child as in Alan. So if that's your kinda movie this one is for you."
"HelenMary","6","0","1","1 June 2013"," Funny but not Hangover 1 Hilarious
","I think Hangover 1 was a comedy game-changer. Two and, now, three, just don't match it, there's no denying it. Whilst three was an adequate comedy, with quite a few laughs, in jokes and addenda to the first and second films, it's just missing something. I don't know what. The final Wolfpack trilogy sees the gang back together: Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug (Cooper, Helms, Galifianakis and Bartha respectively) pitting their wits against Chow (Jeong) and also a new character played by John Goodman.<br/><br/>The gang are back in Vegas but also travel to Mexico, there's lots of high jinx, car crashes, crazy animal scenes, embarrassing scenarios and as always credit extras. Anyone who leaves straight away after the film misses the climax as with all of the trilogy. It's an entertaining film, well worth the view, and not regrettable by a long shot but it's missing something that would make it a great comedy rather than a good one. Perhaps it's that the first one had the element of surprise and it was so different. Cooper, again, is the star, the alpha wolf in the pack, and is more or less the straight man across from all the back and forth of Alan and Stu. Chow of course is off his head insane and he Jeong does that so well, but he's not as freaky as he was in the first two. Not so offensive, but still not vanilla, rude, crude and silly it's a giggle but it is not an exaggeration to say that it seems the writers have run out of laughs and ideas.<br/><br/>Would recommend it, but go in knowing it's not as good as the first one. Don't have your hopes too high and you'll come out pleasantly surprised. Watch to the end."

","I entered the theater without having any expectation. Reading all the reviews floating around the internet is a good way to shed all the expectations you could have for this movie. I liked Hangover part II even though the reviews were bad. So, there was a small hope that I could like this one but not much. I really enjoyed the movie and came out of theater wondering what all the negative reviews were about.<br/><br/>The movie moves away from the regular hangover template. Storyline is pretty much clear from the trailers. The two halves are at two different ends of the spectrum. The first half is a laugh riot with all the characters chipping in with their share of wit though Zach and Ken Jeong are responsible for most of the laughs. A couple of jokes fall flat. But most of them work well.<br/><br/>The second half has its funny moments but is serious for most of the part. There is romance, there is sentiment which you don't usually find in hangover movies. But all those scenes are justified as you have to tie all the lose ends if you have to end a trilogy. Movie scores well technically. Cinematography is splendid and is the best in all the 3 movies. Music could have been better at certain places though it was good for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is a good ending to the trilogy. There are flaws but you can't just dump this movie based on that. It is completely enjoyable and I will surely watch it again."

","If you want to watch a movie that generates almost nonstop laughter, this is the movie for you. Although this is the third installment of the wolf pack, featuring the usual cast of characters, this movie actually is more about one of the characters, Doug, and his strange and highly amusing relationship with Mr. Chow, who is one of the funniest characters in movies today. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are wonderful, but they serve as straight men as Doug and Chow deliver all the funny lines. Ken Cheong is outstanding as Mr. Chow, but it is Zach Galifianakis who carries this movie. What a great comedic actor. Many of his lines generate immediate laughter and since he has most of the gunny lines, there's lot so laughter. Some of the humor is low brow, but so what? It's a comedy. And the presence of Melissa McCarthy makes this movie even more hilarious. A she-wolf may be joining the group."

We wanted to spend the next 2 hours laughing until our faces hurt (as we had with the last 2). It just didn't happen. Now, don't get me wrong, we liked it and it was funny. It just wasn't nearly as funny as we were all hoping it would be. I was really thinking they would make the franchise go out with a bang and really ""bring it"" for the last. I'm honestly not sure what went wrong though. I think they were trying to be more serious, which is fine (and again, the movie was good). But this audience wanted to be rolling in the aisle laughing. As others have said, the funniest part (by far) was the scene during the credits. Now THAT is what we wanted for this movie. Why couldn't we have skipped this 3rd one and gone straight to that one?

","The first Hangover film was a surprise hit. Yes, it had glossy Hollywood production values, but it had no big name stars and in fact made stars of the three main actors. <br/><br/>Hangover 2 was a cash-in, deliberately politically incorrect retread of the original. This part three, well... it could have been great. <br/><br/>The original idea was to have Alan already committed to a psychiatric ward with the ""wolfpack"" (a throwaway joke in the first film that became something akin to the jedi order in the sequels) breaking him out so that he could attend his father's funeral. To do this they utilise the ""demon inside"" Stu by plying him with a cocktail of drugs. The Marshall vs Chow story was to have been a subplot. <br/><br/>This was jettisoned in favour of a plot that Jon Favreau did far better things with in his movie 'Made'. <br/><br/>There are some funny moments, but Bradley Cooper - on Bruce Willis-ian phoning-it-in mode - seems embarrassed to be there now, while the relatively weak acting chops of Ed Helms and Ken Jeong are laid bare by the threadbare script. This is Galifianakis's movie and one is left wondering how funnier it would have been just to focus on his character. <br/><br/>Lack of exposition, of any knowledge of the real story on the characters' part is what made the original such a treat. A terrific script powered it. In part three, funny sketches occasionally raising laughs, there us no such genius at script level. Acres of exposition fill the mouths of actors - John Goodman deftly using this to his advantage as the no-nonsense Marshall - and ultimately it is the audience who are lost and wrong-footed when, in a 'The Hangover' movie, it should be the characters. I mean, did we all really enjoy the nauseating ""Mr Chow"" so much as to have him be a breakout character? <br/><br/>As a movie, Hangover 3 makes a terrific trailer."
