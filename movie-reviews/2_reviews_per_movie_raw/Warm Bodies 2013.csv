"MR_Heraclius","8","45","49","4 March 2020"," Enjoyable zombie flick with comedic elements.
","A genuinely pleasant surprise! Here's a film that takes a dead-on-arrival plot (no pun intended) and turns it into something that is fresh for the uber-popular zombie genre. While the film gets off to a slow start and the acting can be *ahem* stiff at times, we as an audience are invested in this endearing and lovely relationship between the zombie, R, and his living girlfriend, Julie. We want to see them live happily together and survive in the odd, post-apocalyptic conditions that plague their world. I also can't help but dig the nice use of music in this film. Nice work!"
"Quebec_Dragon","7","112","139","25 February 2013"," More original than you might think
","Finally the great zombie romance? Well, maybe not, but it's the closest I've seen. You get to see zombie life from the perspective of a zombie, who starts to get feelings for a girl who's alive. Through a set of circumstances, he ""rescues"" her and they take refuge in a grounded plane at an airport overrun by the undead. There were several original elements that I had never seen in a zombie movie. First and foremost is the narration by our young zombie giving us insights into his condition. He can barely utter words, but weirdly, in his head, he seems smart and talks normally. I liked that part and I was kinda sorry when he got somewhat better at talking, therefore evacuating most of his thoughts. Second original element was the romance. I wasn't impressed by it, but at least it was slow-building, somewhat charming, avoiding most of the disgusting stuff, and you kind of rooted for them by the end.<br/><br/>Third original element would be the zombies not stuck as they are. They can ""evolve"" (our hero) or ""devolve"" (bonies, zombies who shed their outer skins, looking almost like black ghouls or skeletons). Speaking of bonies, I thought they looked amazing, creepy even, but their movements were stiff and made them look computer-generated. Also, who knew that eating brains for zombies could be a way for them to live vicariously the past life of the person they ate, through visions. It's not even the only way they can ""change"", although the other way, though nice, seemed a bit far-fetched and too quick. Fourth original element was that there was sometimes a humanistic, hopeful even, vibe to the proceedings despite the dramatic elements. There's something at the end involving the zombies and the bonies that I had never seen before. So the movie is more original than one might think, however the execution wasn't flawless.<br/><br/>Sure, overall, I found the movie had charms, but for me the laughs were few and far between, like most romantic comedies I suppose. Because it's supposed to be one of those, but with obviously more somber elements. The drama could have used more ""teeth"" to make this film truly memorable and moving though. The movie even made me think of Romeo & Juliet as well as Edward Scissorhands, not bad stories to be associated with. The creators never really went into total parody or silly mode, which I think was a smart choice. What really took me out of the picture at several occasions though is that they didn't follow their own internal rules. We're told by our hero that zombies can only shamble slowly, yet not long after, we see zombies running. It's like they can have bursts of speed at will. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Also, I know it's a short movie, but zombies ""evolve"" too quickly, especially the best friend. Acting was fairly good, not exceptional, but I particularly liked the main character. Why? Because he's a nice, smart freak, quite lonely and having trouble to express his feelings in words and actions, but able to be slowly ""healed"" by kindness and love. It made him interesting and relatable to me and probably others. Yes, the movie could even be seen as an allegory on solitude, not fitting in, and how hard it is to truly connect to others in modern society.<br/><br/>Zombie makeup was rather minimal, and they managed to make the protagonist kind of attractive, in a goth-like way, mostly because of his great hair and pale blue eyes. I thought there were wasted opportunities with the concept, but it could have been done much, much worse. So, I liked the movie, I would even recommend it to most people not allergic to zombies to see a different take on them. It's very minimally bloody and the most ""gory"" part is when they show a zombie shedding his skin to become a bonie, and even that's not too disgusting. I think it would make a good date movie. Warm Bodies didn't leave me cold and the more I dwell on it, the warmer my feelings for it get.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)"
"plasticanimalz","9","196","255","2 February 2013"," Loved it
","I was looking forward to this since the moment I saw the trailer and so got myself out of bed for the 10:05 am showing on opening day. It looked funny, like 'Shaun of the Dead,' and seemed to have its own interesting take, which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie, R's, emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. This is nothing like 'Twilight,' and those that are saying that have either not seen it or are too absorbed in the fact that the two leads are good looking, which is the only commonality this film has with 'Twilight.'But, let's face it, the majority of leads in films are attractive, so, that's not much to base a similarity on. 'Shaun of the Dead' was just a comedy, where this is a comedy with heart and depth. It's a satire, but they don't force feed the point of the film, instead they make it very subtle, which is nice.<br/><br/>It wasn't a laugh-out-loud comedy, but I don't know that I necessarily thought it would be when I saw the trailer. It definitely had more emotional depth than I thought it would which gave me a much fonder attachment to the film than if it had simply been made for laughs. The two leads had great chemistry and were believable and well cast. The directing, writing, and pretty much everything in the film was well done. I have no complaints. It delivered what it said it would and exceeded my expectations which is rare these days in entertainment."
"rebecca-ry","8","130","175","16 February 2013"," Entertaining from start to finish
","'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of the zombies.<br/><br/>The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better – there's depth to the characters, a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not expect. I am glad there were some scary moments, with zombies you expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but, I am surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen – the film entertains you from start to finish.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this; it must have been difficult to do this role – especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good; it's nice to see a female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the mind- numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame because he can be really funny.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary – particularly towards the end. However, the film is really nice, funny and even heart-warming sometimes."
"wolivernyc","Null","111","152","1 February 2013"," Zombie Love Like You've Never Seen
","Going into Jonathan Levine's (50/50, The Wackness) new film Warm Bodies, I was intrigued. I didn't know quite what I was going to get as the concept was fresh and unique.<br/><br/>Zombies have taken over, yet one zombie, named R, played wonderfully by Nicholas Hoult has a mind of his own and is not your typical zombie. He has a conscious mind at work, and soon he falls for a pretty girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) that he encounters.<br/><br/>This is where the movie puts a twist on the whole zombie genre. He soon becomes enamored by her and becomes more human, as she has stimulated his heart. Can a zombie find solace with another person and...love? That is the main theme of this movie, and it's a damn good one.<br/><br/>Their chemistry will draw you in and actually make you buy it, no matter how ridiculous it is. R's friend, M, played hilariously by Rob Corddry steals the show with funny scene after funny scene.<br/><br/>With Warm Bodies you get a mix of comedy, romance, and zombie-horror. It's a fresh spin on all three, and it was truly a fun time at the theater. It's well paced and has a great feel to it from the get-go, mostly in part to wonderful narration from Holt, and smooth direction from Levine.<br/><br/>It's only February but I already found one of my early favorites of 2013."
"bruno_zamrey","7","79","108","16 February 2013"," I'm surprised
","When I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be another teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of her boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with alternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand new type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you with your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great for family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest and the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie, that will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of entertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of course, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a little boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to see with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English, i'm from other country."

","This movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was going to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go see this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute way. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and romantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but this movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was entertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair team were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to relate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone. I suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see this movie!"
"hyprsleepy","Null","86","123","7 February 2013"," Funny and Sweet, like Wall-E mixed with a zombie movie
","And they said you couldn't have a zombie romance story. Take that vampires! <br/><br/>The zombie R was surprisingly strong, but sensitive, sweet, loving, and protective. He wanted to talk to the pretty girl but had trouble finding the words, or at least vocalizing them. His determination and frantic antics were endearing.<br/><br/>Julie was not some wussy victim or brainless babe. It made me happy to see she was tough and could take care of herself. She had a rebellious streak that made her entertaining to watch and a softer affectionate side that showed itself with R.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I liked both characters and wanted to see them succeed. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the scenes where R eats the brains and we saw more of Julie, her old boyfriend, her father, and how they all fit together. It was heart felt and well-done. The relationships and the complexity of them was less evident in the movie than in the book but I could still feel it. If you liked the movie I highly suggest reading the book, by the way.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies was well paced and acted, and one of the better zombie movies I have seen. Watch it, and provided you aren't dead inside, be overcome by it's cuteness!"
"liana-li","9","102","152","1 February 2013"," ""Warm bodies"" embodies so many parodies
","I went to see ""Warm Bodies"" on opening night, something I rarely do. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed in this strangely romantic comedy. Don't be turned off by the premise of a zombie romantic comedy - it manages to parody human relationships on many levels the way ""Shaun of the Dead"" parodied zombie movies. Nicholas Holt does a wonderful job parodying the awkward teenager filled with angst and a longing to connect, yet his inner dialog makes for much of the movie's comedy. He manages to have a bromance and a romance and make you laugh at the same time. Rob Corddry does a wonderful job holding up his end of the bromance if you will, and I didn't even catch his part in aiding the Shakespearian nod. Yes, this movie manages to pull a pun on Shakespeare while also light-heartedly setting out themes for what defines a person as human. Teresa Palmer does a wonderful job rounding out the chick flick humor with Analeigh Tipton. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be going to see it again. I was too busy laughing to see the plot holes.<br/><br/>I also have purposefully avoided reading the book, so I wouldn't have any preconceived notions of the movie. I get that the book was much darker than the film, which would set a viewer up for disappointment in a romantic comedy."

","In a post-apocalyptic United States of America, the survivors live in a city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead. Their leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food and supplies for the population. However, they are surprised by a group of zombies. Among them, R (Nicholas Hoult), who is a young zombie without recollections but very introspective.<br/><br/>R eats Perry's brain and revives his memories and sensations with Julie, and he falls in love with her. R saves Julie from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. Along the days, they develop a weird relationship and become friends. When a group of zombies led by R's friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her. Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them.<br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story is worthwhile; the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with the cover of Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" in Blu-Ray is cult; the chemistry and the romance are adorable and in the end I loved this cute movie. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Meu Namorado é um Zumbi"" (""My Boyfriend is a Zombie"")<br/><br/>Note: On 01 May 2019, I saw this film again."
"lagudafuad","6","37","53","11 February 2013"," This movie is cool
","Warm Bodies is a beauty and the beast love story crossed with the  typical zombie horror flick. The movie's pace is well done and the  movie itself is well directed by the director of the 2011 drama 50/50,  Jonathan Levin. He also wrote the screenplay, which he based on a 2010  novel of the same name (Warm Bodies) by Isaac Marion.  The acting in the movie is glamorous, from both the humans and the  zombies, and I did enjoy the makeup effect on the lead as he starts to  morph from a zombie to a human. The movies use of humor is well timed  and arranged as it is clever, when you feel it is getting a little too  serious, out of nowhere jumps a comic line that lightens the mood. The  other thing that you will enjoy is the Romeo and Juliet references that  the director made sure were present and obvious, as the lead characters  name is R which I believe R for Romeo and his love interest is named  Julie which I believe is in reference to Juliet.  The thing that attracted me to this movie in the first place was the  new idea of how the movie is viewed from the zombie's point of view; we  also get to hear his thoughts as he goes through life being an undead.  Set in a post apocalypse era, Warm Bodies is more about open  mindedness, the ability to accept that others can change. The movie is  more of a romantic drama than it is about humans going all Resident  Evil on Zombies.  The plot is about an unusual zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who  developed human emotions and craved for more. The humans during this  post apocalypse era lived a barricade life away from zombies who have  practically taking over the world. Part of the human settlement went  out to get some supplies, during that time they ambushed by zombies,  there R saw Julie (Teresa Palmer) and fell for her.  He then saved her from the others and made her stay with him during  which more emotional attachment developed between the two till she had  to go back to her people. But something new started among the zombies  that one act by R caused a revolution.  The movies score jumped out at me as being bad though, that is from my  view. The movie is cool, and the humor is really well timed and this is  a movie that I can comfortably advise that you should see."
"gsmoore81","10","59","90","24 February 2013"," Thoroughly enjoyable movie
","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre unlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or gory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a full-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10 minutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because I have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not know how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first hour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I have ever seen. Enjoy!"
"joshrortiz","7","49","76","24 January 2013"," I liked it a lot!
","""Warm Bodies"" is a comedic, romantic, action-filled zombie flick. Being a zombie movie, people do get chased, attacked, eaten by zombies but since it is PG-13, it's not too graphic. Fun surprise: zombies aren't the only creatures stalking humans in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie opens with a wonderfully fun and clever introduction to the zombie apocalypse as well as the main zombie character named R. Nicholas Hoult's R is funny, loyal, curious, likable, protective, charming. Definitely not a typical zombie. There are many scenes where our zombie friend goes about his daily life, accompanied by hilarious and clever voice overs. It's interesting how he questions everything, thinks constantly, longs to connect. This opportunity arises when he meets Julie, sparking a sort-of Romeo and Juliet type of relationship. Julie is a resistance fighter whose dad (John Malcovich) leads the humans. She is strong and brave yet vulnerable and sweet. The chemistry between R and Julie is undeniable. I can honestly say that I cared what happened to them.<br/><br/>All the actors did a fantastic job. John Malkovich is great as always. Dave Franco's character was quite tragic. Analeigh Tipton is wonderful as Jule's best friend, providing some funny lines and support, though it would have been nice to have more of her. A shout-out to Rob Corddry is required as he has some of the best lines and is just fantastic as a fellow zombie. (Definitely would be on my crew during the zombie apocalypse)<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend ""Warm Bodies."" It's fun, fast-paced, clever, looks great, has interesting characters, action, some scares, romance. Maybe see with a date or by yourself or a group of friends, up to you."
"terrellrobinson71","9","89","149","31 January 2013"," Make way for a teenage zombie that is sure to be the best surprise to kick off the new year.
","Here's something you don't see every day: A romantic comedy involving zombies. Thus, ""Warm Bodies"", a fresh, fast-paced, sensational and truly original delight that is sure to knock your socks off from beginning to end. Start with the premise: After an plague has caused people to turn into zombies, the real humans including General Grigio (John Malkovich) separate themselves from the brain-eating zombies by building up a wall in order to keep them away. Along the way, we get to meet one of those zombies. Meet R (the charming British heartthrob Nicholas Hoult). He doesn't quite like this life, knowing that he has to eat brains in order to survive and to live off the memories of the humans he's killed. He's looking for someone to connect to, which is really explained through his facial expressions and inner monologues. Then it's love at first bite, when he's finally connecting to Julie (Australian beauty Teresa Palmer), daughter of General Grigio. When he sees her after she shoots most of his friends, he decides to protect her and to ""keep her safe"". Yes, this zombie is in love. Protecting her in his abandoned airplane filled with vinyl records, a record player, and other resourceful things, R finally gets to realize that something was missing in him all along, leaving his heart beating to realize that he loves her. That's when R, his friend M (a wonderful Rob Corddry) and the other zombies are starting to change. That's all good, until the CG skeletal creatures known as Bonies will do anything to prevent that from happening, which leads off into the film's fantastical climax. ""Warm Bodies"", directed by Jonathan Levine (of the delightful comedy-drama ""50/50"" and the incredibly wicked ""The Wackness""), who also adapted the film from Isaac Marion's bestselling book for young adults, combines a mixture of 5 different genres (comedy, horror, romance, drama, even a little bit of sci-fi) that makes the film more smarter and even more better than ""The Twilight Saga"". (Take that, Jacob Black.) What also makes it work is the inspired casting of Nicholas Hoult from ""About a Boy"", ""X-men: First Class"" and the upcoming ""Jack the Giant Slayer"". As R, he literally dives deep into the emotions as well as having terrific comic timing through his expressions and his inner monologues by using a spot-on American accent. He also develops great chemistry with Teresa Palmer, known as the butt-kicking alien Six in ""I Am Number Four"", who, as Julie, has a tough and fearless personality as well as a emotional side to her. The supporting cast is also incredible, including Analeigh Tipton, who is hilarious as Julie's friend, Nora, Dave Franco (James's little brother from last year's ""21 Jump Street"") who gets a brief amount of screen time, but really sticks it out as Julie's ex-boyfriend, Perry, who (in order not to spoil this) gets called for a dinner date that includes brains on the menu and the great John Malkovich excels as a man who believes that the zombies are nothing more than just flesh-eating corpses looking forward to get shot in the head, but doesn't believe that his only daughter is in love with one. I know what you're thinking, this is just another zombie movie. But ""Warm Bodies"" is certainly different than that. It revives the zombie genre by bringing something original to the screen. For those who love the TV series ""The Walking Dead"" and the other zombie comedies ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", not to mention George A. Romero ""...of the Dead"" series, you actually will get a taste of what the zombie world is like through the eyes of one. And maybe like R's, your heart will warm up too. This is the best surprise so far this year. Note: ""Warm Bodies"" is pretty tame, but pushing the envelope for a PG-13 film involving zombies who eats brains and Bonies who consumes hearts. Those are hardly seen, but there are people who shoot zombies in the head with guns. That works in order to keep it very organic."
"jasonforsending","2","46","77","6 April 2013"," Could have been a great satire!
","This is one of those movies which sadly is a feature-length version of its trailer with little more to offer. During the entire movie I kept waiting for the story world to crumble into satire, because I was in disbelief that someone would make a zombie version of Twilight, let alone one this messy. In Warm Bodies (as explained in the trailer) love literally conquers all. R goes for days without eating because of: love. R becomes living again because of: love. R transfers his love/revitalizing powers via...telekinesis(?) to the rest of the zombies because of....love. What kind of love can have that kind of power? Good 'ol American love: he sees a blonde-haired blue-eyed teenager firing a gun and that's it, baby. No one needs to tell the girl what Stockholm Syndrome is, because that would ruin the magic that is their romance.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there were definitely a few laughs here and there but I just kept waiting for that moment where the fourth wall would be shattered! Having at least a little meta content would have been great, adding a tiny bit of intelligence to it all. 2/10"
"tr91","8","9","12","30 July 2013"," Surprisingly lovely

There is still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.<br/><br/>I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a relationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent Nicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen friendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK it is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we are left with a great ending.<br/><br/>I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely worth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also funny, a winner for me.<br/><br/>8/10"
"nico-hvi","2","55","103","13 April 2013"," An insult to intelligence
","I came into the theatre expecting a coherent (""It's based on a novel so there has to be some consistency"" I thought, stupidly) story set in a post-apocalyptic world (it's a zombie movie, after all) with some dark humour thrown into the mix for good measure. What I discovered was an inconsistent, bland, badly acted attempted romance-movie with ridiculous (not in the good way) dialogues.<br/><br/>In short: We meet a zombie (R) who has incredibly coherent thought processes for a zombie, yet chooses to eat brains for sustenance. If this garish action is really necessary we never truly find out, after all he doesn't eat for a week after meeting Julie (the bland, berating love interest badly played by Teresa Palmer), but the movie dismisses this rather vital part of information with the following mind-blowing dialogue.<br/><br/>Julie: Do you have to eat brains? R: Yes<br/><br/>Seriously. <br/><br/>The movie then goes on about how R is changing, yet the characters seem to ignore this fact - no one seems taken aback in the least that zombies suddenly can talk, even though it's been established that such a thing is impossible. Hell, the fact that they run seems very implausible to me seeing as how the entire intro sequence is dedicated to R telling us how he shuffles around all day and when he goes out to feed he literally says: ""this is going to take a while"", but I digress.<br/><br/>This is figuratively literally the tip of the iceberg, and just to illustrate this point, this is the way the movie handles the love interest losing her initial boyfriend (whom the movie then tries to turn into a douche bag by making him act like one in a dream sequence so we wouldn't be so creeped out when she makes out with the zombie who ate his brains).<br/><br/>R eats boyfriend's brain. R rescues Julie (by smearing what appears to be poop on her - I guess it was supposed to be blood) through some unexplained process several times. Julie NEVER mentions her ex-boyfriend. Suddenly, in a throw-away line, she explains that it's not that she's not sad - it's just that she prepared for this. Yeah, that's how emotions work.<br/><br/>There are still loads of things to point out (for instance how rotting zombies become super-human monsters once they totally flip out and become 'skellies'), but I hope my point has gotten across. The only reason I give this movie more than 1/10 is the way Analeigh Tipton says 'Sup?' to the zombie R when he (successfully) wins Julie back after having explained to her that he ate her boyfriend's brain, but has now walked a couple of miles so it should be okay."
"bmwmalaga","8","43","85","11 January 2013"," Wry and clever, tonally unique.
","This reviewer was drawn into an early screening designed to generate buzz concerning the worth of the same, so I suppose my end of the deal is to afford such. With this firmly in mind, well - so be it! I rather liked the promotional trailer, drawn as I was to the wry tone and unlikely re-imagining of the zombie genre even as I care little for horror or gore. Fear existed that the premise wouldn't be exploited to the full or that the film would register across just the bits shared in the preview. Such anxieties were misplaced for the film proved consistently entertaining throughout and perhaps better than expected.<br/><br/>Much relies upon the capacity of the viewer to accept if not celebrate the understated tone of what is nevertheless an over-the-top zombie picture. The voice over narration provided to us by the 'R' character, affording calm, matter of fact reportage concerning the 'lived experience' of being one of the undead; i.e. charting meaningless time spent will either connect or not connect, where I was pleased to note that the audience in attendance quietly gathered and enjoyed many a little nuance presented for our collective delectation. No one could help by find the tone and direction of this pleasant lark of a date movie anything less than winning. Expect to have a nice time."
"nimedez","8","7","10","30 May 2013"," Twighlight officially sucks after watching this!!!!!
","YES..it is another vampire love story movie, but guess what? There's better humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type of story. The part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they made it to the way comedy/love/vampire gore and most of all action scenes to were they should be placed at the right moment. Although, its the typical zombies eat human, who would ever thought of why not making a Romeo and Juliet zombie kinda movie. Its pure genius, Better yet..Props to the person who wrote it. This definitely makes that OVERRATED Twilight series SUCKS MORE after watching this. I would really recommend watching it."
"chaos-rampant","Null","16","28","19 June 2013"," Zombie narrator discovers Twilight love
","What if zombies had thoughts running through their heads as they lunged around? And what if you made a movie from their pov? That seems to have been the whole concept here, and a story was worked out. The idea itself is a good one, not unlike the Tucker and Dale movie from last year, and perhaps long due. Horror, effective horror, has been all about placing us closer to the nature of the horrific experience, it's why as early as the 1960's, monsters were dragged from swamps and castles and moved next door to Bates motel.<br/><br/>And what better placement than making us the monster?<br/><br/>So they could have this as a black comedy, and I'd be a happy viewer. We'd see all those situations we know from zombie movies, but from behind the zombie mist of dumb instincts looking out at human instincts, in a way that drove home the absurdity and dumbness, drawing the same parallels that Romero did in his time. We are in Romero's timeline anyway, Land of the Dead.<br/><br/>But for reasons that strike me as more shrewd than creative, they decided this should be a romantic movie. The idea here is to have the zombie narrator as one of the target audience, a teenager baffled at the 'deadness' of modern life, a music geek and awkward with the girl he loves, stuttering every time. Clever so far. <br/><br/>Where it completely loses me as a viewer, is that the decision was made, and this had to have been part of a shrewd business plan, that there is currently no better mode to rope more of that teenage audience than Twilight. The franchise has come and gone, but the ripples are still being felt, especially in a film like this.<br/><br/>What the Twilight influence means is that there is the angle of forbidden love, forbidden because of social constructs. They found a mopey, Kristen Stewart lookalike to be the sullen heroine. There is a more elaborate mythos, introducing zombies which are more evil than 'regular' ones. And it all has to culminate with an 'epic' battle and redemptive aftermath. Worst of all, and this is why I rate the film so low, is that mopey, wistful tone that probably passes as introspection in high-school corridors. There's even the inane visual bit, the equivalent of sparkly vampires, with the hearts of 'awakened' zombies beating red!<br/><br/>You'll know the filmmaker is a dull mind, if you observe the scene, it's a small moment but very indicative, where 'good' zombies have decided to make a stand, rousing Scorpions music kicks in the soundtrack; instead of giving us say a flat, comedic side-shot where zombies simply limp along into the frame one by one, he has them coolly walk towards the camera... in slow motion! <br/><br/>Which defeats their actual stumbling in slow motion, all so we can have a useless Reservoir Dogs effect."

","Why? Dear lord, why is this movie rated over seven? Are the humanity seriously that retarded? Can people no longer separate good from bad? These are just some of the questions I am left with after watching this.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie should have been a parody, not a romantic comedy! The movie had been easier to accept if it was in a different genre. For example like «Shaun of the Dead». In that case I would totally accept the zombie-human love thing going on (NOT). Although there is humor in Warm Bodies, and it's clearly a movie that wants to be taken seriously, I do not buy the over all story!<br/><br/>Secondly, I get really embarrassed over how this so-called ""dialogue"" through the film is written. Moaning, ""yes"" and groaning ""not safe"" is totally not necessary. This could have been solved less awkward by letting the character show how he feels/thinks through something else, for example music (since they already have made a big scene about this, which I personally don't think evolved as good as it could).<br/><br/>Furthermore, I think the movie is wrong in terms of how zombies actually are. Zombies are, as they're in ALL the other movies and books on this subject – dead creatures. They do not live, they do not think and they certainty do not feel! But most of all THEY DO NOT SPEAK! They react only by instincts, and that instinct tells them to eat your face of.<br/><br/>I get the fact that this is a movie where the zombie boy gets ""feelings"", so I will not criticize that further on. But why didn't they just give him these human attributes along with him growing a heart? Why let him moan through phrases that would even get the heavy addicts uncomfortable?<br/><br/>I think a lot of this could have been solved to the better if the genre of this movie was a parody, as I stated previously. It would certainty be more fun to watch, and maybe I would actually laugh of the horrible scenes that was made to be funny and not feel the urge to scratch out my eyes and ears..<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is in fact a movie about a zombie who falls in love with his dinner. If that's not awkward enough – A post-apocalyptic Romeo and Juliet story is! Yes, I see the reference. I AM NOT BLIND! (yet, but I could be if I see this movie again) The world's most famous lovers will always be used as inspiration for love stories; I understand that, but really, WHY? WHY couldn't this have been done with a little more sophistic or finesse? Do the producers even have a brain, or did the zombies eat it?<br/><br/>Do not watch this BRAIN DEAD move if you have a beating heart. If you want to see something dead become a ""real boy"", I recommend Pinocchio"

","OK I have to preface this by saying that I normally do not make a habit of going into keyboard warrior mode but after having Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes and now IMDb all recommend me this garbage I have to draw the line.<br/><br/>When a movie kicks off with a completely unliving corpse giving a voice-over you have to be able to smell trouble. If that same carcass is murmuring dialogue you should sense something is wrong and when a love interest gets introduced in the same 15 minutes with the mushy close-ups...its OK at that point to begin asking for your refund.<br/><br/>It breaks a lot of conventions but in a really cringe-worthy manner. Zombieland was a perfect blueprint for modern undead humor without completely tarnishing the genre and style that our horror based creations originate from, why deviate? More importantly why encourage an impressionable movie goer like myself into going to see it when YOU KNOW I WON'T LIKE IT.<br/><br/>I expected better out of my critics, my peers and my internet sources. Roadhouse? I'm game. Turkish Star Wars? Let me at it. Where was the campiness that I loved so much in Braindead or even in the fairly recent Drag Me to Hell? Nowhere to be found here but I sure do get a ""Breakfast Club"" esque makeover scene. Thanks? Nah, no thanks.<br/><br/>Would you let a zombie watch you undress and sleep on your floor? I know this is make believe but GEEZ ITS A ZOMBIE THAT EATS BRAINS. The least you could do is introduce an element of danger that doesn't come from something...that ZOMBIES ARE AFRAID OF?? This is the most disappointing / worst zombie movie since Night of the Comet. There always needs to be new ideas that are tried out to genre movies but Warm Bodies is just not the right way to go about it. If you are a fan of good romance, comedy, action or horror then you will be guaranteed to be rubbed the wrong way and let down. Save your money, save your time."

"billygoat1071","7","15","27","1 February 2013"," Reliving The Love
","At first glance, people might think Warm Bodies is just another Twilight where there are monsters falling in love with humans except the vampires are replaced with zombies. The truth is it's almost nothing like it. Warm Bodies is based on Isaac Marion's book with the same name that serves an intriguing context about an apocalypse that destroyed civilizations and relationships. When humanity is dead without love, as in true and genuine love. It is also built for a whole lot of satires. Surprisingly, it skims many of those and turned it into a simple straightforward romance. It's still pretty good for making the romance feel so real that most adolescent fantasy adaptations fail to portray. Still, there are interesting bits around the concept that was left out and it could have made this film a lot more extraordinary.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's about zombies falling in love with people but there is something beneath it. The book has some satires about society's delusional view of love and contrasts it with the genuine kind of love that can change one's life forever, but those written allegories are probably too absurd(much absurd than the concept itself) to work on screen. The film is smart to just straightforwardly shows the romance and satires the zombie genre instead. Though, the darker side of the sentiment could have also been told but in a different way. The best parts are the romantic sequences between R and Julie. Their romance is just humble. They don't need to show off how perfect they are together. It rather lets the girl express her life while the boy just stammers and shrugs in front of her, meanwhile cherishing each other around the airport as endless music montages at the second act. It may sound peculiar but their modesty makes it peculiarly sweet.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult makes it easy for us to believe that he is a zombie by his movements and grunting. While inside his mind he shows the character's earnestness and views which is endearing. Teresa Palmer keeps the romance alive since she's the only one between them is alive. It's not really hard to fall in love with her as Julie. Rob Corddry here is like a lovable zombie version of his comic relief best friend roles and it surely fits to M While director, Jonathan Levine, never leaves the love behind, the film's weakest part is when it deals with the conflicts. It somehow lacks enough sense of danger, thus the action scenes are the least interesting bits of the film. They could have added more of that runtime for some characterization to the other characters and explanation to its broken world. It might probably improve that contrived and rushed climax. Technically, the film looks good. There isn't much to say about it though since there are much better things to talk about. The special effects may not be the best but those Boneys sure look fascinatingly campy.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is not subtle, though it doesn't always need to. It still gave us a pretty lovely story. Those lovely moments alone already made this a worth watching film. As a film, it lacks a little more gumption of releasing the concept's expressions, despite of that it's still a feel good entertaining film without any pretension and gets it right in providing what a remarkable romance should be. Most YA films really misses that point. Real and affecting love doesn't necessarily need to be flashy, sexy, nor snoochie boochie. Anyway, it's a refreshing escapist tale that anyone would enjoy. They all manage to keep it look literally gloomy, a little less mainstream, and have a pretty sweet humbling romance which made this strangely wonderful."
"kirablpl","1","34","70","14 April 2013"," Borderline Unwatchable
","I really, really wanted to like this movie. I liked the idea of the perspective shift, the trailer narration presents R as an interesting misfit, a little too alive to be a zombie and much too dead to be anything else. I love a good horror-comedy, and what better to poke fun at then undead romance? The storyline centers around a near future where the unspecified virus breaks loose and the remaining humans build a fortress to keep out the zombies. It adds its own twist that zombies, while some stay conscious like the hero, R, others simply give up hope, and become the 'Bonies'; a skeletal group of who are merciless and bloodthirsty, you know, like a zombie. So in that, I guess I was thinking there was a good set up for some more psychological conflict, especially if it's supposed to be based off of Romeo and Juliet where people do, you know, *actually* die.<br/><br/>I don't know why I was expecting so much. I was already expecting zombies, but none of them have so much as a missing hand or a vacant eye socket. It's the equivalent of the glittering vampire; unmutilated zombies, who are pale, blue eyed, and stare longingly. Of all the plot holes you could drive a convertible through, that one bothered me the most. To be fair, I think one of the little kid zombies was missing teeth.<br/><br/>I would give you a synopsis of this movie but there doesn't seem to be a point. It's pretty typical boy meets girl, falls in love, overcomes differences. As for being a comedy, the plot is too straight forward for anything besides a few cheap laughs. It takes itself too seriously to poke fun at things like Julie's controlling father, or how awkward zombie kisses could be, and not seriously enough to give any kind of emotional depth to the characters. The relationship between Julie and R reminded me much more of Tarzan and Jane than Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>I suppose if you're looking for a fun date movie with the all the appeal of the word zombie and none of the gore, horror or anything relevant to the title, and you're still in high school, this movie has appeal. Maybe if you read the book you'll have some appreciation that I didn't. If you have to do your own laundry, or have ever had a relationship with any real emotional substance, Warm Bodies will at best leave you feeling a bit tepid."

","First: Zombie with white teeth. Because if there's one thing the human flesh eating undead care about, it's dental hygiene. I'm in the first 37 mins of this movie and I can only ask myself why I wasted my time (seeing it free so not my money). And what is Hollywood's obsession with trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies, werewolves and vampires. Are they just setting us up to lower our expectations about all men? Choose between an animal, the undead or the actual dead. Honestly, I'm watching this movie as a parody because I cannot see how it can be addressed otherwise. I will not address the plethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow reviewers have done it justice. Skip this movie. To my friends who are making me watch this un-ironically; we might have to reconsider our relationship."
"bernhard-langers","4","22","43","3 March 2013"," This has about as much to do with zombies as the long drink has
","I walked into this movie not expecting much, but a little something. The intro was pretty nicely done and I expected it to not be as dire and gory as say The Walking Dead or Dawn of the Dead. I also didn't mind the idea that R serves as the narrator even though as a character he can't talk initially. Then the humans come into play. The group R first encounters is pretty much your every-slasher-movie-college-road-trip. There are no signs of any kind of training to fight against zombies or act as a group (yes, like playing Left4Dead with 12yos). I was willing to accept the fact that R would fall for Julie, that's the premise of the movie after all. Then however it starts going downhill.... rapidly. R is housing (as of now I will start counting face palm in brackets, so this is 1) in an abandoned airplane. He is opening the door (2) and keeps Julie there. His love interest in her is somewhat developed but still hard to believe. He slowly learns to speak again, yet when he and Julie encounter other Zombies M completely out of nothing can talk at the same level as R can (3). What follows is the typical drama of them getting to know each other better and her leaving him when he tells her he killed her boyfriend. On a side not here. Julie is maybe the worst female character I have seen in a movie for years. Now I'm a guy, but every feminist must have been going through the roof seeing her. R is constantly saying he will protect her, she cannot take care of herself and instead of properly mourning over her dead boyfriend she befriends R, but then again tries to run away from him and what not. Horrible character. Anyhow, R is going to meet her in the human complex (by this time all of the regular zombies have magically stopped eating humans/brains (4)). R easily gets into the human complex and meets with Julie (yeah, build a concrete wall that is 20m high, but conveniently oversee a gap (5) and don't smell the dead guy in the rotting clothes (6)). A group of bonies attacks the human complex looking for R and Julie, what motivates them is however completely unclear, same as what led them there (7). R and Julie escape from them and eventually leap into a pool, with R serving as a kind of cover for Julie. They get back up and R gets shot in the chest. Now, I don't know what you'd do if the water around you is turning red with the blood of a loved one - Julie however starts screaming happily and enthusiastically that R can bleed (8). Then the zombies befriend the humans, come back to live and blah blah blah (9 ad infinitum).<br/><br/>The movie as a whole has no real suspense. There is little to no violence involved either. R is an interesting character that however gets struck by plot holes, Julie is anything but a character, nothing makes her sympathetic. The other characters are also pretty one dimensional.<br/><br/>Well, that's all I can say. Don't waste your money going to the movies to see this. It is pretty much this year's Prometheus - great trailer, shitty movie. I was very disappointed"
"guchrisc","Null","5","7","26 February 2013"," Zombie film is no horror but rather a labour of love.
","Entering the new post-'Twilight' era, a few teen-romance-type films have been showing around St Valentine's Day. 'Beautiful Creatures' is one, 'Warm Bodies' is another. Both films are essentially love stories and both have the same plot. Whilst 'BC' competes with 'Twilight' on a 'I Married A Witch' type of plot, 'WB' has a zombie theme. However it should be clearly stated that this is a teen-romance love-story not a zombie film. The zombie theme is there and provides the backdrop to the story. All the basic plot-lines of zombie films are there, but are cleverly subverted in this rom-com film.<br/><br/>Like 'BC' this film opens with a narration by the male lead. In 'WB', Nicholas Hoult, a tall thin lad, plays the male lead. As the credits roll, he explains that he is a zombie in a zombie-inhabited post-apocalypse world. This world is seen through his eyes throughout the film. This is his film and his world. At the start of the film the zombies appear rather like many stoned teenagers; they slouch about a lot, they wander aimlessly about with hunched shoulders.<br/><br/>By a quirk of fate, male lead encounters female lead played by Teresa Palmer. Fate throws them together as it did Richard Hanney and the girl in 'The Thirty-Nine Steps'. Not handcuffed in the Highlands, but brought together, and hiding together, in this dangerous post-apocalyptic zombie-infested urban world. The result is the same. Male lead however, is a gawky youth, who struggles to impress the more vivacious girl. These scenes are played very naturally, the two leads play their roles well and convince in the reality of their relationship and the reality of their situation.<br/><br/>The situation that is their reality, is the old story of love across the tracks. It becomes clear that this is a modern reworking of an old love story. It is blatantly so and the film revels in it. The standard themes are there, circumstances seem to prevent a relationship, their worlds are so different and the gulf between them too big. Like 'BC' we have the complication of family. We just know that the girl's father is not going to be accepting of this relationship.<br/><br/>The stern father is played well by John Malkovich. Two other supporting parts are also well played. Analeigh Tipton gives a very believable performance as the girl's best friend. Rob Corddry, who this reviewer last saw sitting in a hot tub and a time machine in 'Hot Tub Time Machine', a surprisingly good and thoughtful film, in which RC gave a performance of some depth, in this film, he RC, plays the best friend of the gawky youth. Despite the subject matter of the film, here again, RC, gives a performance of depth that convinces in his role.<br/><br/>Watch out for some scenes that are truly well filmed. The post-apocalypse suburbia is most impressive as are some of the swooping panoramic camera shots. No less impressive are the country scenes, the dream scenes and the gritty city scenes. Rated 12A in the UK, the film, whilst not gore-filled, is surprisingly grim. Dining-out is of course part of the film, and the zombie chase scenes are quite scary. The trailer for this film showed zombie fight scenes, and this reviewer was not impressed with those or looking forward to them. However, in the film itself, the fight scenes were done well and fitted well. Having said all that however, this film is a rom-com, and as such is entertaining and quietly funny.<br/><br/>In boy-meets-girl romance stories it is very difficult to make a film that entertains, holds the tension, keeps you wondering if the romantic interest can grow into love, and how it will end, all the while maintaining, and not breaking, genre rules. This film does all that perfectly, from the very start to the very end.<br/><br/>'WB', like 'BC', is a perfect date-movie for all young lovers, it did, in fact, surpass my expectations and therefore I have no hesitation in awarding it 10/10."

","I missed this film in theaters and now that I have bought (wasted my money)on the DVD, I can only be glad I didn't see it on the big screen. I can think of several other more satisfying ways I could have spent the money instead of buying the DVD; cleaning the toilet, lining the cat's litter box, or simply burning it. At least these action would have provided a function and not have sucked two hours from my life.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, anyone out of 6th grade can yank that from the analysis without a problem, but this is probably the worse retelling of that classic ever to come about.<br/><br/>The plot is shamblingly slow. Forced to stay awake under the hopes that anything interesting may happen, I tried a number of methods to remain alert during this film. After resorting to chewing broken glass (and subsequently finding it to be more pleasing than the movie) I managed to pry my eyes open long enough to be completely let down with everything this movie had to offer.<br/><br/>The story is garbage that has already been ran through the recycling bin way too many times. While it remains usable, it reeks of age and half-hearted attempts to mask the smell with those little pine scented air fresheners. There's nothing new here, just the same old same old but with a splash of zombies to add a grayish green color in the hopes of capturing the success of the zombie resurrection that began in the early 2000's and is still thriving. Unfortunately, movies like this are the shot in the head that will put down the zombie film reanimation.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty bad. John Malkovich phones this one in to collect a paycheck and is as stiff and bored as the undead in the film. Nicholas Hoult does a fairly good job but is brought down by Teresa Palmer and (I hate to say it) Rob Corddry (also in paycheck mode).<br/><br/>The plot devours itself. My biggest complaint is how the movie contradicts itself within 30 seconds of itself. Literally, right after R describes how they can't communicate in any meaningful ways, he has a conversation with Rob Corddry's character. Sure, it's short. ""Hungry."" ""City"". But it is enough to be a conversation. It's like saying, ""Whatever you do, don't press this button"" and then just pressing the heck out of it for no reason. Why bother telling us the rules that govern the walking dead in this movie if they are just going to be broken immediately? Sure, I get it. We're supposed to be amazed that the tender emotions of love have restarted his heart and cured the zombieism, but it could have been done better.<br/><br/>I can't believe this movie has above a 2 star rating. Save yourselves the trouble. If you like Shakespeare, watch Romeo and Juliet. If you like zombie films, there's tons of them out there. Pick anything other than this reheated waste of time."

","R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie on a food run, and for zombies, that means brains. R kills one of the young leaders of the zombie resistance, named Perry, (Dave Franco) but spares Perry's girlfriend Julie, (Teresa Palmer) because he falls in love with her and it's love at first sight. Unfortunately, for R, Julies dad, Grigio, (John Malkovich) is the head honcho of the zombie resistance, to him, the only good zombie is a dead zombie. Despite the fact that R killed her boyfriend and ate his brains to relive his memories, and despite the fact that he is part of the undead, R rescues Julie from his fellow zombies, and in return Julie teaches him to drive a car. But it's not all beer and skittles, R and Julie have more than garden variety zombies to worry about. Hard-core skeleton zombies called Bonies are chasing after R and Julie, as is Julie's father . But a funny thing is happening to R, the longer he is on the run with Julie, the more alive he feels. Can R and Julie dodge her zombie killing dad and the Bonies long enough to save himself and Julie? What is Julie's reaction when he finds out that R killed Perry? Is R really coming back to life? <br/><br/>So this is what passes for romance these days? I was going to make some snide remark about Warm Bodies being Romeo and Juliet for the undead, but it really is based on Romeo and Juliet, maybe for the brain-dead slacker. R, and Julie are the names of the main characters, could the writers make it a little more obvious that this movie is sourced from Shakespeare? Maybe someone should tell the writers that Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, obviously the writers read the Cliff Notes version of Romeo and Juliet. OK, forget for a minute that they butchered a classic, who finds a fully gassed up BMW convertible in the middle of a zombie apocalypse? That's just insulting to anyone's intelligence. I guess I'm too old for these angst-ridden teen dramadies, but I was expecting better. There's a clunky internal dialogue for R, because he's a zombie and basically sounds like Tarzan with a lobotomy when trying to form sentences. Wrap that all in a cheesy moral about the power of love, and you've got a real stinker on your hands. The lead actors look like the stepped out of some teen magazine, faces full of pain and angst, and John Malkovich tries to get some ironic laughs, playing a gun toting dad, but it doesn't work , the laughs are few and far between. The only person who gets any laughs at all is Asleigh Tipton, as Nora, Julie's skeptical friend.

"didonatope","8","15","29","31 January 2013"," Beauty & The Beast...& Zombies
","Having seen it, I am happy to say that ""Warm Bodies"" exceeded my initial expectations, and the result is a sweet, often funny romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Based on the book of the same name (written by Isaac Marion), ""Warm Bodies"" tells the story of a young zombie, later named ""R"" (played very enthusiastically by Nicholas Hoult) stuck in a mental purgatory. R spends his life wandering around a post-apocalyptic world with only his thoughts and other zombies who can barely speak to keep him company. In a witty and well-delivered opening narration, he explains that he can barely remember what life used to be like before the apocalypse. He can't remember what caused it, what his life was like, who his parents were, or even his own name (though he does believe it starts with an R).<br/><br/>It is in this opening scene when we get a true sense of what R's life is like. His often humorous narration of this scenario keeps the tone of the film somewhat upbeat, even though his situation of being alone with only his thoughts is truly tragic. I could instantly relate to his feeling of loneliness, as who doesn't feel lonely sometimes. Loneliness truly does feel like you're dead and alone with your own thoughts, so perhaps the whole zombie element of the plot was one big metaphor for unwanted solitude.<br/><br/>When the zombies develop enough symptoms, they become gruesome skeleton- like creatures called ""bonies."" These creatures, unlike zombies, will kill anything with a heartbeat without feeling any sort of remorse about it. The bonies most likely represent people who have given up on love and live the rest of their lives in despair.<br/><br/>Everything changes when R and a few other zombies search for human flesh to eat. They come across a hideout with survivors and attack. With little memory of the old world, R instantly falls in love with a survivor named Julie (Played by Theresa Palmer). Immediately afterwards, R inadvertently eats the brain of her boyfriend, Perry (played by Dave Franco). The only way that R can relive memories of the old world is by eating peoples' brains and thereby consuming their memories. By eating Perry's brain, he learns Julie's name and uses that to start developing a trust with her.<br/><br/>This is the only aspect I felt was a bit weak. The fact that the zombies in this film can consume memories is a rather interesting story element, though it doesn't really come into play through most of the film. It mainly exists to develop R's sense of guilt for killing Julie's boyfriend, which is important to the story, but I personally felt it could have been used to a greater effect. Perhaps R could find out who he used to be by consuming the brains of people who knew him. Oh well, it's not really that big of a problem here, and it's not something that bothered me while watching it.<br/><br/>After helping her escape the attack, R and Julie bond together. R tries his hardest to act human and gradually forms a friendship with Julie.The scenes of R and Julie are honestly sweet without being to saccharine. R comes across as a likable hero victimized by his zombie-condition and Julie, while occasionally bratty, learns to accept him.<br/><br/>Throughout the rest of the film, R's relationship with Julie will grow stronger, and this is revealed to help cure his zombie condition. It's a rather sweet statement on how love is the best cure for loneliness. But as the climax approaches, the plot thickens. R's exposure to love makes him a target for the bonies. Will R cure his condition? Will Julie discover that R killed her boyfriend? Will the bonies consume our heroes? For a romantic comedy, this is quite a lot of conflict.<br/><br/>I suggest to anybody who hates romantic comedies to give this movie a shot; as it is proof that the genre can be done well. And if you like romantic-comedies, this one is hands-down a must-see. ""Warm Bodies"" is a classic tale of beauty and the beast...& zombies. It's a unique film excellently adapted by acclaimed screenwriter Johnathan Levine and led by a stellar performance by Nicholas Hoult. It's absolutely my pick for the best non-Oscar movie in theaters right now."

Now zombies are falling in love.<br/><br/>It's something new. I wouldn't say it's funny. It's not. It is curious, and somewhat sweet. Nicholas Hoult is a good emo zombie. The difficulty lies with the grunting halting speech. It makes the dialog hard to listen to. This makes the interior narration absolutely vital. It was probably important to try even more internal dialog.<br/><br/>As for Teresa Palmer, I'm not sure she's star material. She's a really pretty girl. I really like her, but I still see her as the girlfriend character. The other girl in the movie is Analeigh Tipton. She might be marginally better as the lead. She seems to have a little more comedic skills.<br/><br/>I am very happy that people aren't just doing the same old zombie movie over and over again. This story had obvious obstacles. I think it overcame most of them relatively well."

","Where to begin with this mess...I really thought this movie would be funny from the trailer. But this movie is an extended version of the trailer and nothing more. I'm not sure whats worse about this movie, the dreadful lack of acting, or the terrible plethora of inaccuracies that I won't even begin to mention because they have been addressed by numerous other disgusted reviewers. <br/><br/>I laughed a few times in the first 20 minutes but after that, the movie hit a brick wall of utter stupidity. I think what really ruined it for me was R trying to talk. It reminded me of an elderly man trying to create a bowel movement. After 30 minutes or so, I actually looked this movie up on IMDb to read the worst reviews and was just shocked to see how many there were, and that I agreed with most of them.<br/><br/>About an hour or so into the movie, there is a scene where R is now living with the humans in some colony and the main girl and her friends are putting make-up all over him so he doesn't look so dead. When R turns around in the swivel chair after being done-up, he looks almost exactly like Edward from Twilight and then it dawned on me that the entire movie was just a satire redo of Twilight, but with zombies, which made me hate the movie more.<br/><br/>This movie tries to be both serious and a satire film at the same time and fails at both. I think it might be the worst movie I've ever seen. If I had spent money on this film, I would've embarrassed myself publicly trying to get my money back."
"cornflakeboy20","5","21","44","25 January 2013"," Charming, but totally illogical
","Warm Bodies does for zombies what Twilight did for vampires. If that excites you, see it. If that prospect offends you, run away.<br/><br/>This is a charming love story that has to be taken on its own terms, although it sometimes violates its own logic, which I will get to later. It concerns a hipster zombie with an internal life, but external limitations. He builds himself a home in a plane in an abandoned airport, which for some reason still has a functioning power grid. He's guilt ridden and conflicted, but still drawn to human flesh. He wanders off with other zombies seeking food and comes to a human settlement protected by a group of armed young people. After eating one of the soldiers, he develops a crush on what turns out to be that soldier's girlfriend. He takes her back to his airplane home, where he does a Beauty and the Beat winning her over montage and their eventual love begins reconnecting zombies with their human emotion. There are additional eviler zombies who have lost all connection to their former selves who become the true enemies of all concerned. The question is whether this young zombie/human love affair can restore peace, and return the zombies to their former selves.<br/><br/>Any Comicon attending horror fan is going to bristle at the portrayal of zombies in this movie. They move either fast or slow depending on what the scene requires, and it seems the more they deteriorate the faster they become. The cause of Zombie Apocalypse is unexplained and the timeline is way out of whack. At first we assume it happened around 1990, since our hero has a record player and plays recordings prior to that time. In a suburban home, a Polaroid camera is sitting around ready to use. However, there are references to iPods and a featured song that was a hit last year. How did they have time to build a huge wall and settlement in a few months' time? And is this problem limited to one area? Also, we have lapses in romantic logic. The heroine seems completely unfazed that her zombie boyfriend killed and dismembered her handsome boyfriend whom she appeared to get along with. She never even raises her voice in protest. In the beginning, she is a tough soldier but all fight goes out of her when she becomes the romantic interest. How does this rotting zombie smell? Wouldn't that turn her off? Also, if she is a hipster with Sonic Youth posters on her wall who knows her way around vinyl, why does she look like a sorority girl with a wardrobe from Banana Republic? ButÂ… there are also scenes, like a makeover montage, where the movie winks at you and lets you know you're not supposed to take it too seriously. So I'm giving it a halfway grade. It is charming and sweet and fun at times but really doesn't add much to the romance or horror genres."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","9","16","4 February 2013"," Cute Take on the Genre
","Warm Bodies (2013)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Cute and different take on the living dead genre has zombie R (Nicholas Hoult) going against the rules and not eating Julie (Teresa Palmer) but instead he falls in love with her, which sets a whole new thing into motion. WARM BODIES isn't a flawless films but for the most part it's very charming and has enough clever moments to make it worth watching. I will start off with the flaws and I'd say that it takes the film quite a bit before it starts to (no pun intended) warm up. The first ten-minutes of the film are pretty boring but this might be because we're basically watching the so-old zombie stuff, the same old apocalypse stuff and it's not until the two leads meet does the film finally start to pick up. I think once the love story kicks in is when the film finally gets going and a lot of the credit has to go to Hoult and Palmer for their strong work. I thought Hoult was extremely believable in his part as the zombie and this includes when he's just a dead creature searching for humans but he's also very believable the more human he becomes. Palmer easily steals the film with her warm and rather bubbly character. The actress certainly nailed the part and I look forward to seeing her in other films. John Malkovich plays her father, a man also leading the battle against the zombies. I wouldn't say he's great but it's still fun seeing someone like him in a movie like this. The screenplay also offers up a few funny gags including the girl holding up a Blu-ray case Lucio Fulci's notorious ZOMBIE to compare what that zombie looked like compared to R. Another great thing going for the film is that we're given quite a terrific soundtrack with the works of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Guns 'n Roses, Roy Orbinson, John Waite and others. Fans of vinyl will also enjoy how the format is worked into the story. Again, WARM BODIES features all sorts of flaws but for the most part it's entertaining enough to make it worth viewing."

","This zombie made all zombies a joke. Of course Hollywood approved this trash but nevertheless here it is on IMDb with a rating of 7.3. Simply amazing that this movie has garnished such reviews and ratings. What were people thinking when they seen this? Cute? Heart-warming? Loving? I mean this movie wasn't realistic in any sense even for a Zombie movie. Zombies uniting together and having hearts of a human??? Original in a bad way people but because the people of today are very much simple minded and perhaps there are many women rating this or something is beyond my understanding. Movies that really deserve a 7 or higher get rated 4's and 5's but this one has changed my mind on folk who do rate low. <br/><br/>Production value is not bad, acting not bad, Ponies not bad, lol and idea wasn't bad but this movie had a strong way of annoyance with the humans and zombies working together due to a couple comprising of a boy zombie and a girl. Talking Zombies is not bad but those that feel... can love... can become human again is not something that should have ever been done. Kissing the dead... BIG NO! What perverted person could ever get away with away with that? Let it been a woman zombie kissing a man and this be on the cover of Newsweekly for a sham. <br/><br/>This is a movie for a group of illiterate high school minded folk who get kicks of this mess. Pure calamity of the horror genre. Waste of my time after watching another waste of my time watching Jack the Giant Slayer. Hollywood could only be the one to get away of Zombies becoming Human. Disaster from the beginning to the end."

I loved that this movie had it all; action, romance, thriller, comedy, etc. It wasn't a ""chick flick"" and it wasn't a movie girls would roll their eyes over because of the action. I loved it because I was so engrossed in the film. During the action/thriller scenes I was at the end of my seat, hoping everything would turn out okay. During the comedy scenes I was falling back laughing at what had just happened. During the romance scenes, I was tearing up and even thinking of how much I love my boyfriend. I believe any movie that can encompass that many emotions into a couple hours, is a movie worth watching."
"rannynm","8","15","32","6 February 2013"," A Hilarious ""Zomedy!""
","When we imagine a post-apocalyptic world, it usually includes a lot of broken down buildings, stray dogs and a bunch of raggedy and tough survivors, but rarely zombies! Warm Bodies, rated PG-13, is a hilarious look at what could be, a world in which humans are uncommon and zombies roam the land looking for fresh bodies to eat.<br/><br/>This may not sound appealing, but according to 15-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney, it's actually quite hilarious. And if your grandkids aren't squeamish about the idea of zombies, then you might consider this film for some mid-winter entertainment. As a quirky romance / comedy / horror film, it stands to remind us of the true meaning of humanity and the importance of staying connected with others.<br/><br/>Go here to see Raven's full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=iDEmy4NlziM<br/><br/>Warm Bodies Reviewed by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 15<br/><br/>The newest addition to the Zombie, Romance, Comedy and Horror genre. I call it, a Zombromance, or a Zomedy! It's set in a post apocalyptic world consisting of zombies, bonies and a small population of humans. When a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) meets a Human girl named Julie, he starts to feel like there is more to life than just being the walking dead. He begins to cure himself, retrain himself to talk and become more human. He inspires more zombies to try to cure themselves, and slowly they begin to become more human. Will R and Julie defy the odds and stay together, or will the fact that one of them is a zombie keep them apart?<br/><br/>I absolutely adore this movie. I will definitely see it over and over again. When I think of zombie movies I think of nasty rotting creatures and lots of blood and gore. Naturally the zombies eat people in this movie, but it is filmed in such a way that brought a sense of humor to the whole thing and the blood was very minimal. Even the zombies don't look that bad. In fact, Nicholas Hoult makes one attractive zombie! I like the lighting and sets in this film a lot. You can definitely tell that it is a post apocalyptic world, but the zombies still try to maintain somewhat consistent routines. I thought it was cool too see zombie security guards and janitors. Although they weren't doing much, you still got the sense that there was some humanity left in them.<br/><br/>My favorite character is R because he is such a sweetheart. He goes against his urge to eat people to save Julie and he proves that he is more than just a mindless flesh eater. Even though he is relearning how to speak, he is still quite slow so he can only mutter out simple words and phrases. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job keeping this character dull and Zombie-like, while still giving glimpses of his emotions and personality. This movie shows that R still has completely normal thoughts, he just can't express them, as if he is trapped in his own mind. R voiced over most of the movie and it was hilarious to hear what he was thinking, compared to what he was actually able to do. He made me laugh even in more intense situations, making him my absolute favorite character.<br/><br/>I can't say I have a favorite scene because this whole movie is incredibly well done. I do love all the times that R and his Zombie friend M or ""Marcus"" interact. They try to communicate and connect and it's so funny and touching to see their friendship show even though it's challenging for them to express it. I also really enjoy the seen when Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) give R a makeover. R is so reluctant to have makeup put on him, which I thought was funny because most teenage boys are. The music in this scene was particularly funny and entertaining and it is a memorable scene.<br/><br/>I think there are so many underlying messages in this film, but the one that stands out to me most is that we need to take the time to connect with our surroundings and the people in our lives. In this film it shows a flashback to the world before the zombie outbreak, and R is saying that back then everyone could connect, but in the flashback everyone is on their phones texting or playing video games. It is a really strong reminder that we are so wired and constantly tuned into technology that we often forget to be with our family and connect with our loved ones<br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because teens and even adults will love this movie, but kids under the age of 13 may find it to be too mature. I give Warm Bodies 10 out of 10 stars so go check it out at a theater near you!"
"Danusha_Goska","4","14","30","3 February 2013"," Only Lukewarm
","""Warm Bodies"" is only lukewarm. A zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco) and thereby falls in love with Perry's girlfriend, Julie (Teresa Palmer). The movie is meant to be a bit scary, a bit funny, and a bit romantic, but I wasn't much scared, I didn't laugh, and the romance was stale and flatfooted. <br/><br/>Julie and R jump into a sports car to escape from menacing zombies and skeletons. The top is down; it begins to rain. They drive into an abandoned, post-Apocalyptic suburban neighborhood. Julie is cold; she has to take off her clothes. She does so in front of R. Teresa Palmer is a very beautiful young woman. R is a frustrated teen zombie madly in love with Julie. The director does absolutely nothing with this scene. There's no special lighting; the camera doesn't show us Julie's beauty as desperate, lovestruck R would see it. <br/><br/>There are multiple chase scenes, none of which make much sense. Julie sees her well-armed father in a convoy and does nothing to join him, but later escapes on her own to join him, a much riskier trip. Why didn't she go earlier? No explanation. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a funny zombie movie, check out ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and ""Zombieland."" If you're looking for a fully realized romance between a living woman and a dead man, watch ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and ""Truly Madly Deeply."" If you like romances between women and monsters, see Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""King Kong."" <br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" isn't a bad movie. It has its moments. R whines to his fellow zombie, Rob Corddry, about Julie, and Corddry's one word responses is the funniest line in the movie. The movie's conclusion is heartwarming if a bit half-baked."
"chappywatched","5","3","4","7 May 2016"," Chappy Watched: Warm Bodies
","So I'll start off by saying that this film does have Twilight themes to it but is 1000 times better and manages to tell a better film in one movie as opposed to four.<br/><br/>The film starts straight away; there is no dwelling on how it all happened or even how far into the world it reaches.<br/><br/>If you are expecting a Walking Dead, Dawn Of The Dead or Resident Evil level of zombie, flesh, blood and violence then you are going to be disappointed. This is a different take on zombies; they still eat flesh but it's a lot more toned down than any of the previously mentioned titles.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by 'R', as he spends his days hanging around an abandoned airport, on the outside he is sluggish and struggles to even get one word out but he seems intellectually capable and aware in his mind. I did find it weird that these zombies are more functional than most, having the ability to open door and play records.<br/><br/>It's also different to see that when the zombies eat a person's brain, they get their memories, feeling and emotions and there are also two types of zombies; the more human ones that can evolve or the 'bonies' that gave up on life and just become an empty shell.<br/><br/>It has a really good cast with most of the focus on Nicholas Hoult, Teresa Palmer and Rob Corddry but with Dave Franco, John Malkovich and Analeigh Tipton rounding out a good group of actors.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also worth a mention with songs by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springstein, Roy Orbison, Guns N' Roses and Bon Iver.<br/><br/>An enjoyable movie that should at least be watched once but I wouldn't be against watching it again."

","I rented this film because of the trailer. I'm not a zombie fan, in fact this is the first zombie film I've seen, but the trailer was funny and I thought, why not? I totally enjoyed this film. It's a sweet, well acted, little gem. Analeigh Tipton is brilliant! I will be looking for more of her work in the future. I'm not sure that this film will please die hard zombie fans. Not much gore really and it is more of a love story but it is amusing, down right funny in places, and the characters are all likable.""R"" is not only charming and handsome, the inside of his plane is fabulous, a set that's little bit of paradise for ""quirky stuff"" mongers, like me. So overall I certainly recommend this film with the caveat that it is subtle. If you want buckets of blood, a lot of violence, amazing CG gore and wild, over the top laughs this probably is not for you, which is fine because I highly recommend it to just about everyone else."
"Buddy-51","8","3","4","21 July 2013"," Now we know what all those zombies are REALLY thinking
","In the long annals of walking dead fiction, ""Warm Bodies"" is likely the first work to ever actually get inside the head of a zombie. And it turns out his thinking process is not all that different from yours or mine - if you can just get past that whole ""I want to eat your brains"" thing, that is.<br/><br/>Skillfully written and directed by Jonathan Levine, ""Warm Bodies"" may not be the first attempt at a zombie-movie parody - ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Zombieland"" and ""Fido"" got there before it - but I'll bet it's the first to apply a ""Romeo and Juliet"" template to the genre (his name is ""R"" and hers is Julie, and there's even a charming balcony scene between the two to clinch the parallel). <br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult plays a young walker who's been reduced to shambling aimlessly through the zombie-infested airport, playing vinyl records on the grounded jet he's converted into a comfy little ""home"" for himself, and mulling long and hard over what it means to be living out one's existence as one of the undead. He's not exactly proud of what he's become, but he's pretty much learned to accept it - that is until he devours the brain of Julie's boyfriend, thereby appropriating his memories and falling immediately in love with her. Our unlikely chivalric hero thereupon takes it upon himself to become the young woman's sole companion and protector as she tries to make her way through this dangerous and hostile world. And as Julie (Teresa Palmer) and R grow together in closeness and mutual understanding, R slowly but surely regains many of those precious qualities that once made him human.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, Levine's screenplay, with its romantic tone and wry voice-over narration, is a subtle, gentle movie parody rather than a smart-alecky one on the order, say, of the ""Scary"" movie franchise or ""Date Movie"" and such. And it works beautifully from beginning to end, thanks in no small measure to the extraordinary chemistry between Hoult and Palmer in the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead). <br/><br/>Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film. And the movie caps it all off with a coda that is about as sweet and uplifting as anything you're likely to see at the movies all year, guaranteed to make you feel proud to be a member of a species that, for all its faults, can still be pretty darn terrific when it puts its collective mind to it.<br/><br/>It's nice to be reminded of that every now and again."
"c_hookham","8","3","4","10 June 2013"," Zombies CAN be Funny and Romantic
","A Zombie finds love in the shape of a victim's girlfriend and feels something 'stirring'. Underneath the smart Alec jokes, grim setting and Zombie 'frolics' what you have here is basically a morality play that proves the old adage that 'love conquers all'. The film starts off in familiar Zombie Apocalypse territory with hordes of the reanimated shuffling around an airport then we meet Hoult's 'R' a Zombie clearly struggling with his new found place in things. The most refreshing part of the film is not the Zombies and the Land of the Dead-esque situation but the blossoming love story between the leads which is handled brilliantly and sets up the ending very well. All in all a good 'Rom-com' that plays on its strengths but will probably annoy the hell out of hard bitten (heh) Zombie fans."

He sheds a humorous light on his predicament and you're immediately rooting for him. The actual plot of the movie, while not totally unique, is oddly refreshing. You get the sense that both R and Julie are sincere & not that much different from any other teens their ages. They're just in another place and time.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies has elements of sci-fi, action/adventure, romance, drama, and comedy.

","When I first saw the trailer for Warm Bodies I didn't know what to take out of it. Are they trying to be this year's Zombieland? Is it going to have any horror in it at all, or will it be more of a romantic comedy? Will it have an indie feel, or would it have too much CGI? Then I saw that Jonathan Levine (The Wackness, 50/50) was directing it, and I suddenly was on board for this movie.<br/><br/>Heading into this movie, I was hoping that this could be another gem hidden in the trash-movie-month that is January. I got The Grey last January, so could I get another one this year? Eh, no.<br/><br/>This film certainly has its moments where it's pretty entertaining, but unfortunately there are too many other missed opportunities that overshadow the bright spots. Probably the best part about this movie was that it gave an honest try at an original idea, which is obviously more than we can say about the majority of movies.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer were the two main actors in the film. There were moments where they probably could have used an extra take or two. Overall, they did their jobs well enough. John Malkovich plays the recognizable face that doesn't really need to be in the movie, but it's more marketable if he is character of Teresa Palmer's strict father.<br/><br/>The main issue that I had with the film was that there were so many conveniences. There were too many scenes in the film that were just glanced over quickly, but most of the audience would assume would be a large emotional plot point. There were far too many moments that felt like they were rushed to be able to finish the story faster, which is odd considering the film is just over 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theater feeling underwhelmed. I can't say that I dislike the film by any means, but I can't say I'll ever watch it again. It was a fine way to spend an hour and a half. I had some laughs, and I liked certain aspects of the movie. It will definitely entertain some, and it will definitely bother some. Unfortunately, the fact is that there were too many overly convenient parts of the movie for me.<br/><br/>5/10"

This picture has got to be one of the warmest, one of the fuzziest, and, yes, one of the most sickeningly-sweet, retch-inducing zombie movies imaginable.<br/><br/>Not only that - I'd definitely say Warm Bodies also ranks right up there as being one of the absolutely phoniest ""quick-cure"" zombie movies ever made, as well.<br/><br/>And, like, if that wasn't enough to earn this viewer's total contempt - Warm bodies was also a zombie movie that refused to make up its bloody mind whether it wanted its zombies to be the slow, drag-your-feet type, or the fast, impossible-to-outrun ones. (Ho-hum!) <br/><br/>And, on top of all of that crap - Warm Bodies' story was so frickin' demented-to-the-extreme that it actually had the unforgivable audacity of sadistically twisting all of its warm-fuzziness into (get this!) a Romeo & Juliet romance, complete with a truly nauseating ""balcony scene"", to boot. (Oh, Romeo! Oh, Romeo! Where for art thou?) <br/><br/>Yes. Indeed. Warm Bodies (which was filmed in Montreal, Quebec) was filled to overflowing with inane plot-holes and truly brain-dead inconsistencies, including a zombie who, at first, was incapable of speech, but, all the while, was delivering to the viewer a fluent, blow-by-blow, voice-over narration as his way of filling in the gaps.

Nothing in the film stuck with me. I was disappointed 'cause the trailer looked good, but the script was so far off from what I imagined it to be. Hmm, I also disliked 50/50 because the girlfriend seemed unrealistic, and the humour wasn't my style, and I found Kyle to be another stock character.

However, I'm happy to put this issue to rest: ""Warm Bodies"" is nothing like ""Twilight."" They're not even in the same family tree. In fact, ""Warm Bodies"" is a clever take on the Romeo and Juliet story, spinning the zombie genre on its head. The way the film subverts and even breaks the rules of your typical zombie movie gave the film some freedom to play with the material that no other zombie movies have done before.<br/><br/>Now this may anger die-hard zombie fans, like how ""Twilight"" angered vampire fans. After all, zombies can't talk. That's just pure blasphemy! In this world, they do. Pure and simple. If it takes a film to break the rules in order to breathe in new life to a certain genre (i.e. ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" ""Scream"") and to tell more refreshing stories, I want more filmmakers to start breaking the rules. ""Warm Bodies"" is unlike any zombie flick OR romantic-comedy you've ever seen before. It's original. It's unique. It's invigorating. It's just plain exciting to watch unfold on screen.<br/><br/>The film has its funny moments and its horror moments, but what really sells the film is its genuine heart. Its plea for hope, compassion, and empathy is something rarely seen in films, and it works without feeling like it's hitting us over in the head with it. There are moments where you get to know the characters - and I mean really get to know them - that are so poignant and unexpected that it hits you right in the heart. And I cried. Oh, yes, I did. Several times, in fact. It also helps that the film's leads, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, are terrific and have great chemistry as well. Rob Corddry is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, and he has some great moments in the film. Additionally, Dave Franco is pretty damn good, especially if you consider the unconventional way the filmmakers develop his character.<br/><br/>To say the least, ""Warm Bodies"" blew me away. It's an extremely well made film with an even greater story to support it. However, coming from ""50/50"" director Jonathan Levine, it also shouldn't be that surprising. ""Warm Bodies"" is already a contender to be one of the best films of 2013."

","I'm a guy that loves his zombie flicks. A few of my favs are Romero's zombie franchise, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Planet Terror, and Zombieland. It could be argued that this movie is the 'Zombie Twilight' In a way, it is, but it's actually done very well. The acting is good, and the characters are likable. It has a few cheesy and funny moments such as R telling Julie to act like a zombie so the others won't eat her. Our male protagonist is a zombie named R. He can't remember his name or what happened before the apocalypse. He lives at an airport with his other zombie friends. On the prowl for human flesh, R runs into a beautiful girl named Julie. He begins to fall in love with her, and it slowly makes him human again. Their relationship is very sweet and adorable. Their new friendship is soon threatened by the skeletal zombies called bonies. The humans and the zombies must team up together to rid the world of the real monsters. If you love zombies and love stories, I'd definitely recommend WARM BODIES!!!"

","I just got back home from watching the zombie/hot girl love story Warm Bodies, and...it was amazing! I won't lie, my first initial though of this movie was,""Oh great, the new Twilight."" But, after actually viewing this movie with my little bro and his buddy, I realized that I was wrong(BIG TIME). In my opinion, I thought that this movie was very enjoyable and kept me interested with what was going on. I especially liked the characters, especially the main character R the zombie(Nicholas Hoult). The romance between him and Julie(Teresa Palmer) wasn't very strong at first, but in the end they were the perfect match, and I thought it was very cute. The other character were interesting too; including, Julie's friend Nora(Analeigh Tipton), R's zombie friend M(Rob Corddry),Julie's father General Griogio(John Malkovich),and Julie's ex Perry(Dave Franco)who actually was my least favorite and I didn't care that R ate his brain. Oh and did I mention that there are bad ass zombies in this movie called Bonies, because important to mention too. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, so i'll leave with this; I highly recommend seeing this flick, because it has a great story, pretty good acting, super awesome climax, some memorable comedy moments, sweet chemistry between the main characters, and some heart felt moments as well. Oh and of course it's a 1000 times better than Twilight. Plus it's from the director of 50/50, so of course you'd be in for a good time! 10/10 See this movie!!!"

"neil-476","8","5","10","12 February 2013"," Delightful
","In a post apocalyptic world, we learn (in a strangely articulate voice-over from the zombie who we come to know as R) that zombies prefer to eat brains because this gives them the memories of the meal, making them feel more alive: it also prevents the corpse reanimating). Also, it seems, that when zombies are particularly far gone, they devolve into skeletal scavengers called Bonies. Having eaten the brains of non-zombie Perry, R feels a strange bond with his girlfriend Julie and kidnaps her. The feelings he experiences gradually begin to bring him back to life, and rub off on the rest of the zombie community. But will that prevent Julie's father, leader of the human enclave, from blowing R's brains out on sight? <br/><br/>Warm Bodies lays claim to being the first zombie comedy rom-com and, delightfully, it manages to succeed in all three genres, as well as being a fairly specific transplant of Romeo and Juliet (R and Julie) into the zombie world, complete with balcony scene. It is extremely well staged, the makeup is good, and the cast all perform very well (Nicholas Hoult is terrific as R). The Bonies don't always convince, and R's lucid voice-over would have been better recounting what had happened (where it would have been credible) rather than what is happening (where it isn't).<br/><br/>But overall, this is very successful and very good fun."

I am not a fan of the zombie genre but for the movies message to work, the hero really needs to be a member of the undead. The characters are intriguing and the story is heartwarming, literally! The take away message, or the parable if you will, is that in order to overcome being undead, you have to be human. It is all about relationships and communication, preferably face to face rather than being glued to your smart phone and tweeting your every thought or mundane activity to an electronic cosmos that literally is not a warm body.

","A movie with the potential of creating a new genre, with the maincharacter being an actual zombie... Which could have given some very needed depth to the hackneyed groaning creatures we all know and love. However, sadly the movie ends up just being another romantic flick with supernatural elements for teenagers. I also feel like the zombies are very loosely defined, can they smell human flesh? Can they communicate with each other ? How and when do they become ""bonies""? Even though the movie sometimes tries to be self-critical and even make fun of the genre as a whole, I think, just because you know your movie is bad, it does not become better.

"paul2001sw-1","7","3","5","7 November 2015"," A pleasant little zombie film
","On the face of it, 'Warm Bodies' is a very interesting film: one part zombie-action movie, one part comedy-romance, and one part whimsical science fiction. In practice, it isn't quite as interesting as it sounds, because each of three elements is actually quite generic, even though they're cleverly interspersed. Overall, the film has a nice mood, although veering heavily towards the sentimental, supported by the kind of folkie soundtrack that seems to be de-rigour in a certain sort of movie (in spite of the genre-bending, think 'Garden State' and you won't be too far out). And if it seems strange to summarise a zombie flick as pleasant viewing, in this case it's correct call."
"TheSquiss","2","3","5","25 July 2013"," Dull, dull, dull, dreary, twee, dull. Take only the kids you don't like!
","Warm Bodies opens with a long, rambling, interminable voice-over from sort-of-zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult). I say 'sort of' because here the rules of being a zombie have changed and R's kind of zombie is known as a 'corpse', as opposed to a 'skeleton' (the very bad zombies). And maybe 'interminable' isn't quite correct; it certainly feels endless but is interspersed with snatches of dialogue from the group of teenagers sent out from their walled city to collect medical supplies for their community.<br/><br/>However, 30 minutes in, a full third of the movie, I was ready to start eating my toes just for a little excitement. It did pick up the barest hint of a heartbeat in the final third but, rather than opting for action, it wandered of in the direction of twee twaddle.<br/><br/>R thinks. He explains in painful, trudging detail how he sees something more than regular zombies. He tells us about his best friend, M (Rob Corddry), another zombie he meets occasionally in the airport where they live, to stare and grunt at each other. Occasionally, apparently, they manage to utter a complete word. Then, while eating her boyfriend's brain, R sees Julie (Teresa Palmer), falls in love, takes her home, and begins evolving at an astonishing rate. Love, it transpires, can bring you back from the dead.<br/><br/>But all good love stories need a dark side and here we have two: First up are the skeletons, those zombies who have given up all hope, ripped off their skin and are in it just for the bloodshed; then there's Grigio (John Malkovich), big daddy of the walled city and father of, dumb dumb dummmmm, Julie. In traditional, two-dimensional style, Grigio has forgotten how to show love, is unpleasant, won't listen to reason and just wants to kill zombies.<br/><br/>And so it goes on. For 98 minutes that feel like a lifetime in purgatory.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is dull. It establishes its pace (deathly crawl) and maintains it for all but the final fifteen minutes. Writer/director Jonathon Levine (All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) forgets to explain or make the evolution reasonable. In the space of a few minutes the corpses go from grunting the odd intelligible word to communicating in staccato sentences, gesticulating and running smoothly.<br/><br/>The makeup is awful, the CGI for the skeletons looks like something Ray Harryhausen produced 60 years ago with his hands, the acting is ropey to say the least and the script hasn't so much been written as slapped together with papier-mâché.<br/><br/>Maybe Warm Bodies suffers by emerging in the wake of the excellent, bloodthirsty The Walking Dead. Maybe it's just because it's dull, tedious, twee and annoying. Did I say it's also dull? <br/><br/>Come back Twilight, all is forgiven. Better still, roll on The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

","It was not formula. Kind of a strange way to start a review, I know. I was expecting a blood-and-guts horror comedy with a sadistic and twisted ending, probably with our star-crossed lovers both zombies at the end reminiscing over a shared brain. But that would have been formula.<br/><br/>As a die-hard zombie fan who has enjoyed everything from Fulci to Romero, every blood-soaked, entrail littered set and corny line, this was not what I had expected. It was much better than I had assumed, it was something thoughtful, not strictly a romance or a horror flick. It has a heart and a soul, which is what this world around us has lost.

But in this one, the zombies, they hate their life, they want to change back. At first, I wasn't to sure about always hearing R (Nicolas Hoult) speaking to himself, but as the movie continued, I thought is was very interesting idea and that was the comedic aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>I am a big action-horror-comedy movies fan, so I adored this movie.

"Robert_duder","9","3","5","31 May 2013"," Freakin' brilliant...why did I miss this one in theatres?
","I watch a lot of movies and I will literally go see just about anything in the theatres. For whatever reason I missed this one and didn't feel too disappointed about it. If there is one genre right now that is being flogged for all its worth, its the zombie genre. However, they still manage to come up with some original or at least very entertaining premises around the zombie genre (Walking Dead, Flight of the Living Dead...no I'm not kidding...) and now this. I heard good word of mouth on it but I still wasn't sure it would be any good in my opinion. Well open mouth and insert foot. Warm Bodies is wickedly fun, darkly humorous, brilliant executed, well acted and original. Its a Romeo and Juliette post-apocalyptic romance that makes Twilight look even worse than it is because this was actually fun and easy to watch and brilliant. Is it an Academy Award winner? Of course not and it doesn't try to be. This heavy handed 9 I am giving this is based on pure entertainment. I pop it in ready to watch but perhaps write or surf the web at the same time and then the laptop goes away and suddenly I am enthralled in the story and laughing and just having a good time. I don't often mention soundtracks but the soundtrack for Warm Bodies was awesome!! Classic 80's and 90's Rock that just fit the mood for the film so well.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult is ""R"", a zombie who feels a little different than the rest of his kind. Throughout the film he falls in love and finds himself changing back into a human being. Hoult is perfect in the role. He has this awkward intensity and the perfect comedic timing for his character. He is charismatic and fun. Teresa Palmer will certainly be one to watch because I think this film will make her a bit of an ""it"" girl. She is beautiful, and feisty and the perfect ying to Hoult's yang. She is a strong female lead and they don't use her sexuality to make a point. They have fantastic chemistry together. I was more than surprised to see John Malkovich amongst the cast. He was terrific and intense as Palmer's father who is emotionally damaged from the zombie apocalypse. He gives an outstanding performance. The supporting cast are really terrific. Analeigh Tipton is sarcastic and funny as the best friend. I wish she had more screen time but she was really great. Rob Corddry was also great in a small role as Hoult's best friend who is also a zombie.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is listed on IMDb as Comedy/Horror/Romance and that is exactly what it is. It embodies all three of those things. It has moments of being dark and creepy and the post apocalyptic setting is done extremely well but then there are some truly great laughs in the film and an epic romance that respectfully channels Romeo and Juliette in an extremely off beat sort of way. The ""Boneys"" in the film are done so well without a hint of being campy. They are genuinely and downright creepy!! I often say how a director and screenwriter being the same person is usually a recipe for disaster but there are always exceptions and Jonathan Levine is a huge exception because he is crafted something brilliant here. This is really his first big full length screenplay and it is just about near perfection. From the scene with Julie teaching R to drive, to the balcony scene to the epic and brilliantly shot battle scenes at the end...this is the type of movie that was everything Twilight wasn't...but should be just as popular. I still probably wouldn't suggest it to young teenagers and younger but ultimately there wasn't anything overtly adult about the movie. Bad language was minimal if any at all, violence was certainly there but not blood splattering, and there is no sex...simply romance. Seriously...do yourself a favour because this is one of the best date movies I have ever seen. Zombies and romance makes this the ultimate guy/girl movie!! A near perfect score. 9.5/10"

","Old conception, new point of view. Anyone who wishes to discover in detail the future universe in which zombies are crowding the planet, anyone who claims elaborate answers for the hows, whens and whys should go elsewhere. This movie is sweet, funny and entertaining. It possesses all the elements a good romantic comedy should and still it's not too cheesy. The performances are decent, not very memorable but believable. Nicholas Hoult's performance is beyond average. The soundtrack is excellent, it fits the movie's style and mood perfectly. All in all this one works much better than the similar-themed Twilight saga but it's not a big miracle considering that the latter doesn't work at all...<br/><br/>I recommend it to those who wish to be entertained by a well-thought out, funny romantic comedy with a lot of action and originality considering it's genre. I don't recommend it to people who long for long, meaningful conversations and a memorable experience because this movie is not going to give you one."
"jonas-ua","9","3","5","21 May 2013"," A great zombie movie that isn't about killing zombies
","I would have to say that I enjoyed this film immensely. It is somewhat different from most films in the genre in that it has a focus on curing rather than killing the zombies. It is also a zombie rom-com where the use of M as a third person narrator as well as as the main character works surprisingly well. Nicolas Hoult has a shining career in front of him if he plays his cards right. Rob Cordry joins him in giving the movie a comedic edge as well as Courdry also giving a somewhat decent dramatic performance. I would have top say that normally I don't like him in many of the movies he is in, but in this one he really works. Annaleigh Tipton also delivers some comedic value even though she is very little on screen, something I think was good for the movie as she plays that annoying friend character that I would like to say often ruins many otherwise decent movies. Teresa Palmer delivers a believable role as the romantic lead in the movie and certainly works alongside Hoult. I would love to see more of these two together, but what I want most is that he and Courdry team up as they really work together, she is more rom com while they are more zom-com. I would love to see any of them team up with apatow or some of the frat pack and make some more movies. I see a bright future for most of these people. Malcovich delivers a weak performance though, this may be caused by the lack of screen time he gets, or that he just didn't work as a gun toting leader. Watch this movie if you want to see a less dystopic zom-com than Shaun of the dead, with more romance and less of the comedic value than of that movie. Also watch it if you enjoyed Zombieland. If you haven't seen Zombieland, do yourself a favor and do that..."
"trapped_in_a_moment","Null","3","5","14 May 2013"," Ambiguity in our Lives
","I'm not going to summarize the movie because IMDb synopsis does a good job in this particular case. I just want to write about something that I noticed thanks to the IMDb user ""mytumtumtree"" who informed the community about Romeo and Juliet references in the movie. Knowing these in advance I came to realize that the movie is not complete. What I mean is that if it were strictly followed the R&J story in the background of a zombie landscape it would end with the familiar bitter end. <br/><br/>I think lots of ambiguities introduced to the movie just to avoid that bitter end. Like R. (Romeo?) can't remember his full name – it's incomplete. But in the end he doesn't care what it was who he was. He just cares what the future can bring. So, sometimes it's best when we don't stuck on little things, and carry on. A little ambiguity in our lives helps to embrace the idea that things can actually get better so we don't worry who we are and how things are so overwhelming. Like blurring the reality so we can't tell the difference between who is alive and who is dead. In the original R&J story the characters didn't have that advantage and maybe that's why things turned out that awful for them. <br/><br/>Here is a movie that is made for us, the audience, to feel good. Of course gory images are abundant but that doesn't take away the optimism within it."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","17 March 2013"," A Fresh Idea for the Zombie Genre.
","I don't think there is a lot of Zombies movies out there that tackles the idea of a corpse reanimation back into human. John Levine's movie does. Plus, it's rare to see a movie told from a zombie's perspective and showing human characteristics in the living corpses. The movie also gives a reason why the zombies eat the brain, because it's makes them feel alive due to being able to relive their victim's memories. The movie starts out, after a zombie apocalypse, R (Nicolas Hoult) live at the airport wishes to be more than a zombie, and feel alive again. It wasn't until he met Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer), a human survivor looking for medical supplies. Rather than eating her, he felt something for her. Now, R must try to keep Julie alive from his zombie friends lead by M (Rob Corddry) and the really undead 'Bonies'. Bonies are the zombies lost the last shreds of their humanity and gave up becoming nonstop killing machines. The more we spent with Julie, the more he turning back into human. The movie is based on the novel by Isaac Marion and very similar to it. The acting is pretty good, but it's not like they were doing Shakespeare. Cross that, it was Shakespeare in a way. There is a few connections to Warm Bodies and that of Romeo and Juliet. R might stands for Romeo. M, R's best friend might stands Mercutio. Julie is short for Juliet. Perry (Dave Franco), Julie's ex is the character of Paris, and last Nora (Analeigh Tipton) Julie's friend is The Nurse. Still there is no social prejudices similar to that of Romeo and Juliet in Warm Bodies. The reasons for this is because the zombies were really eating people. Therefore, people had good reason to fear them. One thing this movie isn't like is Twilight, but it was made to cash in of that fad. There is no love triangle or zombies taking their shirts off, or a whiny teenage girl that just wants a zombie boyfriend to do everything for her. I don't mind feminizing the zombie lore, as long as the story is good. I think the movie works. Nicolas Hoult's acting reminds me of Edward Scissorhand's Johnny Depp with the soft talking, and in some cases, Leonardo DiCaprio dying in the water in Titanic. This is one of the very few roles, Rob Corddry isn't annoying. I didn't like how Teresa Palmer looks like the blonde Kristin Stewart. They were really trying to get the Twilight fans with this. I would give props to John Malkovich, but he's barely in the movie. I like the movie's allegory theme on how technology disconnects us and how we need to feel connect again. I like the Easter Egg of a zombie that looks like Rick Grimes from Walking Dead in the tarmac scene. I was kinda disappointed by the make up in the film. The zombies rarely look like zombies. I didn't think of R as a zombie, but more like a handsome Goth guy. The Bonies were made by awful CGI that makes it looks like leftover Imps design from the movie Doom or the Mummy. I think it was the same CGI from the Mummy (1999). Just watch both of them and you sees the similar design. For a zombie movie, there isn't that much violence in the film. I don't know if it's hurts the film, or not. I like how the zombies were not made out to be brainless, we really made to care for them if they do get killed. Still, I don't like watching movie that deals with falling in love with the dead. While they didn't have sex, it felt a bit necrophilia. It will still gross me out. I have to say that the movie was pretty good, and I enjoy it. Give it a watch if you're looking something new in a zombie movie."
"aequus314","7","3","5","12 February 2013"," Zom Rom Com?!
","Tagline explains the gist of it, ""He's still dead, but he's getting warmer.""<br/><br/>Told from the perspective of a walking ""corpse"" in his early twenties, R (played by teen idol Nicholas Hoult) walks, acts, grunts and gobbles like a zombie but the unique difference is; he feels like a human being. Infection from chemical warfare hasn't robbed him of all emotional and mental faculties!<br/><br/>In this zombie romance based on Isaac Marion's novel, consciousness wanes overtime and not immediately. When humans ""turn"", they become corpses just like R and slowly disintegrate into full-blown nasties called ""bonies."" We find out later that the cure-all solution apparently lies in... umm, some heart and sweet lovin'.<br/><br/>When consuming brain matter belonging to victims, R experiences flashes of their memories — literally absorbing nutrients physically and physiologically as he feeds. One day; he meets cute with Julie (Teresa Palmer, who bears a striking resemblance to Kristen Stewart from some angles), daughter of Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich) — a leader of mankind's resistance against the undead. Hunger gives way to neural activity, hormones and warm fuzzy feelings; the pair soon bond over John Waite's rendition of ""Missing You"" among other MTV hits.<br/><br/>Rest of the plot's development is formalist predicament — ""lovers in overwhelming odds"" — Romeo and Juliet against the scrim of gun-totting homo sapiens and carnivorous bonies.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is the type of fusion flick that will attract a fair amount of praise and disdain from die hard fans of stock genres that range from zombie (Dawn of the Dead), goth (Twilight), romantic comedies (Crazy, Stupid, Love), apocalyptic sci-fi (Children of Men) to serious dramas (Inception). We watch with a preset of ideas about what it should or ought to be, so I'm going out on a limb here to say that this latest feature by Jonathan Levine (50/50) is a pretty fun and amusing trip. It took some time but eventually, I came to enjoy the film what it's worth — offbeat fiction for forlorned romantics.<br/><br/>There are moments when Warm Bodies border on pedestrian vanilla; relying on pop music and goofy-dry humor to compel the narrative but this routine ends after the second act. On the overall; Levine's protagonists make a handsome couple, relatable and charming in this interrobang of romcom in zombie-apocalypse. Story is really sweet, the effect is entertaining.<br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"

The laughs are not as often as one would hope. The suspense is less than suspenseful. There are holes in the film that should have been filled but were not. Even if one could believe that a zombie could come back to life - the zombie should not lose all of it's scars that it earned along the way during the transformation.

Each one successfully makes out Zombies to be what we know them as - Brain Dead creatures with no humanity and extremely contagious bites. They shuffle around for the most part, just doing nothing. They don't sleep. They just eat the living. But this movie is different. Warm Bodies takes almost everything you know about Zombies and throws it out the window. No Mindless zombies. R is a Zombie who eats brains to feel something, anything really. Yet for some unknown reason, he has this strange urge to protect a human girl, shortly after he starts devouring her boyfriend's brains that is.<br/><br/>To say that this movie is worth watching is giving it too much credit. This is supposed to be a Romantic Comedy, but it's just not funny. It takes a whole hour for there to be any real comedy. The most horrible part of this movie is that there is no explanation for any of it. They're supposed to be dead. Not alive. Yet through means unknown, they can fall in love. They can think. They can speak English. They can drive cars for goodness sake! But seriously, R is a Zombie who somehow goes from eating brains to protecting a human girl to falling in love with her to getting a heart beat to becoming warmer to dreaming to making out with her to being cured. This is a movie that will leave you baffled. If you're a fan of Romance, then by all means watch this movie. If you've watched a lot of Zombie movies, don't watch this."
"apaustinproux69","3","4","8","9 July 2013"," What happens when teen girls move on from twilight
","I went to see this with my (now ex) girlfriend. When I first saw previews with that angsty ""zombie"" guy that the girls most likely find cute, I knew exactly what his movie was going to be about. Already the concept is just plain silly: zombie romance. Take that in. ZOMBIE. ROMANCE. Silly plot aside, I like to make fun of bad movies and I knew that my girlfriend and I would be making out. Those two things make the movie worthy of a try. We walk in, get out tickets, drinks, and snacks, and I get ready for something I would undoubtedly dislike. I knew this would be on par with Christian Rock and Ryan Gosling movies for me. The same crap being produced until it's beaten to death. It's cutesy crap, teen zombie guy that wants company, alright humor but nothing special. It's averaging at a 6 in the beginning. Then comes the horrible parts. This group of human survivor kids are out doing a coming-of-age thing (I think) and that's where Zombie Boy spots the blonde of his dreams. How else to kick of this wonderful love-in-bloom without eating her boyfriends brain? Which gives Zombie Boy that guy's memories, despite the fact that Zombie Boy appears to have just picked from anywhere in the brain. In any case, it's dumb. Zombie Boy then abducts Blonde Girl (sorry, but these characters aren't memorable) and takes her to his ""sweet pad"" which is an airplane. They listen to music, nothing important really happens until Zombie Boy starts to feel alive again. Apparently falling in love cures zombie-ism. THIS IS F***ING STUPID Just the entire concept angers me. The writing skill of these people can be equated to most fan fiction writers. ""But it's creative"" Some people might say. I don't care, it's stupid. A small child painting the dog blue could be considered creative, but is still stupid. After the point of Zombie Boy starting to feel the plot goes as predictable as possible and all the other zombies become human again and integrate with the survivors after some dramatic bullcrap. Whatever. tl;dr boring, predictable, dumb concepts, message that teen girls will enjoy"
"trashgang","4","4","8","17 June 2013"," remember Twilight?
","I already had mixed emotions when I see the add saying it was also a romance. That brought in mind immediately the Twilight series. A thing that just wasn't out for me being a horror buff. Sadly I had the same emotions while watching it, not only that, it's also slow so the remote control was in my hands to stop this flick which I finally didn't do due the name John Malkovich, but he also couldn't save this flick. he's doing what he has to do and that's playing the pain in the *ss, what he does best.<br/><br/>It started okay and I had a bit of a smile on my face when R, the zombie, is telling about his life and it even had a few funny situations like walking to town where R stated, God it will take a while like we are walking. But from there on the romance comes in. Still R stays a zombie but towards the end it's just some Twilight or Romeo and Juliet situation that it really is out there for teenagers. <br/><br/>I don't think that any zombie buff will like this very much. Yes there are head shots but for a zombie flick it doesn't have any gore or blood. The CGI used looked nicely done in the beginning and it didn't mind me at all but it was really the story that makes it not watchable for me. Strange to see so many positive things about Warm Bodies but for me it was the next Twilight trash. <br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0,5/5"
"merrilanil","7","2","3","4 November 2014"," Short, sweet and crisp
","I had skipped on this one expecting it to be another zombie movie and since I had not read the book I was not sure whether I wanted to actually watch it but then I recently read some blogs that carried praises for this movie and that Is why I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>Warm bodies is a simple and fortunately well paced movie that does not stall or hover around much and thus giving a decent watch. I for one did not find this movie overly exciting or boring. It was good and watchable with certain elements of humor though for some reason I found the plot a bit undercooked. But it is kind of a recurring phenomenon with any movies that is adapted from a book. Usually during the transition from a book to movie, the details get omitted, maybe because of time constraints or for movie sensibilities.<br/><br/>In short it is a sweet romantic comedy that follows the age old story of Romeo and Juliet except in this case our Romeo is a zombie and Juliet a living person.<br/><br/>Review after reading the book<br/><br/>after reading the book, i feel that the book is a much better version though yes certain blanks were filled on reading the book and the movie had kind of left out certain parts but still book was kind of tough to keep track of and movie was much more enjoyable in terms of plot and narration"
"secondtake","7","2","3","31 December 2013"," A further extension of the great zombie genre
","Warm Bodies (2013)<br/><br/>A surprising, imperfect, slightly adolescent movie that has enough guts and originality to make it glow. It actually toys with being a masterpiece—but don't go comparing it to ""The Hunger Games"" which has a similar audience and much more complete follow through. ""Warm Bodies"" takes the notion of zombies that have a little heart, and hope, and turns it into a vaguely Romeo and Juliet story.<br/><br/>The star, the zombie who shows signs of depth, is pretty amazing, and he makes the movie. Nicholas Hoult, who had a significant role in the excellent Tom Ford movie ""A Single Man,"" comes across here with far more nuance than you're supposed to get with a zombie. And that's the idea. He plays it from all ends, the automaton and the deeply feeling youth.<br/><br/>Across from him is Teresa Palmer who is fine, though she leaves the transcending to Hoult. Palmer's character is Julia, and Hoult's is just called R (because he can't remember the rest)hence a hint of Juliet and Romeo. (There's even a balcony scene, though they don't play out the echoes beyond that.) Julie's evil father who doesn't understand the other side of life is played by John Malkevich with familiar distinction. Well cast. <br/><br/>Around them all is a world that is not so different from other zombie worlds— the endangered human sections and the wild and dangerous zombie sections. They are separated by a wall (just as in ""World War Z"" and others) and the wall, of course, is breached. This is a given, and a good necessity. What zombies eat, and what becomes of them, you'll have to see. This movie takes a slightly different take than others, and that's its optimistic magic.<br/><br/>But it's not a riveting masterpiece. There are some sections that just don't work outside of their core audience—young people in love. The posturing and conversations sometimes dip into obvious clichés. But not often. And the best parts are original and great fun."
"Soul4673","10","2","3","9 August 2013"," Beautiful...just beautiful
","OK. I've tried to write a review for this film 3 times now. I'm getting the feeling that something is somewhat against me reviewing this film which confuses me because this film is beautiful and amazing and the themes are stunningly amazing as well as the score, the effects, the settings, the make up, the casting, the scripting...EVERYthing. I love this film so much. It's just stunning. I've seen 3 zombie films in my life- Shaun of the dead, zombieland and this one....this film is nothing like zombieland or Shaun of the dead....I loved Zombieland too but hated Shaun of the dead but seriously warm bodies is one of the best films I've seen in a while. Nicolas Hoult was absolute genius as well as Teresa Palmer and Analeigh Tipton and Rob Corddry and Dave Franco...the cast was completely flawless. Anyways this film is based around a zomhie called ""R"" who has the rare ability to think. He begins to question his life as a zombie especially when he meets ""Julie"" who he falls in love with on first sight. He saves her life and takes her to his home at the abandoned plane in an airport full of zombies and ""bonies"" to protect her from being eaten. Over the next few days they fall for each other and Julie and R run away with each other to an abandoned neighbourhood where R confesses to killing Julie's boyfriend Perry. She then leaves R after he sleeps and dreams for the first time since he became a ""corpse"" R then heads back to the airport to find out that the bonies are after him and Julie and that the other corpses are beginning to change also. R goes to find Julie and warn her of the bonies and R then plans to tell Julie's father that the corpses are changing. This meeting doesn't go well and ends in Julie and R being chased by her father's army men whilst the zombies are fighting bonies in an abandoned subway station. The humans see this and join in helping the corpses meanwhile R and Julie are being chased by bonies and the army and end up on a ledge above water. R then grabs Julie and jumps back first into the water whilst holding Julie. They fall and he hits the bottom and Julie lifts her head out of the water and then goes and grabs R from the bottom of the water....and he's OK. R and Julie then kiss romantically and then we see an extreme close up of R's eye which changes from light and outlined with slight lack of life to bright blue and human and then we hear a gun shot and see R jolt backwards. Julie's father is stood opposite holding a steaming gun. Julie then starts explaining to her father before realising that R is bleeding. R is in the back in shock holding his shoulder. He is now human. This is such an amazing bit that it actually made me cry.<br/><br/>I can't believe how amazing this film is. You have to see it! I really wasn't expecting it to be like this. I was expecting some cheesy, cheap zombie humour with gruesome scenes based around zombies ripping humans to pieces....it's nothing like that. The humour is all cleverly placed and there is some gore but not enough for it to be a horror or even a thriller. It's a zombie romantic comedy which is insanely cute and an extremely clever idea. I love it so much.<br/><br/>Watch it!"

","What can i say if you are a zombie fan then this is a must, and even if you not you probably be pleasantly surprised. Finally an original zombie movie with a different plot to the normal run or get eaten and then more running.Acting and special affects were great what can i say i loved every minute of it and one of the first zombie love stories you ever watch. As well as being really funny it gives you a different perspective on what it could be like to really be a zombie, an area which hasn't been explored yet which is why i am so excited about it, and is as action packed and Gory as most of the other zombie flicks. Watch and enjoy."

","I watched it yesterday. At the beginning i was a bit bored but it actually gets really better after a few minutes.<br/><br/>The guy just keep talking about his zombie life without really explaining how he got into a zombie. But awkwardly he fell in love with a girl and that chemistry between them was so beautiful. Most zombie movies I have watched(resident evil,I am legend...)portrayed them negatively. But that's the first time you can see walking dead actually having a heart and can love. <br/><br/>At the end that was the cure LOVE.Overall a really nice movie for everyone that conveys more than just being cliché romance. A good family-movie!."

I had never heard of it before we decided to watch it, but I'm really glad we decided to.

","This movie came as a surprise to most people when it was initially released. I expected great things from it after having read the book and that's exactly what I got. Warm Bodies is a charming teen zom rom com. What makes it works as well as it does is the effective chemistry between R played a sexy Nicholas Hoult and a feisty Teresa Palmer. The supporting work from John Malkovich, Analeigh Tipton, Dave Franco and especially Rob Corddry isn't to shabby either. Jonathan Levine takes his premise seriously but also with a winking eye. The movie can be creepy, funny and romantic and the red stuff is kept to a minimum but is there surprisingly. Also impressive is Levines screenplay it keeps the story, engaging and creative taking the concept into unexpected and appreciated areas. All in all it's a fun, surprising little gem that's quite entertaining."
"tabuno","9","1","1","17 January 2019"," A Romantic, Comedy, Drama, Horror Movie
","3 February 2013. This rare blend of comedy and drama with a romance, horror genre is a difficult editing and scriptwriting challenge. To maintain the tone and balance is a juggling act where too much horror can easily destroy the comedy or too much comedy will make too light of the drama, or the romance can be easily lost as just a fluffy add on. In Warm Bodies, this uneasy mixture seems to have developed into a full flavored banquet that is emotive, meaningful, thrilling, and tender. As with The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Electric Dreams (1984) the melodic music is well adapted to this movie and in a few places actually carries the movie itself. This is a predictable romantic comedy with strong dramatic elements with the zombie horror action thrills presented with a great comedic voice-over. Unlike Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story (1961), this movie comes at a time in American history where the Great Recession appears to be over and besides global warming and international alarm, our Country is more hopeful in its outlook while facing an emerging Hispanic population and the movie's tone appears to embrace similar challenges that we face today. Unlike Escape from New York (1981) where the President's plane crashes behind the towering walls surrounding Manhattan that has been turned into a national prison, the walls that have been built up in America will need to torn down, a message that seems to underlie the larger framework of Warm Bodies, along with the magical power of love.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies appears to build on the comedy-drama of All About Steve (2009) with flashes of the comedy flare of Ghost Town (2008). At the same time, this movie also incorporates the more biting drama-comedy as found in Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (1991). The same way that The Demolition Man (1993) brought together elements of comedy into science fiction action genre or Tropic Thunder (2008) set in a comedy set in a deadly serious Asian war arena where the characters believe its all a movie set, is where each of these genre necessarily brushed up with sharp rough edges, Warm Bodies was necessarily cut where horror scenes would sour the lighter comedy elements, where the transitional scenes between comedy and drama and action threatened to become boringly slow was filled with impending, hauntingly beautiful music to carry the mood through to the next scene.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies even takes is underlying romantic theme from Roman Holiday (1953) where a sheltered princess is exposed to the love experience with an American newsman in Rome. Romantic flashes of Total Recall (1990), Dances with Wolves (1990), even the classic sci fi The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) or Blade Runner (1982) reverberate throughout this movie.<br/><br/>It's difficult to assess whether the awkward newness of this fusion of genres, the unsettling mixture, the at times slow pacing, it's seeming predictability are a product of a weakness of this movie or whether its boldly forging ahead with these momentous changes in movie plot developing incorporating major distinctively different genres are reflection more of a brilliance is hard to say."
"sherilcarey","8","1","1","11 January 2019"," Fun Twist
","Warm Bodies had some unique twists and turns not seen in other zombie movies that came before it as well as some good performances. Our main zombie was very well cast too, perfectly suited performance and screen presence. There weren't detractors from the far too common poor excuses for wit or poor language in so many scripts. It's great to see movie makers without the need for those weak crutches. I enjoyed this flick thoroughly when I saw it originally and again these years later."

","Warm Bodies is harmless fun. It's a new twist on the zombie genre that features pretty good acting from the cast, especially Nicholas Hoult. The movie did feel a bit rushed, though, and some plot ideas aren't fleshed out (ha!) enough. The story isn't as sappy as I was expecting, but it also isn't as funny as I was expecting, either. Warm Bodies could work as a gateway movie to get certain people to watch other, better zombie movies."
"dannolan","9","1","1","18 August 2018"," Surprisngly heart warming movie
","This film definitely deserves a 9/10 review but as im only seeing this as 6.9 i feel like it deserves to be higher. So im hoping people will realise how good thos filn is to bring the average up. This film was brilliantly done for the script it had so dont read unless you want spoilers although ive kept them to a minimum. So if you have seen the film just think how stupid the original script must of sounded.
Basically zombies manage to invade the world and even take over every countries military with ease and have a group of survivors build a wall to protect themselves (maybe this is what trump is trying to prepare for). Then a group of teenagers who cant even shoot a gun straight, seriously when you watch this film dave franco had the perfect shot to take them out with a semi automatic but still f$&#s it up and gets himself killed. But in some weird sort off karma this then contributes to the survival of everything (dont want to say to much as it is spoilers).
But with both Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer's acting and not to forget john Malkovich's co starring they manage to turn what sounds a stupid as s%#t film into something brilliant that just grabs your attention from the start and wont let go till the film ends. Its even one of them films you can happily watch over again with your loved one without getting bored off it."
"vickymthomson","10","1","1","16 July 2018"," Completely Underated

"dagallop","10","1","1","26 May 2018"," Just good entertainment with plenty of exceptional moments.
","This is a bias review because I bought the DVD and have subsequently watched it over a dozen times in the years that I have owned it.
There is no chance that anyone with a pulse couldn't like this movie, it is exceptionally well acted, has an exceptional soundtrack, marvelous sets, brilliant story and above everything else John Malkovich is in it!
The concept is truly original, probably the only movie of its kind to have a real conclusion that is as plausible as the initial cause, which by the way is only briefly mentioned but is totally superfluous as the movie carries the plot without it!
I personally believe that this movie should be up there in the 'classic zombie dramedy' list for anyone that enjoys light hearted humor along with a great and extremely well acted stories.
And then there is the soundtrack, oh my, whoever selected the music for the specific scenes deserves an award for their choices.
John Malkovich is never anything but a brilliant, talented and adaptable master of his craft and this fits in with the history associated with everything he has ever done. As convincing as possible with the hints of his personality thrown in as usual. By the way, even his small roles such as that in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy only he could have pulled off in the style that he did.
Overall, a brilliant movie with great music, however, not for the faint hearted as some of the scenes deny the younger viewers an opportunity to watch this."

"MihaiSorinToma","9","1","1","27 December 2017"," An unusual Zombie
","In a post-apocalyptic world, where most of the population was turned into zombies and some into walking skeletons, R is a pretty unusual member of the undead. He collects stuff, he spends ""quality"" time in an airplane, and, most importantly, he thinks. In his situation, he saves a girl who got surrounded while scouting for medicine and tries, in his own way, to communicate with her. Although scared as hell in the beginning, she starts to enjoy R's company, creating some sort of human zombie connection. From this moment, R slowly turns more and more alive, but as his evolution becomes more pronounced, he becomes a target of the ""Bonies"", so he must do something fast before he will be eaten (almost) alive.<br/><br/>It's a pretty atmospheric horror movie, featuring an unusual zombie who is determined to change and receives some unexpected help from a living being, which he saves. It sends emotion and tension, and although it starts very slowly, almost boringly slowly, it gains pace and becomes interesting. While it is mostly predictable, but not in a bad way, and some events are rather questionable, it manages to be a very good watch, with a happy ending which put a smile to my previously sad face."
"Kristoffer-Eikrem12","8","1","1","27 June 2017"," A good usage of fusion between two very derivative narratives
","This movie does two things; 1. show a zombie-apocalypse from a new perspective, and 2. everything it can with something that is not new or super high-concept. <br/><br/>Fantastically displays how zombies feel and how socially anxious they would be. It is amazing how it manages to portray such a relatable zombie. <br/><br/>This is a typical love story so it does have some tropes here and there, like the ""come sleep in the same bed as me scene"", but the fact that it merges two very derivative narratives provides freshness in both spaces, so the movie earns those tropes. <br/><br/>It also sort of plays like a Disney fairy-tale. You've got transformation/curse, unlikely romance and even a disapproving father."
"vantikaci","7","1","1","5 May 2017"," Surprisingly thoughtful
","I was expecting a slightly dark Rom-Com and got a little more.<br/><br/>What piqued my interest, was the angst filled,hapless R,shuffling through the airport lamenting on how humans used to interact and connect, which switched to the same airport, filled with disconnected humans, alienated and engaging only with their cell phones. <br/><br/>I thought, well , that's an astute observation. <br/><br/>Hought's was a compelling performance, I loved his repulsion at his own inhumanity when he ate the brain of Perry, as seen through Perry's memory. That's some good acting. <br/><br/>I also like that twist, it reminded me of Robert Heinlein's Michael Valentine Smith,(Stranger in a Strange Land) who ate the bodies of the dead in order to absorb their spirit, all in the name of love. You grok?<br/><br/>I LOL'd in real life when the zombies were geared into action, to 'Rock You Like a Hurricane', and we were treated to the (now iconic) Reservoir Dogs slow-mo, except it was in real time- because...hey, they're zombies! They're already in slow-mo!<br/><br/>Also when the makeover to human montage was cut short by the friend shutting off Pretty Woman and saying ""It's funny"". It is. <br/><br/>And of course, the redemption of the zombies (and humans) and the bonding experience of reconciliation through the love of killing a common enemy.<br/><br/>Yay!"
"bryank-04844","7","1","1","2 September 2015"," 'Warm Bodies' is a great addition to the zombie genre and stands out from the rest fresh love story and great and likable characters.
","Jonathan Levine's adaptation of Isaac Marion's 'Warm Bodies' focuses more on an undead romance than any political or social issues, with having just enough blood and guts for genre fans. I have to say that this zombie flick ranks right up there with some of the best living dead films ever made. It's original, fresh, and has an amazing soundtrack. I have no doubt that this lovable zombie movie will make tons of money at the box office.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Levine has taken up the horror genre from his recent efforts in 'The Wackness' and '50/50' to give us a coming of age story set in a dystopian world conceived by writer Isaac Marion, whose book of the same name was published only a couple of year ago. I have not read the book yet, but if it's anything like the film, I'm sure I'll love it. This love story starts out in the very near future where we see a post-apocalyptic world where most people are no the undead, who spend their time wandering around looking for still-live humans to feed on their brains, guts, and organs.<br/><br/>Among the millions and millions of zombies is R (Nicholas Hoult). He goes by R, because he can't remember his name as we hear him narrate throughout the entire film. R also cannot remember anything about his former life before the big zombie apocalypse, other than that it happened and what might have caused it. During an afternoon, R and several other zombies are out looking for humans when they stumble upon a group of survivors salvaging a pharmacy for medicine. Durring the attack R is captivated by Julie (Teresa Palmer), who is very much alive and who is killing the zombie attackers. In an effort to dodge her bullets, R attacks Perry (Dave Franco), Julie's boyfriend and brutally kills and eats him.<br/><br/>However, it's love at first sight with R, and decides to spare Julie being eaten by himself or any of the other zombies, and escorts her to safety to his home, an airplane at an airport that he has converted into a makeshift home complete with a collection of records and a record player that he operates. At first, Julie is very scared as R only blankly stares at her and groans. But after a little while, she seems to notice he is different and that he is trying to communicate with her, even learning to slowly speak again.<br/><br/>It's here where we find out why zombies eat people, especially their brains, as it not only gives the undead their daily fill of vitamins, but also gives them access to their victim's memories, thus making the deadites feel a bit more alive and human. However, Julie knows she can't stay in the airplane with R forever, as she must get back home, which is a section of the city that has been blocked off by giant 100 foot cement walls and is led by her widowed dad, Grigio (John Malkovich), who at one time might have been a decent guy, but is now in charge of the safety of a lot of people and in charge of the make-shift military, and who rarely has time for his daughter.<br/><br/>As Julie starts to make her way back home, R realizes that he is transforming into a human again and that there maybe a cure. So , R must tell Julie so that her dad and his army will stop killing the zombies. However, there is a larger threat that equally effects the humans and zombies. They are called boneys, which are a sort of mutation when humans turn to zombies and are undead for a long period of time. These boneys are mostly skeleton-like and have no brain function what so ever, other than eating anything they can find. It's up to R and Julie to let the rest of the world know their secret.<br/><br/>The story plays out perfectly with no lags in the script or characters. Everything is on pace and brilliantly told. Their is also quite a bit of comedy here, not only from the situations of teenage love and how awkward that can be, but by one of R's zombie friends, who is hilariously played by Rob Corddry. Also, 'Warm Bodies' is completely aware of itself and how silly at times it can be, which makes this undead comedy shine above the rest.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job as R as he flawlessly showcases his zombie-like body language and his undying wish to be alive again. Hoult rose to fame as the main kid from 'About A Boy' starring Hugh Grant. Hoult does not have the English accent here and he sounds great when actually is verbal. He's very charismatic as Malkovich and Palmer also turn in solid performances. There isn't ons of gore in this, as it tends to stray away from the blood and guts aspect and focus on the relationship between Julie and R, but there are bits of brains and its of blood here and there to please any gore fan out there.<br/><br/>With a killer soundtrack composed of artists ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Roy Orbison to Bob Dylan to Guns N Roses, the older crowd will laugh and love the music used here, even with its cheesy placements, but like I said, the film is fully aware of itself, so you'll be pleasantly happy with it. 'Warm Bodies' is a great addition to the zombie genre and stands out from the rest fresh love story and great and likable characters. I have no doubt that once you leave the theater after watching this, you'll be dying to see it again."

","Warm Bodies opened quite cleverly with humorous dialog and an understanding of characters. However the direction of both the story and humor seemed to go only downhill from there. Ultimately in the end the combination of zombie horror genre and romantic humor just did not seem to mix well. <br/><br/>Shuan of the Dead is an fantastic example of a mix of genre done well (Zombie Horror and Humor) and has a good build up of characters.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies provided characters that were shallow stereotypical teen types and really everyone just seemed to shallow to care about.

","Warm Bodies is a movie that I did not expect too much from. zombies, head shots and jump scares as normal zombie flicks, but it turned out to be unexpectedly beautiful.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around a zombie who seems to be semi-conscious from the very beginning, and is narrating the movie all by itself. but trapped in a zombie body, he is unable to communicate and even speak clearly, all he can do is fumble a few words time and again. as the movie advances, he meets a human girl and starts have feelings for her, and that feeling of love makes him gradually more and more human. That is what the movie basically is about, but on the deeper side, the zombies in the movie try to teach what is it to be feel love, pain and how precious it is to be human, a simple fact that we are taking for granted. The movie also conveys the message of accepting change and getting along with each other. Most importantly, what i believe the movie says is that love, compassion and humanity lies at the very core of being human, and love can break down the strongest of walls. All of this is in the 90 some minutes of fun filled journey, with good acting and considerably good screen play, and quite funny dialogues. A nice movie that i would recommend to everyone."
"pc95","7","1","1","16 November 2013"," Fairly Entertaining
","Being a big fan of Walking Dead television series, my review for ""Warm Bodies"" is undoubtedly positively biased. It was a good watch with several good laughs. It also has a nice to see some originality. Indeed, I'd rate the movie between a 6 and 7 - closer to 7. Young lead Nicholas Hoult does a good job with his line-delivery and zombiness. The movie is especially witty and clever in it's initial third or so. Beautiful young Teresa Palmer is up to the test to be the lead love interest. She is a bit Tom- boyish, the right amount so. On the lesser side John Malkovich has a bit role, maybe not even needed - part of the weaker side of the story involving human fighters. Worth a watch, especially for zombie fans."
"shark-43","8","1","1","16 November 2013"," Clever Twist On Genre
","WARM BODIES marketing campaign probably hurt it cuz you couldn't tell if it was a romantic comedy WITh zombies or a zombie movie WITH comedy. But we finally watched it and I thought it was very clever and funny. Hoult & Palmer were terrific. The opening monologue was hilarious and immediately showed how funny sharing the inner thoughts of a zombie would be. LOVED that John Malkovich was the militaristic leader. Haven't liked most of the other films Jonathan Levine has made but this was very well done. Romeo & Juliet with a BITE! They satirized everything from makeover montages, sidekicks, zombie folklore, etc. And the music used throughout was GREAT! Bravo! Hoult has really grown up since being the little kid in ABOUT A BOY!"
"motofreak2772","8","1","1","15 November 2013"," Romeo and Juliet Zombified
","I feel like most people missed the connection between this movie and the classic romeo and Juliet play. Obviously all the names R, Julie, Perry, M and the plot with opposing families give this away. The real difference is that instead of dying together in the name of love, they become alive together. With R being a zombie his coming to life is literal but even Julie who was sad and lonely in this post-apocalyptic world finds herself at the end because of R. This movie is the untragic comedic zombie romance version of Romeo and Juliet. I think if they would have advertised it more so in this way people would have understood it better and probably enjoyed it more. As for the movie itself the effects were good. Music was fun. Kept me interested the whole time. Just a fun zombie romance for people who are tired of the same old stuff."
"moh_hamade96","5","1","1","26 June 2013"," A comedic 'human extinction' kind of approach, where the viewers feel no humor merely a tingling feeling of pity; towards the character and the screen writing.
","A comedic 'human extinction' kind of approach, where the viewers feel no humor merely a tingling feeling of pity; towards the character and the screen writing. Warm bodies, a movie, describing the light in the end of the tunnel, for a disease that has taken over and spread throughout the world. A disease mentally and physically affecting the body to transform into a zombie, obviously. The humans have barricaded themselves from these low life creatures using a wall, calling it 'the wall,' obviously. A group of human volunteers were set on a mission, in the zombie territory. A girl by the name Juliet - played by Teresa Palmer- is saved from the terrors of zombies, once the mission failed,by a zombie called 'R' –played by Nicholas Hoult. He returns to his crib namely the airplane with the girl and the romance begins!<br/><br/>It is always obvious what a movie is trying to reach out for; the underlying message the movie conveys through the characters. Even in the worst of circumstances-in other words-when it has failed to accomplish it"". This movie defines this statement. Warm bodies has attempted to enlighten the mind of the viewers that even the dead can be enlighten with love. Love is the pulse and beat of the heart. Indeed the events were in front of our eyes, the zombie was cured using love but the movie has failed to make us truly believe it. Probably the comedic approach was a little far-fetched, and ruined the message. The background narration by 'r' where we understand that the human and sane 'r' is speaking to inject humor into the movie. The humor thrown in between the lines was not caught by me, and felt irrelevant. Moreover, the idea of music playing every couple of seconds made me feel I have paid to watch a concert, a lifeless concert! The idea of music might have been to introduce life into the zombie and make him use it as a means to feel the richness of it words fall gracefully on his ears- like humans. Yet again failed and felt unbelievable! <br/><br/>Since the movie is embarking on a 'zombie' journey, a new life has to be created by the screenwriter, a life with new rules. Where humans are on the edge of extinction and zombies have taken over! The new rules set in this movie seemed unrevised and reluctantly thrown into a paper using words and called a 'script.' I couldn't digest what the zombies can and cannot do. What was life there, the viewers couldn't live it. Can they talk? In the beginning the narrator states that conversations are at a minimum where one worded gestures are sufficient. Then 'r' suddenly is talking with a stutter to his comrade but what seemed a proper conversation. <br/><br/>A scene three-quarters through the movie where R is looking for Juliet, and she happens to be on the balcony. That moment struck me; R and Juliet in a balcony THIS WAS A ROMEO AND JULIET SHOWDOWN. Where the high born Juliet is looking down at the low life, where their romance is odd in their society; and deemed as an impossibility. That moment will probably go down in history as the clearest example of a cliché, and how screenwriters grind through the chain of events to reach to something what they consider as epic but is silly at best. A screenplay's chain of events should be left to flow on its own, make it as if it was handpicked from life and shown in a four sided box.<br/><br/>If R was make upped to look dark and gloomy then he is the light of this movie. His acting was rightly fit for this character, his change in his walking/running style was impeccable! The scene where he started devouring someone's brain and started exploring his memories; actually caught my eye a little off guard. I wished and hoped that the dramatic approach would be constantly used in this movie, but sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>The 'memories' theme of the movies can be categorized under what worked in this movie. Along with 'r's acting, and the make up, the vitality of memories was felt by the viewers. It was really the thing which kept us thinking; and shows how the attempt was successful.<br/><br/>If you want a romantic horror movie with a sprinkle of humor, and filled with clichés then this is your movie!"
"anton2101","9","1","1","16 June 2013"," Unexpectedly entertaining
","I didn't expect much from this movie. There have been more than enough zombie films lately and the idea to mix it up a bit with Twilight-style romance didn't make it any better. But the trailer was interesting enough and the ratings were decent so I gave it a try. 1. The film is very even. And by that I mean there are no weak moments that you would like to skip. 2. There are no unnecessary details over what caused all the mess and why, and I liked it that way. 3. The soundtrack is worth noting. There are numerous nice old songs throughout the movie, a few modern ones (Chad Valley's Shell Suite was a find for me) and some original tracks when they are needed. 4. The acting is very good. I especially liked the supporting by Analeigh Tipton and Rob Corddry. Nicholas Hoult (R.) was good but since his zombie basically was deprived of emotions for the most part it is hard to judge his performance. Teresa Palmer was great at most scenes (especially showing terror), but some of others were unimpressive (balcony scene for one). I feel like in some scenes she didn't really understand what was required of her and the director didn't really help or correct her either. 5. There are enough funny moments. Just many enough and funny enough. 6. What I especially liked is how the important moments were mostly silent scenes. Really shows you don't have to talk to make a point, something I would like to see in other films. 7. The romantic part was charming and heartwarming. The leads definitely shared some chemistry.<br/><br/>So overall I definitely recommend this. It's a romantic comedy and it nailed those aspects. It doesn't have the deepest of meanings but it's not shallow either."
"turboisturbo","6","8","22","2 February 2013"," Too bad the marketing ruined it
","I've read the book and like most adaptations, it would be easy to say the book was better. This one is not the exception, unfortunately. But let's focus on the movie.<br/><br/>What ruined this movie is the simple fact that they spoiled the entire story in the trailers and marketing. ""Their love is the cure"". Seriously? Am I supposed to hope they DON'T fall in love? They could have based the trailers and marketing on the fact that ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) is a self-aware, thinking and undead zombie and it would be enough to make me wonder what a zombie's life is about. They thought knowing the climax from the start wasn't a problem apparently.<br/><br/>For those who like to compare this to the Twilight franchise, personally I wouldn't. It's not meant to be neither epic or a ""saga"". Yes, it's a surreal teenager love story but they clearly don't have the same approach. If you look for Twi-like movies, watch the trailers before Warm Bodies and you'll find plenty.<br/><br/>This movie is still somewhat fun with some funny lines and expressions but quite inconsistent. The characters felt dry and shallow. The drama bits were barely affecting the characters or the story. The action is basic and mostly made of CGI. The story felt simply felt rushed and there was no tension to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>Maybe this flick will appeal to younger people and those who haven't read the book but as a movie on it's own, I can't give it more than a 6/10. It's an ""ok"" movie."
"jesusgurl78","10","5","12","14 February 2013"," Wonderfully Fresh
","When I first heard about Warm Bodies a few months ago, I was a bit intrigued. I thought, ""Zombies being cured? Not so new. Falling in love?! That's new..."" So, safe to say, I was interested in it for quite awhile. Then I saw the trailer, and several movie clips, and thereafter, I was hooked; hook, line and sinker.<br/><br/>When I watched the movie two days ago, my first reaction was, ""Not too shabby."" But, as I've thought about more and more, I've realized... This was one of the most refreshing movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>When it comes to genre of horror movies, romances, comedies, and even mixtures of the three, I think it's safe to say we've seen it all and then some. Well, let me tell you now: Warm Bodies just blew that out the window.<br/><br/>This movie is refreshing because I've never seen, or even heard, of anything quite like it.<br/><br/>Now that I've discussed how much I liked the idea of the movie, let me tell you about what I thought of each individual aspect.<br/><br/>The acting goes from decent, to great. Most of the acting is decent, while Nicholas Hoult plays R quite splendidly. R is a zombie that isn't quite as typical as the rest... He has quite a bit of thought running through his mind, and has a desire to connect with people; humans in particular. However... His being a zombie, as you can imagine, makes that quite difficult. When he sees Julie, there's an instantaneous connection that feels with her, causing him to want to protect her, instead of eating her, like the rest of the Dead would do in his position.<br/><br/>It may be a bit surprising, given this movie's protagonist is a zombie... But, this movie really does belong in the genre of comedy. R is quite hilarious, you see. He doesn't talk much, but with his thought narrating the movie throughout, the things he thinks about are quite amusing. I thoroughly enjoyed his amusing perspective on life.<br/><br/>While the way the trailer shows R's heart beating once (in a very cheesy way) when he first sees Julie, let me ease your fears... It's not that cheesy. That's in the trailer. The movie's different. Better, actually. Anyway. The idea, put in this particular way: ""The zombie was cured with love..."" is a bit corny. But, the way it actually is, is that R's heart begins to be revived with love, but Julie actually teaches him how to be human, again. The longer he spends with Julie, the more human he gets.<br/><br/>There was one part, at the end of the movie (I will NOT say what it is; if you see the movie, you will know), that was unrealistic with what would happen with a shot to the chest...<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was refreshing, new, keeps you on the verge of being on the edge of your seat, funny, and cute, all wrapped up into one, gruesome, romantic package. Although, from what I've read with other people, you either love it, or you hate it. But, then again, it was the same with The Avengers....<br/><br/>Most definitely, and irrevocably, 10 out of 10 stars from me."

","OK, I have to admit I was very disappointed, but I was expecting it. For those of you who haven't read the book, please read it. There's much more to this than what the movie literally ruins. The only thing good I found on this movie were the actors, all of them 10 out of 10, and that's the only reason I'm giving the movie a 5 (specially for the actor playing M). I don't understand why a studio buys the rights for such a great story and then this is what they have to give us. They changed/removed what the story had best: depth and a message. It seems they decided to make this a ""twilight"" of zombies or something. So, I advise you all, read the book or you'll be missing out. It's so much more fantastic than the movie."

The acting was good, even though acting as a Zombie does not take all that much work :-) It was an entertaining movie, the main characters Nicholas Hoult, and Teresa Palmer did a wonderful job of pulling you into the movie and getting you to feel for the Zombie. With the support of Analeigh Tripton, Rob Corddy, Dave Franco and John Malkovich, it wrapped everything up into a nice movie to sit and just enjoy without to much thinking. Well worth the cost of a ticket!"

","Adapting a popular novel to film is always a very challenging thing. You have to try and please the fan base as well as making it accessible enough so that people can find a way to relate to it. It's even trickier when that source material is so uniquely weird. It's a hard thing to pull off such a successful adaptation and that is the reason why Warm Bodies is so damn impressive. Centering around a zombie who calls himself R played by the adorable Nicholas Hoult who while on a hunting spree with his fellow undead finds himself falling in love with Julie played by the really impressive Teresa Palmer, one of my new favorites. There's a little more to it than that but it's hard to explain without it sounding a little too bizarre. I myself have read the book and was a big fan of it and although the film differentiates from the source material it really nails the feel and ultimate message of it all while remaining true to it and just completely committing itself to it's cooky concept. In some instances it even enhances it with subtext of about adolescence, human connection and society in general. It also helps that strong performances populate the film throughout most notably by the 2 leads and Rob Corrdry as Marcus R's best friend. The film is funny, a little gross, a little scary and just really endearing. It's a sweet but dark valentine for people who want there rom coms a little edgy. Zombie fans may be a little disappointed at the films lack of actual horror but if their open will find an exciting new angle to revisit the now clichéd material. I've heard a lot of people comparing this film to Twilight and the truth is although I'm a fan of that series this is far more complex, clever and not as mushy. Warm Bodies is a film that should be celebrated as it takes the chance to break new ground and for that alone in a slew of unnecessary remakes and sequels that is a truly special thing. 4/5"

","I was wrong about Thor: The Dark World being the worst film of the year. At least it was credible. This movie on the other hand, is the biggest travesty since Iron Sky. A Insult to the zombie genre itself by insulting fans of the zombie genre in this poorly acted, abysmally written movie.<br/><br/>I didn't even finish watching this film and I know its the worst film of the year. Its so bad it makes Twilight look like a better love story than anything.<br/><br/>The film is about a Zombie played by the very gifted actor Nicolas Hoult. Unfortunately, this model/actor has to work with such bad material. This Zombie named R has more problems in life than a Disney Princess. He wishes he was Human and how he wants to be free. This is unbelievably stupid.<br/><br/>But not until he meets a human named Julie. Then he falls in love with her. He takes him back to the airport where she is creep-ed out by him but... *Sigh* she begins to like him. So the movie is basically about him narrating every five minutes about his stupid life.<br/><br/>The movie's most insulting scenes are ones where R is getting healed. The things that most offended me was that he eats people because ""IT MAKES HIM FEEL HUMAN"" BS! Zombies cannot feel human! They cannot breathe! Also, He Can Dream. WHAT THE ACTUAL F#@$!? HE DREAMS!? Who wrote this crap? OH WAIT. LEVINE HIMSELF.<br/><br/>Not only is that the worst of it, but the zombies can also talk. OK. Zombies don't talk. Even if they did, would they sound like depressed Goths? The acting is horrendous. The girl who plays Julie has about as much emotion as Bella Swan. This movie is a poor mans version of Twilight.<br/><br/>The music is incredibly misplaced with 80's pop songs that sound like they should be in a real romantic comedy than a film about zombies. Even though some of the songs are OK, the score is a stupid dumb tech-no soundtrack that should be placed in a film like Tron: Legacy.<br/><br/>This also is a stupid Romeo and Juliet Post Apocalypse film which I hadn't noticed until I saw a balcony where Julie is looking into the sky.<br/><br/>This is a disgrace to movies. Its a disgrace to filmmaking. Its a disgrace to writing, its a disgrace in every sense of the meaning. Warm Bodies is the worst film of 2013. A clumsily written, horribly acted, and awfully directed film from the man who brought us a movie called 50/50 which I haven't seen but I know it should be good.<br/><br/>I feel sorry to all the 13 year old girls who like this movie.

The baddies (skeletons) and the leader of the good guys aren't developed much or are very 1 dimensional, but the main character and his supports are great fun. This aspect makes it feel a bit like a short story/graphic novel where a larger scope was attached for the film but not developed.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and use of music throughout was a big plus for me.

","This movie was not just a movie to me but an experience. I was expecting a light hearted comedy, but it soon became much more deeper and meaningful. I found myself lost in the movie, mingling with the characters and story, forgetting I was in the theater. The wonderful choice of music, the beautiful filmography and scenery, the appropriate colors, lights, and shades, and R and Julie's endearing and realistic behavior in each of their tumultuous situations, all combined to create a truly believable experience, given the futuristic, sci-fi scope of the story. And the romance that develops between them is gradual and truly touching, and though they don't really touch each other physically enough in the course of the movie, at least not for me, I still found their romance to be very satisfying, very believable.<br/><br/>And as a woman, I found R's tremendous devotion and protection for Julie to be absolutely HOT (besides the fact he looks so damn hot too).<br/><br/>And though this movie has some similarities to Twilight, there are differences too, mainly because R completely lacks the arrogant, obnoxious, prima donna behavior of Edward. R isn't especially gifted with superpowers, in fact he struggles a lot, yet he tries with everything in his being to do whatever he can for Julie - he's much more sincere and likable...and lovable. I would much rather have someone like R rescue me from dangerous situations than Edward :-) <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. I left the theater teary-eyed, mainly due to the story's ending, a message of hope for humanity when all appears lost. And I never once took my eyes off the screen."
"Leofwine_draca","2","3","7","7 June 2015"," Twilight with zombies
","Yeah, WARM BODIES is a mess, and unlikely to thrill the viewer unless they're an American teenager, because this film is squarely aimed at the TWILIGHT market. In fact it's pretty much TWILIGHT with zombies instead of vampires, and it's a film that serves to thrust post-modern mindless slacker humour down the throat of the viewer at every opportunity. Needless to say that I hated every moment, and sitting through it was a chore indeed.<br/><br/>The unlikeable Nicholas Hoult plays 'R', one of many zombies in a post-apocalyptic world, who inherits the memory and emotion of a random jock guy when he eats his brain. He ends up falling in love with the guy's girlfriend, a blonde bimbo type whose name I can't even recall. John Malkovich co-stars as the girl's tough dad and you feel sorry for him being mired in such an outing.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially Romeo and Juliet, but with lots of laughs and undead jokes along the way. There's some supernatural stuff thrown in too, like a twist involving the whole zombie epidemic thing which I didn't much care for. Plus, with the zombies being good guys for once, there has to be a breed of super-zombie as the real villain, which is all nonsensical. Anyway I was never going to love this film as it's the sort of soft, mainstream nonsense I automatically hate; your mileage may vary."

","Warm Bodies is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was praying for a zombie to jump out of the screen and eat my eyes, but that would be way too graphic for a shamefully hindering PG-13 rating. I could barely get past the opening credits before I started to wish I was dead. Ironically enough, the script was so excruciatingly awful that after my brother and I made it about 10 minutes in, it started to hurt our braaaaaaaaaaaaaains! All kidding aside, because I don't want this review to come off as cutesy and nauseatingly candy-ass as Warm Bodies itself, one has to wonder if this entire god awful production/crap-fest was completely funded in secrecy by Hot Topic in a desperate attempt to sell more hoodies. It is one thing for a movie to be stupid, but when it is pretentious to boot, I just can't stomach garbage of that magnitude and in this regard, Warm Bodies is by far the greatest offender of all. In all seriousness, the synopsis/tag-line to this film should just be ""zombies are like so adorable."" I mean chances are that was the pitch the director gave to the studio. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the screenplay as well. George A. Romero's poops should have more credibility in the realm of Zombie cinema than this debacle. It could have been a Disney film, but there wasn't enough blood. Never mind that it was so boring, predictable, wrote, and hackney that I was doing more moaning and groaning than the freaking zombies as I struggled to watch it. If there is one positive thing that can be said about Warm Bodies, assuming you take it out of context, I guess it would be that watching it truly is a zombifying experience.<br/><br/>P.S.

If it wasn't for the last portion of the movie I would have given it a 3/10 but the ending somewhat redeemed it. However, the fact remains that the first 3/4 was very boring and cheesy. It felt like they were trying too hard to create something different and funny. What resulted was not what I had hoped for. There was so much error in logic (what logic there can be in a zombie type movie). It just didn't make any sort of sense. Throughout the movie I kept hoping for it to improve, increase suspense or at least keep me interested. Unfortunately, it did not. I would classify this as a B level horror film meets chick flick.

"papoe2005","6","3","7","9 February 2013"," Irony befalls this title.
","After seeing the trailer for this film I knew I had to see it. It's an interesting concept about the human condition being the cure for all things, even the zombie apocalypse...Grant it it would never work but the charm is there. Here's where irony befalls this title; all the charm and character in this film is found in the undead characters. If it was intentional by the writer than kudos, but I highly doubt it.<br/><br/>I loved the zombies in this movie if it had been just a 40 minute short film it would have really worked. Lets say the zombie R was a lot closer to the human enclave not living in an airport; the group of survivors get swarmed, hopefully in a much more intelligent manor, and R of course saves the girl but she returns home. Periodically R visits her after following her through her secret entrance one day after she goes out and gathers supplies a second time and a bond finally forms when she realizes she can trust him. Bing bong boom there's your foundation. Just a thought because there were so many plot holes with the idea of these kids growing up in a zombie infested world; why would they be so careless. Okay step one when scavenging supplies don't play video games you stupid ass! Step two if there is only one door why not put a couple people on it to secure any dangers, especially when you think you hear something that could be a potential threat, and finally why the hell would you let a zombie get that close to your face!?!!!?<br/><br/>The humans in this movie were dumb! Just completely and utterly stupid! I did not care about them at all and if they were to die than good riddance because they were too stupid to be a survivor; dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb only begins to describe them and their actions and sadly there was no plot except for the love story...oh wait yeah there were the ""Bonies"" which is a dumb name but I get the reason for it those enemies are skeletons...clever. But if those things were not involved than what would be the conflict...oh the f*cking zombies!!! See your story falls apart when you throw in a weak subplot known as the ""Bonies."" It's a lame stretch to make it so the human looking zombies are little better than the skeleton zombies. No!!! What you do is actually flesh out your characters you gave R a reason to be compassionate he wishes to communicate again to feel alive; why not have some of the zombies understand his motives and wish to help while others are just crazy cannibals. Than you have even more plight when the humans have to fight off the zombies because now they can't judge by appearance alone, makes it a bit more gripping.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed 40% of this film the stuff with the zombies was great, it was funny at times and the character R was charming. The girl he falls for however was boring, stupid, and lacked all personality. It was like watching Kristen Stewart if Kristen Stewart was blonde had a better rack and no chipmunk teeth. R shows a lot of personality and character with his undead hobby of collecting and listening to vinyl and the guy likes Springsteen which is awesome! That girl would not know who Springsteen was I'm sure her modern day personality would go straight for the Justin Beiber and never look back. She barely talks about anything pressing except when can she leave...hmmm why not use your survival skills and leave you are the daughter of the leader of the human resistance you can't fight with melee weapons are you dense!! Doesn't matter point being even in the flashback or dream sequences she yammers on about how life is so detrimental and we need to exhume humanity...ugh now you sound like a pretentious hipster who uses words like exhume to sound smart, I hate you.<br/><br/>I'm pissing a lot on this movie I know, but its because they took a very charming short film concept and padded it out with pre-teen nonsense; driving a car real fast on an airport strip would be fun I don't want to watch that though, not in a zombie film. Also if it took place more in the survivor enclave then we could have dove into the social hierarchy that was obviously going on. Near the end our characters go down into what looks like a refugee camp, in comparison to the mansions these white girls were living in; okay what the hell is that about why are these people living in filth and you are living it up in a mansion. I can assume because your dad has power but now it looks like he abuses his position and makes him a bit of an asshole; bam another plot point that would have been so much more interesting to see!!!<br/><br/>Yeah you guys dropped the ball on some real social issues that are plaguing our society. But I do appreciate the daydream of life before the outbreak where R talks about how it must have been great to simply enjoy the company of other human beings back then; however, it shows a bunch of people on their cell phones and ipods not paying any attention to the physical presence of the people around them...Brilliant!!! You just made a perfect analogy of our modern lifestyle to that of a zombie apocalypse, we may as well all be dead because we lack the abilities to socialize, f**king brilliant!! And you capitalized on it by showing a zombie trying so damn hard to simply speak to a living human being....BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!! But then you dropped it and made it a teenage love story, as if like we haven't already suffered the Twilight saga."

","Warm Bodies is a smart, funny and touching film about a zombie named R who saves Julie from a zombie attack. It has great performances, a brilliant script and intelligent directing.<br/><br/>First I need to talk about the two leads. I was a big fan of Teresa Palmer in I Am Number Four (underrated I think), where she showed that she could kick ass and take names. She still has an element of being tough in this movie, but the character is far more complex. She shows such a range of emotions that pull you in and make you fall in love with her as quickly as R does. Warm Bodies has been compared to Twilight (they were both made by Summit) and the criticisms that have been leveraged against the character of Bella (passive, submissive to Edward, not a good female role model etc.) are nowhere to be seen here. Julia is quite possibly the hero of the movie, but not by just being a 'male' character portrayed as a woman.<br/><br/>Go to my blog for a full critique of the movie.<br/><br/>http://mydreamtank.co.uk/"

Yes it is about Zombies changing through the power of redemption and the human touch but it is more than that. All the actors are amazing and it made my wife and myself laugh all the way through ( not bad considering I lost my job this week ). So it starts off with a zombie hoping there is more out there and not understanding how he came into the situating that he was in and back stories that addressed some issues but oh my god I loved the sound track. It harks back to old school soundtracks and it blew my mind.

"jkrumnow","8","3","7","4 February 2013"," Warm Bodies – Not just a Zombie Twilight
","Warm Bodies is easily a modern day, zombie-turned, loose adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, so for viewers and critics who claim this is just zombies cashing in on Twilight are seriously missing some cultural background. The main characters are even named Julie and R. R being the zombie love interest (who is hot regardless of the fact that he is dead) can not remember his full name, all he knows is that it begins with an R. Sadly, as much as the overall film screams (or moans) Romeo and Juliet I had not caught on to it until a certain balcony scene.<br/><br/>For the rest of my review google Thoughts of Jacki K and head into my movies category."
"Convictions","8","3","7","3 February 2013"," This Movie Brings Life To A Genre That's Been Done To Death
","After a cold and quiet January, Warm Bodies manages to warm and liven things up at the multiplexes. I will admit, when I first heard about this I thought of Twilight and what this movie would to the zombie genre that Twilight did to the vampire genre. A lot of people thought this as well and that's perfectly understandable but, I was pleasantly surprised. To compare this to Twilight is almost an insult. It's not perfect but, it's definitely charming and clever. <br/><br/>While I did enjoy this movie very much, I can't help but feel that the trailers promised so much more. This movie is many things, part horror, part comedy, part romance, part action, part romantic comedy but, this movie only achieves some of these and fails in others. The horror is kind of lame, the bonies are suppose to provide the horror but, they're horrible done and look really fake. There's some action but, none of it really gets the pulse pounding. I guess these problems have to do with the PG-13 rating, there's no zombies ripping people's guts out or zombie's heads being blown to bits. The PG-13 doesn't give it the edge that this movie needs. However, it does succeed in being funny and romantic, which makes up for these things towards the end. <br/><br/>Instead of the movie showing us everything through the human's point of view like in every zombie movie, we see everything from the zombie's point of view. Though it might be weird at first (zombies can actually think and talk to themselves inside their heads?) it's a unique and interesting twist. There are also more fresh twists along the way, like by the zombies eating human brains they actually get glimpses of past memories of the person the brain belongs too. While I've never heard of this, I liked it anyway. I thought it was a clever and well executed idea along with some of the other things the film makers throw at you. <br/><br/>With the exception of John Malkovich who just utters a few lines of dialogue, picks up a paycheck, then leaves, the acting is great. Nicholas Hoult is the stand out, and unlike Robert Pattinson who's come out in the past that he never liked playing Edward, that showed in twilight. Here, that's not the case with Hoult and he's really starting to become more known which is great because he's a good actor. I look forward to Jack the Giant Slayer coming out in a couple of months and the next x-men sequel. Teresa Palmer is better here than she was in both I Am Number Four and The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and she's gorgeous. Her and Hoult share effective chemistry, by the end I was rooting for these two which took me by surprise. Rob Corddry has the best lines, and Analeigh Tipton is sweet as Palmer's best friend. The rest of the cast don't do much, but they're good too. <br/><br/>What really sets this apart is that unlike Twilight, this movie never takes itself too seriously. This movie knows what it is and never tries to be anything more. Director Jonathan Levine stated in a couple of interviews that John Hughes was a big inspiration and it shows. They're many references to those movies. The nice 80's score also added to that and when the soundtrack comes out I plan on buying it. Then there was the issue with necrophilia, I mean this is about a girl falling in love with a corpse but, as you see in the trailer, the zombies begin to come back to life so no need to worry. <br/><br/>Warm Bodies couldn't have come out at a better time. With Valentine's Day just around the corner, you could do worse, a lot worse than Warm Bodies. Especially since Safe Haven, another Nicholas Sparks adaptation coming to the big screen on Valentine's Day. This has something for both the Ladies and the Men so I would recommend seeing this instead of another gag-inducing Nicholas Sparks movie. As for the zombie fans, you'll most likely be disappointed as there's not much zombie gore or action (thanks to the neutered PG-13 rating). This is after all Romeo and Juliet except with zombies, R(Romeo), Julie(Juliet). This probably won't become a classic like the John Hughes movies Warm Bodies references but, this is finally the first good picture of 2013( No I'm not counting Zero Dark Thirty or Silver Linings Playbook because they're technically are 2012 releases). This puts a nice spin on the zombie genre and although it's not particularly scary or action-oriented, it's still funny, clever and charming. As for you Ladies, I think your boyfriends would be much more forgiving dragging them to this movie instead of Safe Haven."

I had meatier fare to watch, but it was one of those moments when all you want is to sit back and enjoy a mediocre movie while shutting off your brain. When I found myself laughing like a hyena a couple of minutes into the film, I knew I had chosen right.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple, dead guy falls in love for living girl in post-zombie world, hilarity ensues. There's a catch though, ""regular zombies"" are not the worst you can find in this world, and that works fine in context, because you wouldn't get a satisfying resolution otherwise. You have it all, hot youngsters in hip clothes pretending to be soldiers (?), fascist dads who went hyper-protective and sorta crazy, EUREKA moments of cheap philosophical truth, and rom-com montages. It's awesome.<br/><br/>The ~*moral of the story*~ isn't just hilariously over the top, it slaps you in the face with cheese. Anyway, the film knows it and that's why it lets you laugh out loud with it.<br/><br/>Is it a Good MovieÂ®? No. Would I recommend it? Yes, no doubt.

","These zombie-genre-benders have had a good run, and ""Warm Bodies"" love story theme works about as well as I could have hoped.<br/><br/>There are many ""explanations"" that could have been better developed/explained, but some sharp casting, solid art direction, and fantastic music really pull this thing together to be one of the early, pleasant surprises for 2013.<br/><br/>While I said that some things could have been better examined, and they could have, the lead character's journey comes off as completely genuine. The timeline for his ""transformation"", and the ""heart"" behind it are pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>The humor is subtler than it could have been, but that actually fits the mood of the entire film.<br/><br/>Theresa Palmer and Nic Holt have fantastic chemistry and bright futures.<br/><br/>The film wouldn't work without all the early, well-written narration. And the more I think about - the lack of explanation may be there, but the story has the backbone to help the audience draw many of it's own conclusions.<br/><br/>I don't want to raise expectations too high, but this might be about even with Shaun of the Dead, and perhaps a touch better than Zombieland(even though I rated all 3-7/10). IMO Zombieland starts out funnier than this but fizzles a bit late. Shaun of the Dead is funnier too, but for me that music(I'm buying this soundtrack) and the love story(which probably gives this more mass appeal) make ""Warm Bodies"" as good or better.<br/><br/>You might like this if you liked:duh..Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, or Dear Beautiful(2009).<br/><br/>73/100"

"hatton-1","8","2","4","17 March 2013"," Warm bodies warms the heart
","Some genre hybrids are beginning to deliver intriguing narratives and shifts as the cycle of parody loses its charm. With Warm Bodies we have what is essentially a romantic picture set in the world of zombies. In some ways the idea is not that new. If we have a look at the progenitor of the zombie genre as Frankenstein we see the undead monster in sympathetic terms. It was rather the narrow-mindedness of society that was being critiqued. Intolerance and societal shifts were later to place the zombie film firmly in the path of the Cold War and the race divide that underscored its inhuman sensibilities. With the resurgence of gore films in the 70s and 80s, style began to triumph over substance and zombie films lost their credibility.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies finds its strength and uniqueness not when it is in the mode of parody, which inevitably it dabbles in at times but rather when it focuses on its central theme of loneliness. Much of the film is set in an airport, a transient place where only pointless waiting and anomie await the zombie inhabitants. R (Nicholas Hoult), the protagonist so named because his memory has gone lives in an abandoned plane playing old LPs on his record player. As John Waites ""Missing you"" plays it is a poignant moment that resonates with us. Our inhumane world at times is not that different from this zombie world.<br/><br/>Of course R has to eat and ventures out into the city to find a human. R narrates his story in an introspective voice-over that has many moments of subtle humor. He is trapped by his lack of memories and dreams but knows that something essential is missing. During a feeding frenzy that plays down the gore, R meets Julie, a human and takes her captive. Initially she is filled with fear but slowly begins to warm to R as he rediscovers his humanity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the third act capitulates into the well-worn face-off between humans and zombies and the film loses much of its power. It is a pity because if it had stuck to its guns it might have been propelled it into the sublime dimensions of the vampire flick Let the Right One In. Nevertheless it is well crafted, well-performed and infinitely more captivating than some of the more recent entries in the zombie and romantic genres. ****"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","16 February 2013"," A genre is born
","Both rom-com and zombie flicks have been around for a long time. When somebody finally comes up with the bright idea of marrying the two, a new genre is born: the zom-rom-com. This experiment, incidentally, turns out to be a success, a consensus among critics and general audience alike.<br/><br/>While stylish, classy Edward Cullen undeniably triggers an infatuation-type crush from teenage belles, for ""true-true"" (yes, inspired from ""Cloud Atlas"") love, it takes the gentle, awkward, shy and at times self-deprecating zombie ""R"" to really steal her heart. While Edward needs a shirtless rival to pad the attraction of his movie, R does it all by himself. I'll skip the details of the story set in a post-apocalyptic ruins of a city with a wall that reminds you of THE WALL (""A game of thrones"", though not quite as formidable) to keep out two deadly (in more ways than one) species: zombies (or ""corpses"", as officially known) and bonies (an advanced stage of the zombies).<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult, from the titular role of ""About a boy"" (although true lead is Hugh Grant) a decade ago, is today perfect for one of the most sympathy-winning roles ever offered in a movie, R the young zombie. His love object Julie is played by Teresa Palmer, remembered as ""Number 6"" by those in the audience who have seen ""I am number 4"" (2011). In my user review on that movie, I used a single word to describe her ""hot"". Here, in a Bella-Swan-type role (and many have remarked on her close resemblance to Kristen Stewart, in the context of these two movies), she is quite endearing. The best thing is the delightful chemistry between these two leads.<br/><br/>The one that truly captures my heart in this movie is Analeigh Tipton who plays Julie's sidekick Nora, who ends up saving the day for the lovers. Topton's performance is sparkling and show-stealing, and may Nora find her own darling zombie. Another show-stealing performance in the support cast is from Rob Corddry who plays middle-aged zombie ""M"", our protagonist's sidekick. While Tipton's charge is to provide comedy, Corddry's role is heart-warming pathos. Both are absolutely first-class.<br/><br/>That leaves John Malkovich who plays Julie's father, a militant leader with a philosophy of ""shoot first, ask later"" when it comes to zombies. An acclaimed flamboyant actor, Malkovich must be complimented for his restraint in playing this somewhat stereotypic role. Flamboyant or not, this actor is a true professional."

The worst thing about it sadly the immensely bland female lead.<br/><br/>Our lead is much better. He's funny, cynical, sympathetic I can believe he's the kind of cute boy your daughter jerks it too and all the zombies here look brilliant.<br/><br/>It's a sentimental story but never in a way it doesn't earn. A lot of people probably assumed this was a variation of ""Twilight"" and although I don't hate that franchise, this is far more than the ""paranormal chick flick"" I suspect a lot of boyfriends assumed it would when they were dragged to see it.<br/><br/>Well, I'm a boy too and I saw it alone so no sexism intended.<br/><br/>This movie is a sort of high 7 or low 8 so I think I'll round it up because it masters a certain charm we haven't really seen in teen movies for a while."
"williampsamuel","8","0","0","6 May 2020"," More Brains than Your Average Rom Com
","Zombies have been all the rage as of late, with undead themed movies and TV shows reaching near saturation point. Naturally this has resulted in a fair number of parodies, each with their own take on the genre. Zombieland mashed gory horror with a road movie. Shaun of the Dead was The Office with zombies. And now Warm Bodies reimagines the zombie apocalypse as a rom com in which love is you need to recover your humanity.<br/><br/>It starts predictably enough with a zombie eating a young man's brains. Only in the process he gains his victim's memories, plus his feelings for his girlfriend- who the zombie proceeds to save and take home with him. And from there love eventually blossoms, with wider implications for relations between humanity and zombie-kind.<br/><br/>I know: on the face of it, the idea of Zombies coming back to life by learning to love sounds like a really stupid idea. It's one that could easily have dissolved into sappiness or pure ridiculousness. But this movie manages to make it work, with hilarious and sometimes heartwarming results. It works partly because it's stated clearly and very early on that in the context of this movie Zombism is a metaphor for emotional detachment and feeling dead inside. And of course, the cure for that is personal connections, especially love. So in that framework the premise mostly makes sense. It's actually believable, if scientifically impossible, even by the standards of zombie movies.<br/><br/>The premise also works because the protagonist is so likeable and adorably awkward. For a zombie he's a really nice guy. He eats the brains of the living, but he feels really bad about it. He sort of remembers being human and wishes he could go back. He even has a best friend, kind of. And his constant internal monologue is charmingly geeky and kind of neurotic, like Michael Cera in one of his better roles. And things only get cuter and more awkward as his relationship with his new girlfriend starts to unfold.<br/><br/>At first, she's naturally afraid for her life, and he nervously tries not to scare her any more. It's quite charming to see her feelings for him gradually develop into non-revulsion, then trust, then something approaching love. The movie wisely takes its time with this, never rushing or forcing the relationship. The added twist also fixes some of the problems plague most romantic comedies. For once, there's a good reason for the awkwardness and stupid misunderstandings that get in the way of their love. He literally can't talk to her. And she has a much stronger reason than usual for not wanting to bring him home to dad.<br/><br/>Just as interesting as the relationship itself is the gradual transformation back life to that accompanies it. Watching him regain his humanity bit by bit is quite inspiring, especially when the effects prove contagious.<br/><br/>The one major criticism I have is that the movie kind of wimped out and never made a major reveal between characters that should have been a major part of the plot. And admittedly Warm Bodies isn't very scary, even compared to Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead. But there are some pretty frightening scenes at the beginning, and a good amount of action and suspense towards the end. And above all, it's a very sweet and surprisingly smart romantic comedy. The zombies may be lifeless and brain-dead, but the movie isn't."

"Cineanalyst","6","0","0","25 April 2020"," Romeo and Juliet and Zombies
","Although an adaptation of a novel, ""Warm Bodies,"" the book and the movie, are clearly a reworking of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" ""Julie"" is short for Juliet, and ""R"" is for Romeo. Julie and R... are star-crossed lovers, and the feuding corpses and the living are the Montagues and Capulets. This all becomes exceedingly blatant in the balcony scene. Modern rom-coms, however, lack the heart, brains or guts for tragic romance, let alone iambic pentameter, and so we get skeletons, too, and a different ending. Instead of poetry, popular music. The awkward teenage yearning is still there, though. Dreams and monologues, too.<br/><br/>I'm surprised to see that some commenters are surprised that they enjoyed this at all. ""Romeo and Juliet"" has been revered for over 400 years, and ""Warm Bodies"" is ""Romeo and Juliet""--albeit watered-down in its transmutation to the modern rom-com and zombie genres. But, yeah, cribbing Shakespeare works to an extent, because some of it's still as good as Shakespeare. It's just a rather, if you'll excuse me or not, undead version of the bard--grunting more than literate, not original but exhumed. There's a reason the zombie is the protagonist and narrator (other than traditional sexism); it's because this romance doesn't invent culture--doesn't breath life into it--it collects and hordes it: records, snow globes, even red convertibles and a lousy issue of People magazine. It consumes culture and life like zombies do flesh and brains, half-remembered and cannibalistic."
"quiqueperezsoler","8","0","0","22 April 2020"," Surprisingly fleshed out, heartwarming, self-aware and not overly-romanticised teen romance story.
","Expecting a Twilight-inspired romanticised version of another well-known supernatural concept that are zombies with an underdeveloped cliched post-apocalyptic setting, the movie surprises the audience with a well-realised world with a light-hearted and not overly-romantic love story with a deeper relevance to the overall status quo than most.<br/><br/>While movies of the same ""genre"" portray a love story centered in the unlikely relationship between two different ""species"" of creatures, this movie approaches it by deconstructing, in a way, the ""zombie science"" behind not in a way that could scientifically explain the logic behind the decisions it makes throughout the movie but rather by applying a viable approach to a more visceral cure to the zombies.<br/><br/>The film is not meant to be taken too seriously as it's many inconsistencies and unrealistic portrayal of the zombies provide a more plausible chance for both the leads to have a resonating romance. However, the story feels well-developed thanks to the inclusion of other creatures and characters that provide more layers to the story making it possible for it to have more to say than simply study the possibilites of a cross-species romance.<br/><br/>While some of the supporting characters may feel bland and underdeveloped the mere presence and attempt at a backstory in all of them and the fact they have a purpose to the story makes it not only welcomed but engaging. Some situations would seem unlikely and there are some scenes that do feel misplaced as their sole purpose do reminisce of teen movie-tropes like the typical makeover scene or several of the slightly abused montage scenes.<br/><br/>Moreover, while at first the overall execution of zombie mannerisms such as growling, slow walking and dismembering due to rotting flesh began to lack as the plot unraveled, rather than becoming an overlooked inconsistency the movie stands out for providing a reasonable explanation pertaining to the core of the story. And the film provides a sense of finality and earned romance between the two leads as it provides a conclusion to the problem of the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether the novel it's based on belongs to a saga of more books, the film provides a self-contained decently fleshed out story that benefits from not receiving follow-ups to its story as it has told everything it needed in a single film. While some matters and situations needed of a little more development, the movie decides to rush through them in order to meet the runtime. Matters that could have benefited from those extra minutes are instead tailored to allow a consistent story and a good pacing to a story that is too creative to fit in only one film.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a well-realized, endearing and light-hearted story of two teens that fall in love in an unfashionable way but whose story holds more weight in the overal story and outcome of the setting it takes place. It isn't too deep or has relevant themes to learn from or communicate to the audience, it's self-contained and affects solely in the story that it's trying to tell. But it's a feel-good and uplifting movie."

","The naughts saw a whole slew of zombie films released-such titles as 28 Days Later and Land of the Dead. Eventually, you started to get more off-beat comedic offerings-i.e. Shaun of the Dead. For my money Warm Bodies, an utterly delightful romantic comedy, is the best thing to come out of this trend. The film does ever you expect a Zombie love story to do. And it does it all so well. The movie is sensuous, scary and above all funny. Its inventions within the zombie form-why the zombies eat brains here is quite clever as a plot device, thematic point, and as genre revision-are all clever. This film is so lovable as a zombie film. It is loveable as teenage angst. It is lovable as romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Much of the film rests on Hoult's star turn. With very few lines of dialog, he captures the audience's heart and runs away with it. He is perfect for the role of R and the character ends up being a iconic teenage heartthrob. He is absolutely hysterical when he needs to be. And he makes an utterly distinct believable character all within the Zombie persona. Probably the most endearing moment of the film is when R takes a moment to get into the practice of walking human. Palmer is no slouch and her Julie completes the R(omeo) and Juliet of the star-crossed lovers.<br/><br/>Levine directs and writes with relish. He manages to sprinkle in just enough genre gore to make this a proper zombie film."
"robertemerald","9","0","0","19 July 2019"," Oddball zombie thriller has found a winning formula
","Nicholas Hoult also stars in a sci-fi thriller called Equals (2016) with Kristen Stewart. Here, with Teresa Palmer in 2013, I found an odd similarity between the two, as both are love affairs. Equals is a regimented, sterile society with space travel, whereas Warm Bodies is an enclave and hard and gritty with zombies outside, but both stories are somewhat Romeo and Juliet. I wonder if one was the inspiration for the other. Warm Bodies has high production values. There is good cgi throughout, and as they have gone to the expense of using good cgi for some of the zombies, this movie has managed, in my mind at least, to jump from just another nod to cult popularity, to the true realms of really good sci-fi movie-making. Breathtaking backdrops on a scale like I Am Legend enhance the apocalypse vision here. I had to tag a point for never quite commanding the line between oddball (romance) and serious (apocalypse), as well as at least one minor flaw in the story. Aside from that I found it one of those movies that aims to get better, both visually and in terms of excitement, as the story progresses. This is a really good zombie film, and one where, even if you aren't a fan of zombies, you may just find yourself enjoying it."

","Warm Bodies is a modern sci-fi ""horror"" iteration of the classic Shakespeare work of Romeo and Juliet. The term ""horror"" can be very loosely used; the majority of the movie follows an awkward romance scene and the scary parts are few and far between. Don't be fooled! There are a few jump scares. Clearly, the biggest allusions to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet are the characters names, the feuding houses now the feuding populations, and even the story's progression. The similarities are clear enough, but Warm bodies is unique enough to stand as its own story. However, the ending differs greatly with the couple living happily ever after (more or less). This is a nod to its modern approach and setting where audiences are much more receptive to a happy ending. The film is overall a great watch and can be enjoyed without any background literary knowledge."

3. If You want to establish different zombies, maybe you should do some worldbuilding first.
4. The things they establish aren´t coherent. I.e. slow zombies become fast just because.
5. Too little on-screen chemistry between the main characters for my taste (my god, I sound like a RomCom snob)
6. Worst of all: this movie takes itself too serious to establish a tongue and cheek interpretation of a horror trope."

","Warm Bodies is the story about a zombie called ""R"" which falls in love with a human. The idea of this movie is pretty cool. It is very different from all of the other zombie movies. The idea of zombies having personalities and such is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the movie is kind of boring in my opinion. Like, nothing really interesting happens. Most of the time is spent developing the two main leads, which have a very boring chemistry. The rest of the characters are clichés like ""the over-protective father"".<br/><br/>Im giving this movie a 6/10 because I did like how the protagonist develops throughout the film into a more rounded character, but besides him, the rest of the characters don't have much development.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in a 12 hour long trip in a bus, and that is exactly where it belongs. A fun movie that you can watch in TV or in a bus when you have nothing better to do. It provides some original and fun concepts but nothing else.<br/><br/>If you want a better zombie comedy I suggest you watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Zombieland"" which I absolutely love."

","The zombie apocalypse has come and a group of young survivors have left the safety of their walled community in order to search for supplies. Naturally the zombies attacks and our young female heroine's boyfriend gets eaten. At which point the movie decides to become a romantic comedy as the boyfriend-eating zombie in question decides that he's in love with her and promptly takes her back home with him.<br/><br/>After that the film can do pretty much anything and it would be acceptable because it has already veered so far off the beaten track. And although the film doesn't go outright bat guano insane, it does contains some really weird scenes, which all still meld together rather well. The movie has a logic of its own it follows, even if that logic is so weird.<br/><br/>The actors are also rather good. Special mention should go to Nicholas Hoult who manages to pour such presence into the lifeless corpse he plays. His zombie character plays all the zombie notes correctly, moaning, grunting and stiffly walking around, yet you can still somehow read a lot of emotions from his rotting face. This is at least partially helped by the fact that we get to follow his inner monologue, which in itself is one of the best parts of the movie, especially because Hoult's delivery is surprisingly well- suited for dry comedy.<br/><br/>All that being said, the ending is rather disappointing. You can see it coming by looking at the film's overall tone, but it's still so filled with sugary fluff that I swear it gave me new cavities. I'm not saying the ending should have been filled with gore and suffering, but a modicum of moderation would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>Still, not a bad film to check out if you're looking for a zombie movie that's different."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","0","17 March 2016"," A funny comedy with minor problems
","When it comes to zombies, everybody pretty much shares the same opinion. If you were to come in contact with one, either run as fast as possible or shoot it in the head. Although this situation has never occurred, it's at least some kind of solution to an extremely difficult problem. The zombie itself has changed numerous times over the past several years. Initially with its introduction in George A. Romero's Night of the Living (1968), the zombie has been portrayed as a mindless eating machine. An empty vessel looking only to gorge itself in its crave for human flesh and to do nothing else. Or at least, this is what we uninfected humans believe. What if under all the decaying exterior and faded color was a functioning brain that was aware of its current condition but could not control the system that carried it? What if there was an actual cure for the plaque that made everyone so lifeless? Well that's what Isaac Marion's novel explored in the book of the same name Warm Bodies. This adaptation of it is well done too.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (50/50 (2011)), the story follows a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who is indifferent on his current state. He only eats when threatened but on the off chance of finding him, he'd rather try to communicate. As far as R knows, he's the only one who started out with this thought process. One day when hunger gets the better of him, he manages to come in contact with a female human named Julie (Teresa Palmer) and brings her back to his home (which is an abandoned airplane). As they stay with each other, they begin to bond. Meanwhile on the sides, both protagonists' parties don't catch on. Marcus (Rob Corddry) one of R's zombie pals almost mistakes Julie for food, while Julie's father Grigio (John Malkovich) looks to annihilate all zombies in his way. Considering the director who also acted as the writer handled this production, it's impressive. There's quite a bit of development that goes on among characters and that's for both factions. <br/><br/>To help the viewer understand R better, much of the reasoning and motivational decisions made by him are explained through voice-over by Hoult in order to know what he's thinking. There's also explanations given as to how R understands other people and as to why he eats aside from being threatened. However, the one aspect that Levine did not cover is how R became self-aware. How did it happen? When did it happen? Of all the zombies around him, nobody felt the same way he did anywhere else? It's possible but highly unlikely. The only other issue this horror comedy has is its rating. In the past there have been horror films released by the MPAA with a PG-13 rating. Yet for this movie, the violence isn't super gory but there are a number of bloody scenes. Even one of the characters drops an F bomb, so why not just go all the way? It's obvious this could have been rated R too because all the ""blood"" that's on screen has mainly been coated in a black ooze color. This is what keeps the MPAA from giving it the restricted label. Seriously though?<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the acting is great in this picture. Nicholas Hoult as R has quite the charm going for him being undead and all. There are some real moments that show that there's something ticking inside his head. Teresa Palmer although representing the female strong head trope in horror films, her character's courage is noted and her chemistry with Hoult is amiable. Plus as both develop, the audience will see the struggles both need to accept. Rob Corddry as Marcus plays a funny counter to R in his mannerisms and actions. The same can be said for Analeigh Tipton who plays Julie's friend Nora. Both actors act as the protagonists' backup in a comical manner. John Malkovich as Julie's father has a much smaller role to play and although he's not around for long, his motivations are clearly defined and explain why he acts the way he does. There's even an appearance by Dave Franco playing Julie's ex; he probably has the least amount of development among the rest of his cast members. The antagonists are called bonies, walking skeleton zombies.<br/><br/>For the bonies, they have no conscience whatsoever. Special effects wise, they seem to be the weakest aspect because of just how rigid they move. They have a look that resembles very close to Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (1999) CGI. However, the cinematography Javier Aguirresarobe was handled well. Even for the chase scenes, the camera felt very steady. All scenes captured the right amount of landscape, whether being in R's airport or in the humans' bunker. Aguirresarobe also filmed for the Fright Night (2011) remake, Goosebumps (2015) and The Finest Hours (2016). For music, Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders (a Beltrami collaborator) composed the score. Surprisingly, this is the second score (the other being The Sessions (2012)) produced by Beltrami that rarely sounds like his previous horror scores. There are moments that involve blaring horns, but much of the score is comprised of bells, harps and piano that represent themes for R and Julie. They are simply one the most beautiful themes ever composed by him and it is by far one of his most recognizable and its quite pleasing.<br/><br/>Writer/director Levine forgets a few areas in the script to elaborate on when it comes to logic, but a lot of the time, it will wholesomely immerse the audience into the mind of R. It also could've been rated R, but aside from that, the comedy between the leads work, the camera-work is good and the music is the heart tugging centerpiece."

","Warm Bodies is a decent movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast. It is a very unique film, set in a completely different universe from our own, zombies may be a very overused device in film and television these days, but in this movies defense, it uses them in a very different way, giving us sympathy for them instead of simply wanting them all dead. I know a lot of people like this movie, but it didn't really win me over, the romance was the strongest part of the story, but I really didn't find Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer believable, they didn't have a lot of chemistry and once Hoult's character became able to speak properly, their unconditional love became even less believable. I felt like it tried too hard to be several different genres, it wanted to be a comedy, with a lot of romance, a fair amount of horror and even a little action, I think it should have stuck with romantic comedy without so many scenes that were meant to be scary and intense, R and Julie's relationship could have been much more effective without these scenes. It's definitely not a brutal film, but Warm Bodies has too many flaws that left me feeling underwhelmed by a movie I thought had a lot of potential, and because of that I couldn't recommend it. <br/><br/>Set during a zombie apocalypse, a girl begins to fall in love with a zombie with human traits, despite her father planning to annihilate them all. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Nicholas Hoult"

","Considered to be a science fiction film, warm bodies was directed by Jonathan Levine in January 2013. Starring Nicholas Hoult a R, and Teresa palmer as Julie, the leader of the survivor's daughter, whose father hates zombies. After an apocalypse in the USA, the survivors live in a city surrounded by tall and thick walls for protection. Julie, among others, is sent on a mission on the outside, where the group is attacked by zombies. R eats Julie's boyfriend's brain, gets all his memories and falls for her. He saves the girl from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. They develop a relationship and become friends. Soon the zombies change their emotions and are capable to dream, but the Bonnies, the evil zombies, are after Julie and R. The movie has incredible special effects and very realistic make up and costumes. It also has excellent performances. It's a fantastic film to enjoy in family. This film appeals to sci- fi lovers and zombie fans, though it also has romance and adventure as well as action. It's a film recommended to everyone, young and old."

","Warm Bodies (2013): Dir: Jonathan Levine / Cast: Nicholas Hoult, Teresa Palmer, Rob Corddry, Analeigh Tipton, John Malkovich: Unusual zombie film with the ultimate take on the act of love. It is set during the zombie apocalypse but something seems different with R, a zombie who seems able to think for himself. There are others like him but they live in fear of the skeletal zombies that devour anything with a heart beat. When a team is sent out to gather supplies and such they are attacked and mauled by zombies. Teresa Palmer plays the girlfriend of one of the victims but she is rescued by R who is fixated on her. He conceals her in a plane where they slowly develop a strange friendship. What is great here is unlike other zombie films we have a conclusion that goes an opposite direction that is truly uplifting. Director Jonathan Levine previously made 50 / 50 and here creates a zombie flick that is low on gore but high on comic appeal with a sense of warm good will. What works against it is the fact that R goes from barely a grunt to carrying on progressive conversation. At any rate Nicholas Hoult is terrific as a zombie struggling to communicate non zombie feelings to someone who is suppose to be afraid. Teresa Palmer as the daughter of a military head finds a connection with R. Rob Corddry steals scenes as R's best friend Marcus. Other roles are unfortunately as dead as the boney zombie villains. Even John Malkovich who can steal a scene better than anyone, is unable to elevate here as Palmer's military father. This is a refreshing look into love and communication being life's ultimate cure.

","To paraphrase the oft moaned female lament, ""He couldn't keep it up."" Zombie film as told from a detached, wry, dryly humorous soul. Hmm, do zombies even have souls?

Thirty minutes on, love enters the narrative and the overall edge wilts. Movie turns romantic, then preachy. Rom com, at least in this movie, does not equate to razor honed satire.

","With a friend having recently started to dip her toes into the Horror genre,I decided to search around for an easy-going Horror title that she could watch on Halloween.Due to her being a fan of the TV show True Blood,I started to look round for movies which contained a similar comedic aspect to the one featured in the series. Struggling to find any suitable titles,I suddenly remembered seeing a trailer for a fun looking Zombie film,which led to me getting ready to see the warm bodies hit the floor.<br/><br/>
View on the film:<br/><br/>Adapting the Isaac Marion short novel,writer/director Jonathan Levine skillfully uses the books inner-monologue to give the title a delightfully quirky comedic bite,with being a rather awkward,very self-conscious zombie whose obsessed with vinyl records and attempts in having full conversations with his fellow zombies.Along with the quirky Comedy edge,Levine also gives the movie a surprisingly sweet romantic nature,which never becomes sickly sweet,thanks to Levine matching sly nods to Romeo and Juliet,with R getting flashbacks to his brain munching skills.<br/><br/>Whilst the film does largely focus on the romance side of things,Levine makes sure that the horror of the walking dead is never left behind,with Levine scattering the movie with fun horror in-jokes, (a highlight being a ""cameo"" of Lucio Fulci's Zombi) and also making sure to not stay away from the gore,as R finds himself having to take on a bunch of deranged,uber- zombies.<br/><br/>Slowly walking across the screen, Nicholas Hoult gives a great performance as R,as Hoult shows R falling all over the place in his attempts to show new love Julie that he is not a mindless zombie nutter.Tip toeing over the risk of her character being plain and wholesome,the pretty Teresa Palmer gives a lively as Julie,with Palmer showing Julie's unease over being the girlfriend to a zombie who ate who boyfriends brains!

","The one thing I try not to be is a sucker for the romance movies. I am certainly not against them in any fashion but I find most to be very contrived and obvious that they are almost offensive. It is with that in mind that I avoid the much 'hyped' ones like the drinking water in Sochi. The ones I truly am interested in seeing, I do so with cloak and dagger tactics so no one recognize me entering or leaving. I'd probably be less embarrassed caught leaving a porn shop than caught leaving some big budget romance film. I do recall seeing previews for Warm Bodies and felt it was safe enough as a comedy / romance to brave the chance of embarrassment. This movie is about Zombies. In a time when Zombies are all the rage, someone found a way to make this a part of the rest. The movie centers around 'R', a zombie who provides us with his internal monologue. While he and his Zombie brethren are out feeding, he sees Julie and is immediately captivated by her. Instead of eating her brains, he protects her and takes her back to his 'sanctuary' (a home he has made on a plane parked at the airport). Julie discovers he is different and seems to be trying to communicate with her. They develop a bond and R begins to change, slowly regaining his speech and faculties. As Julie starts to notice this as well, the two embark to spread the word in hopes of curing all zombies. I know that synopsis sounds lame but I cant give too much away. There are some typical zombie feeding scenes and battle scenes between the undead and the living- so don't fret. At the end of the day, this is a wonderful movie about an unlikely pair reminding people what it is like to be 'human'. I still tear up at the end of this and regard it as my favorite Zombie romance movie."

","You know, once this film began, I couldn't possibly imagine where it would go, since the main story's premise felt too crazy to develop something interesting. I may admit that, until the 30 minutes, I had no big excitement or reason to keep watching it, but I went on-- and I did the right thing. Julie is a beautiful girl who happens to meet the zombie named R-- because he actually can't remember his name--, and for some reason we can't figure out, she starts having feelings for him-- maybe because he ate her former boyfriend's head? Not only that, but R begins to act more like a human, also starting to have feelings, leading to something like ""Bicentennial Man"" or even ""Pinocchio"". The few funny scenes exist only when Julie makes fun of R, like when she imitates his (their) way of walking, or when she tries to understand what name he was trying to speak. It's inevitable to mention how Teresa Palmer's acting looks like Kristen Stewart's in 2008's ""Twilight""; even the characters are really similar. Other than that, although the movie didn't have an impacting scene or anything, the photography direction-- and direction itself-- portrayed the film in a beautiful way, with melancholic scenes and a pleasant scenario. I believe that MANY people will find it utterly boring, but something about it made me feel good and in peace. ""Warm Bodies"" is a great and relatively original work that became famous for being so unusual and inspiring, but is surely not a movie for all."

","Warm Bodies seems like something fresh and peculiar when compared to movies released nowadays. Sure some aspects are more than overdone by Hollywood on a regular basis. What makes this movie stand out among the others is the fact that it was carefully made and everything about it fell into place. Our lead character is someone that will get you off on the right foot with the story that is going to be told. He is funny, interrogative and sort of fits in with his kind, but seems to wanna break free. When he meets Julie, a human girl sent out to get supplies, he senses a need to protect her and therefore takes her home. From then on he will change as he spends time with her and begins to bond. This change will progress from R (the boy's name) to the other zombies, as they begin to feel and dream like they hadn't in years. Despite these good news, danger is present when the bonies (zombies reduced to deadly skeletons) become aware of what's happening and both the humans, led by Julie's father, and the evolving corpses face extinction. Not too long, the movie manages to entertain with competent acting that makes you root for the characters. The fine directing helps as well as it is quite compatible with the smart script, based on the novel. Warm Bodies is a good movie experience for people who not only appreciate this genre but also enjoy logical romances filled with thrills.<br/><br/>Rating 7/10"

","I am a big fan of zombie movies. This was a cute movie, however a bit slow, the romance between the two heroes of the movie was dragged out too long and made the movie a bit slow and kind of boring. I think they should have shortened the scenes on the plane where the Zombie R is living and added in a little bit more action. However,there were some exciting parts where they are battling the zombies. Funny parts too which are cute. I think it may have also needed a bit more history of the characters. The parts with John Malkovich were really good, because John Malkovich is just awesome. Nice movie to rent on a Saturday night, but not in the same league with Resident Evil zombie movies. However, this movie is a bit more heartwarming rather than bleak, there is hope for the zombies."
"justwrite3","7","0","0","3 January 2014"," A refreshing look at the zombie story
","As is often the case, this story can be seen as another retelling of what has come before -- zombies, boy meets girl, boy meets girl from a forbidden family, and so on. That's particularly the case for the Romeo and Juliet aspect of Warm Bodies, right down to the balcony scene. But ultimately, I found this to be a funny, enjoyable, and refreshingly different entry in the zombie genre.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult does a fine job as R, the zombie with feelings whose inner monologue carries the story, and Teresa Palmer is also good as Julie, R's living love interest. The plot is dangerously simple, but the film engages the viewer by leaning heavily on the likability of its stars and using humor and intelligent writing effectively -- the zombie security guard reflexively scanning other zombies at the airport security checkpoint, the things R keeps in his airplane home, funny throwaway lines by R and M (Rob Corddry) -- to keep the audience entertained throughout.<br/><br/>There are plot holes and nit picks if you want to find them, but it's a zombie movie, so willing suspension of disbelief is a requirement. If you can check those tendencies at the door and leave yourself open to this film's charms, it can be a pleasant surprise."

These are the core ideas Warm Bodies is built around.<br/><br/>Personally, I love extended metaphors, all the better when they're written as a comedy/horror. <br/><br/>If you've read this far, you know what the movie is about. What I want to tell you is how good the performances are and tell you that when the zombies don't live up to the rules they laid out, that it ties back to that central theme. <br/><br/>If you watch this -- I hope you do -- remember that this is the first zombie film that isn't a statement about consumerism or retribution for everything humanity has gotten wrong, rather it's a film that says we have within us the ability to change the world even after the apocalypse."

","I had seen many previews for this movie, and didn't think I would be THAT impressed by the watching of it, therefore I put off the initial viewing. Now that I have seen it, I feel compelled to tell a bit.<br/><br/>The film quality was up-to-par of films nowadays as to be expected. The actors all provided performances that held strong for this type of comedy/horror. The story, while extremely cliché was done entertainingly enough that it held my utmost attention through the entirety.<br/><br/>The gore in this delicious ride of horror fun is at points eye-flinching (the eating of brains with juice running out of the mouth, anyone?), but stays brush-away-able as compared to the story unfolding and the actions of each character. A love story for the times, it shows how the power of a young persons attraction can win over the most cold of hearts. I found the entire movie not out loud laughingly funny, but a grin it kept on my face throughout. For those who believe it bares ANY resemblance to Twilight style of teen feces, then think again. While the sparkly vampire took itself so seriously it failed, this film keeps it's tongue quite in cheek. Overall 8/10, solid comedy, would definitely recommend to others, but not worth buying on BluRay/DVD."

I wish I could talk more about the story, but I try to either leave these posts fairly spoiler-free or at least warn readers when I'm about to spill some of the beans (brains?).<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is based on the Isaac Marion novel of the same name and centers around the relationship between R (a male zombie) and Julie (a female living human). Seeing as how I've already classified this as a romantic comedy, I think you can tell roughly where the story goes. I enjoyed the relationship between the odd pairing, and the awkwardness that ensues when a girl catches a zombie's fancy unsurprisingly leads to some funny moments.<br/><br/>What truly makes the story unique by zombie standards is MILD SPOILERS it is basically a retelling of Romeo and Juliet. R is Romeo, J is Juliet, M is Mercutio, Perry is Paris, Julie's dad hates all of zombie- kind, etc. There are several scenes that reference Shakespeare's classic, but I'll leave that for you guys to discover yourselves. END SPOILERS<br/><br/>This movie was a huge pleasant surprise. I expected it to be cheesy but decent enough to watch. Instead, I found myself regarding this as probably one of my top ten favorite zombie films of all time. The uniqueness of the story is only half of what makes it good; the other half is simply the fact that this is a solid, enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Isaac Marion announced in 2012 that he is writing a sequel to the novel Warm Bodies. Whether it is also adapted to the cinema screen remains to be seen, but I eagerly await the chance to watch the further evolution of his story.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: highly recommended not only for zombie fans, but also for anyone else looking for a good movie that's different than the usual undead fare.

Although the plot is not smooth and has some logical caps, the presence of diverse zombies, inclusion of boneys, use of varied music, and some fine acting (particularly Nicholas Hoult as R - Hoult should obtain more praise for this role - and John Malkovich as Colonel Grigio - well, Malkovich is always pleasant to follow).

The more time they spend together, R develops more emotions, thoughts, dreams, and ability to speak.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.

"edion13","10","0","0","3 November 2013"," What this movie really is about
","I'm a 29 year old guy who truly despises Twilight movies and everything alike. Warm Bodies was none of that. Twilight is a movie tailor made for idealistic teenage girls who know nothing about real life. Warm bodies is tailor made for intelligent and cynical people who have some knowledge of psychology and politics... <br/><br/>The key to understand this movie is to overlook the zombie aspect. The zombie apocalypse is just a metaphor for the dehumanization of our society. The Zombies are just normal apathetic people, who walk through their lives without ever being truly human. They are like the teenagers of today who can only send text messages to each others, or play on their Iphones, or the bureaucrat who can't bother to greet you properly when you go and renew your driver license... <br/><br/>They can only «eat a brain» to feel, by stealing other people's thoughts. Which is a metaphor that means that they have no original thoughts, they try to be someone else. They are people who are not themselves, people who are slaves to the thoughts of other people, who cannot be «free». <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, R walks in the airport, goes through a metal detector with a TSA zombie who is still doing his job, not unlike an actual TSA worker... As R describes his «life»; walking around, not talking to anyone, looking at the ground,stuck in his own little bubble, he wonders how things were before the Zombie Apocalypse... And the next scene shows that things were EXACTLY THE SAME before... <br/><br/>Then comes the girl, who truly is alive. She is a true human being. She listens to no one but herself, she truly is free (from herself). The apathetic, emotionally dead young man, upon seeing her, begins to feel again. Anyone who has been emotionally dead at some point in his-her life, and then experienced true love, can relate to that. <br/><br/>The reality of our time is that about 85% of the population is brain- dead and emotionally drained to the point where they are basically non- human. Modern society destroyed us. A lot of those people were good kids, who could feel, who could love, but modern life got through them. Many just feel hopeless, they would love nothing more than to be human again. Others, are just plain scum, they have no more souls, they cannot be saved. <br/><br/>This movie was pure genius."

It's good that they still eat humans, but they also still have feelings, and I really liked the idea of a zombie eating a human brain and then they could see the memory's and everything that person has been through.

","Initially, I never really gave a thought for Warm Bodies until last week, when I read the book in a day, and immediately went out and bought the DVD afterwards. And I was very, very glad I did.<br/><br/>It's such a fresh and original take on the zombie genre. Up until now, I'd only ever seen zombies be brainless (pardon the pun), moaning and groaning, absolute dehumanised... things, really, and never a film from the perspective of the zombie them self. And yes, these zombies moan and groan too, but it's either funny (case in point, R and M's ""almost conversations""), or endearing when concerning R (is it weird to find a groan endearing?) <br/><br/>Nevertheless, R, played brilliantly by Nicholas Hoult, really is an endearing character. He's a zombie with a conscience - which is such an oxymoron that it's brilliant - which enables him to behave a little different to the rest. As his dialogue (not including the voice over) is minimal, we're mostly left to rely on his facial expressions for prompts, which I think Nicholas does so down to a T. His eyes say a lot. And I liked seeing his character develop, thanks to his interaction with Julie (played by Teresa Palmer). The relationship between the two mains is sweet, but not over done. And I think they're both capable enough in themselves that neither of them ever seems ""weak"" - vulnerable, yes, but not weak. The chemistry between the two is nice as well. The scenes with them in the plane I thought were especially good. The voice-over was a nice touch, because without it, well, we'd be a little lost between moans and groans until things begin to develop a little later on. It's also pretty humorous, and helps to lighten the atmosphere of the film as a whole, I think.<br/><br/>It's clever, too. There are deeper issues to this film that render it with a good sense of substance. The social commentary included that shows the zombies are really only what they are because of their loss of their own humanity. I loved the symbolism. And personally, I liked the homage paid to Romeo and Juliet. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, and it stays relatively true to the book, which is great. I would have liked to have seen more scenes translated from book to film, but I understand that obviously, not everything can be included.<br/><br/>One of my favourite films of 2013, so far. Definitely give it a go!"

","Zombie movies are a dime a dozen right now. This charming little mix of action, horror, and a love story changes things up a bit. It provides a satisfying experience, yet left me surprised there wasn't more funny parts.<br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" tells the tale of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult). R spends his days wandering through an airport aimlessly. One day he saves a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) from an attack by the walking dead. The two become unlikely friends, which appears to restore R's humanity over time. Have they discovered a way to bring the zombie masses back to life?<br/><br/>As a whole, ""Warm Bodies"" works. I have to say I was expecting more humor than I got. While it was funny, it fell short of delivering the grins trailers promised. Director / Writer Jonathan Levine did a great job with creating a bond between the two lead characters. However, Julie accepts the fact that R ate her boyfriend way too casually.<br/><br/>The zombie carnage and gory imagery isn't downplayed anywhere near as much as one would expect in an adaptation of a young adult novel rated PG-13. There's plenty of scenes of the living dead eating dinner. Creatures called ""Bonies"" also offer a higher level of horror than what one would expect from a zombie romance / comedy.<br/><br/>Although ""Warm Bodies"" doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting, it's still an entertaining and warm film. It's a less campy and more serious mix of 1993's ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and ""I Am Legend."" There's something for horror fans and romantics to enjoy in this movie."
"GameBoyAlexander","7","0","0","24 March 2013"," Definitely not the new twilight, take that however you wish
","In case the summary caught your attention let me explain. A lot of people where expecting this movie to be the new tween supernatural romance flick ala Twilight now that the series is done with making movies. Whether you want it to be or not Warm Bodies is NOT a twilight movie. In fact it's almost a parody of the twilight-esc genre that apparently exists now. If you knew about this movie and didn't expect the next twilight you where probably expecting the next shaun of the dead and well... it's not really that either. Most of the observational humor on the zombie genre is given at the beginning of the movie and then that's kind of it. Shean of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies in it. Warm bodies is romeo and juliet except romeo is a zombie. Seriously the zombie's name is R and the girl's name julie.<br/><br/>To be honest it's really not that bad, it stays funny the whole first act then slips into romantic territory for the second, but not twilight romantic where absolute jack sh** is happening between the two lovers except sexual tension and stupidity, but more of the romantic comedy style that this movie is trying to be so that's nice. And the third blends the comedy and romance with a bit of zombie flick action. The whole thing is a bit too cutsie poo for horror fans and a bit too scary for kids so there's a pretty small demographic for this movie but I'd recommend it none the less."
"zardoz-13","10","4","12","9 February 2013"," Zombie Makeover Movie
","When Hollywood started making zombie movies, filmmakers used voodoo as the means of controlling the dead. The first genuine zombie flick, ""White Zombie"" (1932), featured Bela Lugosi of ""Dracula"" infamy as a sinister zombie master who owns a sugar cane plantation and exploits zombies as his labor force. While most zombie movies were set in the West Indies, Hollywood didn't confine its sub-genre of the horror movie strictly to the Caribbean. For example, ""Revolt of the Zombies"" took place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, standard-issue zombie movies, such as ""King of the Zombies"" (1941), ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1943), and ""Zombies on Broadway"" (1936), clung to the traditional Caribbean setting. Meantime, ""Revenge of the Zombies"" (1943) occurred in Louisiana. A fiendish Nazi scientist toiled to forge zombies to supplement the ranks of Hitler's Third Reich. Occasionally, exceptions to the rule cropped up, like the first Caped Crusader serial ""Batman"" (1943) where a devilish Japanese spy on American soil converted individuals into mindless zombies by means of electricity. Apparently, nobody felt like experimenting drastically with the zombie formula, aside from relocating them beyond the West Indies.<br/><br/>Pittsburgh-based writer & director George A. Romero re-imagined the zombie formula in 1968 with his classic chiller ""Night of the Living Dead."" Ironically, nothing like a global apocalypse had spawned zombies until Romero conjured up such a notion. Romeo's zombie slayers aimed for the head when they shot zombies. The next change came about courtesy of the Italian-made epic ""Nightmare City"" (1980) where zombies no longer lurched about but now ran like track superstars. Aside from this minor formula tweaking, the biggest difference in post ""Night of the Living Dead"" zombie sagas has been the use of either an apocalypse or a virus to trigger an outbreak of zombie-mania. Just when you thought zombie films were stuck in a rut, Hollywood brought Seattle-based writer Isaac Marion's novel ""Warm Bodies"" to the screen, and movies about the undead will no longer will be the same. Simon and Schuster published the inventive book in 2010.<br/><br/>""50/50"" writer & director Jonathan Levine's adaptation of Marion's ""Warm Bodies"" is surprisingly captivating. A comparison between what occurs on screen and in Marion's book suggests Levine took minimal liberties with the source material. This innovative makeover of a moribund genre takes matters beyond anything that either ""Zombieland"" or the ""Resident Evil"" franchise has tried in terms of permutation. Basically, ""Warm Bodies"" takes zombie movies to the next level that gore-hound purists may not appreciate. Levine doesn't pile up gratuitous amounts of blood and gore with shocking revelations to keep you stimulated. Sure, zombies feed on the living, and they prefer the brain as an entrée.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Levine doesn't make a spectacle out of gut-munching for the sake of gut-munching. He obscures the feeding frenzy to accommodate a PG-13 rating. First, the ""Warm Bodies"" zombies consume brains to experience the memories of those they've slain. They just don't eat brains for no reason. The idea you can derive knowledge from the consumption of an opponent's gray matter is fanciful. Some cultures have argued eating the heart of an antagonist imparts strength to the victor. Second, ""Warm Bodies"" has classified zombies as either good or bad. Previously, all zombies were bad. Creating a division between good and evil zombies endows the genre with greater sophistication. In the ""Warm Bodies"" universe, bonies are the bad zombies. Bonies are zombies who tear the skin off their bodies and resembled mummified skeletons. They move like lightning and they are treacherous. They feast on the living as well as some of the dead. They are reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's sword-wielding skeletons in the 1963 fantasy ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Following Marion's lead, Levine has appropriated virtually everything else from the genre but cleverly has reconstituted the subject matter.<br/><br/>Basically, Levine has synthesized the traditional zombie movie with a romantic comedy. Like its literary source material, ""Warm Bodies"" makes allusions to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" Indeed, there is even a brief balcony scene, though nothing like the Shakespeare version. Our hero, a zombie known only as R (Nicholas Hoult of ""X-Men: First Class"") because he cannot remember his name, has spent most of the last eight years gnawing on humans. When he doesn't join his dead pals, like M (Rob Corddry), for group hunting trips, he enjoys his vinyl collection on a stereo in a derelict commercial jetliner. You see, he holes up in an abandoned plane. All the zombies congregate at the local airport. Similarly, zombies in both George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) and Zack Snyder's 2004 remake gravitated toward a shopping mall. After they became zombies, they were drawn by memories of the good times that they had had when they shopped together there. Our lovesick zombie falls big-time for a young female zombie fighter, Julie (Teresa Palmer of ""I Am Number Four""), after he chomps her boyfriend Perry's brain.<br/><br/>Perry (David Franco), Julie, Nora (Analeigh Tipton), and others had left their heavily-fortified camp to scavenge the zombie infested outskirts of their fallen city for medical supplies. When the zombies storm the medical supply room, R kills Perry, chews his brain, and feels smitten by Julie since he is seeing her from Perry's perspective. Incredibly, these sentiments of love reanimate his heart. Now, R swears to protect Julie from the rest of his kind. He escorts her back to his jetliner, and they grow to love each other. According to this imaginative premise, biting into brains has the side effect of giving the undead a cerebral blast from the past. If you shun run-of-the-mill zombie movies, ""Warm Bodies"" may change your attitude toward Z-pictures. This off-beat epic unites the living and the dead as allies in their collective war against the wicked bonies. The happily ever after ending may curdle in the mouths of zombie purists. Nevertheless, ""Warm Bodies"" qualifies as the best thing that has happened to zombie movies since George A. Romero."

"DICK STEEL","10","3","9","23 March 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Warm Bodies
","With werewolves and vampires hogging the cinema screens in the last few years under romantic genres, perhaps it is timely now to explore if zombies can fit into the same picture as well, and being a more interesting prospect at that since there's no icky bestiality involved, nor necessary have to be uber-sexy and charming like a vampire should be. Zombies are basically rotten walking corpses of the undead, lumbering – or in recent times, running - around seeking out humans for food, with a preference to feast on human brains as a delicacy. They're easy to put away with conventional rounds into the head, unlike werewolves and vampires that require specialized skills and weapons, so they go around in hordes where strength in numbers tend to overwhelm. <br/><br/>Then came writer Isaac Mario and his idea for his novel, to get into the shoes of the other side, and walk around in them for a little. As far as I recall, not since Fido had we a cinematic zombie who tried his darnedest best to assimilate back into the life of a human, with thoughts still lingering about filling an intense void in the unbeating heart of his. Zombies can hardly talk, save for the occasional grunts, and what director Jonathan Levine managed to do, is to have the film's narration peek into the thinking head of R (Nicholas Hoult), a zombie who is experiencing existentialism issues, and providing us a quick update into the rules of the game in which Warm Bodies operate under. <br/><br/>And no, there's no sparkling nonsense under sunlight. What was proposed were highly feasible and worthy addition to the zombie canon, where the first person perspective here provides us with that up close and personal look at the dilemma of being an undead, where the feasting of humans, and their brains specifically, allows for the zombies to momentarily adopt the memories of those they are consuming, and allowing them that slightest chance to feel alive again. If that's the case, then I don't see why they behave the way they do, with that dietary preference. And for those who are zombies for long, they eventually lose all sense of humanity and become skeletons, whose sole objective is to feast. And there were a number of essential presentations that just serve to enhance those parameters the narrative has to operate within.<br/><br/>The story truly begins when R, on a feasting hunt, meets up with a surviving bunch of humans outside of their walled city to look for medicine, and smitten by Julie (Teresa Palmer), takes her under his wing to keep her safe, as well as the ulterior motive of romancing the girl. Conveniently living aboard a jetliner at the airport, which provides that airtight condition to keep her human scent from other zombies, close proximity with only each other meant plenty of opportunities to get to know the other party, and who would have known, fall in love. It's a modern day Romeo & Juliet story set against a zombie apocalypse backdrop, with that instantly recognizable token balcony scene to boot, that would set the hearts of romantic die- hards aflutter, since adversary comes in the form of Julie's dad Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich).<br/><br/>In this love conquering all tale, Levine perhaps wanted to tell the tale of how love provides the key to what would be a seemingly hopeless situation, especially amongst those ""Zombiefied"" amongst us who live life as soulless routines. There never was any attempts so far to suggest how zombies could revert to human form, and this story had the audacity to do just that, making that bold statement to set it apart from the competition. Between the two leads of Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, clearly Hoult is now seeing his star shining brighter, with lead roles here and in other blockbusters like Jack the Giant Slayer, cementing his status to heartthrob levels with his boyish charm on the big screen. With the material, he did his best rendition of the lumbering, awkward zombie R who finds his heart getting warmer and his mannerisms slowly giving way to become more human like. Palmer didn't have much to do as the damsel usually in distress, though having moments to show she's no pushover as well. But ultimately it's a role that could have been played by any other starlet, save for her solid chemistry opposite Hoult.<br/><br/>As far as romantic stories go that has classical monsters as one of the other significant half, Warm Bodies proves to be a sheer winner for its romance and comedy, together with its eclectic selection of pop tunes that make up its soundtrack. As a fan of Rob Corddry, I have to make note of his supporting role here that came as a surprise to have been a little bit more than expected, but I'm not complaining. Warm Bodies has enough heart that makes this a zombie love story like none other. Fans of the romance genre should lap this one up as well, as it comes with that stamp of recommended approval!"

I'm trying very hard not to be too much of a spoiler here but I do think everyone knows that ""love is definitely in the air"" in this movie. And, as we all know, love changes everything. (giggle)"

","Maybe I'm cynical. Maybe I'm just cold. Either way this movie sucked the life out of me.<br/><br/>The movie stars ""R"", a Zombie (played by Nicholas Hoult) who displays affection for Julie, (played by Teresa Palmer) a human girl whom he captured in a search for food. The more he falls for this girl the more human traits he begins to develop until he himself becomes human.<br/><br/>The concept of the movie itself is actually pretty interesting and kept me engaged just enough to see it to the end. With that being said, only clocking in at about an hour and a half, this was probably one of the LONGEST movies I have ever seen. Every scene could be predicted as soon as the plot reveals itself, and all of the characters portrayed are very 2-dimensional. What may have started as a interesting concept quickly becomes one of your usual ""boy meets girl plot-lines"" found in all romantic comedies. All characters beside R and Julie are only there to move the plot along and seem to have no lives or motives of their own. And every attempt at a comedic moment does nothing but register a pity laugh, because nearly all of the jokes fell flat.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the movie is that Julie, the romantic interest, is the most helpless character in the entire film. Her inability to defend herself or her compliance to do whatever R tells her to do is beyond any rational mind. She was raised to hate zombies, her boyfriend was eaten by zombies, she has to scavenge for food and supplies because of zombies, yet she has the audacity to fall for a zombie after 3 days of capture. My head hurts from just thinking about it...<br/><br/>All in all this movie is nothing but average. It reeks of a reused plot line, 2-dimensional characters, standard movie clichés, and a sub- par script. As I said before the concept could have made this a great movie, but it was executed so poorly that it solely exists for you to give it a chance."
"teacher_writing","1","2","5","6 September 2013"," Seriously Deranged and Stupid
","First of all, a zombie who can't talk is articulately narrating the story, which doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Next, the zombies who can only shuffle around slowly while looking mentally brain-dead can suddenly break into a run to chase down the humans. Yeah, okay.<br/><br/>Here's the worst part: the zombie-protagonist EATS THE BRAINS of the the human-protagonist's boyfriend (That's the spoiler). You can actually see it happening. She doesn't cry, and then she presumably falls in love with the creep who did that? Okay, so I didn't get that far into the movie because I couldn't get past how sick and disturbing it was, both in image and concept.<br/><br/>What is wrong with people for actually liking this? I worry for humanity. I don't need to watch images of cannibals stuffing bloody human flesh into their mouths like animals and getting all over their faces and then watching enactments of people suddenly losing their ability to mourn their romantic partners in favor of falling in love with their gruesome murderers. I am not a holy roller, and I enjoy plenty of sci-fi, action, romance, foreign, independent, campy, and dramatic films, but mixing love and horror in this way doesn't work.<br/><br/>The fact that so many people rated this film highly does NOT make it okay or normal. Anyone who enjoys following such disgusting ideas has a mental problem."

","***may contain spoilers*** When I went to the cinema with my friends I kept thinking about how many other things I could be doing at that time instead of going to that ridiculous movie. When the movie started I was thinking, ""Brilliant, how long is this movie again?"" But as the movie progressed and I got familiar with the story line I began to enjoy it. I was really impressed with what they had done. I loved how it was Shakespeare related, especially the part when R goes to Julie's balcony(Romeo and Juliet, R and Julie). This is a great romance film for couples and a great suspenseful, horror movie for friends. If you are one of those people thinking this movie is lame and not worth your time I would greatly suggest giving this movie a chance. I have heard that the book is much darker and gruesome so I am going to have to find that book! Anyway, great movie, great cast, just a brilliant movie."
"patial93","9","2","5","18 May 2013"," The Cutest Zombie Movie ever
","Well, how do i start. If this movie can be compared to any animated pixar movie then it would be Wall-E. This is no zombie horror flick that you watch every now and then. Talking about the cast; Nicholas Hoult is a perfect choice for a zombie like this. I don't think any other actor would have been able to potray this heartful zombie. His face was perfect for the role and had its own cuteness. The actress did her part very well too. Nothing in the movie seemed to be pushed hard. There was nothing stupid done. From the beginning till the end, it was a very grasping movie indeed. The screenplay and the editing is well done indeed. The entire transition from a zombie to a human shown in the movie is quite commendable. For emotional folks like me who cry in almost every movie, this is indeed a great movie for you to watch. All the things that the zombie did to gain the human's trust and to bond with them again; all these little things shown in the movie tell us that the director has done a great job. The director has shown various types of emotions all throughout the movie and has given a message that in the end ""love prevails"". Love has the power to change everything. No matter how bad you are, love can change you in no time. So, in the end all i would say is that please please please, watch this movie with anyone you love; your family, your girlfriend, whoever you want. Its a complete entertainer from the start to the end. And this movie is nothing like the normal zombie movies, this is truly different. A much better movie than expected. If you are on a date the this is a perfect movie for you to go to. The cutest zombie movie ever. My rating is 9 out of 10. Awesome Just Awesome. :)"

"svicki","9","2","5","3 May 2013"," Loved It
","A clever concept which was executed brilliantly. Warm Bodies puts a twist on your everyday zombie movie featuring humor (some brilliant lines by Rob Corddry), a convincing emotional connection between the 2 main protagonists, R who is a (hot!) zombie and Julie who is a human, and a light-hearted yet in depth underlying idea relating to the power of love.<br/><br/>Warm bodies has a unique concept. I liked how instead of usually viewing zombies from a human perspective, we see the world through the eyes of a zombie straight from the first scene. This atmosphere made eating raw brains seem ordinary. I also enjoyed the idea that eating a human's brain could enable a zombie to gain memories of the brain's deceased owner. Very smart!<br/><br/>I genuinely enjoyed seeing the emotional development of R due to falling for Julie. I found myself rooting for them and yes, I did shed a few tears although this is not a big deal as I cry in literally every movie involving superficial sadness/love.<br/><br/>Many minor actions of R and the zombies may seem illogical and contradictory, but I think this was intentional to further emphasize their development from zombie to human . E.g. Initially, R states clearly how slow he moves yet at the end he is running pretty fast. If you observe closely, throughout the movie, his movements and words slowly become more and more humane which is logical as he himself is beginning to turn human again.<br/><br/>One flaw was the lack of authentic plot twists. The trailer gave most of the movie away (and unfortunately most of the funny lines), which in turn made the plot predictable. But I guess I am still a kid at heart who loves happy endings so I enjoyed knowing the conflicts would conclude positively.<br/><br/>Overall, an intriguing romantic comedy. I would recommend it mainly for it's unique concept and genre (zom-rom-com?).<br/><br/>If you're skeptical, give it a try! If you're looking for more serious zombie action, you'll be disappointed."
"tequila101","9","2","5","25 April 2013"," A Fantastically, Well-made Zombie Dramedy Flick which Represents New Elements
","Stating from the above summary title, that pretty much sums up what I thought of Warm Bodies. It wasn't my initial thought but when I went in and then walked out of it, I found that my perspective was of something I have just mentioned in the summary. Warm Bodies which is a modern take on of the Zombie sub-genre of Horror manages to pack quite a punch with its great acting and characters alongside it's excellent story and themes whilst showing us how good some Horror films can still be in this age today.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film that I thought stood out was the ""About a Boy"" and ""Skins"" actor, Nicholas Holt. He was perfect for the role and for very good reason. *SPOLIER ALERTS* (If you haven't seen the film, please don't read on). He gives the character life in all aspects of his changing form into becoming human. On the other side of the spectrum, the reason that he gives this character a true nature and great entity of life is because of how he portrays him. He portrays him as a sympathetic character who tries to live with what he's got. I really enjoyed his performance because he put much effort into it so he could make it look as realistic, sympathetic and as creepy as possible. The other actors and actresses did a stunning job as well, but I still think Holt takes the medal here.<br/><br/>One fact to touch upon is the CGI with those skeleton like beings. I wished that they had maybe used material or non computerized technology. That was a point or element which could have been more scary, however they decided to skip it. It wasn't a major issue but it just would have been good to not use CGI there.<br/><br/>I thought the combined sequences of action, drama, horror and comedy alongside the vividly detailed, and well paced plot helped the film greatly to stay in touch with me as a viewer so I could care about what was happening with our main protagonists and what perils and dangerous situations they got themselves into.<br/><br/>The element I found the most interesting and fascinating however in this modern zombie flick was how they treated the sub-genre. In many zombie films of the past which consist of Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Dead Snow, the zombie genre just continued to improve entities from before and become scary. At this moment, I'd say that Warm Bodies takes that place at enclosing and expressing the full entity of the sub genre. In the film, the zombies start to slowly turn human when they either eat human brains or have personal connections with the living. Later on throughout the film, Nicholas Holt's character ""R"", starts to fall asleep, have dreams and then finally bleeds. It really showed what the director was doing and where he wanted to take the direction of the zombie concepts and film in general. I believe that the aspects of a zombie slowly becoming human is a great one for the sub genre because it kicks new ideas to a whole new level now.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe Warm Bodies is a film that shouldn't be missed in the cinemas. It's fun, it's bloody, it's beautiful, it's lovable, it's legendary in it's roots of the zombie genre and it's just damn creative. I highly recommend it. 9/10"
"dr-monideepa","8","2","5","20 April 2013"," Warm Bodies, a warm zom com
","director Jonathan Levine has done a fine job with this one. initially i was apprehensive about going for this movie as it was being distributed by summit entertainment (we all know how dreadful the twilight saga was).i decided to go anyway, but once the movie started i was relieved as it was a very fresh and different flick. new fresh faces of Nicholas Hoult (who plays R, the zombie) and Teresa Palmer (who plays Julie,R's love interest,HUMAN!) have done a splendid job.<br/><br/>Rob Corddry as M (R's best zombie buddy) does a superlative job. (i personally feel he's one of the best actors for a comic role at present. his witty sense of humor adds the extra zing the movie needed.<br/><br/>Dave Franco, the younger brother of James Franco, is slowly rising as the next big young star. he was seen in a small role in the movie Fright Night. he has a small but important role in this movie. he plays Perry ,Julie's fiancé who is initially scared of zombies and hates them as the zombie plague claimed his dad.<br/><br/>the next star in the movie is a big one, John Malkovich! he plays the stone cold col. grigio. it was good to see him in this role after is last brief venture( the disappointing Transformers: Dark Of The Moon) i mean what was he thinking? . but he adds the serious touch in the movie. as zombies killed his wife he wants to kill all the zombies (in short hates them to the core)<br/><br/>Analeigh Tipton as Nora, Julie's best friend, is sweet and does justice to her brief role.<br/><br/>Cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is very modern.<br/><br/>the story is inspired from the book by Isaac Marion 'Warm Bodies'.<br/><br/>so the film focuses on the development of the relationship between Julie, a young woman, and ""R"", a zombie, and how their eventual romance develops throughout. The film is noted for displaying human characteristics in zombie characters, and for being told from a zombie's perspective.<br/><br/>R is a young zombie who has no idea about how the zombie breakout took place (or when it happened), his age, even his name!!! his best friend is M(Marcus), yes a zombie, they at their normal hangout place- the airport and they 'almost' have conversations. (their conversations don't go beyond 'hhhhuummmhh' hhhhhhhhnnnn' 'hhm?'). so R's life is pretty much boring. but one day while searching for food they come across Perry,Julie and Nora and a few others. while R kills Perry, he falls in love with Julie and saves her from other zombies and takes her to his crib (an airplane) he falls head over heels for her. Julie too starts thinking he's different. his new found feelings slowly changes him from zombie to human. and this in-turn changes M and other zombies too (their hearts beat,they start speaking clearly(well somewhat),they start having dreams etc etc. but R confesses to Julie that he killed Perry and she leaves. <br/><br/>how he travels to win her back and together with the help of Nora, M and zombie and human armies defeat Boneys(zombies which can't be changed back, they eat anything with a heartbeat) and convince Col. Grigio that zombies can be changed back to humans forms the rest of the story.<br/><br/>as a whole the movie is a perfect date movie and single people can enjoy it as well....it is that movie that you can watch and lighten up. i'd give it 8 on 10."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","2","5","10 April 2013"," Such a heartwarming tale...
","Zombie meets girl, zombie eats brains of girl's boyfriend, zombie saves girl from other zombies and romance blooms. In this unique genre mashup of 'zom-rom-com', Nicholas Hoult plays a monosyllabic zombie with no memory of his name (only that it started with an 'R'...or ""aah"", as he puts it), nor his past life. With only a grunt here or a few words there, Hoult's able to express a lot while portraying a pale, scarred, slouching, shuffling corpse (also notable: his zombie 'run' and impressive ability to not blink). Unlike in a lot of films, where the narration gets on your nerves, the voice-over here is part of the film's charm. Hearing what R is thinking lets us know exactly what's going on inside his head since he's unable to express it verbally. A lot of the film's humour comes from Hoult's dead-pan delivery, as he makes wry observations regarding the slow movement of zombies, his hoodie-wearing and 'conversations' with his fellow zombies.<br/><br/>The film gets to the point pretty quickly when a group of survivors searching for supplies encounters R. It's here that he meets resistance fighter, Julie (played by terrific Aussie actress, Teresa Palmer, who always makes the most of her roles, but has sadly felt underutilised in some subpar films. Thankfully, this isn't one of those). Seeing Julie (understandably) kick-starts R's long dead heart, and this is before he feeds on the grey matter of her boyfriend, Perry (absorbing his memories in the process). Julie awakens something inside R. Not just his heartbeat, but his feelings/emotions/humanity as well. Unlike some other so-called 'heroines' in supernatural/romance films, Julie is freaked out by R, showing vulnerability/fear as any sane person would when confronted by the undead. To keep her safe, he takes her back to his 'home' (an abandoned plane at the airport). Although she's cautious (and takes advantage of several chances to run), here begins the blossoming relationship between zombie and human girl, as they bond over R's collection of old vinyl records, among other things. While some may roll their eyes at this, that would be rather short-sighted/selling the film short, as it manages to make this unconventional 'love story' actually feel believable.<br/><br/>It's not just a case of ""Well, you ate my boyfriend's brains...let's kiss!"", Julie is a kick-arse girl who can more than handle herself, as evidenced by her fending off zombies with a weed-whacker and shooting them while on the run (and shooting WELL, it must be noted). She also shows smarts, not being all zombiephobe like her father, nor trusting R fully from the get-go. She understands that R saved her, but is also determined that she isn't going to remain holed up on his plane forever either. It's nice to see a well-rounded, smart, kick-arse girl in a zombie movie. The montage of the pair's blossoming romance is really well done (the fact that Hoult and Palmer have great chemistry helps a lot). The film has just the right amount of humour sprinkled throughout (keep an eye out for Teresa Palmer's comedic skills when R instructs her to 'walk like a zombie' to blend in when they're surrounded by other zombies. Julie's zombie impression is quite hilarious).<br/><br/>However, the movie's not without its dark moments, however. Considering the film's rating, its beginning is surprisingly gruesome (like when we learn what 'Boneys/Bonies' are) and there's no shying away from what zombies do best: eating brains (R's shown snacking on his supply of Perry's brains from time to time). There's the perfect balance of light/dark moments and some amusing nods to 'tropes' in these sorts of film, like the balcony scene between R/Julie referencing Romeo & Juliet or when Julie and her friend, Nora (Analeigh Tipton, who also displays great comic timing/provides quite a bit of the film's humour and isn't annoying like some 'best friend' roles tend to be), give R a makeover so he can pass as human while 'Pretty Woman' is played (though is cut short). The other great supporting character is R's best friend, M (Rob Corddry), who eventually regains his memories/humanity along with other zombies. The choice of music and how it's used throughout the film is also excellent.<br/><br/>There were just a couple of characters/actors who failed to live up to the rest. I can't say John Malkovich (who plays Julie's father) nor Dave Franco (who plays ill-fated Perry) left much of an impression (the former just seemed bored throughout the film while the latter's character made it rather understandable how Julie could seemingly 'move on quickly' from him following his demise). The film is just the right length of time, not being overlong (which is a blessing these days, given all the films that overstay their welcome), but not feeling 'rushed' either. While the film's pace may seem as slow as a shuffling zombie to some, it is in fact taking the time to properly focus on developing its central characters and doesn't just throw in needless action scenes just for the sake of it, thus making you actually *care* what happens to the characters. I very much enjoyed this film, and if you ignore the haters (and those likening it to the Twilight Saga), you too might just find yourself enjoying it as much as zombies enjoy brains."
"dan-rittenhouse","8","2","5","20 February 2013"," Warm Bodies is a great romantic movie with an added twist of zombies
","""Warm Bodies"" successfully brings together comedy, romance, and zombies. Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, the movie tells the tale of zombies coming back to life through the power of love. While the whole story is very cheesy, it is still very entertaining. The story is told through the thoughts of R, describing the daily routines of a zombie who doesn't remember much of his past life. <br/><br/>The acting in ""Warm Bodies"" is superb. Nicholas Hoult, who plays R, is excellent at portraying the quirky young zombie. His facial expressions really tell the whole story of the movie. It is amazing how much can be said without words. Julie, played by Teresa Palmer, is the tomboyish human love interest of R. Her emotions vary wildly, from the loving daddy's girl, to the emotionless zombie killer, and everywhere in between. The emotional interactions between the characters of R and Julie give a sense of realism, with Julie starting off terrified of her captor, but eventually trusting him to lead her to safety, and finally falling in love with him.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is very dim. The broken down airport, the abandoned houses, and the depression era Hooverville appearance of the human settlement represent the deteriorating state of the world as it is overrun by zombies. Yet there are also scenes of open fields and sunny days that bring back the romantic side of the movie. The costumes and make up for the movie are all well done. Each zombie looks as if they have truly died, many with scars all over their bodies. Their clothes are all ripped and blood stained. There are also animated zombies, known as Bonies, that have their flesh peeled off. The animation done for these monsters is well done, including lifelike movements that instill fear. The humans, while not as bad as the zombies, also have an appearance of living a rough life. <br/><br/>All of the concepts that make a good movie are present within this picture. ""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that contains a little bit of something for everybody, whether it is a romantic tale, a light hearted comedy, or an action filled zombie thriller. It is recommended to see this movie because no matter who you are, you will find something in it that you like."
"robot-zombie-dinosaur","8","2","5","19 February 2013"," Weird premise, awesome movie
","I have not read the book so I didn't quite know what to expect from a zombie meets girl love story, but I had heard good things so I decided to give it a shot. Which was definitely a great decision; I was laughing my head off from basically the first second of the movie. The story is an amazingly refreshing twist on the zombie genre; it totally flips the script. I had no idea how they were going to make a zombie come across as sympathetic, but the voice over element is genius and hilarious. <br/><br/>Despite the obviously high-quality source material, the whole thing easily could have been a disaster if not for a brilliant performance from Nicholas Hoult, who plays the zombie protagonist simply known as R. Even with extremely restricted dialogue, facial expressions and body language, he still manages to convey an impressive range of emotions and elicit audience sympathy. <br/><br/>In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit that I have been a huge fan of his ever since ""Skins""; anyone who has seen that show knows that Hoult is a fan-freaking-tastic dramatic actor, which is obvious in this movie as well. But I was even more impressed with his comedy chops; between him and Rob Corddry (who plays R's best zombie friend and is also amazing)I was cracking up all over the place. <br/><br/>Also little miss Analeigh Tipton (who I will never not associate with America's Next Top Model, sorry) was super likable as the leading lady's best (human) friend Nora. Like, I don't even know if she is a good actor or not; she just has such a charming and magnetic personality that I want to be her BFF. <br/><br/>Yes, John Malkovich obviously deserved more screen time and Dave Franco deserved less, in my opinion (which it pains me to admit, since I do love me some Franco), but the only real issue I had was with Teresa Palmer as the love interest Julie. Granted, she didn't have much to do besides act perplexed by R's strange, un-zombie-like behavior, but she basically struck me as a blonde Kristen Stewart, frowning and sighing and eyebrow-furrowing her way through the movie. <br/><br/>This, by the way, is the one and only valid comparison between Warm Bodies and Twilight; despite any superficial similarities the two are not actually alike in any way so do not under any circumstances let that put you off, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice in avoiding this movie for that reason. <br/><br/>So yeah, basically it's funny and poignant and suspenseful and a little bit creepy and a little bit cheesy, and basically just generally adorable. I loved it a lot and I think you probably will, too."
"mdnobles19","8","2","5","17 February 2013"," Unique, fun, charming spin on horror/comedy tropes
","Not since Zombieland has a horror/comedy been this much fun and charming. It was surprisingly poignant in some scenes and hilarious in others thanks to a sharp as a dagger adapted screenplay, from the novel by Isaac Marion. Jonathan Levine is on a winning streak and to me he is almost like a John Hughes of horror filmmaking as he seems so in touch with his viewing audience. The story combines in a well-balanced way with a star crossed lover's story, a zombie apocalyptic story and a comedy all wrapped up neatly in the most humane way possible. Warm Bodies is the first solid, wide released genre picture that cleanses away the bad after taste of the other genre bending horror efforts at the beginning of this year.<br/><br/>The performances were chemistry filled and nails it so much better than the asinine Twilight films could ever do, thanks to a great director and his adapted screenplay. The film stars Australian beauty Teresa Palmer, who can still be mesmerizing even when she says nothing, she can probably have chemistry with just about anyone or thing. Teresa plays Julie, one of the surviving humans of a now dying and zombie infested world. When several zombies ambush Julie, her boyfriend Perry, played by James Franco little bro Dave Franco, and her best friend, played by charming and promising newcomer Analeigh Tipton, it results in the death of her boyfriend. Julie is now stuck with the zombies and loses contact with her friend and family. She has a change of heart when one of the zombies spares her and saves her from danger. Julie starts to form a connection with one of the zombies, R who is played to a tee by former child star Nicholas Hoult from About a Boy. Nicholas is establishing quite an impressive start so far a leading man. Who knew that a romantic horror/comedy with zombies can have such rich characters with a meaningful message, that if we all come together and unite we can make a positive change.<br/><br/>Writer and Director, Jonathan Levin has made a breakthrough horror/comedy with Warm Bodies and hopefully more horror, genre bending efforts in the future. The was such a nice surprise considering that I had no hopes for it and zero interest in seeing it when I first heard about it. It's a shame that this film got such a better and fair release and start than his chopped up and deserted first effort, All of the Boys Love Mandy Lane, for which put Amber Heard on the map. Since his shaky start in 2006, Jonathan Levin finally gets his break with 50/50 and now Warm Bodies. Jonathan's talent as a director and writer is definitely relevant to today's culture and I can't wait to see his next handcrafted gem.<br/><br/>Overall, Warm Bodies will touch you, make you squirm on the edge of your seat, make you laugh, liven your spirit and enlighten you with its thoughtfulness. Not too many horror/comedies have those abilities, making the film a potential cult classic in the making, a movie men and woman alike can sit down and enjoy together. Recommended!"
"avillone21","8","2","5","17 February 2013"," The best (and probably only) rom-com-zombie movie!
","Last Sunday, the second half of ""The Walking Dead"" premiered on AMC. Watching the show, you see many zombies being shot, stabbed, decapitated, etc. They are lifeless, have no soul, and have no remorse.<br/><br/>People love zombie plots. ""Warm Bodies"" is a terrific addition to the zombie film category, because it adds so much originality. The film takes on the point-of-view of the zombie R(Nicholas Hoult), something that has never really been seen in film before. R walks around his post-apocalyptic city with several others who have been turned doing the same routine. Some days he just walks around hopelessly, and others he searches for food in an outskirt of the city. He has a friend he ""communicates"" with, named M. He also has a hideout of his own he stays in, an a nearby airplane that he keeps collectibles.<br/><br/>One day, R, M, and a pack of zombies walk on the outskirt of town to find humans to feed on. R does not want to, but he needs to survive on it. He feels conflicted about it, but still needs to feed. He comes across a group of humans trying to get medical supplies for their base. After one(Dave Franco) tries to shoot him, R instantly kills him. R likes to eat the brains of the humans, because then he gets to feel human and live their past memories all the way up until their demise. He sees memories with a girl(Teresa Palmer)that seemed to be his girlfriend. R instantly falls in love with her, and he somehow gets part of a human heartbeat going again. He looks forward to see that this girl is actually part of this pack of humans. He puts some blood on her and is able to somewhat communicate that she should follow him and he'll keep her safe.<br/><br/>The girl, Julie, is obviously cautious. She has never seen a zombie communicate, for her father(John Malkovich) leads the pack of humans and has them believing their is never any hope left for the turned humans. Julie is brought with R to his airplane hideout, and he plans to keep her safe.<br/><br/>Every scene with Julie and R is done so well. They have such a chemistry together, even for a zombie and human. Many people have been comparing the film to ""Twilight."" This is nothing like ""Twilight,""for that movie was about a girl's conflictions to fall in love with a supernatural being. ""Warm Bodies"" is about a zombie being able to fix the zombie race because of his love for a human. I did find the film a little short, for I wished the film would continue. The ending is wonderful, and will leave you smiling.<br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" is probably the best romantic comedy out right now you could see. Go see it and discover an original film with a concept that may seem ridiculous, and turns out brilliantly."

","Rare is the chick flick that a guy can go for, or a guy film that his gal will also tear up for. This movie does both at the same time with wit, comedy, a touch of horror.. and does it all in a storyline that is both familiar and at the same time novel.<br/><br/>At its core, this is a zombie-boy meets girl, falls for girl, loses girl when zombie-boy reveals he ate her first boyfriend, then wins girl again by rescuing her... and ends up becoming a real boy. Their love saga in turn sparks a renewal of all humanity.<br/><br/>Within the film are lots of fun spoofs of the Zombie genre, narrated by the boy about the dreary nature of life after the Apocalypse.

","I really liked this movie because it was not based on death and violence for the entire thing! Usually zombie movies have a lot to do with death, and even though there was death in the movie, it was touching that the one thing that could save the Zombies was love and interaction with other people. I thought that was great and a good message for teens, which is who I feel this movie is meant for. It's funny, well written, creative and the acting and makeup is pretty good too! I would suggest you go see this is you want to see a light hearted movie that is fun and cute, but not if you are looking for a gory Zombie flick. There is minimal swearing and obscene gestures. It's pretty G rated as far as movies go now a days!!"
"alec13-342-619712","8","2","5","2 February 2013"," Pretty good and funny movie
","Warm Bodies was a really great film, based on the book this film adaption is much funnier than the horrific book. Nicholous Hoult stars as R who is a zombie who hates being one. But then when a female zombie hunter tries to kill him he falls in love with her immediately, and he starts to heal and turn back into a human and so do all the zombies too. This is basically the new Twilight accept zombie romance than vampire romance. I also found this film better than the Twilight series (Considering Warm Bodies comedy) is a horror/comedy. There is also some entertaining action scenes compared to Twilight so this movie would also be good if you want to bring someone who doesn't like romance that much. This movie was just one of those feel good comedies that just make you sit back and relax and in my opinion, I never got bored at any point accept the credits. Overall, this was a great film, and I had to choose between this and other good films such as Mama, but I decided to watch Warm Bodies (Mostly because I'm a sucker for PG-13 comedies like this) This film would also probably be good if it were in 3D because there is a lot of up close zombie violence that is very fun to watch. Take my opinion, WATCH THIS MOVIE!"

"Coventry","4","2","6","4 November 2015"," A Zom-Rom-Com Do we really need those?
","I don't like zombie comedies, and I especially don't like zombie comedies in which the zombies can think, feel, talk or – god forbid – slowly transform back into human beings again! I often wonder how far nowadays directors can and will go exploiting the concept of zombie comedies even further. The days of George A. Romero's original zombie trilogy are long over and nail-biting suspense has gradually turned into absurd comedy and annoyingly ambitious story lines. The majority of zombie comedies are pretty lame, with some notable exceptions of movies that accomplished something particularly refreshing or innovative, like for example ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Fido"" and ""Wasting Away"". ""Warm Bodies"" is definitely also one of the more watchable zombie comedies out there, but this is merely thanks to the solid directing of Jonathan Levine and the excellent performances of Nicolas Hoult and Theresa Palmer, rather than to the dire and derivative subject matter. Following a not specifically mentioned type of catastrophe, 99% of the world's population turned into zombies while the last remaining human survivors entrench themselves in a fortress and listen to the orders of John Malkovich. But the shuffling zombies here are quite different than the usual type of braindead monsters, as they somehow still have remnants of emotions and intelligence left in them. The young R – he can't remember the rest of his name – lives at an airport where he cozily decorated his own private plane and he manages to contemplate about his life (or, better yet, his death) and even produce a few words. During one of his quests for human brains to feed on, R falls head over heels for the tough chick Julie. He munches Julie's boyfriend's brains – and memories – but rescues her and bonds with her in his airplane. Problem remains, of course, that R is a corpse and Julie is the daughter of the leader of the human resistance fighters. ""Warm Bodies"" contains a handful of really good ideas and – it has to be said – R's monologues are extremely witty. It's hilarious to finally hear zombies say about themselves stuff like ""God, we move slow!"" After an enjoyable first half, the film becomes dull and ordinary. The sequences with the skeletons or ""Bonies"" (zombies in a final state of decay and completely devoid of emotions) are downright pathetic, because of the unfitting violent tone and the miserably bad CGI-effects. The fairy-tale climax is as soft and weak as you would expect from a zom-rom-com"

"jaxbubba","5","2","6","12 April 2013"," Zombie Romeo and Juliet
","I have to admit that it actually took me two sittings to finally get through this film; however, once you get past the utterly preposterous plot premise of this film, the movie turns out to be kind of cute in the most ridiculous set of circumstances that you could possibly imagine. The basic plot line is as follows: boy dies and turns into a zombie, boy kills girl's boyfriend, zombie eats boyfriend's brain, gain knowledge of girlfriend, zombie falls in love with girlfriend. You can easily see why after only the first 24 minutes of my first attempt to view this film, I quickly diverted to watching something else. However, the film does get better, and even somewhat more ludicrous as the film proceeds. But we will get to that<br/><br/>The film centers around ""R"", a teenage zombie with lots on his minds, but he is constrained within the rotting corpse of a zombie. He reminisces of days gone by, and collects household treasures that he can relate (snow globes, vinyl records). His only pleasure in his afterlife existence comes with the consumption of human brains. The brain holds all the memories and experiences of its human host, and all these events and recollections get transferred to the zombie as the brain is ingested. These life images provide the zombie with a brief euphoria of what it was like to be alive. So when ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) ate Perry's brain (Dave Franco), Perry's memories of his girlfriend Julie (Teresa Palmer) came rushing into ""R"" s zombie soul. While feasting on Perry's brain ""R"" happens to glance up, and quickly realizes that Julie (his new memory) is about to ravaged by a horde of zombies as well. He rushes to save the damsel in distress, and thus ignites the first spark of life ever to be felt by the undead.<br/><br/>The story that follows is your typical dweeb boy falls for the hot cheerleader teen angst PG-13 film; however, writer/director Jonathon Levine does employ lots of zombie humor to keep this story fresh and fun. The longer Julie and ""R"" are together, the more human ""R"" becomes. However, turmoil arises when the truly undead, the ""bonies"", sense that their world is changing as the newly undead are starting to experience feelings. Add in that Julie's father (John Malovich) is the leader of the human resistance force to kill all zombies, and what you have here is a 21st century twist on a Zombie Apocalypse meets 'Romeo and Juliet' tragedy complete with its own balcony scene. <br/><br/>Needless to say, this is not Shakespeare nor does it try to be. This film is light-hearted fun with plenty of quirks to keep you amused. I actually found the closing five minutes really, really enjoyable with comments like ""damn these zombie fingers"" and ""I no eat (you)"". This is definitely not your typical rom-com, but under all that rotting flesh, a romantic comedy is exactly what this film becomes. A moderate recommendation, well worth the price of renting. So give this film a shot, and I think you may be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris REEL"""
"HelenMary","7","2","6","21 February 2013"," the strangest adaptation of Romeo & Juliet I've ever seen - fun zombie romance!
","As loose Shakespeare adaptations go, this could be the most unusual; zombies and humans as opposed to the montagues and the capulets. This was another success for Nicholas Hoult, who is ""so hot right now,"" and he was endearing, engaging and heart-warming in this as the zombie with a soul who falls in love with the girlfriend of the guy's brains he just ate, and got to know her through the guy's memories. She lives in the post-zombie apocalypse world, and her father is the general/leader of the army who is protecting humanity and obliterating the zombies outside of the city.<br/><br/>R (Hoult) is the narrator of the film, with his inner thoughts that are still quite human. As he gets to know Julie, form a bond, he becomes more human again. Yes it's predictable, and rather fairy-tale-esque, a morality tale, but that doesn't detract from it's cute, romantic, funny and pleasing storytelling. It's definitely a feel good film, with a lot of heart. R reminisces about a time when people were together and connected, before they were zombies, and you see a flashback to people isolated all on their phones not communicating at all... poignant, perhaps suggesting that in the digital age when we are all connected but insular we are like zombies walking around in our own little earphoned worlds.<br/><br/>Really enjoyed this, great special effects, stunts and make up and the CGI of the 'bonies' - the too-far-gone zombies who have given up the last of their humanity - was pretty good. John Malkovich in an unusual role of him, was good of course, and Teresa Palmer was also convincing and a sympathetic character as Julie. The viewer immediately is drawn to the gentle humour of R and he's just so adorable! Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry and Dave Franco were also good... Rob Corddry very good, actually, as the M the best zombie friend of R. Cory Hardrict - Kevin, one of the soldiers - was rather yummy! I recommend this, it's good clean fun; an improbable love story where true love conquers all, including being a corpse. A good zombie film for a girls night in or a romantic evening!"

","Warm Bodies is one of those movie themes that you almost expect it to be bad, but it turned out to be one of the best teenage comedies I've ever seen. It is very witty, doesn't take itself too seriously and is full of great humour and clever parodies. Nicholas Hoult's acting is very good and really brings the audience along his journey. <br/><br/>The movie also provides a very fresh perspective - the world from a zombie's eyes and shows us their side of the story, I haven't seen any other movie providing this perspective before. You could say the story is a little predictable but given such a fresh angle, and great written lines, the story catches you completely from start to end. <br/><br/>Like most of the audience in the theatre, I laughed out loud countless times and thoroughly enjoyed the movie, walked away with big smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart."

He feels something change in himself and decides to rescue her from his zombie cohorts and it's from this point on we see R shamble his way back to the world of the living.<br/><br/>The movie is a great romantic comedy. While not laugh out loud it does have it's moments. The two leads relationship is very convincing and is good fun to see it grow throughout. Even the smaller interactions Between Julie, R and their friends are good fun too. There are some great riffs on the whole Romeo and Juliet angle ( R and Julie ) even down to a whole balcony scene.It does have a tendency to go a bit too syrupy at times (one E.T. type moment) and it does occasionally border on the cheesy but never enough to ruin it.<br/><br/>The make up for all the zombies look great as does the set design for the post apocalyptic world. Effects wise the only thing that lets the movie down are the Bonies. The skeleton like evil zombies should have been creepy but they just looked a bit too cartoony and could easily have been done with some super skinny actors in Prostetic make up.

The teens at my showing clapped like crazy at the end (thinking back to when I was a teen a few months back, the teens of my day were more sophisticated: if, for instance, director John Hughes or whoever had killed off Voldemort in HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, we would not have been clapping at the end of such a travesty). In fairness to today's teens, maybe WARM BODIES is part of a book series to which the movie has been faithful, and maybe there actually ARE ways in which the characters of R and Julie can be taken further that I just can't think of now. After all, I never heard of this book before seeing the movie, so it could be the HARRY POTTER of the 2010s for all I know. At any rate, WARM BODIES is a somewhat interesting twist on the low-gore sub-genre of Zombie movies, though much of the plot is ripped off from a story called ROMEO & JULIET by William Q. Shakespeare!"

"tbmforclasstsar","8","2","6","1 February 2013"," it may contain some obvious humor and lacks a bit of gore, Warm Bodies is a fun and touching romantic comedy set in a zombie world
","Last year, Jonathan Levine brought us one of the most touching and funny films of the year when he directed Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen in 50/50. A film about a young man who is diagnosed with cancer, 50/50 was a tight-rope walk between humor and sorrow that Levine directed rather brilliantly. Now, he has another film that hits comedic and touching tones, though the subject matter is a lot less serious.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is the story of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who finds that he is starting to feel more and more human after meeting a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer). Sure, some of his desire for the girl stems from gaining the memories of her old boyfriend after R kills him and eats his brains, but it is still a touching love story. Saving Julie from a horde of zombies by covering her human scent and walking her back to the safe haven of the plane he lives in, R slowly teaches Julie to look past his corpse appearance and see him for the caring undead he is; a monster trying to change.<br/><br/>Slowly, some of R's friends start to have feelings too; a brain-hungry set of deceased humans that are starting to feel emotions again. But in a world where humans have had to fight off the undead to survive an apocalyptic reality, can the humans come to accept these monsters that are trying to change for good?<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is as light hearted as they come in the zombie genre, making films like Sean of the Dead and Zombieland look like a George A. Romero film, but there is nothing wrong with that. If you are going to see Warm Bodies, a film advertised as a comedic romance, for zombie thrills, then you probably have walked into the wrong movie. But if you are looking for a thoughtful and fun film, you won't miss.<br/><br/>Let's start with the style. Having a lead character that can only talk in brief words or short sentences is problematic, but some pretty funny narration by R leads the film in the right direction. The recognition in R's head of the monster he is and the ridiculousness of zombies (""God, we're slow"") is a fun inside joke between the protagonist and the audience and works to both connect us with the character as well as entertain us. This narration is important as at least 70% of the movie happens between R and Julie.<br/><br/>Other fun style points can be given to the fun soundtrack, which includes music from many popular artists as well as a few indie bands. The film also has a nice artistic style with grey hues for the present reality while some vivid coloring for the memory sequences in the film. The film never feels as dark as a horrific zombie film, but it disguises itself as one for some nice spoof fun.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/warm- bodies/"
"hilarylang","4","1","2","10 October 2019"," Not Terrible, but Forgettable Wasted Potential
","Warm Bodies was a movie that I really wanted to like and one that I thought I'd really like. A zombie love story is a concept that is pretty promising. You would think it would be comedic, clever, cute, and creative. However, I found it to be none of these things. I found Warm Bodies to be boring, predictable, and uninspired.<br/><br/>I feel like the movie is trying to advertise itself as ""Not your typical romance story."" But that's exactly what it feels like. I personally don't feel any connection between the two characters. Neither of them are particularly likeable, which is a problem when the whole story revolves around those two characters. What's even more frustrating is that I think R could have been a really lovable character. R, like the other zombies, can only speak in broken English, but the audience can hear his internal dialogue. This specific reason is why R is unlikeable. There's something so endearing about monstrous characters with a soft side, and all of that is thrown away when they make him such a main character for a teen romantic comedy. As for the love interest, Julie, she's even worse. There is no level of relatability to attach to her. That's not saying that every character should be relatable or even likeable, but like I said: The movie revolves around these two.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is extremely predictable and cliche. And I hate the word ""cliche"" but it's really the only word to use here. Every plot point, every scene, every bit of dialogue can be seen ahead from the very start. This may seem like an inconvenient factor that wouldn't affect the movie, but it does. Just because there's zombies, that doesn't make it at all creative. In fact, it feels like one of the least creative movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Warm Bodies is... not good. I'm not going to say that this is one of the worst films ever because it's not by any means. There are many films that are technically worse. What Warm Bodies is, is forgettable wasted material."

Losing contact with my body, my feelings. So to me, this movie is about Waking Up, and it serves a much greater purpose. So goddamn good it's a funny and somewhat ironic movie as well.

","While attempting to help rid the world of zombies, a woman finds that the zombie who saved her from an ambush has changed enough to fall in love with her and they set out to ensure those changes are brought to bear on their war with the undead world.<br/><br/>This one was a pretty enjoyable and ultimately different take on the zombie film. What really holds this one up here is the fact that there's a really enjoyable attempt here to bridge the paranormal teen romance trend with a more traditional type of horror effort here, and its best moments are a combination of the two. While at its core the film is about the star-crossed romance between the zombie and a human, there's the attempts here at humanizing the zombies more than ever before in the genre here by showing them not only capable of simple, rudimentary behavior outside of the mindless need to feed on humans here by showing them gathering in diners, airports and shopping malls with a basic sense of familiarity to their previous lives, giving them crude language skills and other cognizant capabilities that are shown here to grant the romance more legs. While these here manage to make that aspect more believable, there's still a semblance here of this one being a horror film which makes this one still treat the zombies themselves as threats that need to be exterminated, from the opening ambush in the supply room where the whole adventure starts or the different encounters here with the bone-skeleton zombies who are much more of a general threat here by even having the zombies afraid of them as much as the rest of the humans are. As well, the film's big action scene battles here with the full-scale war between the two sides coming to fruition in the baseball stadium makes for a great showing of what the influx of the romance into the proceedings means here as they manage to make it not seem hokey or gimmicky that they've joined up here and come together, and all of this manages to make it quite enjoyable. There's a few small problems here, mostly with the fact that this one doesn't feel all too much like a true horror effort here with the concentration on the romance here, as while it's an integral part of the film it does tend to hold off the attacks possible to still keep the zombies as important figures here off in the background while they're together, and the fact that they don't even try to mount a search parties is a big flaw on its own that would've been a fantastic way to resolve those two issues at once. Likewise, there's also the fact that the skeleton-zombies here look utterly ridiculous with the atrocious CGI that doesn't come close to looking the slightest bit realistic or capable of putting them in the same scene with the rest of the cast here they stick out so badly here. Otherwise, this one was quite fun and much better than expected.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence and Language."

","I don't want to mention Twilight, but, let's face it, it was 'vampires for teens,' just like Beautiful Creatures was 'witches for teens.' The 'teen market' is very profitable when it comes to film-making. Therefore, what with the trend in zombie movies in the last decade or so, it was only a matter of time before someone made a 'zombies for teens' movie.<br/><br/>Amazingly, it's actually pretty good.<br/><br/>It starts in a decimated world where the undead outnumber the living (nothing new there then, eh?). Only one - former teenage boy - zombie is starting to have 'feelings.' These remembered emotions lead him to make contact with the last few human survivors and strike up a friendship with a living girl.<br/><br/>It plays out like Romeo and Juliet (check out the unsubtle nod to the Shakespearean play in the 'balcony scene') where the boys 'zombie family' don't take too kindly to a living human among them (that they can't eat) and the girl's human settlement doesn't relish the possibility of a brain-eating flesh-eater wandering among them.<br/><br/>If you can move yourself out of the typical 'dumb' zombie world we're used to from George Romero and The Walking Dead etc and step into one where zombies can now talk, reason and even love, then you should give this one a go. It's not just for teens - zombie/horror fans like myself are treated to a healthy dose of gore and skeletons ripping people apart. There's a small helping of humour in it too and, on a personal level, I actually preferred the film when it was being an out and out comedy, but there's not too many laughs, so don't expect them coming thick and fast.<br/><br/>In a market saturated by one rubbish zombie movie after the next, fair play to Warm Bodies for trying - and succeeding - in bringing something a little different to the genre."
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","8","1","2","24 October 2014"," Unbelievably, I bought into it...
","Warm Bodies had all the makings of a 2/3 star rating for me, but here I am giving it an 8. I really enjoyed the film, but would normally have trashed something as ridiculous as this.<br/><br/>I thought it was fabulously well produced, even down to the beginning and end titles. It used copious cheesy references to famous musicians from years-gone-by such as Dylan/Joni Mitchell/etc, even a corny flick through the 'cool' record collection somehow stored on an abandoned plane with full electrical power, but even so, the film is still miraculously plausible, i.e with the small pieces of the plot jigsaw fitting and making sense even though the larger picture is completely implausible and couldn't possibly happen, if you care to think about it. On that note, the film is never going to become a classic because of the long-term implausibility, but short-term it was really fun and entertaining.<br/><br/>Besides being entertaining and madly plausible, the film is unusually original - even though there is nothing original about a post-apocalyptic zombie invasion scenario. The unusual presentation or 'take' on this possible scenario is the key, and one that I'd never experienced before. It's a film of positives for me, with lots of humour and plenty of decent music, which mostly worked.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some distractions. John Malkovitch's performance grated. If he'd been ever-so-slightly camp or comical, fair enough, I could have bought that, but not the deadly serious anti-zombie exterminating warlord. Also, when zombies become 'human' again, they don't get shot in or around the heart, bleed to death and carry on as though they're zombies. They're either zombies or humans, or at least I didn't understand that. Also, girls that see their long-term boyfriends getting mutilated and killed by zombies, don't fall in love with the guilty zombie after a about a week. The 'bonies' sort of attacked viciously at times, but conveniently paused and waited to attack at other times. It's all completely bonkers, but it didn't bother me. Shall I go into further plot-holes, such as the flimsy door that anyone could use to gain access to the stronghold, that our 'hero' zombie manages on his own, including walking through enclaves of humans without being detected? No, I don't need to, because somehow I forgive it all, for all its weakness, and still give the film an 8.<br/><br/>Enjoyable, silly, original, humorous, violently entertaining and completely aware of how ridiculous and implausible it really is.

I was impressed ^_^.<br/><br/>This movie is *mind for stupid pun* Rrrrrreally good. -Original plot (yeah hard to come by in the zombie industry) -A great execution of the plot -Talented new cast (though you wouldn't need a lot of character to imitate a corpse would you? :P) -Intelligently placed humor -A satisfying ending<br/><br/>What more could you wish for from a movie?<br/><br/>Then why give it a 10?<br/><br/>*spoilers*<br/><br/>Well: -1 for not explaining what the zombies ate after they merged in society and -1 for promoting necrophilia <br/><br/>I kid I kid :P -------------------------------------- END OF SPOILERS --------------------------------------<br/><br/>But yes there are some flaws here and there. To make things clear, I wouldn't classify it as horror and the ""Romance"" for me is sidelined in the plot, though it is executed very well in my opinion..<br/><br/>So are you going to soil your underwear? No (unless you're incontinent) <br/><br/>is it a exclusively a Romance film? No, though as a sideline its very well done.<br/><br/>is it perfect? No<br/><br/>Is it worth a watch?

"g-bodyl","9","1","2","26 June 2014"," A Welcome to the Zombie Genre!
","Warm Bodies is an interesting and rather fresh entry into the tiring zombie genre. Despite lots of good entertainment, we really haven't been offered something new, not until this movie came along. It's more of a romantic comedy than a horror and the film is told from the perspective of the main zombie, R. This film is touching, sweet, gruesome, and action-packed. I think everyone from both genders will enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Jonathan Levine's follow-up to his 2011's 50/50 is a radically different story, but still emotionally-infused. This film is about a zombie named R who develops love for this human girl named Julie. But if his love is to be protected, he must avoid being killed by the humans and even more undead creatures called Boneys.<br/><br/>The acting is actually really good. Nicholas Hoult does a great job as R. Teresa Palmer is really good as Julie and both the actors have great chemistry with each other. Rob Corddry has many scene-stealing scenes as R's best friend, M. John Malkovich is rather restrained, but that's because of the source material.<br/><br/>Overall, Warm Bodies is an excellent movie and so much better than expected. This isn't the Twilight of the zombie genre as many feared it was going to be. The romance is actually endearing and bearable. This film is funny, smart, action-packed, has good special effects and is a really sweet film. I rate this film 9/10."

","Highly original zombie movie. Possibly the most original since the first ever zombie movie. A zombie-romantic-comedy, if you like, which shows how original it is as I doubt any other movie has been described as that.<br/><br/>Very interesting, quirky plot. Starts intriguingly and gathers momentum as it goes. Has a few periods when it becomes a bit of a mundane chase and/or action sequences, but these are short. Plot isn't entirely watertight either, but, considering the science-fiction nature and quirkiness of the movie, it can be forgiven for erring on the side of entertainment over flawless plot.<br/><br/>Has some funny moments too. The whole premise of the movie is quite funny, in fact.<br/><br/>Ending is quite sweet and profound.<br/><br/>Good performances from Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer in the lead roles.

","To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this film given how the storyline read on the cover, I didn't really believe it would be my my kind of thing, but being a fan of zombie movies in general I thought I would give it a go. It turned out to be a great movie, a great watch and very enjoyable from start to finish, not what I expected from zombie but still great. It was very funny in places with an odd and very dark humour, also scary and quite jumpy from time to time, and it has to be said the strangest storyline ever. I love the way it gave an alternative view on zombies, giving them personalty. The character R was played extremely well by Nicholas Hoult, you just love him from the start and root for him until the end, brain munching and all! Highly recommended, and a must see!"

","The movie uses forbidden love between two persons who present two completely different worlds which is not a new method but love with zombie, that is insane ! Recently, ghosts, vampires, and beasts have been noticeable as wonderful lovers in chick flicks. Nobody would think zombie would stand out (or fit in) as such sweet, attentive, WARM lover. Zombies in Warm Bodies are far from their relatives in The Walking Dead which people have been familiar with. Zombie R aka the narrator, for example, is a very good-looking, insightful, lovable brain-eating creature. The horror and romantic implements tremendously parallel throughout the movie. The love story of R and Julie is very interesting. The movie is funny and cute, not a bash of romance but full of optimism and actually clever. Teenagers swoon over Twilight, you should watch this !"

After initially being reluctant to trust the Zombie, Julie learns to have fun with R. Their love story might just transform the current state of the world. I honestly wasn't expecting much with this film when it was announced. It seemed like P.G nonsense that I would dread. I started reading positive reviews for it and suddenly, my expectations began to rise. I never thought the ""friendly"" zombie type could work. I'm a big believer in zombies being threatening, so naturally I thought the idea was ludicrous. Guess what? It worked in a big way. This is mainly due to the fantastic chemistry between Teresa Palmer & Nicholas Hoult. Palmer is lively and gorgeous. Hoult is an absolute star with his portrayal of R. The two manage to make it all work. I thought Rob Coddry stole the show as a fellow zombie. He's proving to be one of the best comedic actors going today. It isn't just the acting, it's the story as well. Don't be warded off by the P.G rating. It is genuinely a very heartwarming film. You'll find yourself smiling throughout the movie. My only major carp is the ending itself. I thought they rushed things a little bit, and they could have gone a lot farther with it. It was still enjoyable, though. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

","This is the craziest zombie movie of them all. First just forget everything you think you know about zombies because this movie throws all that out the door. R is a zombie that can think and he eats the brains of Julie's boyfriend, hence getting all his memories, that's one of the new zombie twist. So when R has a chance to attack Julie, he recognizes her and begins talking and gets her to safety. How is this possible? Well it seems the zombies are coming back to life, of course this is never explained. They are the walking dead, but come back to life, really far fetched. Of course, Julie's dad doesn't understand the blossoming love between her and R, but it's easy for her friend to accept. And the bad guys in this are the bonies. Zombies that have ripped all their flesh off and look like skeletons.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: This movie makes up a lot of new rules about zombies. The plot is too much to take, skip it."

","Look, I'm not going to say this was some kind of mind blowing, thought provoking movie because it wasn't. I don't think it was supposed to be. It was a light, mainstream movie. It's a unique, silly, sometimes meaningful spin on the zombie genre. The thing I really enjoyed about it was that FINALLY someone made a movie where the zombies can be cured. I've always hated zombie movies because the plots to all of them are pretty much the same. A virus spreads, people turn into zombies, there's a camp of survivors who fight the zombies. In the end, the zombies die and a few plucky people prevail. How many times can we watch that same plot over and over again? This one, while not perfect, was refreshingly original. I admit, there were some contradictions here and there and there were cliché moments but the movie was enjoyable enough that I didn't care. I also liked the fact that the zombie make-up wasn't overdone. I've seen some other reviewers criticize that but I am sick to death of zombies with rotting flesh and dangling body parts. The characters were very likable and made me root for a happy ending. The girl was tough but not annoyingly so, and the male lead was vulnerable and sweet. I have loved Nicholas Hoult ever since he was in About A Boy. I was so happy to see that he was still having some success in the business. I'd so wanted to like this movie just because he was in it but then I heard from a lot of people that it was pretty bad. I avoided it until now because I just didn't want to see Nicholas fail miserably. That would've been painful. My eleven year old daughter finally persuaded me to watch the movie tonight and I am glad I did. While it wasn't earth shattering, it was a good, solid movie. I'd recommend it to anyone."
"~AleXa~","7","1","2","29 November 2013"," A refreshing take on the age-old zombie tale with a bleeding heart at its center
","11/29/2013<br/><br/>A refreshing take on the age-old zombie tale with a bleeding heart at its center<br/><br/>Preface: Some of you reviewers are not using your own mind. Complaining about this not being a conventional Zombie tale is like complaining about someone having a better idea than you If this was written just like Dawn of the Dead but with teens, you'd be complaining just the same. Take this film for what it is—a unique interpretation of an old cult classic. And really? Another remake of Romeo and Juliet meets zombies? Did you even READ the play? The ONLY similarity is that their names begin with the same letters. Grow a brain!<br/><br/>The film has a provocative introduction with R. jumping right into his view of life as a zombie, and we are pulled not pushed immediately into this post-apocalyptic world. The subtle satire is more than amusing, and his interest in Julie and desire to protect her start us off in a new direction. <br/><br/>I personally love the idea of some zombies still being closer to their humanity than being a zombie, and it is ignorant to declare that this is so out of the realm of possibility when we see in our own world today how isolation and alienation can lead to these same undead-like traits in very much living, breathing human beings, who begin committing inhumane acts such as rape and murder, and thus become degenerates of society, rejected and abhorred by all. I personally feel killing someone and eating their brain to provide sustenance to oneself is certainly more HUMANE than rape, torture, and murder, but I digress.<br/><br/>Julie continues to try to leave as R. must subsequently protect her, which does not fall into the overused damsel-in-distress motif that other reviewers indicated was so offensive. We are talking about ZOMBIES here, so it would stand to reason that if we're not going with the guns a-blazing, shoot 'em all in the head approach, a zombie would be the only one who could protect her. This is in no way anti-feminist, but believable for the story.<br/><br/>R. narrates a bit about zombies and himself, illustrating the ways in which he feels different than the rest, and also serving as a means of clarification to the audience that through the film, not just he, but all the zombies (with the exclusion of 'Bonies') are changing.<br/><br/>The story moves along well until the pivotal plot point where R. must do the honest thing and tell Julie that it was he who killed her ex. She utilizes a classic defense mechanism, stating she had been mentally preparing for such an event, however disappears the following morning to return to her father. Meanwhile, R. finds his zombie friends were run off by the 'Bonies' who wish to quell this newfound hope beginning to run rampant amongst their zombie counterparts who are meant to become them. This is all quite believable until this point, as we are to believe that the 'Bonies' became just that because they lost hope and therefore do not think, however it is just that that the story leads into.<br/><br/>I do find it quite surprising that John Malkovich comes off very two-dimensional and lacking the charisma and wit we are used to seeing from him, however one could leave this to bad writing and/or direction. I did find the pace to retain my interest and was fascinated more by R. than any other character.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is quite entertaining with a refreshingly original look at a tried-and-true plot line. Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer excelled in their respective parts where the others just kind of faded into the background. I really would've liked to have seen more from Dave Franco, as I think he is fresh, up-and-coming talent. Good storytelling with some minor plot holes, and respectable direction that holds the audience's interest throughout. I for one appreciate the author as well as the screenwriter's intention on making a film that steps outside of the box and asks us to not just think differently, but to explore a psychological perspective in a situation that would make this otherwise impossible. Kudos to the filmmakers!<br/><br/>7.0 out of 10.0<br/><br/>-H. Martin"

","A weird combination of romantic drama and zombie apocalypse movie, Warm Bodies certainly covers new ground. It wasn't a great movie and the plot certainly has some elements that leave you scratching your head and/or make you sick. Still, it succeeds in being funny at times and emotional at others.<br/><br/>The story is told from the point of view of a zombie. His inner monologue is pretty hilarious. He can't speak, or do much of anything besides shamble around and eat brains, but it's like he has this longing for something greater. Then he manages to fall in love with a human being.<br/><br/>Squick? Well, there is no necrophilia here, though it's sort of implied by the story. The romance is actually pretty romantic, though that might sound strange.<br/><br/>The bad guy is the girl's dad, played by John Malkovich with a veteran's stoic confidence. He doesn't approve. We get a Romeo & Juliet story.<br/><br/>Still, it's a B-movie with poor action sequences and some stuff that got thrown in when it should've been cut."

","Romantic comedies are particularly difficult to reinvent. They are typically a formula of ""boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy wins girl"" with some variations. There is usually another romantic interest. ""Warm Bodies"" adds a totally unique and fresh twist to the formula. Boy meets girl, but he's a zombie.<br/><br/>This movie is very much based on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". Instead of the Montagues and Capulets it's the living and the zombies. There are many more subtleties that reference Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The music in the movie is incredible! It is used very effectively.<br/><br/>There are also several scenes that are far more artistically filmed than one would expect in a romantic comedy. <br/><br/>Before seeing it, my teenage son was very critical of a romantic comedy zombie movie. He found it to be nearly as enjoyable as I did. It is a feel good fun movie. It is well worth seeing. <br/><br/>I should note that I gave it a ""10"" rating because it currently is below 7 on IMDb (which it shouldn't be).

","I am so glad I decided to give this a try.<br/><br/>I saw the trailer for this film in early spring and it didn't look promising. I checked it out on IMDb as well but I have to say that taglines like ""There's nothing hotter than a girl with brains"" and ""Dead sexy"" aren't exactly promising (nor are they a good fit for this kind of plot). Well, it wouldn't be the first film that was mismarketed. That could explain the somewhat lower than expected ratings, too.<br/><br/>I was positively surprised from the beginning. The atmosphere was completely different from what the trailer let on and the film was so much better for it. While the story might be old, the setting (and execution) made it refreshingly original. There aren't many positive films about zombies and the only ones I've seen so far are the ""Shaun of the Dead"" type black comedies. I appreciated how the film portrayed hope and hopefulness for a better outcome.<br/><br/>I like happy endings if they work, because tragedy and drama for the sake of it is just melodramatic. I was left with feeling good and optimistic (despite all the brains eaten at the beginning). I enjoyed the pace. The build of the relationship between the two protagonists was enjoyable and realistic (except for R eating Perry). It took a leap, though, to accept how easily Julie discarded her previous relationship and the way it had ended. Then again, I've never experienced living in a world where death seems imminent. Perhaps it makes one more agreeable.<br/><br/>There were a few clichés, like the trigger-happy father, but not too bothersome."

","Who knew the simple combination of a socially awkward teenager and a zombie could be so hilarious and heart-warming? I expected something pretty silly from this film and was surprised when it grabbed me in its first minutes with its relateability and its kinetic atmosphere. I was curious as to how this film would be executed and I was delighted to find that it's through the disassociated narration of Nicholas Hoult's character. There's something brilliant about how he's a zombie on the outside with that kind of inner monologue, it highlights that huge gap teenagers have from their thoughts and actions. The story takes relatively predictable steps from then on in but its blissful simplicity, quirky sense of humour and creative choice of antagonist tiers keeps it engaging. It's very cinematically shot as well with a great soundtrack. It completely won me over when a character chose to play a Bruce Springsteen track for a bonding montage. Jonathan Levine disappointed me with the lifeless 50/50, it seems he was saving it all for Warm Bodies. Best surprise of the year so far.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I am surprised at the people on here saying they wanted to walk out of the theatre part way through the movie. I don't know, maybe some folks are so used to having someone else do their thinking for them they've forgotten how to and this movie does require you to think a little. The basic premise of the movie was pretty clear in the trailers so it wasn't to hard to work out what the movie was about really. It makes me think of the parents who took their kids to see Jurassic Park years ago and then complained that it was scary, ridiculous. Also I agree with previous posts on here saying if you walked out part way through your comments are not valid, that's like walking into a restaurant, smelling the cooking food then leaving and declaring it inedible."
"p-stepien","8","1","2","16 June 2013"," Best zombie comedy since ""Shaun of the Dead""
","Obviously intent on drawing Twilight crowds, director Jonathan Levine brilliantly redefines a genre laden with history mixing the expected romantic twist to the tale with the unexpected hilarity of subverting teenage drama into a zom-com. In a not-so-distant future the world has been overcome by zombies with the last outposts of the living in heavily guarded fortresses. Meanwhile the dead walk the Earth, pointlessly and repeatedly wandering along oft-tread paths, mechanically searching for live brain. Those zombies, who have entirely detached from their humanity (given up the vestiges of hope), have turned into soulless remnants called 'bonies', entirely ravaged by the virus - now faster and consumed by an overwhelming blood lust.<br/><br/>The rest, like R (blue-eyed Nicholas Hoult) still hang on to some past memory of being human, eating brains a way to re-immerse into the living (brain-eating causes the zombie to steal other peoples memories), whilst spending the multitude of spare time collecting vinyls and having quasi-conversations with fellow undead M (Rob Corddry). When Julie (Teresa Palmer), daughter of general Grigio (John Malkovich), falls into a zombie trap, R (after prior munching through the skull of her fiancée) creates an unusual affinity to the girl, thus causing him to spare her life. This soon brings about a spiral of events, which surprisingly causes R to slowly uncover the ability to speak or to harbour feelings.<br/><br/>Levine obviously was inspired by the vampire craze initiated by the Twilight series, audaciously deciding to take Teresa Palmer as the female protagonist. Due to significant facial similarities coupled with a dose of mimicry Palmer could well claim to be a sister of Kristen Stewart. But ""Warm Bodies"" uses these similarities to introduce a new take on the zombie genre, while bringing in new crowds in on the fun. Bound to cause some confusion amongst Meyers fan-base as to what exactly this movie is, Levine isn't however really interested in making fun of ""Twilight"" (although certain nods can be easily distinguished). Instead he quickly finds his own pace and style within this illogical romantic scenario of a dilapidated corpse falling madly in love with a live girl. Masterfully balancing the more sincere, dramatic moments with an onslaught of well timed, brilliantly thought out comedy, the movie succeeds in throes, delivering one of the freshest pictures of the season. Much praise must be given to the obviously restrained Nicholas Hoult, who mostly communicates with 'ughs' and 'ers', throwing the occasional crooked smile, while delivering the comedic underpinning with a wry narration of his thoughts."

","""Arg!"" says the undead.<br/><br/>Actually, the undead aren't supposed to say a lot. And this is coming from someone who grew up on George A. Romero's films and recently, The Walking Dead. Maybe they did in the Return of the Living Dead films – ""Brains!"" but that's not the norm.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is a touching and different take on the current zombie craze that's happened over the past few years to decade and it's the first I've seen that puts the viewer (and zombie film lover) in the mind of the living dead. And while it's not a bad thing that this is a comedy (well, romantic comedy,) I would also like to see this from a straight point of view.<br/><br/>I digress. In a movie that's not even rated R – we're all probably becoming pretty immune to zombie movies, we have 'R' who still has a minute left of a brain yet to think consciously after being inadvertently turned into the undead. His thoughts, while both interesting and often hilarious, lead him to true love when he meets the un-undead of his dreams and rescues her.<br/><br/>Once the initial and inevitable back & forth getting used to the idea one of the zombies would want to help the living and not actually eat them, the movie falls more and more into the predictable territory for a film that's set up like this, or the Romeo & Juliet theme, if you will.<br/><br/>Now, the movie has more highs than lows, and that's thanks to the cast, namely Rob Corddry and lead zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult.) And the ending is one of the most original I've seen for a zombie movie and that was thoroughly refreshing.<br/><br/>It's a nice take, has literal laugh out loud moments and enough for both the zombie & chick-flick fans. Recommended!"

","After a zombie apocalypse, R, a zombie, spends his days wandering around an airport which is now filled with hordes of his fellow undead, including his best friend M. R and M achieve rudimentary communication with grunts and moans and ""Eh's"" and occasional near-words. As a zombie, R constantly craves human flesh, especially brains, as he is able to ""feel alive"" through the memories of their former owners. The zombies travel in packs, moving very slowly, searching for victims to feed on. While out looking for food, R and a pack of zombies find Julie Grigio and a group of her friends, who were sent out by Julie's father from a heavily-fortified, walled-off human enclave in a nearby city to recover medical supplies from abandoned buildings. R sees Julie and is drawn to her. After being shot in the chest by Julie's boyfriend, Perry, R kills Perry while Julie is distracted and eats his brain, giving R his thoughts and memories, making his attraction to Julie become even stronger. He rescues Julie from the rest of the pack and takes her back to an airplane he lives in at the airport to keep her safe. The two bond, causing R to slowly begin to come to life.[9] After a few days, Julie gets restless, and tries multiple times to return home, yet attracts swarms of zombies every time, requiring R to rescue her. After fighting off a group of corpses, including M, R decides it is time to start driving back to the humans.<br/><br/>On the way, R reveals to her that he killed Perry, causing her to abandon R and return alone to the human enclave. R begins to make his way back to the airport, heartbroken, but when he sees that M and other zombies are also beginning to show signs of life, but the Bonies are looking for R. So, he and M lead a group to the human enclave, where R sneaks inside the wall. There he meets Julie's friend Nora, who is initially shocked. When R reveals the other corpses have also been coming back to life, the three of them attempt to tell Colonel Grigio, Julie's father and leader of the survivors. Colonel Grigio, however, refuses to believe corpses can change and threatens to kill R, almost succeeding until Nora pulls a gun on him. Julie and R escape to a baseball stadium where the rest of R's group is waiting, but find themselves under attack by a horde of skeletal zombies (also known as Bonies) who have irretrievably lost all traces of humanity, and are set on killing and eating anything with a heartbeat, which now includes R and his friends.<br/><br/>Julie and R run from the Bonies, finding themselves trapped. Taking the only escape route, R jumps with Julie into a pool far below, shielding her from the impact. After Julie pulls R from the bottom of the pool, they kiss passionately - and this triggers R to become fully revived. On finding them, Colonel Grigio shoots R in the shoulder and causes him to bleed, which proves he is fully revived. The humans and zombies combine forces and kill the Bonies while the rest die off, and the zombies slowly assimilate into human society. Soon after, the human population destroys the walls surrounding the human society, creating a life for both humans and reanimated corpses much like the days before the apocalypse. The film ends with a now fully alive R and Julie watching a wall surrounding the city being blown down, signifying the end of the apocalypse."

It's such an original story, a zombie love flick! Who'd have though it? It's not even a spoof, although it does have quite a few funny moments it does actually take itself quite seriously, the story really draws you in and you find yourself actually caring and rooting for 'R' (zombie lead character). I've never really been a fan of Nicholas Hoult, I guess I still picture him as that annoying little kid in About a Boy, but he plays this part really well and comes across as (I know this sounds daft) but a really adorable zombie! You can kinda compare this to Twilight, there are a few Twilight-esque moments in there, Terasa Palmer even looks like a blonde Bella but to be honest it's no bad thing and if your a Twilight fan you should give this a go, it's just as good if not more so just for its originality!"

Great movie over all. Great new direction for the zombie genre. You should see it. You won't want to miss it. So entertaining. You will laugh. You will cry. I mean it. Should not be missed. I need more lines in my review I know. But this is all I have to say. Still need more lines. No more to say here. You can stop reading. Just see the movie. I will have to recite something if this is not enough. O.k. Four score and seven years ago. Our fore fathers brought forth."
"jackmeat","8","1","2","2 June 2013"," Well made, original take on the zombie world.
","Movie review:What an entertaining flick this was. I often don't start by saying this, but you should definitely see this movie. The story is about R (Nicholas Hoult) who is a zombie that is just plain sick of his mundane existence. Yes, you did read that right, the central character is a zombie. The zombie apocalypse has already occurred and the zombies quarantined outside of a walled in city just go about business as usual, wander around, groan, walk into things, the usual zombie like stuff. But R is different, he is lonely, bored and looking for companionship. The closest he has is a fellow zombie, M ( Rob Corddry).This of course is difficult because, well, he is a zombie. The audience is privy to what R is thinking which leads to some very amusing scenes from the very start. Well, like zombies often do, they get hungry, and need to travel to find food since they have already eaten everyone local to their area. When they set out for a search for humans, they run across a team from the city (that is run by the one and only John Malkovich) that is searching for pharmaceuticals. Well, in the zombie like feast, we learn that when a zombie eats a brain, he absorbs the victims memories, sort of like a daydream, and during the melee R attacks and eats the brain of our heroines boyfriend. Julie (Teresa Palmer), the aforementioned heroine, is saved by R and takes her back to where the zombies ""live"" In this time, R slowly develops a small vocabulary to try and communicate but of course, she is still at first terrified of him. But this is a romantic movie and the two begin to develop a strange sort of symbiotic relationship, hers is need to survive, his is desire. Now this is basically the meat of the movie, but there hasn't been an antagonist yet. Enter the bonies, zombies that are far to gone and have no feeling but hunger, so we can call them the really bad zombies, not the regular zombies. When the bonies realize that not only is a human (food) hanging around the zombies, but the zombies are slowly regaining more human like traits. So, like bad guys do, they go after R and Julie. By this point, R and Julie are ""friends"" and decide to warn the people of the city of the impending attack from the bonies and zombies alike (the ones that haven't started feeling). This movie plays out just so incredibly well, you may find yourself forgetting this is a zombie flick. Yet don't expect blood and gore, it is virtually non-existent. What does exist is an extremely original and well made movie that finds a way to excel where typical romantic movies fail, that is by making you believe in the characters so much, even under the ridiculous premise that it has and if you can look past that, you will absolutely adore this movie. Fine performances are turned in by Hoult and Palmer to make you really sympathize with the world they are stuck in. An excellent movie all around from slow moving amusement to a nice finale that will make you smile. 7.6/10 IMDb 7.1 My only gripe, I know they needed to use cgi, but it was pretty bad. I know, low budget. Very small gripe though. Thanks Bec for viewing this with me, it was nice to have someone in chat to laugh with, even if it was just typing LOL to halfway across the planet. Not very easy to watch a movie with someone when they are 15 hours ahead of ya. Timing is a b*tch."
"DisturbedPixie","8","1","2","2 June 2013"," A Revenant Zombie film that appeals to the romantics who can laugh at absurdity
","Look up ""Revenant Zombie."" ""While conceptually very old, and the prototype from which many other undead derive, this trope has fallen out of favor for more modern breeds of zombie, and for the bloodsucking vampire."" This is not the first zombie movie to show talking/reasoning zombies (Return of the Living Dead, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Wreck it Ralph, Day of The Dead, Land of The Dead). This is not the first romantic zombie film (Fido, Bride of Frankenstein, ""Fear Itself"" New Year's Day, My Boyfriend's Back). This is not Twilight (Twilight and its 3 sequels are Twilight, and we don't have to fear it's gonna get us. Don't worry, there will still always be dark and gruesome horror films. And for Twilight fans, there will always be darkly romantic films for you. No need to fight.) I have seen around 100 zombie films, and this is by far not even close to some of the crappier zombie films, though it was pretty unique and sweet and funny.<br/><br/>You have to have a soft spot for romance to enjoy this and you have to notice that it is a commentary on society without love. Life without love is no life at all. That's the message and I think it's powerful enough to resonate with those who don't require the usual cliché zombie film. We have plenty of zombie films that are just about surviving, but we have far less about living.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a realistically dark zombie film, maybe this isn't for you. If you want a very violent and gory zombie film, maybe this isn't for you. But if you don't hate films just for being different or appealing to romantics, you might just enjoy this. It's not Oscar material, but I genuinely prefer the quirky stuff that isn't widely accepted. That's where you find films that speak to you directly, as we are all different."
"BritGirlJay","9","1","2","18 May 2013"," Rom-zom-com with more rom than zom-com
","I thought it was great, a very sweet touching and gently amusing movie - although, at it's (undead) heart this movie is a romance first and foremost. There's a bit of 'horror' (that would be the zombies and their bony frenemies) and a bit of comedy (if you count the deadpan - no pun - monologues from R and a few nice one liners from M) but there's a whole lot more romance. I think many viewers mistook the movie to be more horror/comic than it actually aspired to be.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it - because I'm one of those people with a guilty pleasure that is romantic comedy - and found the lead actors very convincing. R's self musings were wonderfully written and I also liked that Julie wasn't the kind of girl that inevitably falls over, while wearing underclothes, during a chase scene or screamed every 5 minutes for no discernible reason. Overall is it clichéd? Sure - but who cares? It was a cool take on an old theme, with a couple of chuckles and nice undead makeups thrown in."
"multiblackdog","1","2","7","5 October 2014"," a 7/10? are you kidding me?
","Alright, so I have a couple of problems with this film. The first and most mind-boggling thing is the fact that we have the female lead falling in love with a monster that just killed her boyfriend. I don't care that he became 'human' again, are you kidding me? half the people on this very forum itself, (not the sappy teenage girls who've got the ratings up to 7) would kill the zombie who mutilated their loved one. Dude, i would kill a human being if i saw them eating my loved one, but to fall in love with that beast, really?<br/><br/>Now teenage girls, i admit you have taken vampires away from us, but please leave the zombies alone. I mean, all it takes is a little sunshine and some love and the friendly neighborhood flesh eating monster is now your new sparkling Edward Cullen like sparkling boyfriend? give me a break.<br/><br/>The special effects were bad. the bo*#ers, (or was it the 'boneys'?) look like charred puppets awkwardly jerking around. Dave Franco was wasted in this movie. The voice over was horrible, there were a bunch of stupid plot holes, like why was there power in the airport after what seemed like a considerable time since the outbreak. the sparkling zombies are electricians now too?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, i have nothing against romantic comedies, as long as they are good ones but don't expect me to like this nonsense. do yourself a favor, watch zombie land instead 1*"

"queenstar_valera","7","2","7","13 February 2013"," If you want to know the juices of this movie read here, otherwise don't. Because this may contain spoilers of the movie.
","Yes people, this is a spoiler so read at your own risk. LOL. The plot was pure fiction and it was exaggerating though the whole concept was awesome enough to pass as a feel good movie. It was actually a mix of twilight and Romeo and Juliet in the whole idea of a peculiar love story though nobody died in the end since R was dead to start with. Nonetheless it was overwhelming since it does have a happy ending for those fairy tales buff viewers. The first few minutes I wished the boyfriend would have turned into zombies so they would have this triangle love story going on. Though when it turned out great that the boyfriend was better off the screen that's when I started to love the awkwardness where the zombie was terrifying but showing his desire at the same time to Julie. Some moments with the zombies were funny. M and R scene at the airport where they don't speak just groan was the funniest. It is well taken and was clever for a minute of laughs. Some point of the movie is the scene where he had come to life again it was confusing and again was exaggerating. Being shot for many times isn't possible but then I realized hey, it was a fiction story after all. Science needs to go away for a while and build up a fairy tale Snow- White-Like love story and in a matter of seconds the side of my brain where I have to apply a non-science mode which is by the way easy for me to do since the science only apply on 1/8 in my brain all of them is fantasy. For the feel good movie lovers out there yes you will feel great on this movie and you will wish that your boyfriend is a zombie too, LOL. And for a zombie movie I give it 7/10. Enjoy watching!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","7","4 February 2013"," Redefines the word cockamamie.
","Warm Bodies has a premise that redefines the word cockamamie. Here is a bizarre love story set in a landscape in which the living dead have taken over, leaving the surviving masses to huddle together behind a fortified wall only to find themselves bonding after the zombies begin to illicit feelings and memories. Yes, it is as lame as it sounds, but here is a movie that at least has some redeemable merits. This may be the first zombie picture in history that finds room for both the living dead and ""Rock You Like a Hurricane."" It doesn't have much but least it has that.<br/><br/>The story is based on a book by Isaac Marion who came up with the idea after his short story ""I Am a Zombie Filled with Love"" gathered a minor internet audience in 2010. Something about the finished product leaves you with the feeling that it was better off in a shorter form. Even at 90 minutes it kind of wears out its welcome.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in an unnamed city that is still smoldering eight years after the zombie apocalypse. The story takes place from the point of view of a teenage zombie (Nicholas Hoult) who doesn't remember his name or any of his personal history. He's one of thousands of lumbering dead who were bitten by fellow lumbering dead and became, well . . . lumbering dead. Early in the film he narrates his own inner monologue, a neat idea that unfortunately peters out early on. He explains some of the odd values and virtues of being a zombie and instructs us that there are two kinds of zombies: the regulars and ""The Bonies"", a race of horribly decayed skeletonized deadites, zombies who have given up and simply ripped off their own rotted flesh and become feral. Their presence is fierce but their appearance is underwhelming due to the fact that they all look exactly alike. They are a product of computer animation, but they look like exact clones of one another.<br/><br/>Despite his gray pallor and blood-stained lips, the hero zombie (who is eventually given the underwhelming nickname of ""R"") retains some of his former human value. He lives in an abandoned airplane fuselage where he displays his collection of pilfered objects and listens to vinyl records of John Waite and Bruce Springsteen. On his daily rounds with fellow deadites, R comes in contact with the surviving dead. They have turned themselves into a militia and take pleasure in blowing their little zombie heads off. During one particularly fierce melee in an abandoned store, R locks eyes with pretty blonde Julie (Teresa Palmer). He rescues her and, naturally (or unnaturally) he falls in love with her. The bond between the very alive Julie and the living dead R makes for a love story that has to be taken at face value and is complicated by the fact that Julie's dad (John Malkovich) is the leader of the surviving militia.<br/><br/>Something in R's rotted little heart begins to melt in the presence of Julie and pretty soon he finds himself remembering how to love and showing signs of returning to some of his former human emotions. That, we can buy, but then other zombie begin to illicit the same feelings, and if you can buy the scene in which their zombie hearts begin to glow like E.T., then by all means, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>The story is lame (to say the least) and there are few who would doubt that. This is not exactly a movie that is going to be beloved by your average ""Walking Dead"" crowd, but the movie has some sense of redemption. You can honestly say that at least you've never seen this plot before. And there is some merit in the production design by Martin Whist whose credits include Super 8, Cloverfield, and The Cabin in the Woods. He manages to create a cityscape that really does look as if it has been trashed and abandoned for nearly a decade. And the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is the perfect shade of cold gray; making everything look eternally overcast. Yet, while the production is well-made, it is at the service of a story that has you rolling your eyes. Yes, it is original but you find yourself resisting it almost from the start. C'mon, glowing zombie hearts? Really?"
"brookemarieisme","7","2","7","3 February 2013"," Nothing Compared to the Novel
","As a person who read the book and watched the movie, I was a little disappointed that Hollywood got a hold of this novel. They missed so many details from the book, and didn't include many scenes, especially my favorite ones in the novel. Even though M was suppose to be a porn- addict zombie, I feel like he was still portrayed well with the lines he was given. <br/><br/>Being a person that read the book before watching the movie made me noticed many missed things, such as leaving out that R was ""married"" with his orphan children, or the bar fight, and even the boob mishap between Nora and R (which would have been hilarious if they used it in the film.) Hollywood transformed it into another generic love-story. I laughed a little and enjoyed it, but nothing compared to Issac Marion's actual writing. <br/><br/>I say go watch it, it's a good movie. But I personally prefer the book myself, mainly because it's less focused on the romance and has more comedic value to it. But if romance is your thing, go and see it."
"StevePulaski","6","2","8","2 February 2013"," Nicholas Sparks this ain't
","When the zombie craze hit America, circa 2009, it seemed to have swept everyone up except for myself. What can I say, I guess zombies just aren't something I will make a totally conscious effort to watch. I've enjoyed several zombie movies in my day, including George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland, but have never watched a full minute of AMC's The Walking Dead. Perhaps I've just thrown all my zombie-credibility down the drain by revealing that.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I can hold an opinion on Johnathan Levine's Warm Bodies, a somewhat unique romantic-horror story centering on the romance between a beautiful living girl and an attractive dead boy. We open by seeing ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult), a young zombie wandering around an airport after a fairly recent zombie apocalypse that has claimed a good portion of the country's citizens. ""R"" can not speak coherently, holding conversations with passersby that rarely channel anything besides grunts and muffled groans. We get all his internal thoughts through open narration about how he can not remember his name, or how he became a zombie in the first place, and just wants to go back to being a normal human being.<br/><br/>One day, ""R"" and a group of other dead souls run into a group of perfectly undead ones and a shootout begins. ""R"" winds up feasting on the brains of an innocent young male, and begins to get the man's memories flowing through his head. In them, he sees a beautiful, young, vibrant woman of golden blonde hair (his girlfriend), who just happens to be in the same room as this shootout is unfolding. She is Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer), who ""R"" looks not to harm, but to protect from the undead army of people invading the remainder of the country. He takes her to an airplane that will serve as their closeted sanctuary, where she will teach him the ways of a human, and he will assure she is protected and cared for properly. The only minor problem is that Julie's oppressive dad (John Malkovich) runs a violent human group that is hellbent on searching for zombies and slaying them on impact.<br/><br/>Writer/director Levine, who, two years ago, made one of the most heartwarming comedy-dramas of 2011, 50/50, juggles two genres here that haven't had the best treatment in recent years. The horror genre, which is so dreadfully lifeless it mimics the onslaught of zombies brought forth in this picture, and the romantic comedy genre, which is usually just reduced to incredulity and emotional manipulation, are merged with somewhat satisfactory results, yet this leaves the tone of Warm Bodies jumping all over the place. One thing that remains consistent, however, is the slowburn technique that Levine employs early. The film takes a while to get from place to place, and rarely focuses on anyone either than Hoult and Palmer, leaving a lion's weight of dependability on their chemistry together. Their chemistry works and elevates the film to a respectful status, and is without hesitation, the best part about this film.<br/><br/>The problem with the tone is the main distraction, though. Warm Bodies jumps into so many different genre pools that it only manages to pull them off fairly, without much notable charm. The genre that comes out with the most due payed to it is definitely the romantic one, and as one watches the inevitability unfold, it's nothing but blunt to the audience that this is trying to attract the tween audience and get them hooked on what aspires to be the next big thing. Comparisons to the Twilight series have already been made, but this is a far less melodramatic exercise than those films proved to be. Yet, while Warm Bodies may provide one of the love interests with a different twist, it still carries us down the path of contrivance and inevitability we can foresee before the halfway point.<br/><br/>Had this been R-rated, no pun intended, the horror possibilities could've been further exploited and the story may have evolved into something more than tween-fare. Alas, this isn't how the idea came to fruition, and perhaps this tween direction would've been more profitable and well-received than the path I would've rather seen this story take. Everyone involved is capable, the inspiration drawn from Romeo and Juliet is apparent, and the idea of focusing on a zombie character for once is a good one, and it should satisfy those seeking out a different kind of romantic comedy that injects flavor, wit, style, and potency without bearing the name ""Nicholas Sparks."" But the girls who are ""creeped out"" by zombies can comfortably standby for two weeks when Valentine's Day brings a film more up their alley.<br/><br/>Starring: Nicholas Hault, Teresa Palmer, John Malkovich, and Rob Corddry. Directed by: Johnathan Levine."

Also naming a character after a letter or number is really overdone.

In fact I don't give a crap about 'genres' if I like a movie it's because I enjoyed it & that goes with any art. I understand that some people won't like it (I have no idea why but not everyone can like(or dislike) one thing) but adding logic? It's Romeo & Juliet in the Zombie Apocalypse real world logic isn't high on the list the only plot hole i see is the speed of the corpses & the only remedy for that is the fact that R was becoming more human. My other problem is that art isn't supposed to have logic, every cop drama (which FYI i find this more of a RomZomDram yes there are funny moments but none that made me laugh out loud) episode is more intense then a real cops entire career. I know some people are complaining about the power of love but unlike practically every RomCom this one is perfect (well as perfect as it can be being in a span of 3 days) because unlike most moving picture mediums it's not making out right when the meet each other yes R does have a love at first sight but they become friends long before they are romantically involved like real life.

","This was cute, funny and kinda heartwarming giving a fresh twist to the zombie genre. Based on the book by Isaac Marion, the movie managed to capture 'R's' self deprecating, sarcastic and humorous voice especially in the beginning, as he describes his ""life"" to the viewer, what an average day is like for one of the undead shuffling around a post apocalyptic airport. <br/><br/>The beginning of this movie was super good. If I'm honest though I did find parts of this(maybe even as a whole) a little slow.<br/><br/>R is kinda tortured, seeking a connection as he feels there must be more. After he rescues 'Julie' from a zombie attack the two form a relationship and he experiences a profound transformation, becoming increasingly more human. There is a definite Romeo and Juliet vibe going on here as Julie is the daughter of a military leader (John Malkovich) charged with eradicating the undead. Their romance aspect was cute.<br/><br/>Teresa Palmer plays Julie and at times reminded me of Kristen Stewart, something about her look and the frown in her brow, her awkwardness. Nicholas Hoult does an excellent job as R, I enjoyed watching his transformation, his struggle with speech, memory, making his body work properly. I also liked Analeigh Tipton and Rob Corddry in their BFF roles. Dave Franco has a smaller ""brainer"" part.<br/><br/>The soundtrack mostly consists of 80's music and I should mention the ""Bonies"". They're the bad zombies here and reminded me of those stop motion sword fighting skeletons from that 1963 movie 'Jason and the Argonauts'. Very jerky looking.

","Let me just say that I typically don't like ""zom-coms"" for the simple reason that most of them just aren't that funny. Additionally, the idea of a romance between a person and a zombie fills me with revulsion. Having said that, I fully expected to be bored to tears or completely disgusted with this particular film. I was pleasantly surprised. Essentially, ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who ambles along--day in and day out-doing what zombies typically do. Then one day he and a number of other zombies stumble upon a group of humans and while he is chowing down on one happens to see a beautiful woman named ""Julie"" (Teresa Palmer) who is surrounded and totally vulnerable. This strikes a strange impulse in his brain to protect her and lead her to a safe location. What follows is a story that is both funny and cute without getting too morbid or syrupy. Be that as it may, judging from some of the other reviews my opinion is not shared by everybody. To each his own. In any case, I didn't think this film was too bad and I rate it as slightly above average."

Our female lead is as beautiful as it gets and while not all of her decisions seem rational, this still is a movie and shouldn't be measured to hard on that front.

The main producer who pushed to make the book into the movie, getting financing and a writer/director also read it first on her Kindle. Welcome to the electronic age!<br/><br/>This is not your usual zombie movie, being told from the zombies' perspective. As it starts out, an infection has spread and now the last band of ""normal"" people live in a city with a high, guarded wall. But Brit Nicholas Hoult as R (as a zombie, he can't remember his name, only that it started with the letter 'R') seems a bit different. At a short battle in a lab, R is angered when he is shot at, so he grabs the guy and eats his brain. Eating a person's brain has the effect of the zombie sharing all that person's memories, so he realizes that the blonde in the lab is the dead man's girlfriend.<br/><br/>Aussie Teresa Palmer is that blond, Julie , who is terrified, but R manages to mumble out that he will see that she is kept safe. And he leads her out of there, to his own place of residence, an old abandoned jet liner on the tarmac of an abandoned airport. Gradually she learns to trust him.<br/><br/>In the meantime, as R is losing some of his zombie qualities, it is also rubbing off on some of the other zombies, particularly his friend, fellow zombie Rob Corddry as M . <br/><br/>(Side note, there is a strong 'Romeo and Juliet' element in parts of the story, and in a key scene Julia is on a balcony looking down at R. It can be presumed Julia and R represent Juliet and Romeo, while R's friend M represents Romeo's friend Murcutio, and so on.) <br/><br/>The other key character is John Malkovich as Grigio, Julie's dad who seems to be in charge of protecting the walled-in city. <br/><br/>This is an excellent movie, the writing is very clever, and we laughed often. The acting is also superb, especially Hoult playing the zombie 'R' as he gradually goes from grunting to saying a word or two, to eventually speaking, as he became more human. A very entertaining movie."

","This ridiculous little movie was the complete definition of ""over- hyped."" I kept waiting for the awesome, or awesomely funny parts. Then...it finally ended. I think the funny part is that they conned so many people into paying between 8-10 bucks to go see it.<br/><br/>Basically it is kind of like a politically correct Zombie movie. They try to humanize a zombie...seriously. They give him feelings, thoughts, etc. I know its a comedy and that aspect isn't lost on me. It has a few minor laughs and I did rate it a 5. A 5 is far more than it deserves and I was kind enough not to rate it a 1,2,or 3.<br/><br/>I know everyone is on the zombie movie kick right now. A light hearted comedy about zombies doesn't sound bad. The fact is though that this boring zombie turd obviously ate what remained of advanced screener's brains and they actually made it out to either be the best zombie movie ever, or at least the funniest one, and what you get when you watch it is maybe, at best....The best, funniest movie that maybe one of the brain dead zombies that you call your idiot children have ever seen. I guess it could be pretty hilarious if I smoked and ounce of weed in the parking lot before I watched it. Then Again most movies are pretty funny after that.<br/><br/>If you took the short yellow bus to school you may rate this one a 10, but for those of us who's brain's still function and blood still pumps, it's a mildly amusing 5."

"barnabyrudge","6","1","3","1 May 2013"," Interesting and unusual zombie film, a fair bit better than it sounds.
","I know what you're thinking. 'Oh dear Lord, no not another teenage-girl-falls-in-love-with-a-monster romance', right? After five mediocre and depressingly humourless. A quick glance at the plot synopsis certainly suggests that Twilight-with-zombies is the best that one could hope for here. However, appearances can be deceptive and Warm Bodies (adapted from a hit novel by Isaac Marion) is a pretty enjoyable and original twist on the concept, bristling with wit and a lot more fun to watch than the afore-mentioned adaptations of Stephenie Meyer's books. It's not perfect by a long shot, but is nevertheless worth a look.<br/><br/>Following a worldwide apocalypse, most of the population has transformed into zombies. In an un-named American city, a handful of human survivors exist within a walled compound. They are surrounded by suburbs full of staggering zombies, hungry for a hearty meal of human brains (weirder still, after devouring brains the zombies are able to experience some of their victims' memories and thoughts). One zombie, known simply as R (Nicholas Hoult), is different from the others. Although slow-moving and barely able to speak, somewhere in his mind there remains a flicker of curiosity, a wider contemplation about what has happened to him, and a dim desire to uncover his past. He lives on an abandoned plane out on a deserted runway, where he collects old bric-a-brac that he has scavenged from the ruined city. During a run-in with human hunters, R spots a human girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) and something within him is inexplicably stirred. He rescues her from being eaten by the others and smuggles her back to his plane, where he promises to protect her for a few days after which he will return her home. Against all odds, R's time with Julie reignites his long-inactive heart, and he begins to gradually metamorphosise into something more 'human'. Julie herself becomes attached to R, and their blossoming relationship stirs human emotions within the other zombies too, suggesting that it may be possible to cure them rather than blowing their brains out. The problem is that Julie's father Grigio (John Malkovich) has dedicated his life to wiping out zombies, building an army of soldiers who go out on regular sorties to kill as many of the walking dead as possible. Will Julie and R be able to convince him that there is another way, or has his frenzied bloodlust driven him past the point of no return?<br/><br/>It soon becomes apparent that Warm Bodies owes more to Romeo and Juliet than Twilight. It's no accident that the main characters are called R and Julie, nor that they find love when their people are meant to be sworn enemies. Just in case you're not getting the parallels, there's even at one point an amusingly played twist on the famous Romeo and Juliet balcony scene. The film gets a lot of mileage from its wry humour and continual insistence of flipping conventions on their head. Hoult gives a warm performance as a character who should be anything but warm; Aussie actress Palmer shows a decent emotional range as the heroine of the piece too, delivering a winning performance which will no doubt result in us seeing plenty more of her over the coming years. Malkovich is his usual dependable self as the grief-stricken zombie killer whose humanity may be too far gone to save. It's a small role but exceptionally well-played, but then you wouldn't expect anything less. There are weaknesses along the way, such as occasional logic loopholes and disappointingly clunky CGI villains in the shape of the 'bonies' (skeletal zombies who have peeled off their flesh and are beyond redemption). With its relatively brief running time, one also wishes from time to time that Warm Bodies would milk its own possibilities a little more – there certainly seems to be scope for an even more in-depth and satisfying look at this fascinating divided apocalyptic society. The film scratches the surface but leaves one lamenting that there isn't more. Overall, however, Warm Bodies is better than expected. The zombie genre is already far too heavily populated, but this film manages to find some new and interesting angles to justify its existence (it's certainly one of the first films – maybe THE first – to be told from the zombie perspective). Give it a look – you could do a lot worse."
"dcobbimdb","7","1","3","25 April 2013"," I liked it, nothing like good clean wholesome zombie fun
","So for those who haven't done their homework this is obviously a very different kind of zombie gig, and being how vampires, zombies, not to mention the imminent and ever approaching zombie apocalypse, mustaches, and glow in the dark zebra print duct tape are all in full bloom now, why not a touchy feely zombie flick? I mean really why not???<br/><br/>Who knows, maybe we as a people have overcooked the same ham time and time again but I do have to say for what it's worth this film is original in that it's from the perspective of a zombie, and not only that but a zombie with thoughts who changes and causes others to change, and all for love. I mean what a sediment...<br/><br/>So anyway, the movie is not one that I'd put in my top 10 list and will probably be forgotten over time as most spoof like movies are for me, but it was put together and flowed rather well. It had a different kind of heartbeat all on it's own (pun intended) and was enjoyable for me to watch. And that really is what it all boils down to is entertainment value right? I don't care if you're watching a movie about aids or a total comedy, if you are entertained and came out of it with something well then isn't that the whole point? This is obviously a lower budget movie with no big stars except for John Malkovich as most zombie like flicks are, but it had a totally different approach as pretty much given away by the trailers and such.<br/><br/>In the end I liked it and wanted to see it first before showing my kids to make sure it was worth watching and not too graphic as they are totally into Plants vs. Zombies gig and all the like and would probably love this and I'll show it to them when it comes out on disk. The movie could have done without the one 'F' word scene although for me it made a good laugh, so eh nothing's perfect. It's by no means a summer Marvel blockbuster nor a Steven Spielberg great, but it stands on it's own and I give it a thumbs up."

"estebangonzalez10","8","1","3","22 April 2013"," We get to see things through a zombie's POV!!!
","¨You miss himlike a boyfriendyou miss your boyfriend? ¨<br/><br/>Jonathan Levine surprised me a couple of years ago with 50/50 and now he tries his luck on a very different genre in Warm Bodies. With the success of The Walking Dead television series the zombie genre is probably as popular as ever, but Levine does something different by turning things around. Instead of having us run away from the incoming brain eating zombies, he puts us inside their heads as we get to see things through a zombie's point of view. The main character's name is R and he is a zombie. We get to experience everything he is thinking as he narrates the film. This is probably what makes this film so fun and entertaining because we get to see this misunderstood zombie grunt and walk around so slowly while his mind processes things so quickly. Zombieland had already broken the predictability of the zombie genre by making fun of the premise, but Warm Bodies takes a different turn in that it makes the zombie one of the protagonists. These zombie eating villains might have a heart after all and we get to experience it in this romantic comedy. Nicholas Hoult, who is also the star of Jack the Giant Slayer, plays the leading zombie in a very funny way using a lot of physical comedy. The fact that he is given some very clever lines also helps this film. The screenplay was adapted by Levine himself from Isaac Marion's novel and it is very loosely based on the Rome and Juliet story (the balcony scene pays homage to that Shakespearean play). Teresa Palmer plays his human love interest with whom she shares great chemistry. She is very talented and the two make this film work thanks to some very funny moments and a touch of romance. Warm Bodies is really well paced and has a little bit of everything, combining comedy with romance and action. It is probably my favorite film of the year so far.<br/><br/>In a near future zombies are now in the top of the food chain, and humans have been reduced to live inside closed walls. R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie living inside an airport with a bunch of other zombies. He seems to be a little tired of his daily routines which involve walking slowly around the airport, spending some time sitting around with his best friend M (Rob Corddry) just grunting at each other, and eventually going out to find something to eat. They have to eat, although they do feel guilty about it. R claims that eating a human brain is what makes them feel alive again as they can access the memories of that person. It is as close to feeling alive as they can ever get. One day they encounter a group of humans who are out looking for pharmaceutics. Julie (Teresa Palmer) is one of the members of the expedition along with her boyfriend, Perry (Dave Franco), and friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton). R ends up eating Perry and gets access to his memories. He ends up falling in love with Julie and decides to protect her from other zombies by spreading some blood over her face and asking her to remain still. R takes her to an abandoned plane inside the airport which he uses as his personal room full of items he collects including some records. R is a different kind of zombie, but this new connection he feels for Julie has made him feel more alive than ever. Not only R begins to feel alive again, but some of the other zombies seem to slowly be recovering their humanity. The problem is that Julie's father, Grigio (John Malkovich), is the general behind the closed walls that is determined to exterminate all the zombies and they are running out of time. <br/><br/>The film is perfectly well paced with some memorably funny and clever moments. The film is funny, romantic, and lots of fun. Levine seems to know his craft and he uses this well known genre as a sort of parable to how through all the new technology we seem to be living as zombies and losing real human connections with each other. This film reminds us of the power of human connection, but that is just one point that Levine tries to get across without seeming to preachy. The film has some very funny performances and some great moments as well. This isn't a perfect film, and I probably enjoyed Zombieland a little more, but it definitely is a new spin on the zombie genre and it really worked for me. I have to give this movie a lot of credit for being so original and taking us inside the rotten mind of a brain eating zombie. Levine once again takes a huge risk here, but it really pays off nicely. One would never expect to be rooting for a lead character like this but you can't help but sympathize for this guy. I had a great time with Warm Bodies!<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"ciera-larose","9","1","3","22 April 2013"," Warm Bodies is the story of a young male zombie and a young woman who form an interesting relationship and embark on an action packed adventure.
","""Warm Bodies"" begins by introducing us to a zombie called ""R"" who shows us around his digs and explains that he doesn't know how he became a zombie, or even who he was before (hence his name, or lack thereof). We then meet Julie and her friends who live in a secure walled city but must leave in order to search for more supplies. While out for food, R and his best friend M encounter Julie and her friends. To make a long story short some of her group dies and for some reason instead of eating Julie, R decides to protect her. The two face several challenges along the ways they begin to develop a strange relationship and R's heart starts to beat again. Action and adventure ensue as they fight to keep other safe and help save the rest of the zombie race as things begin to drastically change.<br/><br/>This film is a good nod to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", basing the characters names off those in the original play, having forbidden love on both sides, even including the iconic balcony scene.<br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" is a movie that's kind of dark and even a little gory but it still manages to be cute. It's also very funny, with most of the laughs being a direct product of R's inner monologues. It's very suspenseful as well, leaving you on the edge of your seat for most of the time. This movie is a comedy with some depth even delivering a subtle hint of satire. This film exhibits a breath of fresh air in its manner of portraying the best elements of a comedy, satire, romance, drama and even a zombie, horror film. Very rarely does a movie manage to capture the very best of so many different genres this gracefully without getting too muddled, but this film definitely accomplished such a feat.<br/><br/>Perhaps what surprised me the most about this movie though, was the overall zombie aspect of it. The zombie make up was superb; scary and a little grotesque without being overly gory. The acting was impeccable and the actors all really did stay true to the genre. I must admit that I was expecting the zombie element to take a firm back seat to the ""rom-com"" plot of this movie; however I'm glad to see that that wasn't the case.<br/><br/>Nicholas Holt was magnetic; he managed to give a heart warming performance as a zombie. He was funny, quick witted, and quite charming. He had great chemistry with his costar Teresa Palmer (Julie) he was very protective and caring. His relationship with fellow cast mate Rob Corddry (M) was thoroughly entertaining. Hey had great chemistry and a beautiful bromance. In my opinion, Corddry comes pretty darn close to stealing the show. He much like Nicholas Holt's ""R"" was funny and quick witted; he was also very loyal, charming and protective of his friends. I really enjoyed watching the two male lead characters evolve. Teresa Palmer who plays another lead role, Julie was captivating; she much like her make count parts, was funny, caring and protective. Her chemistry with Nicholas Holt was great fun to watch. Dave Franco had a relatively small role as the ""boyfriend"" but he performed it well; and Analeigh Tipton rounds out the cast nicely as Julie's best friend. She does an excellent job and really helps sell the ""rom-com"" ""chick flick"" angle of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a great nod to the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" story. It handled the multitude of genres gracefully and with ease; each genre was portrayed perfectly. The zombie elements of this film were superb; the costumes, makeup, mannerisms and the acting was all fantastic. The cast was great and they each portrayed their characters flawlessly. I think this movie is most definitely worth a watch."

"tibineagu","8","1","3","20 March 2013"," God, I hate Hollywood!
","I may be wrong to feel special here, but I think I've had the fortune of reading Marion's book after the first trailer of the film had been released. So, I had a face to put to the characters, and every passage of the book was a delight for my imagination. So, in many ways, I had already seen the best version of the film, right here in my head.<br/><br/>Having said that, I went to see this film with high expectations. And, mind you, most of them were met, quite elegantly and actually managing to bring more definition to the pictures inside my head (Malkovich as Grigio, the 'Boneys' and the desolated cityscape being some of them). The story was often so closely tied to the narrative in the book that at times I felt as if I was re-reading it. The characters' lines stay true to the original context, and a lot of the very funny scenes in the book were played flawlessly. Nicholas Hoult is perfect as R. He gets the 'shrug' down to an art, and even though they've reduced the internal monologue and made him more talkative than in the book, he stays true to the original character.<br/><br/>Adding to all that is the soundtrack -- the incredibly well chosen soundtrack, nothing any other Zombie movie could ever hope for. Bruce Springsteen. Bob Dylan. Guns N'Roses. Feist! M83! In perfect sync with their scenes. This was not a zombie movie. This wasn't a rom-com. This felt like one of those films that wasn't made for the box office, that wanted to transmit the feeling of the book, and added music as topping. <br/><br/>-- spoilers start here --<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Levine decided to skip on what I think are some key scenes. The zombies' evolution seems too abrupt (M becomes quite chatty all of the sudden) and we don't really get too much of a glimpse into their world. As for Julie's character - while she still transmits the feeling of liveliness really well, there's something missing about her - she just doesn't feel as innocent and as candid. It's not about Teresa Palmer (she's quite good), it has probably to do with the rather short run time of the film. I feel that 10 more minutes might have made a great difference in terms of the cohesion of the story.<br/><br/>But it was actually the decision to make the climax into a ""real"" zombie action scene, a ""mano a mano"" fight with the 'Boneys', something to bring together the humans and 'corpses', that feels the most out of place. That's why I hate Hollywood, and that's probably the only bone I would pick against this film.<br/><br/>So there you have it. A film with a fresh approach, an excellent soundtrack, some very funny scenes involving Rob Corddry, quite a few heart-warming (pun not intended) scenes, and even a zombie fight to keep the moviegoers satisfied. If you haven't read the book and don't have a complete repulsion for zombies, you'll find it even better.<br/><br/>8/10"
"pagan1-2","8","1","3","6 March 2013"," Funny, charming and even somewhat thoughtful
","I decided to watch Warm Bodies because of the funny and fast paced trailer, which suggested something like Zombieland + Romance. The movie turned out quite differently: It was of much slower pacing than expected and only featured a few uninspired and generic action scenes, but in my opinion it scored quite high in other fields.<br/><br/>The characters, humans and zombies alike, were very likable and have been performed convincingly. The general sentiment of the movie was warm and kind and, although always on the edge of stereotyped cliché, never overdoing it. The characters showed some development and i really enjoyed the growing romance between the two main protagonists. Fortunately the cautious borrowing from Romeo & Juliet was integrated nicely into the movie and not striking in your face, like in some other recent productions.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie was deep or ambitious, but it featured some interesting themes like ""wandering around, not knowing why or where to go"", ""looking behind the surface"" or some spot on zombificated versions of real life romance / relationship building.<br/><br/>One of the best ""young adult"" romantic comedies currently around and it really strikes out of the all those other one-dimensional and superficial movies of that genre."
"chibirinoa","8","1","4","16 May 2013"," Really? Some of these reviewers don't seem to understand this movie at all.

If you go in expecting a zombie shooting action movie, you'll be disappointed, though it does have its share of action sequences. If you go in expecting a gory horror zombie thriller, you'll be disappointed, though it's not completely without gore or danger.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you go in expecting an odd but ultimately sweet love story, with plenty of witty humor, a few action sequences and shootouts here and there, and an uplifting message about the human condition, then you'll be right on the money.<br/><br/>That said, I did feel slightly disappointed that they left out some of my favorite scenes from the book, although I suppose those somewhat darker scenes wouldn't really fit in with the lighter tone they chose for the movie. And if you haven't read the book, you'll never know the difference anyway.<br/><br/>In short: this is a greatly enjoyable movie, as long as you don't expect it to be things it isn't.

","I was never.. never a zombie movie fan. It has always been a plot that I could not digest. Initially, I had the Jack and the Giant Slayer in my mind when I planned to go for a movie. However, one thing let to another I found myself convincing my family members to go for this movie instead. Perhaps the trailer that my brother showed me some months ago played a huge part in it. This zombie movie was nothing like any other zombie movies that I have watched. It was an unusual plot - very different and was presented in a way that was so enjoyable. Kudos to Isaac Marion for a creative thinking and Jonathan Levine for a powerful narration. Despite some scenes of discomfort (which i accepted as after all it is a zombie movie) it was largely entertaining. I also found the movie quite hilarious especially the scenes where we get to hear the inner voice of R. Nicholas Hoult played his part brilliantly meanwhile Teresa Palmer captures our heart with her beauty just the way she has made the zombie feel in the movie. The supporting characters made their presents felt too. So, take my word for it - this one is a good one!"
"willsgb","7","1","4","24 February 2013"," not perfect... but you can still warm to it;
","I went to see this with a lady friend of mine, in a really intimate screen with only 40 odd seats, and we and everyone else in the theatre had a good laugh at what is essentially a comedy, with a good sense of parody and amusement; it did have a dramatic element to it too, which is where it seemed to come off the rails, a little, for me.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes, where R shuffles around the airport and introduces us to his world with his mentally delivered narration are brilliant, and left me terribly enthused about how it would unfold; his best friend at the bar, and the revelation that they could actually squeeze out a word or two, as well as the bonies, were intriguing and gave the zombie phenomenon in this story an identity and a logic which engaged me; I enjoyed the equal portions of comedy and brutality in the scene where he meets and takes Julie, too - not to mention that annoying intern from season 9 of Scrubs getting killed and his brain eaten by our main man/zombie - and settled back to enjoy the rest of the film. With it being a comedy they could have chosen a goofier route, but gratifyingly tried to retain a sense of an actual zombie apocalypse, producing comedy that shined through the otherwise bleak horror of it, which enhanced the comedy as far as I'm concerned. I also particularly loved the plot point that eating brains allowed the zombies to watch the memories of their victim; that was interesting and well presented in the film.<br/><br/>Then, it becomes apparent that R is starting to reanimate, miraculously... and then his best friend and other non-bony zombies at the airport also start showing signs of reviving, tangibly regaining a pulse and whatnot, seemingly triggered by R and Julie's burgeoning relationship and memories of a normal life and relationships garnered from posters at the airport... hmm.<br/><br/>The first Pokemon movie had the same plot point. Ash gets turned to stone when Mew and Mewtwo face off, but then Pikachu and all the pokemon and their clones who Mewtwo created start crying and basically their emotions, i.e. their tears bring Ash back to life. Just saying.<br/><br/>I'm not writing this movie off, in spite of that. For one thing, it has plenty of hilarious lines, particularly Hoult's narration, American accent an' all, and even when it does get a little goofy and girly with Julie and her friend applying make-up, there's an interesting aspect that makes that worthwhile;<br/><br/>Allow me to explain. In Twelfth Night, the character Viola dresses up as a man, disguising herself to fit in and work, which made for an interesting performance because female parts in plays were usually played by young, possibly androgynous men in Shakespeare's day - therefore, if you went to see Twelfth Night at the Globe or wherever back then, you'd have watched a man playing Viola, a woman pretending to be a man. Interesting, right! the make-up thing is a nod to that, i think, because Hoult wears zombie make-up for his role as a zombie in the film, who is then given make-up in the story by the girls to in turn look like a human.<br/><br/>This reference to Shakespeare is of course pertinent because R and Julie have obvious parallels with Romeo and Juliet, not least the balcony scene which precedes the make-up scene, Julie's dad played by Malkovich not accepting the relationship - at first, anyway - and of course the overriding sentiment that love can break down all barriers.<br/><br/>In addition to this particularly 'romantic' edge, there were also plenty of moments where the pedant in me strained against certain plot points and moments in the film, such as where R managed to successfully break into the human stronghold and even find Julie's house without detection, or Julie not reacting with more anger or despair when R eventually admitted he was the one who killed her Scrubs boyfriend, or even when the bonies don't jump after R and Julie at the end, and other little things like that, but ultimately, it wasn't enough to spoil the film, which was pretty funny throughout and also interesting enough to be a worthwhile experience. it embodied the symbiosis between a zombie apocalypse and a romantic comedy as well as it could and the body of work was generally well made. Depending on who you are, you might not be especially enamoured with some aspects of the film but I did warm to it and we all had a laugh and it helped make my evening with Ash a lovely one so I'll give this one a 7/10!"

But with Warm Bodies you get a completely new take on the whole franchise. The end of the world happens via Zombie Apocalypse and the survivors have to learn to scavenge for food and supplies and hunt Zombies and the whole thing. Then one Zombie sees one girl and a semblance of humanity is reborn within him, and with it--hope.<br/><br/>The story is sweet and cute, avoiding all of the typical genre trappings. The two leads (both unknown to me) play their parts very well. The girl (who resembles Kristen Stewart in certain lights) showing all of the frustration with the way life is after they are pushed to the brink of extinction very believably, and he showing the unusual emotions and thoughts of his wayward, seemingly mindless character in such a way that you think to yourself that it can't be all bad being a Zombie. Analeigh Tipton (from Crazy, Stupid Love) is there as a supporting best friend to the lead female and provides some comedic relief (to an already witty and laugh out loud funny film) and reason to those characters who would otherwise be as mindless as the Zombies they attack.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this movie is one of its gems. The movie kicks it off with ""I ain't missing you"" by John Waite, and later ""Pretty Woman"" by Roy Ordison. Your head will be bobbing the entire time. For those who enjoy the classic blood thirsty element, there is plenty of that stuff too. The movie has it's fair share of death and mindless Zombie attacks.<br/><br/>All in all a very pleasant viewing. I give this movie a 7.3 out of 10."

","""Warm Bodies"" is a nicely directed post-apocalyptic love story--that is at the very least--a fresh approach to a zombie film that is fully realized, and flushed out to satisfaction. ""Warm Bodies"" is a light comedy, which is often witty and consistently enjoyable. Levine's latest is well shot and possesses impressive production values. The film lacks any real thrills or major conflicts, but the romantic and comedic aspects are pleasant and effectively delivered with fine all around performances, while Jonathan Levine exhibits his skillful abilities behind the camera.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (""50/50""), and adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion, ""Warm Bodies"" takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, following a plague that has wiped out millions. The remaining humans live behind a wall, surrounded by soldiers led by the human leader Grigio (John Malkovich). Meanwhile, the zombies mostly shuffle around an abandoned airport, only making occasional trips outside to feed on the living. Nicholas Hoult, our protagonist zombie named R, is amusing--stumbling and grunting his way around the airport. R explains his feelings in the voice-over narration, so the audience is always aware of his dreams and desires, and what is actually possible. When he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer), he is at the ultimate disadvantage - he's dead.<br/><br/>On a feeding encounter with a human gathering party, R meets Julie and feels an urge to protect her. This sparks the beginnings of a strangely warm relationship that causes R to start to regain his humanity. As this change spreads throughout the undead population, Julie and R eventually find they are facing a larger issue--even as their friendship is challenged. <br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" lacks the ability to surprise, which makes it seems longer than it. However, Levine does a good job with the screenplay, balancing the right amount of fun and romance, as well as human dialogue with 'zombie talk.' Simply put, ""Warm Bodies"" is heart-warming and charming, when it could easily have been a romantic zombie disaster."
"TBWarrior720","8","1","4","8 February 2013"," Socially Aware Allegory plus Zombies
","This movie seems like it could appeal to audience members looking for comedy, romance, or action. (If you're looking for a suspenseful horror movie you're gonna have a bad time.) While Warm Bodies offers a small bit of action, a few warm chuckles, and quite a bit of romance, it excels most as being a socially aware allegory that reaches out to a wide audience because of its incorporation of zombies, which seem to be big ticket sellers of todays pop culture. While the two main character's names, and a balcony scene, alludes to a certain Shakespearian play, the zombie's awkward behavior and inability to communicate with one another, the human's fear and hostility towards the zombies, the exclusive walled city the humans live in, and the dark, looming shadow of the ""bonies"" are all articles of a deep allegory which I can't really tell you about without using spoilers."
"gregeichelberger","6","1","4","3 February 2013"," Twisting the zombie tale
","Like last year's plot-bending tale of teen slaughter and urban legends which was given a nice new treatment (with a healthy side of comedy) in Drew Goddard's ""Cabin In the Woods,"" this new release tries to turn the overused and often clichéd premise of the zombie film on its ear.<br/><br/>Writer/director Jonathan Levine (""50/50"") has adapted the Isaac Marion novel which tells the story from the undead's point of view, mixing other stories such ""28 Days Later,"" ""Zombieland,"" ""Grindhouse (Planet Terror),"" the ""Resident Evil,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Mummy"" franchises and even mixing in Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet.""<br/><br/>The results, although a bit uneven and nonsensical at times, nevertheless makes a fairly entertaining experience. And while most of the cast, with the possible exceptions of John Malkovich (""Red"") as the zombie-phobic general and Rob Corddry (""Cedar Rapids,"" ""Hot Tub Time Machine"") are not very recognizable, there is enough humor and slight action to keep the tweeners happy.<br/><br/>Adults will have to be content with comparing the movie to other - sometimes - better efforts, and the quirky factor may never quite reach its full potential, but at just 97 minutes it does enough to keep this zom-rom-com in the positive category. Be aware, however, that 97 minutes is just about the limit a picture like this can sustain itself.<br/><br/>In the not-too-distant future, in an unnamed metropolis, a strange plague has caused the living deaths of thousands. These unfortunate creatures, while not completely physically expired, nonetheless shuffle about the city's airport, for seemingly no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>Representing this rabble is the laconic (okay, most EVERYONE is laconic in this film) narrator and lead character, R (Nicholas Hoult, ""X-Men: First Class"" and the boy in ""About a Boy""), who by the very fact he is narrating the movie means he is a few steps about your average zombie. He does, however, look like a cross between Johnny Depp in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and Robert Patterson in the ""Twilight"" series, so the creepy factor has to be overcome before his true humanity can be realized.<br/><br/>While he, M (Corddry) and a group of hungry compatriots are on a food run, they meet up with a group of survivors who have left the safety of the wall to search for medical supplies. Led by Julie (Teresa Palmer, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" ""I Am Number Four"") - the daughter of the general - and her boyfriend, Perry (David Franco, ""Superbad,"" ""21 Jump Street""), this group was supposedly trained by the vast and heavily armed military units which secure the human perimeter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these youngsters are not very good at their jobs and end up being ambushed and (most of them) become a light snack, especially Perry, who is given a new meaning to the term ""brain food."" Evidently, when a zombie munches on the gray matter, it is the only way they can revive memories, since their own are long-dormant.<br/><br/>Captured by R, Julie fears the worst, but the zombie is not like the others, or at least he does not show her his violent, non-living side. He secures her in his private 737 abode and keeps her ""safe"" from the others by teaching her to ""act"" dead (not much of a stretch for this actress).<br/><br/>Despite his warnings, though, and several examples of him having to save her life, she still continues to wander about as the only living human in this deadly apocalyptic realm. And while she can fool the mostly lethargic, slow-moving newly dead creatures, she is much more vulnerable to the ""Bonies,"" those undead who have just given up, stripped off their skin and now ""eat anything with a heartbeat"" (which is sort of what REGULAR zombies do, so I'm not exactly sure of the difference other than appearance).<br/><br/>With the help of some vintage vinyl LPs and a montage backed with either totally recognizable classic rock songs or tunes we've never heard of, Julie begins to see that perhaps R is not a lost cause and her spark has given him a heartbeat and a reason to live. Dad, of course, does not believe this (he still harbors a resentment of the plague victims since they ate his wife), but now, because they can discern a beating organ, the Bonies are now after them both.<br/><br/>It's not just R who is changing, however, M and many of the others are seeing this zombie thing as a passing phase, but the question is can they make the transition fast enough before the humans blow their heads off or the Bonies devour them? <br/><br/>The picture is fantasy, of course, but there are a few nagging breaches of logic, such as why the soldiers - who have heavy weapons and armor -do not search for the medicine themselves instead of sending out inexperienced teenagers (and why the general's daughter would go out in the first place); and how R was able to move his entire home into the jet (did he feel the undeadism coming on and just decide to pack everything over the weekend before it took full effect?).<br/><br/>Then, there is the question of how the Bonies, who are basically recycled zombies, are able to move 10 times as fast as well as scale large buildings and obstacles with seemingly little or no effort.<br/><br/>But, just when we thought the concept had run its course with the hilarious ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun Of the Dead,"" Levine does pump some new life in the genre and wisely keeps it at just the right time before the idea ultimately collapses within itself."
"KineticSeoul","6","1","5","18 May 2013"," Nothing special...Despite the premise
","I really wanted to be entertained with this flick but I just didn't find this movie to be all that enjoyable as I wanted it to be. If you seen the trailer everything about this flick is predictable and they put all the best parts in the trailer. Although this happens often and just lacked good development, emotion and humor. It's a romance flick that might get guy's attention since it's about a romance between a zombie and a human girl. But that is basically the only unique thing about this flick. What irritated me the most is the constant plot-holes that just doesn't make any sense. Usually I try to look past this but it just becomes to much. It's like they just didn't care and wanted to make a zombie romance flick. There is also this group of monsters called the Boneys, it's basically monsters that transformed from being zombies after a long period of time. But they are just in this flick so the humans and zombies can have a common enemy. The script just didn't seem well crafted or unique despite the human zombie relationship aspect of this story. Vampire romance has been done many times, even werewolves and other monsters or creatures and now it's zombies. And that is where this movie falters, it's just quickly becomes boring despite the premise. It's a watchable movie and better than the ""Twilight"" flick but just nothing special. I wouldn't be shocked if the makers of this was inspired by a video on Youtube called ""Zombie Love Song"" which is a more entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>6.2/10"
"tash-taylor","10","1","5","19 March 2013"," Amazing Film!
","This is my definitely favourite film at the moment. It is a great story. It's about a zombie apocalypse in the future. But with a slight twist. Who would ever expect a zombie romance? It's such an original idea and is produced outstandingly.<br/><br/>We follow the story and emotions of 'R' (Nicholas Hoult) who protects Julie (Teresa Palmer) from another zombie at the beginning of the film. Throughout the film we get to see how both characters feel about each other and the way they slowly come together. 'R' begins to change as becomes more attached to Julie. <br/><br/>The story is full of love, humour and suspense as we watch and wait to see what happens. It's definitely worth watching. I've never seen another film like this!"
"abcvision","9","1","5","13 February 2013"," Heartwarming
","In Warm Bodies the world is in shambles, the population is split between the zombies, the skeletons, and the humans. Julie seeks refuge outside the bubble of existence and gets in a bit a trouble, only to befriend a zombie who takes a liking to her. This unexpected adventure seeks to understand the divide between the living and the dead. Some good intense scenes and with John Malkovich, you are taken on a wild naughty adventure. It gives new meaning to the old maxim ""can't we simply get along?"" The movie does a good job of making light the often serious consequences of turning into a zombie. It also showcases how youth is wasted on the young and sometimes they see what their elders fail to admit."
"Hellmant","7","1","7","7 February 2013"," The film is not nearly as bad as 'TWILIGHT' (it's not even in the same league)!
","'WARM BODIES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>A zombie romance film based on the popular 2011 book, of the same name, by Isaac Marion. The film was written for the screen and directed by Jonathan Levine (Levine also directed the exceptional 2011 comedy-drama film about cancer called '50/50'). This film stars Nicholas Hoult (who's most well known as 'Beast' in the latest 'X-MEN' films, in which he met his now ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence) as a zombie who is self aware and starts to become more and more human as he falls in love with a human survivalist (played by Teresa Palmer). It co-stars Rob Corddry, Analeigh Tipton, Dave Franco and John Malkovich. It's an interesting and unique take on the classic zombie film (as well as romance and it's been compared to 'Romeo and Juliet'). Whether it works or not is debatable but I mostly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The film is set in a zombie apocalypse where most of the human population has been turned into the undead, either the 'classic zombie' or a more severely inhuman skeletal like zombie creature known as 'bonies'. The surviving human population lives in a walled off enclave and are led by General Grigio (Malkovich). One day the General's daughter, Julie (Palmer), leads a group of her friends, including her boyfriend Perry (Franco) and best friend Nora (Tipton), out into zombie land to find medical supplies. They're attacked by zombies and Perry is killed by one, who's later known as R (Hoult). R is self aware (and narrates the film) and is immediately drawn to Julie. When R eats Perry's brain he's able to see his memories and learn more about her. He quickly develops feelings for Julie and rescues her from the other zombies and takes her to an abandoned airplane at a nearby airport. There the two oddly get to know each other as R becomes more and more humanlike.<br/><br/>The film has been praised and condemned for being the first zombie romance but it's not actually the first of it's kind. There's another zombie-romance-comedy film (a 25 minute short) on YouTube called 'REVENGE OF THE DEAD' (written, directed by and starring Tim Hellman) and it's a much better film. The movie has also been compared to 'TWILIGHT' for taking another classic monster film genre and turning it into a sappy romance; involving a 'hot' young girl falling for a 'hot' young monster. The film is not nearly as bad as 'TWILIGHT' (it's not even in the same league)! It's much better acted, much more cleverly written and much better directed. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. I don't like all of the liberties it takes with the genre and Malkovich and Corddry are wasted in the film (what's the point in casting Rob Corddry if he doesn't have any lines, he's only a genius comedian because of what he says and how he says it). Palmer is strikingly beautiful in the film and a nice tough heroine (much better than Kristen Stewart) and Hoult is decent as her zombie love interest (which is much more than anyone can say for Robert Pattinson or Taylor Lautner). The movie isn't a great zombie film but it's a nice change (for the most part).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP2Kjuc4BQY"

But, the 2nd half of the film really picks up. There's a good amount of action, I became invested in the ""relationship"" and the plot just all fell together really nicely and ended how you would want it to!<br/><br/>I will say that if you are putting it on because you want to watch a comedy.

The film starts out with first person narration from ""R"", a zombie.

If they can regain that connection, they can be cured or at any rate, not smell as bad.<br/><br/>In this tale ""R"" consumes the brains of Julie's boyfriend and gains his memory. This starts a platonic relationship where they protect each other from each other's world. ""R"" is a horder who lives in a plane. Julie's dad (John Malkovich) is the leader of zombie killers. The introduction of young kids with pseudo patriotic themes is a satire of the ""Red Dawn"" movies.<br/><br/>There are some questions that arise.
1) How do the skeletons, i.e. ""bonies"" stay together without falling apart?
2) How does a record player operate after 8 years into a zombie apocalypse with no electricity?

Despite the zombie apocalypse being in full flow Warm Bodies was a mostly light hearted as the relationship budding between R and Julie. However when there was action in the third act it was very small scale and the limited budget was obvious.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies was a decent offering and worked best as a new twist on zombie genre by looking at zombies themselves, giving them personalities and desires.

"BA_Harrison","8","0","2","10 June 2015"," A refreshingly different kind of zombie film.
","R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who spends his days shuffling aimlessly around an airport, snacking on the brains of any human who might stray across his path—but he hasn't lost all of his human qualities just yet: he still has interesting thoughts, can grunt the odd word to his zombie pal M (Rob Corddry), and enjoys listening to music.<br/><br/>Julie (Teresa Palmer) is one of a handful of survivors who occupy the city behind the safety of a massive wall. When she takes part in a mission to the dead zone to find supplies, she comes under attack from zombies, but is saved by R, who—having just eaten her boyfriend's brains—begins to have feelings for the girl.<br/><br/>With other zombies on the prowl, including the terrifying 'bonies' (the zombies who have deteriorated the most), R insists that Julie spends several days in the safety of his home, a deserted passenger jet; as R's feelings for Julie become stronger, he discovers that he is gradually becoming more human.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies not only works well as a charming, unorthodox romance but also as a smart allegorical tale about how society has become dehumanized to the point where many people sleepwalk through life in a zombie-like state, glued to their mobile phones, only communicating via social media or experiencing life through other people's Facebook accounts. It is only when a spark is ignited by someone who is truly alive that a 'zombie' can begin the gradual journey back from the dead.<br/><br/>With gentle comedy, romance, action, brain eating, AND social commentary, Warm Bodies is a welcome and innovative addition to the zombie genre that offers something to delight almost every demographic. Hoult, currently appearing in cinemas as war-boy Nux in Mad Max Fury Road, is on particularly fine-form, absolutely nailing the zombie routine. Who would have thought that that bowl-haired kid with the weird eyebrows from About A Boy would turn out to be such a star?"

Quirky doesn't even begin to describe Warm Bodies. Based on Isaac Marion's novel of the same title, Warm Bodies is a zombie tale from the zombie perspective in a hilarious and original fashion. The jokes are dry and odd and put a spin on the humdrum aspects of real life. The re-imagination of the zombie apocalypse through the infected's eyes is fresh and innovative.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult is R, R because that is all he can remember from his old life and human name. Oh yeah, did we mention R is the star of the film and a zombie? Just as the tagline of the film states, he is dead but he is getting warmer. Only Hoult could play a flesh eating zombie and make the audience feel the character's humanity. With subtle nuances in posture and glances, Hoult is entertainingly laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>""It's the end of the world as we know it"" seems to be a theme with movies in recent times, doesn't leave much hope for the future.

","Otherwise known as Romeo and Juliet in Zombie Apocalypse, also despite the overwhelming Twilight vibe oozing from it, Warm Bodies is a funny undead flick and quiet charming in its wordless execution. Its self-aware lightly toned comedy composes lay back youthful attitude in the form of a zombie's monologues and his deficit on vocabulary. The antique plot may seem rigidly predictable, fortunately it has some freedom on delivery, making it a fresh tongue-in-cheek dystopian humor since Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult as R, is a good pick for the lively-minded undead protagonist. He has tall thin frame and apparent cheek bones, making him a believable zombie after a few touch of pasty foundations, all while cosplaying as the latest apparition of Dante. To his credit, this role suits him perfectly, he has minor motions that are cleverly stiff and humorous, which fits the novel sensation of courting living female. It's amazing that with much scarcer lines, he triumphs over his role as the recent Jack, the digital giant killer.<br/><br/>Julie, played by Teresa Palmer, is your typical blond gorgeous chick. She moves rather well, although not full blown action star yet, but she makes for a convincing role of someone who grows up in cryptic world with daddy issue. Her emotions are expressed gradually, she has natural ambiance and it will attract the young audience, and even if she didn't stand out much in acting department, her looks elevate her performance. John Malkovich as the source of Julie's daddy issue is emotionally imposing. He has the air of someone you don't want to mess with, standing near to antagonism.<br/><br/>Graphically, it's captivating. The world after zombie virus is depicted with great cinematography, barren gray dye, and still pertains few of its charms, which are subtly placed beneath a crumbling civilization. The set might be grim, but it doesn't depress, landmarks and trivial places have distinct salvageable atmosphere to them. Its use of make-up and wardrobe is simple, most often lacking color as R's red lackluster jacket, it emphasizes the little humanity left without going full zombie.<br/><br/>CG for skeletal extremely-dead undead is rather plastic, it's obviously fake. There are some plot devices that are set conveniently as well. Details like these might not ruin the enjoyment, but they still register as annoyances. Warm Bodies is a quirky amusing twist of old ideas, it is wittily written and warmly entertaining."

I went into this expecting to dislike it (the history of teenage based romance films is obviously not great), but ended up loving it as the film hit all the right notes for me and was a pleasant surprise.

","I'm usually not the kind of person that watches all the newest films and follows all the latest treads. Hollywood likes to group movie trends together. Last year everyone liked vampires, now its zombies. I hadn't even heard of this movie, but my friend really wanted to see it, so I agreed to watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised. This was a fantastic movie! It's not your typical zombie teen romance film, It was a lot more than that. I loved the change of perspective. Usually a movie like this would tell the humans side of the story, but this one told the zombies side, which I thought was really unique and I loved it. I think this was the first time I ever felt feelings for a zombie. I also thought the actors were great. I loved Nicholas Hoult as R. He was perfect for the part and acted it out fantastically, you actually believed he was a zombie. Teresa Palmer was good, but not great. I didn't really like her character, but I guess that's not her fault. The character of Julie acted rude and snobby towards R, despite the fact that he saved her life multiple times, It was only till the end that she started to warm up to him, which I thought was kind of bizarre. Over all, this movie really touched me. I thought It was beautiful, mildly funny, and just a breath of fresh air. The ending was especially great. I loved how this movie told that love could even bring the dead back to life, even though that isn't very realistic, but screw reality."

Warm Bodies is an intelligent, warm love story that includes themes of redemption and interpersonal communication. The simple but effective Romeo and Juliet type plot is well crafted, the actors do a very good job, and it is directed flawlessly. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. A good candidate for those couples who can't agree on a chick flick or a horror movie.

","I got interested in watching this movie because of the accidental trailer playing after I watched another movie trailer. The trailer was funnily inviting, I was gonna watched Hurt Locker but then I decided to try this instead. It was interesting, very different from other zombie movies. First few minutes was interesting, it's funny (or rather tragic) to be hearing zombie's thoughts. I have to admit the first half hour after the first ten minutes of the movie was kinda slow paced and I was starting to dozed off but I was so curious with the ending of the movie so I kept watching. A very refreshing break from the gory zombies on the Walking Dead. Going to recommend this to friends for sure!"
"FEmalediction","8","0","1","12 October 2013"," Kind of like a zombie fairytale...
","When I first heard about this movie, as a huge fan of the zombie genre, I was not impressed. I deliberately avoided watching this movie because it goes against everything I love about zombies.<br/><br/>However, I stumbled across the trailer for it, found there to be some humour and decided to give it a go. I was very pleasantly surprised. Apart from the very loose references to Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, this film has an original twist to the otherwise unchanging zombie genre.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult does an excellent job at channeling the typical awkward teenager in zombie form, and I found his inner dialogue to be the shining star of the film. Teresa Palmer delivers as the female counterpart, incorporating humour and womanly power throughout the film. Rob Corddry was hilarious as usual, although I felt he could have stuttered over his words a bit more, rather than speaking so fluently as a zombie. John Malkovich was awesome, he always is, but I would have loved to have seen some humour come from his character.<br/><br/>The direction was great, loved the cinematography, and the soundtrack suits the film perfectly.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite plausible within the zombie genre, I mean, if the dead can rise and eat brains, why can't they come back to life through simple human contact? Zombies are already a fantastical idea, so anyone saying this movie isn't 'realistic', must have forgotten that zombies aren't realistic, well they aren't yet!<br/><br/>I actually found the 'bonies' to be quite scary, and believable that there are two stages to the 'zombification' of former humans.<br/><br/>Although overall this is meant to be a romantic movie, I didn't feel as though it was overly mushy (I'm not one for chick flicks), it had a great story, and it's one of those rare zombie movies where there really is a happy ending, and we all need that every now and then."

","Zombies, shuffling living dead with decomposing bodies and dead eyes, craving human brains to sustain them.<br/><br/>But what if you were a Zombie and were conflicted about it, going through the motions, the shuffling, mumbling and munching but maybe with a trace of humanity left, could you be saved? Turning the traditional Zombie flick on it's head, this has ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) finding his inner human when confronted with a pretty vivacious victim, wanting to protect her rather than chow down on the usual grey matter.<br/><br/>Making a Zombie/Human love story has significant risks but largely the film pulls it off. This is mainly down to good casting with Hoult and Teresa Palmer as ""Julie"" making for a good couple, notwithstanding the obvious obstacles in the path of true love.<br/><br/>Following the usual zombie apocalypse, ""R"" lives in a deserted airliner complete with vinyl based music system, as it sounds purer, who knew that zombies had such audiophile good taste. When the surviving humans venture outside their protective wall for food and medical supplies, they are at risk. Capturing or saving ""Julie"", after a reasonably scary opening sequence, the film makes fun of the genre, as ""R"" teaches his new girlfriend how to mumble and shuffle. Less is more, is the approach in case you are ever faced with that situation.<br/><br/>The shocks are reasonably scary, the gore is largely off screen or implied, in keeping with the PG certificate, which overall is a good choice for this light and frothy tale.<br/><br/>Of course no zombie film can exist without the military turning up with assorted weaponry, this time complicated by the leader of the group ""Grigio"" (John Malkovich) being the father of ""Julie"". Understandably this father/daughter dynamic changes the story somewhat.<br/><br/>There is also a pecking order of zombies with ""Bonies"", which are provided by CGI, the lowest of the low and irredeemable. This provides a handy disposable enemy, should events turnaround later.<br/><br/>Julies friend ""Nora"" (Tipton) adds to the fun, when the pair decide to makeover ""R"" to make him more presentable, or even ""hot"". If only the internet was available to enable them to update their Facebook page, ""Bummer"".<br/><br/>There are faults, the dialogue is occasionally clunky, Malkovich gets very little to do and ""R"" manages to recover his vocabulary remarkably quickly. The post apocalyptic world is presented believably, albeit on a budget and the effects are more than adequate. The story, once it makes the turn, gets wrapped up rather quickly and neatly, not outstaying its welcome at a short 98 minutes.<br/><br/>There might have been a better story for a third act, drawing parallels with certain administrations whereby the authorities are actually the bad guys using the threat of ""zombies"" to control the masses. Zombie threat inconveniently disappears but they have no wish to give up power but this is not that film.<br/><br/>Instead the story is about love or connection and the power of redemption it can bring. Although the film does add a touch of irony when the ""real world"" is seen, with everyone in their own private world with their mobile phones.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Good fun with a few scares, essentially a love story wrapped up in a zombie flick, a perfect date movie perhaps?"
"con_au","9","0","1","1 October 2013"," Warm movie!
","Julie and ''R' are star-crossed lovers (yep, there's even a balcony scene). He's a member of the living dead and she's the daughter of the head honcho responsible for what's left of the post-apocalyptic human world. Wandering alone through an airport, R has been left with a tiny pilot light of humanity left in his corpse, making him capable of thought and feeling. And his feeling is mostly lonely. He meets his Juliet while she is raiding for supplies and the pilot light ignites. Overcoming his zombie urge to eat her up, R saves her and starts his road to redemption, dragging the rest of man-, and zombie-kind, with him. Monster movies are never really about the monsters. They're about humans, the nature of humanity and our flawed and/or triumphant responses to what is unknown or different. Warm Bodies spells that out for us as R and a growing number of the undead start to exhume themselves and it's the warm-blooded, in particular John Malkovich as the broken father, and father- figure, who have to de-monsterfy themselves. Anchored by strong performances from its two young leads, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer (as well as a nice turn by Rob Coddry as R's wing-man), Warm Bodies is funny and sweet. It's pretty low on the splatter-factor for a zombie film, and a few of the sfx and make-up components could have been better but ultimately this is zombie dystopia on a very intimate scale, so no huge foul there. There's also a bit of imagery at the end that I found heavy-handed - the message had already been well-made. Rushing to judgement, putting up walls, closing ourselves down - these might all be ways of protecting ourselves, but they also close us off to possibilities. The redemptive power of love and kindness is the theme sustaining Warm Bodies and it manages to only tip the cheese-meter a little bit in its delivery, making for genuinely enjoyable viewing."
"JPfanatic93","7","0","1","23 September 2013"," Delightful zomromcom
","Zombies admittedly are having a big break on the silver screen this year. While World War Z is the sort of epic flick meant for the usual audiences blockbuster movies are made for, the zom-romcom Warm Bodies should attract crowds looking for more unusual horrific fare, and even – gods willing – teenage girls that want to fill the gap left by the finale of the Twilight movies by exploring similar themed films. Fortunately, the fact this movie combines thematic elements from the horror genre with all the qualities of romance is as far as the parallel between Twilight and Warm Bodies ought to be drawn, as the latter is a delightful off-beat comedy that hopefully will stay a one-shot instead of being milked for many more movies to come. The film follows R (Nicholas Hoult of X-Men: First Class and Jack the Giant Slayer fame), a teenage zombie male who does what zombies usually do: incoherently move about the place looking for people to eat, either alone or in a pack with his undead friends. One day he happens upon the brains of a living teenage boy, and after devouring them finds he is attracted to his girlfriend Julie (Teresa Palmer), the sole survivor of the zombie attack that claimed her boyfriend's life. Hiding her from the other living corpses, R soon displays amorous behavior towards her, or attempts at such as good as any dead boy could make, and because of these sudden feelings appears to regain his past humanity slowly but surely. Eventually the plot allows for a certain degree of romance between the pair which is developed compellingly enough to make it rise above its ludicrous premise. The problem the fledgling lovers face is how to overcome the prejudices dominant in a world where one group in society aims to eat the other. Matters are complicated by the fact Julie's father (John Malkovich) is the stern and uncompromising leader of the human survivors, while the rise of a subspecies of zombies named 'Bonies', zombies so far gone they have lost every shred of humanity and form a danger to both humans and regular zombies, also is cause for concern. Can R and Julie's mutual love for each other bridge the differences between both groups in time for man and dead man to overcome their hatred and unite against their common foe? As the movie draws towards its close, the plot focuses more on action and the expected preachy messages, but it's the first half of the movie that makes for a wonderfully funny viewing experience totally worth your while as R, via voice-over, details his dreary everyday life, illustrating a zombie's daily routine to hilarious results. While people who might fear the love affair between live girl and dead boy is not convincingly carried through, they're in for a nice surprise. In fact, it turns out there's not so much difference between the awkward experiences of young love as seen through a dead boy's eyes as there is from a living one. Few guys who tried to hit on girls in their teen years won't recall similar instances of acting odd in front of the opposite sex that made them wish they were dead, right?"

","After watching this movie I was keen to log on to IMDb to write up my review but now that I have seen so many reviews on here that basically cover most of what I wanted to say, I'll try and keep it brief. My expectation was not high as I don't particularly like the lead actor Nicholas Hoult, however a wry smile appeared on my face within a moment or two of the movie starting. Zombie movies are ten a penny and we all pretty much know what to expect. This is a little off the beaten track and it doesn't take very long to work out it's direction, however I found that this didn't distract me from the movie and settled in nicely to see how it would progress. No spoilers here but suffice to say movies are all about entertainment and this one entertained me thoroughly. I enjoyed this immensely, while some of the special effects could have been better, the direction was thoughtful and visuals not overly dark. For an offbeat zombie this is a watcher even if you don't wish to own it. Miss is and miss out!."

","""Don't be creepy, Don't be creepy, Don't be creepy"" Yes, be creepy, and funny and do your thing, after all you and the girl are probably the same age, but, what about you being a Zombie? Sorry, I got caught on the moment and forgot I suppose to review this movie that unfortunately, avoided for quite a while. Because of the poster and the awful marketing, I thought it was another stupid flick directed just to young audiences and not to people like me, that ask more brains (no pun intended) in a movie. The zombie in question, ""R"" is the kind of zombie that maybe under the right circumstances you would like to have as a friend. I have been following the career of Nicholas Hoult, since ""About a boy"", and I am really glad that he will be in ""Dark Places"" one of my favorite books, (Believe it or not I predicted that one day the movie would be made). So as you can see the casting of this movie is as good as it can get and as a bonus we get to see the always welcome John Malkovich, and Teresa Palmer, whom I haven't really paid much attention before, and she has the acting skills that what's her face? Doesn't have, As Julie, Teresa made me smile, then giggle and finally laugh and completely care about her character. The chemistry between this very weird pair made of this silly movie, a fun-love-story, and the soundtrack, Oh man, awesome!

While utterly predictable this movie is funny (as in I laughed out loud several times), sweet and generally warm.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, inspired by the old tale of forbidden love (more specifically, Shakespeare, but we can all agree he didn't make up that concept) and as such isn't very interesting, but R's jokes (and perhaps, my love for Nicholas Hoult)are funny and the post-apocalyptic setting is a nice backdrop. It is a tale of love and hope and I enjoyed it a lot, and know that others will too if they get past the whole ""zombie falls for human"" part, which I didn't until someone told me to. If you need a light, funny, hopeful movies then give it a go, you can always turn it off if you hate it."
"Bruce722","8","0","1","9 September 2013"," Surprisingly entertaining.
","Warm Bodies is a surprisingly entertaining movie from beginning to end. I think these writers need to get with the program. Making serious, dark zombie movies just doesn't work. The best zombie movies have been light-hearted movies that don't take themselves too seriously like this one and Zombieland. This film had plenty of humor, some solid acting, and a unique twist on the clichéd zombie apocalypse concept. Here we have a zombie, played very well by Nicholas Hoult, who for some reason is drawn to human things and not just because he wants to eat their brains. This takes a turn when he sees Teresa Palmer's character and somehow falls in love. Looking at her it's easy to see why. She looks like a combination of Hayden Panettiere and Kristen Stewart but more attractive than either one. I truly hope she gets more roles because the camera loves her almost as much as R did. Back to the movie, throughout the rest of the film she essentially reteaches R how to be human and he begins to adapt over time. When this phenomenon begins to spread, the human population has an interesting situation on their hands. Overall, was this movie realistic at all? Of course not, but it's a zombie movie. Analyzing the film for plot holes or anything like that would be just silly. If you want a fun movie- watching experience, however, it's worth checking out."
"matsnowie","6","0","1","5 September 2013"," Juliet and Zombie Romeo
","Nicholas Hoult plays R, a zombie who cannot remember his full name. He shuffles around an airport with dry, witty narration filling his thoughts. M (Rob Corddry) is his best friend, and sometimes they get hungry and team up to go look for brains. During one of these meals out, R eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco), and R finds Perry's feelings for his girlfriend Julie (Teresa Palmer) becoming his own. R then saves Julie and hides her in his Wall-E like shelter full of the remains of human society.<br/><br/>Director Jonathan Levine made the indie coming-of-age film The Wackness, which was reasonably entertaining if not very original. His follow-up feature was the terrific 50/50, which was a great convergence of actors and script. Warm Bodies ends up somewhere between the two. The highlight of the film in terms of both actor and script is Nicholas Hoult. His depressed narration includes most of the best lines and Hoult manages to get across a lot of emotion despite sticking to the grey, dead features of the classic Hollywood zombie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast fits the film, but no one is trying too hard to make Warm Bodies a very serious film, which for a Rom-Zom-Com is the best choice. Rob Corddry just plays himself, Teresa Palmer is a beautiful and relatable lead, and John Malkovich agreed to be in this movie, which is less impressive now that his recent work has included Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Jonah Hex.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, if R and Julie wasn't enough of a hint, Perry sounds like Paris, R's best friend is M, and Julie's best friend wants to be a nurse. The star-crossed connections become painfully clear when R approaches Julie at her balcony. And this is the main flaw of the film. Director Jonathan Levine keeps the focus on the Shakespeare romance instead of on the zombie comedy. This is only a problem because it places the audience in the awkward position of rooting for necrophilia, an obstacle that even the most dedicated romantic would have trouble overcoming.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is an entertaining riff on Shakespeare that seems very original at the start, but soon reveals its conventional side. It's not gory enough to be a zombie classic, but it's good enough to be a worthwhile (unconventional) romance.<br/><br/>http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2013/02/warm-bodies.html"

Its a fun movie, riffing on Romeo and Juliet (we even get the balcony scene), but the concept works so well, even if R doesn't get shot by Julie (in any other Zombie movie, he'd be cannon fodder).<br/><br/>The two leads are great, and they have wonderful chemistry, but the support, especially from Corddry and Malkovich is wonderful, as well as the soundtrack.<br/><br/>But its pretty dark stuff, and I'm surprised that it was a 12a here in the UK, because the first act is scary, and violent.<br/><br/>But hey, I'm a father, so that's my little gripe over.<br/><br/>So all in all, its a great movie, criminally under-seen in cinemas, but what could have made it more remarkable, is if the makers went against the book narrative and have R killed at the end, that would have been just as tragic as Shakespeare's source.<br/><br/>Still good though."
"herbatienen","8","0","1","30 August 2013"," Witty, romantic and actually just plain hilarious
","Well that sums it up actually. The movie is great fun and top of the shelf entertainment, that is for sure. And the top it off , it is quite original for a zombie-story. <br/><br/>We are getting treated to a bona fide romance between a zombie boy and a living girl. But the real catch in this movie is the voice-over from lead actor Nicholas Hoult (you know the boy in the Hugh Grant hit 'About a boy' and Beast in the new X-men franchise) for his own character R. As audience we're privileged to listen in on a zombies mind and what happens inside the brain (much more apparently then we ever thought) and that is just what makes this movie stand out. Especially the monologues he is having with himself, they're priceless. I don't wanna give out to much from the plot, but the opening sequence is one not to miss, even if you're not a horror or zombie fan. <br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer (She was the Alien protector in I am Number 4) have a great chemistry going on here. The storyline is quite thin off course, and one can wonder at first why Malkovich is in this movie, but you can clearly see he's having fun as the dad and ruthless zombie-killer. The level of gore is OK, but not even close as to how much a normal horror movie would have. The focus is much more on the romance and situational comedy and witty one-liners, and it works perfectly here. <br/><br/>So Kudos to Jonathan Levine, who wrote and directed this movie. Great make-up and most importantly he knows how to tell a story and keep the pace in the movie. Although he's not without experience as he gave us the more then average 'Everybody Loves Mandy Lane' and the excellent '50/50'.<br/><br/>So I would highly recommend this movie."
"MarumeChiisa","6","0","1","27 August 2013"," Brilliant Idea, but Lacks Rationality
","I'm never a big fan of zombie movie, even though I followed 'The Walking Dead' series, I just watch it to kill some time while thinking what movie I should watch next. Even when I started watching this movie, I was still thinking what movie I should've been watching. But, quite surprisingly, this movie took my attention away from my sea of thought.<br/><br/>While any other zombie movie focused on the gory scenes or run-by-a- hair-breadth-close-from-zombies things, this movie focused on a very unusual plot for a zombie movie. But, as much as I like the love story between the zombie (R) and the still-living girl (Julie), I couldn't help but pointing one after another anomalies all the time I watched the movie. I didn't say the anomalies made the movie bad, it's just confusing, but still good to watch. I don't understand myself.<br/><br/>As I said above, the story and the idea were brilliant, hands down. The comedies also give some refreshment in the right place instead of annoying. But, the characters were the confusing part of the movie, especially the characteristic of the zombies. That's the anomalies I was talking about, to make it easier, I'm gonna list it;<br/><br/>1. 'R' once noted that zombies were slow, but on the other scene, some of them were running (well, it might have something to do with them seeing their food (living flesh), an it kinda remind me of the infected people in '28 Days Later' rather than the literal walking dead).<br/><br/>2. The zombies were breathing, YES, breathing as in inhale and exhale (most notably when they (trying to) talk. They sounded more like Stevie Kenarban from Malcolm in the Middle, seriously...). Yet, R was drowning when he fell into the pond. So, what's with the inhaling and exhaling? Aren't zombies suppose to be 'dead'?<br/><br/>3. Eating brain made the zombies able to regain memories of the person whose brain they ate. Then, if they eat the heart, they should regain some heartbeat, right? This part of the movie is the weirdest for me. It sounds more like mutant (yes, despite being different in the method, I'm implying about Rogue from X-Men) than zombies.<br/><br/>4. In some scenes, zombies were able to smell living flesh from distance, even when they (humans) were in the building. And yet, when R brought Julie back to his 'home', none of the zombies were smelling her. Did that has something to do with the blood streak on her face?<br/><br/>I think that's all. And to be frank, 'Warm Bodies' felt more like a love story between a retarded boy and an action girl. Seriously, 'zombie' is another calling for Neanderthal humans. I always think that zombie movies are made to criticize how selfish humans can be.<br/><br/>Well, as the review's title said, this movie was basically good, but lampshaded with loads and loads of anomalies. Zombie-fan wouldn't be impressed, but it might hook some irregular chick-flick fans.<br/><br/>I give this movie 6/10 for the brilliant idea and the anomalies."

So, Julie (Juliet), R (Romeo), and his best friend, M (Mercutio). We get it. That actually made it better because at first, we weren't lovin' it. But now, I can give it at least 3 stars and even 4 for that connection and the performances of ALL (did I mention John Malkovich???). So a good, solid 4 for Netflix and 7 or 8 on IMDb. Too much time on my hands? Well, yes, but so what? AND THE SOUNDTRACK, ROCKED 80s - Cory Hart, GnR, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and some Indie stuff. Just watch it already."

","This is a quite different zombie movie. I think it can best be described as a romantic zombie movie with a humorous touch and some action thrown in for good measure. It is not at all a bad movie. I do prefer the ""shot everything that moves and when it doesn't move anymore shot some more just to be sure"" type of zombie movies but I still quite enjoyed this one. The words ""romantic"" and ""zombie"" is of course two words that you really would never expect to see in the same sentence. Surprisingly enough it does indeed work in this movie.<br/><br/>I think my main enjoyment of this movie was the voice-over with R's thoughts though. At times it is incredibly funny. The actual story, that the zombies' magically starts to heal themselves is of course pretty nonsensical but you do not really watch zombie movies for their elaborate plot anyway. I have seen worse and this was not really supposed to be a horror-zombie movie anyway so I can live with that.<br/><br/>This is the first zombie-movie that I have watched where you actually see the story from the zombies perspective. Another thing that, surprisingly enough, worked quite well. The voice-overs helped a lot to make that happen.<br/><br/>The special effects are fairly low key for being a zombie movie but I would say that they are just about right for this movie. The ""bonies"" are the most monster-like ones in the movie and their make-up is quite cool. Unfortunately their movements are quite stiff and look decidedly computer generated. That is a shame and pretty much the only complaint I have concerning the actual implementation of this movie.<br/><br/>Unless you are totally allergic to zombies I would recommend watching this movie. I would especially recommend it if you are not normally into zombie movies. You are likely to be surprised."

","http://filmthroughmyeyes.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>INTRO:<br/><br/>On a bit of a zombie kick with this and the World War Z reviews, but hey I'm not complaining. Warm bodies is very much a different kind of zombie movie, a love story. I was skeptical of this movie turning out super corny or teen drama-ish, but luckily these stereotypes were avoided.<br/><br/>ACTING:<br/><br/>The film stars a few recognizable faces. Perry is played by James Franco's little brother David Franco. R is played by Nicholas Hoult who was Jack from Jack the Giant Slayer and Beast from X-Men: First Class. Rob Corddry plays M. He has been in various movies from Hot Tub Time Machine, Blades of Glory, and What Happens in Vegas. Julie's father is played by the one and only John Malkovich from Burn After Readng and many other films.<br/><br/>Julie is played by a stunningly, gorgeous Teresa Palmer who was in I am Number Four and The Grudge 2. She looks like a mix between Hayden Panettiere and a blonde Kristen Stewart. Palmer throws in a great acting performance as Julie. She plays a very dynamic character ranging from the serious, broken hearted version of Julie to a the newly love struck Julie at the end of the movie. Julie is a strong willed character throughout the entirety of the film. <br/><br/>Palmer's male lead co-star, Nicholas Hoult, also delivers a fabulous acting performance as R. Playing a member of the undead who is the main character is hard enough. Showing zero emotion is more difficult than it sounds, but the audience watched the slow development of Hoult's character grow throughout the entire movie. Hoult executes this progression effortlessly and seamlessly. <br/><br/>Overall, all the acting is pretty spot on in this movie. The great makeup artistry of the film crew aided this as well as the costume work. The disheveled zombie look was nailed on the head. <br/><br/>TAKEAWAYS:<br/><br/>The uniqueness of the film adds in new dynamics previously never explored in a zombie film. There are numerous laugh out loud moments that keep the audience involved with the awkwardness of a human, zombie relationship. The puns are placed perfectly and the stereotypes are executed just crafty enough to not seem corny yet remain humorous. The premise sounded strange, but Jonathan Levine, the director of 50/50, executed the movie flawlessly to combine a chick-flick (I hate this title because not only do I enjoy most of them and it's just another gender role stereotype that limits societies outlook), love story with a comedic variant of a zombie movie. <br/><br/>I'm putting this on my must see movie list. I highly recommend you see this movie in whatever manner you'd like: Netflix, Redbox, actually buying it, etc... I can say that I'll be watching this movie again sometime soon to introduce it to others.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies of the year.<br/><br/>RATING:<br/><br/>The film gets 4/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups."

","No veritable zombie fan could hear the premise of this film and want to watch it, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is set post-zombie-apocalypse (think 28 Weeks later, survivor stronghold-esq), and zombies are roaming around, as they do. The narrative follows 'R', played by Nicholas Hoult, who is a zombie. R meets an alive woman (I say 'meets', he tries to eat her and her friends' brains), falls in love and, as a result, his heart starts beating again, and he gradually begins to come back to life.<br/><br/>Stay with me! I warned you about the premise, I really did.<br/><br/>When I heard the plot for this movie, and watched the trailer, even, I sicked up a bit into my mouth. Hollywood had done it, I thought, it had finally ruined the zombie genre. It had forced Twilight to rape Dawn of the Dead, and Warm Bodies was the illegitimate, shameful spawn of such an unholy union.<br/><br/>Though it is based on a book of the same name, written by Issac Marion, and this at least gives it some credibility, surely? Even if it is penned as a 'zombie romance' – eurgh. It's not even as though the world has never been introduced to such a thing, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's Shaun of the Dead (2004) is classified as a Zom-Rom-Com, but I think we can all agree, it's just not the same.<br/><br/>Despite these forth-comings, I felt compelled to watch it, it was a zombie film, after all, and I am a zombie fan. I have seen every zombie film, read every graphic novel in The Walking Dead series, and constructed a detailed plan in the, let's face it, inevitable eventuality of a zombie apocalypse. I watched it, I loved it.<br/><br/>My goodness, Warm Bodies! The plot, not all the great, but the humour stole the show.<br/><br/>The narrative is pushed along by Nicholas Hoult's voice-over, vocalising the inner thoughts and feelings of the otherwise mute zombie. The observations are so apt and hilarious, it must be frustrating to go anywhere or do anything when you move so slowly, of course! And R's constant self-admonishment to not be creepy when in the company of Julie, the object of his affection, played by Teresa Palmer, because obviously zombies experience extreme social anxiety about their deathly exterior, how have I not realised that before? Perhaps there groans are just them trying to connect.<br/><br/>The comedy is subtle, but brilliant. If more obvious, in your face comedies are your thing, then this might not get many laughs out of you. But if it's the simple things that tickle you, then you, like me, will be in stitches.<br/><br/>Like a lot of zombie films, it comments on the modern human condition, monotonous lifestyles and our growing failure to communicate and interact with each other, without the aid of technology, and in general. Which is always fun to be reminded of.<br/><br/>If none of the former grabs you and makes you want to watch this film, then at least check it out for the amazing soundtrack. With artists ranging from The Smiths to The National, and a bit of Jimmy Cliff in between, all of which are now firmly on my MP3 player, I would happily have it as the soundtrack to my life. The music adds so much to the film, especially with R's fetish for collecting vinyl records, and isn't always just played over the top, but also interacted with, within the narrative.<br/><br/>I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I did. It's not going to earn itself a spot in the top ten zombie films of all time, but it has earned itself a spot on my DVD collection, and I will be watching it again.<br/><br/>More reviews like this at FortressofSolitude.co.uk"

","No spoilers here so don't worry.<br/><br/>So I began watching this film with the intent of just making fun of it and laughing AT what was going on rather than WITH the intended jokes. Because to be honest, a ZOMBIE ROMANCE FILM? C'mon. Zombies are probably the least romantic and attractive of the supernatural category. But man, was I surprised.<br/><br/>From the first moment, I was completely invested in the fate of the main character because of his dry, awkward sense of humour. I only realised after a while that he's played by Nicholas Hoult, i.e., the Beast from X Men: First Class.<br/><br/>And sure, the basic plot of the film is a bit predictable but by the time the viewers reach that point, they honestly wouldn't care or would completely agree.<br/><br/>This film promises to make you laugh and fulfill your wish of a romance genre too in a high school teen romance between a pretty girl with an overprotective father and an awkward social outcast who just HAPPENS to be a zombie in an apocalyptic scenario.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 7/10 overall and I suggest you all watch it!"

","Funny, I was going to watch ""Cloud Atlas"" as a ""transformational"" movie and then watch this as entertainment. I decided to go straight to the entertainment and I think it had a great and healing message and I had fun too! I love seeing Nick Hoult! He did a great job! Even John Malkovich seemed normal-ish!It's a romance so it is a movie about love and unconditional love and going for it with your heart, even when you don't one! I liked that the CG stuff wasn't overdone so the movie had an organic feel. This added to the realism in the movie. SO many movies now days don't integrate their CG well and it ends up looking cartoon like where it should not. All in all, a very enjoyable movie!"
"manateegrey","8","0","1","23 July 2013"," Cute zombie flick?
","I suppose that's the best way for me to describe this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a good movie. But it's cute, too, which is a good thing because that's the point.<br/><br/>Zombie boy sees girl w hearts in his eyes, kills her boyfriend, eats his brain, sees his memories, and falls even more for the girl.<br/><br/>Speaking of the girl, it's pretty interesting that the lead that was chosen is one who looks like an attractive version of Twilight's Kristen Stewart. That can't have been an accident.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that is an off-the-shelf date movie, or one to just enjoy on your own if you like zombies. I'm not interested in Hollywood pushing Nicholas Hoult down our throats (ugh, Jack, anyone) but he was good in this movie."
"mark-newman-1","9","0","1","20 July 2013"," Best (color) Zombie Movie I've seen
","A wicked sense of humor elevates this movie but the other aspects are all strong, too. Evil monsters called 'The Bonies' are genuinely scary, the comedy is funny (and well hidden in parts) the drama and love story are convincing.<br/><br/>If you like 'An American Werewolf In London' then you'll like this. <br/><br/>My hopes were low... I don't like zombie movies and teen flicks just annoy me, but the opening narrative from the leading man soon had me in a different mood altogether.<br/><br/>Highly intelligent script, comedic timing and a superb direction are the icing on the cake. Much funnier than (the massively over-rated) Shaun Of The Dead.<br/><br/>The irony of R (Nicholas Hoult) looking at a magazine with Kim Kardashian on the cover with a confused expression on his 'Edward Scissorhands' face is priceless. But I have a feeling that it's intent will fly above the heads of it's intended audience.<br/><br/>...and finally, a shout out for the terrific sound track. Any movie that finds time for a classic Bob Dylan track (Shelter From The Storm) is all right by me, and there are another 20 or so audio clips that were all funny, appropriate and most importantly of all... NOT ANNOYING!"
"vebb","8","0","1","18 July 2013"," Great movie!
","This movie contains booth horror and lots of love, great for couples and everyone who has the age required for this movie :)<br/><br/>The Boy ""R"" meets a lovely girl when she and a ""team"" are looking for medicines for the human camp. People with hearts, zombies and bones which have been zombies for so long that they can't become human again. If the movie should have been any better I think another actor would fit the role as dad in this movie better. The role is well played by John Malkovich, but not well enough. The movie also have other weaknesses as it is too overdone in the way of editing special effects.<br/><br/>Great movie overall and sometimes touching, I give it therefore 8/10"

","Love comes into play in almost every feature film you will ever see. It comes in many forms and often times, entire movies are centered on it. Those are basically the film that I loath, but Warm Bodies was different for the simple fact that it has everything! From love and romance to apocalyptic Science Fiction, this film has something for everyone! In this world, a virus has spread and left the world in ruins. Several human settlements still exist, but they are the food source and they are surrounded. The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling into the danger zone in order to find medicine for their settlement, when they are attacked. It looks like they're all done for, when a zombie named R sees one of the girls and decides to save her instead of eat her. For some reason this girl evoked emotion in R, which led to memories. Soon the other zombies in R's group start having memories and decide to convince the humans that they are changing. Are they really changing though or is it a ploy? Love is the cure is kind of a hoke concept, but it is our most powerful emotion and it seemed plausible that this feeling could evoke memories. Nicholas Hoult (forever known as that kid from About A Boy) stars as R and is terrific. It might not take a lot of talent to play a zombie, but to play one that is learning to be human again is no easy task. Hoult plays the part perfectly and is the reason this film is believable. John Malkovich is also in Warm Bodies and while he's not playing a hilarious bad guy, he still adds a different dynamic to the film, getting involved in much of the action sequences. Warm Bodies is a refreshingly unique story that will appeal to a large audience. The Walking Dead it's not, but it still has enough bite to keep the audience that's not into all the classic romantic stuff. To be honest, I thought it might be good for a few laughs, but I never thought this film would be as good as it was. It has a message and makes an impact, while being a funny, edge of your seat thriller. This was really not something I would usually go for, but my recent Walking Dead inspired zombie craze put it on my radar and it was an amazing ride."
"hsoj_porrah","8","0","1","12 July 2013"," Funny, cute and different
","A quite different take on the zombie theme. On the surface a dumb and dumber premise but artfully handled and nice allusions to Zombie lit, Shakespeare and world politics. This film is often surprisingly beautifully shot with some nicely understated CGI and even more understated humour (even if occasionally borrowing from Shaun of the Dead...but who could resist?).<br/><br/>Not rip roaring laughs but delicate film making meshed with dumb zombie humour in a way that somehow works. Overall premise seems a bit cheesy but supported by the film's metaphor of accepting/understanding others ... difficult when someone wants your brains."

","I really liked this one. In most zombie movies the zombies are bad and a representation of evil and have to be cured by some magical potion. Here zombies are represented in the beginning as bad but then they start to change by themselves with their will, which is what struck me. It is a movie that shows that change must come from the inside and that it is always possible. And also that the strongest changing force is love. The movie's love story is beautiful because it is not pushed, unrealistic, and badly paced. At the end, it makes sense that she loves him. The theme of the movie is not shoved in your face. Julie's dad was what I thought the movie would fail with. I expected him to be stuck up, unwilling to accept to the degree of being ridiculous, but he wasn't. It was a pleasant surprise as him not understanding went only so far and it didn't ruin the movie. I was touched by R's willing to change. Great music, perfect pacing of the story. At times it is a little predictable but in a good manner because what you expect to happen, must happen. Overall, a very good movie."

","Few would ever assume that a director could be ambitious enough to attempt to bridge the Twilight and Dawn of the Dead crowds until now. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the Twilight crowd was obviously the group treated preferentially but the end result was still a solid combination of comedy, romance, and a splash of horror.<br/><br/>This light-hearted ""zombedy"" tells of boy meets girl, but unfortunately boy has been on a steady diet of brains for sometime.

","So I heard going in to watch this movie is that it was ""zombie twilight"" and I thought to myself, ""dear god how are they going to try to make rotting corpses into teenage sex symbols"". The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and as long as you aren't looking for seriousness, it's a very funny and interesting movie to watch. Sure the ""power of love"" and all that jazz is overdone, but it didn't go over the top with the romance, it was just quick paced and humorous. And hey, John Malcovitch is great in any movie, so it's worth checking out just for that. The music really makes this film and sets the tone. If the music had been super serious twilight stuff I would have just laughed at the ridiculousness of every scene where romance was involved, but there were a lot of funny song choices. Which made me laugh WITH the movie and not AT the movie. And I was genuinely surprised to see that they did actually make zombies sexy at a point, that's a pretty strange achievement."

","I saw Film 2013 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny reviewing this film, it sounded like a really interesting alternative zombie film, and the title certainly gave me a clue of the premise I heard described, from director Jonathan Levine (50/50). Basically the world has been devastated by a zombie apocalypse, and R (About a Boy's Nicholas Hoult) is one of those zombies, and despite being dead, not remembering his full first that begins with the letter ""R"" and needing to find human flesh he has a personality and soul of sorts. One day while looking with his group of other zombie for food he comes across humans, including Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer) who with her group was searching for medical supplies, he is drawn to her, and while she is distracted he eats the brain of her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco, James's brother), which gives him his memories. R rescues and takes Julie to his empty aeroplane safe place, she is for a while fearful of him, but slowly they bond, and he is slowly gaining his life back, including speech and speed, but she tries to get away a couple of times, which only attract the attention of other zombies. It comes to the point when he agrees to help her back to the humans where she came from, so he helps her travel, but he is honest to her and admits to eating Perry, so she abandons him and he heads back to the airport heartbroken, but other zombies are gaining their lives back as well, making them vulnerable to the Bonies, skeletal zombies that have no humanity and will eat anything with a heartbeat. R and his friend M (Hot Tub Time Machine's Rob Corddry) manage to get into the human shelter, and they find Julie with her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), and revealing the zombies' lives returning they try to convince military leader and Julie's father Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich), but he refuses to believe that corpses can change, he even threatens to kill R. With this R and Julie run away to a near baseball stadium, but there is a horde of Bonies ready to attack, trapped the only escape route is to jump into a pool far below, so they jump and she is shielded by his body, and having survived the two of them share a kiss, and this fully restores R back to human form, he is shot by the Colonel and bleeds which confirms this. In the end humans and zombies combine forces to kill the population of Bonies, most of them are wiped out and those remaining die of starvation, and all zombies slowly gain back their humanity, life goes to back to the days before the apocalypse, and R and Julie watch as the wall surrounding the city to separate the original two populations is pulled down. Also starring Cory Hardrict as Kevin and Vincent Leclerc as Perry's Dad. Hoult being for most of the film almost completely emotionless but gaining back his life is great at carrying the film, with his narration as well, Palmer is likable and pretty as his love interest, and Malkovich is reasonable being easily angered and strict. This a terrifically unconventional love story between someone dead and someone living, and it almost removes all the rules for conventional zombie films where they would normally be mindless and completely savage, it has the small creepy moments, but mostly it made me laugh, it is a fun romantic comedy horror. Good!"

","On the wave of hits like ""Twilight"" and similar unconventional and impossible love stories involving different worlds, ""Warm Bodies"" is a sweet tale on the love between a human and a zombie both living on an apocalyptical world. It's about zombie R (Nicholas Hoult) and human Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer) and how one saved the other's life amidst the conflict between their species and the Bonies, horrific and dangerous creatures more powerful than the zombies itself, slow in movement and speech and reduced to strange groans. <br/><br/>It all started when R noticed the girl while they were under human attack and he end up killing her boyfriend (Dave Franco) yet saving her from being attacked by his own zombie friends. At first she doesn't understand his reasons since he can only mutter words, the most he can say is ""Not safe"". But since she's the daughter of the human's resistance leader (John Malkovich), a tough colonel, she needs to go back to the stadium where the few human survivors are based, at the same time R notices changes on his deteriorated condition, now capable of doing more human things like dreaming, expressing his thoughts in a better way and more. And now? Love and trust trying to survive in a shattered world that is about to face more conflicts and perils.<br/><br/>What's underlined such simple story? True love and true respect that doesn't see appearances but sees actions, it's all about what's inside and not what's outside. It's different, it's far from the usual, you get suspicious but you try to know the other one and discover the world others have to offer. It seeks union in the difference, even at its most awkward. A good call to its target audience (teens) and the way they perceive changes and go through them. Invisible to majorities, sometimes alone in crowds, walking around like zombies and only getting truly noticed when they like someone, love, friendship or any kind of bond. Just a way to put it, not necessarily an universal truth, but appropriate.<br/><br/>Easy going, profound and far from being corny like many of same traits, ""Warm Bodies"" manages to be better than its original source, Isaac Marion's novel (good yet depressing), not betraying his intentions, changing a little here and there but being a little funnier. But they should have stick with Sinatra's songs (changed for obvious reasons but replaced by Springsteen and Guns N' Roses, equally great in my book) and also present R's zombie family and his adopted kids. <br/><br/>Relatively impossible to happen but please, give Nicholas an award for his role in here. The first of its kind, here's an unusual zombie, one that invites you to his world and deeper thoughts, one you create an enormous empathy even when he kills people to survive. He was the perfect R, in movements, expressions, actions, reflections and all and we get a bonus because he's incredibly funny and charming while being an awkward and good-looking zombie. Palmer was a good companion to him, and Malkovich played a good antagonist but Rob Corddry steals the show from time to time as M, R's best friend. Interesting to see him playing a more restrained character, a little amusing, different from the loud characters he plays.<br/><br/>One of the year's most entertaining films, greatly presented and acted, humorous and romantic despite the minor horror in it. 9/10"

I have seen almost all the Zombie movies of recent past and was quite certain that this would turn out something like that. The title made me a little curious and the plot revealed its significance. This movie shows that we have moved on with our thinking and understanding of Zombies for good. This movie is result of a brilliant effort by the director and shows that you can change anything with love, care and affection.

"F_Mizra","8","0","1","2 July 2013"," Www.. www... Whoa! Something new to me
","The first word I tried to utter while watching this, was: Www www whoa. Warm Bodies (WB) is nothing like any typical Zombie movies that I've seen before. The film stands out because it is told from the perspective of a Zombie. And it shows that even these walking-dead could still have some human characteristics, despite the need to eat people.<br/><br/>The Apocalypse world in WB is survived by three groups: Humans, Zombies and Bonies. Zombies who have lost humanity and any bits of hope would shed their own flesh and become Bonies. Bonies, as the name suggests, are nasty skeletal figures who prey on anything that has a heartbeat.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Isaac Marion which bears the same name. I highly respect the originality of humanistic nature of Zombies in Marion's ideas. The film starts off with the protagonist named R (a young ambitious Zombie-lad) wandering in an airport, while narrating to us his daily routine such as communicating (grunts and moans, actually) with his best friend M, hoarding, and listening to vinyl records.<br/><br/>One day, while touring to the City with his packs of Zombie friends, they bumped (attacked, actually) into a group of humans seeking some medicines in a pharmacy. There, R met a pretty hot girl named Julie, among others. It's love at first sight! The story goes on, developing the relationship between R and Julie. <br/><br/>When my sister said (and showed the trailer) about the bizarre elements of this film, it enticed the curiosity in me. Thus, I've set my mind to be as open as possible, and regard this as a light-watching. Man, I never thought I'd be this thrilled and satisfied! Perhaps because it's been so long since I've last watched any romantic-comedy genre. <br/><br/>Seriously, some of the scenes are like damn funny. You would grin at the very least. And the l'amour. Sigh. The story gives you many hints of Romeo and Juliet references. Just look at the names R and Julie for starters. Chick flick? Nahhh, I wouldn't be as mean to label this as that. But rest assured, it's not Twilight.<br/><br/>The cast gave their best. Nicholas Hoult (R) and Teresa Palmer (Julie) had this sweet chemistry. Rob Corddry plays M while Dave Franco and Analeigh Tripton acted as Julie's boyfriend and best friend respectively. And with John Malkovich as Julie's father, you could expect his wittiness coloring the film. <br/><br/>WB has this awesome soundtrack too. I dare say the music and score help the success of this film. I personally love Bruce Springsteen's Hungry Heart! It's one of those song that would stuck into your head, and you'd reminiscent the scene over and over. Just check out the videos in YouTube, and you'd see many people thanked Warm Bodies in making them searching for the selected song(s).<br/><br/>My only problem, a slight one, is the appearance of Bonies. Looks very computer-generated. But hey, the film is not that serious (deviate from orthodox Zombie-rules), so I tend to get over that. The plot is superb, and at the end, well, it's wonderful. Needless to say, WB becomes one of those movies that I'd recommend my friends to watch when they come over.<br/><br/>Verdict: Rrrrrrrrrr Read my last sentence above."
"Xtremegt2","7","0","2","30 June 2013"," A little too sweet, but there's a lot to like.
","As a guy, sometimes this movie would really work for me. The cast is great from top to bottom. Rob Corddry was perfect. Analeigh Tipton never wastes a minute on screen. I've never seen Teresa Palmer before, but I'll be looking out for whatever she's in next. And Nicolas Hoult keeps showing me range I didn't know he had.<br/><br/>But at times they just pushed too hard for that sort of...fairytale...hakuna matata...""the world is made of roses"" vibe. They'd show some really interesting, quirky ideas of life in a zombie outbreak, but then they'd get really sitcom-y when things should've gotten a little more serious. And a lot of it just felt too written. Like they didn't earn something that happened, a writer just decided it's time to happen now. <br/><br/>R talked too much, too soon. Soldiers dropped their weapons too quickly. Everything just got accepted so quick. It felt like everyone was just playing their part to help these two's love story, instead of being real characters that act in any way that makes sense.<br/><br/>It's a great idea. There are some really nice moments. And even when it gets dumb, it doesn't get as dumb as a lot of summer blockbusters can get. And it makes sense for the story it's telling. It just kinda disrespects zombie movies a lot. And doesn't find the balance between fear and love like it wants to. And kinda wastes a really really great premise, taking shortcuts to help make these two's world-changing love work.<br/><br/>It's kind of a testament to Teresa Palmer and Nicolas Hoult that the movie stays together and still pulls you in. They make odd leaps and choices at weird or off times. The problem is, this movie really respects the love story it's telling a hell of a lot more than the world they built around it.<br/><br/>But I still liked it.<br/><br/>Like a lot of people, I'm a sucker for zombies. And I think guys and girls who are just happy to see a prettier Kristen Stewart who can act and Tony from Skins doing a really good job will like this. And zombie fans who don't care too much about the details or scares and have been itching for Zombieland 2 will like it as well."

","When I first heard the premise of Warm Bodies, I thought that it could be a serious flop. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my initial thoughts were completely wrong. This film has a refreshing plot that is really quite different than anything else I have seen. Not only is it quirky and extremely funny it places, but it also carries a great message of open-mindedness and acceptance. It has a romantic storyline that keeps the viewer rooting for the two lead roles the entire movie, who both happen to have great chemistry together. They keep the romance quite lively (hardy har har). Strange as it feels at first, you find yourself hoping the zombie gets his girl.I found Warm Bodies to be very entertaining, and quite charming."

","Warm Bodies is an interesting zombie movie that tries to answer the central question: Can zombies find love? It's a funny premise, one that is entertaining to watch unfold, but in order for the filmmakers to make it work and give it a Hollywood ending, they kind of go against the grain of what we always have known about zombies. <br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult plays R, a zombie who falls in love with a human girl, portrayed by Tersea Palmer. R takes Palmer's character back to his home inside a derelict airplane and tries to woo her. These are the film's best moments, where we as the audience hear R's human thoughts, but all he can do is act and talk like a zombie. Where the movie starts to lose its momentum is when all of the zombies start turning back into humans because R's love with this human has sparked their hearts to come alive once again. I know the whole idea of zombies is far-fetched, but this is really making serious logic jumps even in the zombie world. If these zombies were created through disease or nuclear radiation, love can't just cure them of these things. They'd need a medical cure as well. <br/><br/>Honestly, this is just me being nitpicky, because the real take away from Warm Bodies is that it's a fresh and original comedy, that features a spectacularly heartfelt performance from star Nicholas Hoult, even if he is playing a zombie.<br/><br/>I give Warm Bodies an 8 out of 10!"

","I didn't have high hopes. Its not that it wasn't an interesting concept in the premise but its the low budget ""please don't let this be twilight"" aspect of it. I was surprised at the amount of heart the film had. My first problem with the film is that it had a lot of plot holes. Meaning unanswered and in-explainable gaps in logical storytelling. However, because of the dark comedy mix genre, I didn't take this to heart. The film is free minded and is more about personal interactions and gestures than dialogue or plot. Although its mostly about the humor, it does take itself a bit seriously at times which works sometimes but not every time in execution. It took me until the balcony scene to realize what R stands for, so I guess I wasn't looking too hard before hand. My main concern was trying to grasp what the difference between the bonies and the corpses were. We never really get a detailed answer, and that hurt the film for me. Even though I liked it overall, I totally can see how someone would outright hate it. Nicolas Hoult did a good job hope to see him in more projects."

","Coming up with a new idea for a Zombie movie isn't easy considering there have been so many of them. Warm bodies is different in a way that hasn't been done before and that's what makes it interesting. <br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult plays a Zombie who still possesses a spark of humanity, nicknamed R by a girl he rescues from the other Zombies. The movie is narrated by R in the form of his confused and self loathing self talk.R reveals that Zombies take on the memories of those they eat so after tucking into a member of a Human scout team out looking for supplies, he instantly feels compelled to rescue Julie (played forgettable by Teresa Palmer). <br/><br/>Julies father Grigio (not John Malkovich greatest moment) heads the Human colony that intends to wipe out the Zombies. The connection between R and Julie sets up a chain reaction that leads to a Zombie awakening. I enjoyed the friendship R has with fellow Zombie M (Rob Corddry). M also has a spark of Humanity inside him. Unfortunately the movie progresses to a messy and somewhat predictable conclusion. I feel more could have been done with the idea. Still i enjoyed Warm Bodies and for me it was certainly better than many other Zombie movies I've seen."

You'll see when you watch it, I won't give anything away.<br/><br/>I didn't really understand the whole zombie thing if I'm honest. To me it seemed like a last minute idea to make a romance movie a little more exciting. You could re-write the entire storyline around street gangs, Vampires, Werewolves, Witches, High schoolers or Supermarket workers really and it would still fit.<br/><br/>I think the rash of dire zombie movies out recently probably spawned the idea off.<br/><br/>That being said, I really enjoyed the film for what it was. It's well written, very well acted and no real major plot flaws. I expected it to be another low rent B movie like all other horrors that seem to be creeping out of the woodwork recently.<br/><br/>I've given Warm Bodies an 8 out of 10.

","8.3 of 10. Original zombie horror/comedy seeing the world from a zombie's point of view.<br/><br/>While there's furiously beating hearts and affection, it's too simple to call this a romantic comedy that just happens to involves zombies. It is truly a zombie horror film that just happens to involve comedy and young adult, 20-something attraction.<br/><br/>While there are zombie comedies (Zombieland & Zombie Strippers being the only other ones that are not pure nonsense), and brief comedic/satirical elements in some of the more complete films (Land of the Dead (2005), Resident Evil), the only film that seems somewhat similar to this is Woke Up Dead. The Zombie POV and different stages of zombies give it something unique to zombie films even without the comedy/love.<br/><br/>While the film is not perfect (narration, zombie speed inconsistency, and the soundtrack is like someone stuck in the 1980s), its failing moments detract only temporarily, the acting is consistently real, and there are logical new answers to why zombies snack on brains."

","I was rather hyped up about getting to see this movie, as I am a big fan of all things zombie, and the trailer did seem really interesting, and not to mention that I had the book way before this was ever turned into a movie. And now having seen it, I am somewhat sitting here with a little bit of a strange taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>While the movie is great, yes, there was just something very superficial and shallow to it, as its storyline progressed without really delving into anything but just brushing over the surface of everything. There was just something profound missing from the movie to make it unique.<br/><br/>I am not saying that the movie is bad, far from it, because it is rather entertaining to see the 'apocalypse' from the zombie's point of view, but truth be told, then this movie is meant for a lovestruck audience that have just gotten over their romantic sparkly vampire crush and seeking love from other members of the undead. Despite its sugar-coated, candy-sweet love-story, then the movie is enjoyable for a zombie aficionado as well.<br/><br/>The zombies are nicely detailed, though there is a strange lack of missing limbs and decay here. You are either recently deceased or long-time deceased in this movie - zombie or bony. The bonies were rather unique though, lots of good details and decomposition here.<br/><br/>The story itself, well yeah, it was meant for a teenage or young romantic audience, as it tended to get overly sugar-sweet and cliché-filled throughout the course of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the cast, well people did good jobs with their given roles, and it was nice to see John Malkovich in a movie such as this.<br/><br/>But in itself, then ""Warm Bodies"" is a great, albeit rather unusual type, addition to any zombie aficionado's zombie movie collection. This is essentially ""Twilight"", just with zombies. But as such, it is bearable, and also the lack of sparkly skin and big hair makes it all the more better. If you enjoyed this movie (or book), then you should definitely check out the book ""Breathers"" by S. G. Browne."

The zombies and especially the ""bonies"" look creepy like taken directly from a horror movie. Some parts of the movie are full of suspense and thrill. At least one could think it a teeny horror movie. But that is only one part of the story. The other is an rather ugly dead boy falls in love with a beautiful living girl. Sounds a bit like the Gothic version of ""Beauty and the beast"" or like ""Twilight"". But I bet that most teenage girls have experienced moments with boys their age which made them believe boys are zombies. You might know guys who could do with a good shower and some hairstyle before presenting themselves in front of the living. And I'm sure that lots of teenagers very clearly know how to behave, just like R, but when they act they rather feel like zombies. So you see, after all it's just an coming-of-age comedy."

","Warm Bodies wants to be a new take on the zombie genre. I'll give them partial credit for the result.<br/><br/>There's several unique elements about zombie life that really make this flick worth seeing. Its biggest novelty achievement is using a zombie apocalypse as a backdrop for a romance, and casting a zombie as one of the lover. That's definitively well done.<br/><br/>However, this movie is fortunate to have a fresh spin, because there are many logical flaws in its scenario.

","Its summertime in America, OK not really, since large swathes of the country are still blanketed under snow, but for Hollywood its about blockbuster time.Its that time of the year when America must suffer another apocalypse, which of course means there must be a CGI-ed post apocalyptic America to gawk at, which gives the studios a raison d'être by offering us yet another spin on how America may bounce back again from the dead.The makers of this film take this notion very seriously indeed and they give us a Zombie romance where the undead become the unloved, as a tiny zombie shuffle towards redemption.<br/><br/>I saw a Twilight film once, (yes yes, I know), and to be honest, thought it was a perfectly entertaining film. And I totally understood the hysteria surrounding Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.While watching Warm Bodies I was completely fooled into believing I was watching Ms Stewart when it fact it was Ms Teresa Palmer, her clone.Now thats a cheap trick but then who cares.Warm Bodies is another riff on the Zombie genre and tries to be cash in on the current craze for paranormal romance, just the way Beautiful Creatures recently did.I walked out of that affront of a film but this one was a little more tolerable.<br/><br/>We start at square one, there has been a deadly epidemic and most Americans have turned Zombies, but this time there is a class divide, some are badder, the ""bonies"",erstwhile zombies, who against their better(ahem..) judgement have peeled away their unnecessary layers of skin and flesh to become lean mean killing machines.Now if you were a zombie, shuffling along slowly, seems a terrible handicap when hunting fitter humans for food, but zombies cant think, can they? Except to sniff out human flesh, and lunge for it? We will let this pass since this is a zombie film, remember? We see a zombie in a red hoodie who can't recall much about himself except the first alphabet of his name, R (Robert Pattinson maybe?). He has delusions of grandeur, he feels he has a heart and is capable of human emotions like befriending a fellow zombie.In this mix arrives Julie( lookalike alert!) and R eats her boyfriends brains, ingests his memories in the process, which will help him hook Julie.<br/><br/>Julies father is Grigio (John Malkowitch) who is the leader of the last surviving group of humans, armed to the hilt , he has the whole arsenal of NRAs(whose members must have turned zombie too) legacy at his disposal, so he cant complain, and is determined to blow every zombie brain off, that he can find.That will undoubtedly pose serious problems for Julie and R when they do fall in love.What Malkotcih is doing in this film beats me, making pocket money maybe, but undoubtedly his presence is likely to sell quite a few tickets but loose him a few fans in the process.<br/><br/>The makeup guys get the transition of the zombies to human just right, and so do the actors. Nicholas Hoult nearly pulls of a badly written role with his disciplined performance, the same cannot be said of Mr Malkowitch and Ms Palmer.Jonathan Levine has made a mixed bag of films which showcase his ambition but unfortunately he seems more preoccupied with become a saleable director than a good one. Warm Bodies tries to subvert the genre of zombie movies but in the process produces a film bereft of the charm required of a rom-com. The scenes between R and Julie have no chemistry and the sequences which set up their romance just do not add up to the imagination bending premise of a hot babe falling for a zombie who just killed her boyfriend. The scene where Julie reunites with her father is so devoid of emotion that it should alert us the director does not have his heart in the right place, unlike the zombies whose hearts are beginning to beat again.<br/><br/>Jonathan Levine, the director is certainly not dead, just hope he gets warmer."

That being said, the relationship between R and Julie was really cute and innocent. Sure, it started a little unconventionally, but it was strong enough to literally change the world. Nicholas Hoult is just too adorable as R. His mannerisms, facial expressions and inner monologue are great. Don't judge a movie by its trailer I guess.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","2","1 March 2013"," Rom-com spin on zombie flicks that isn't just satisfied with how clever that idea is
","The zombie genre has gone the way of vampires lately, except that it managed to dodge the romance bits — until now. Yes, it's even possible for the undead to fall in love, though considerably more difficult. ""Warm Bodies"" introduces the zombie romantic comedy (yes, zom-rom-com), and despite all the ways that in name alone it sounds as though the film could fail, it manages to carve its own niche among zombie pop-culture.<br/><br/>Luckily for us, Jonathan Levine adapts and directs this Isaac Marion novel. The director of ""50/50"" and ""The Wackness"" has yet to disappoint, and though the premise of ""Warm Bodies"" brings him dangerously close, his grasp on romance and making young love work on the screen serves him well yet again.<br/><br/>Levine's talents aside, ""Warm Bodies"" is a premise-driven film, which has its pros and cons. Other filmmakers could've executed it in ways that would've yielded countless movie reviews featuring the word ""cold"" in the headline, but a zombie who struggles with being emotionally dead inside and having to prey on human brains has its inherent merits. Conceptually, it takes on a certain life of its own that Levine mostly capitalizes on whenever possible.<br/><br/>The film begins in our main character's (Nicholas Hoult) head as he copes with being a meandering, flesh-craving zombie and dreams (even though the dead can't dream in the literal sense) about getting something more out of this paltry existence. The film widens in scope with each passing scene, and though it never gets any better than it is when it's more intimate, it doesn't go so far off the rails in the finale that it loses sight of the charm that got us to pay attention up to that point.<br/><br/>Everything changes for R (that's all he can remember of his first name) when he and a band of hungry corpses encounter some of the survivors from whatever outbreak caused everyone to become zombies eight years ago. A young woman (Teresa Palmer) catches his eye, and he unknowingly devours the brains of her boyfriend (Dave Franco), thereby receiving his memories of the girl, named Julie. R instantly becomes protective of Julie and helps her escape to his personal jet (an airplane stranded on a runway that R calls home).<br/><br/>R convinces Julie she is only safe if she stays with him, deceiving her for companionship purposes. They bond in a number of ways as R's use of language drastically begins to improve. It's clear he's becoming more and more human with time.<br/><br/>Hoult and Palmer have the difficult task of creating chemistry between their characters, which had to have been one of Levine's biggest challenges making this film. Presumably, Julie would be grossed out by her undead protector, but she senses his humanity rather quickly. To slow things down from there, however, she tries to ditch him at first. If her romantic interest had grown too quickly, it would've trashed the entire film. Given his track record, Levine should get a lot of the credit for allowing the audience time to warm up to their relationship.<br/><br/>Palmer has been in a number of young-adult geared action films (""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" ""I Am Number Four"") but her performances have been either overshadowed or crushed by these giant turd blockbusters. ""Warm Bodies"" is a better fit with its indie sensibilities. She makes Julie's combination of fear, curiosity and love come together into a smoother blend than you'd expect from this kind of film. <br/><br/>Hoult, on the other hand, has to find a perfect balance between zombie caricature and a thinking, emotional person. The narration crucially helps us connect with him, otherwise we'd never get to know him as a character, but he finds a way in the more traditional scenes when he interacts with Julie to express those feelings with grunts and slow-forming words. Think of all the cheesy monster movies when the ""thing"" expresses his feelings out loud for the first time. Just the mere thought of that has my eyes rolling, but Hoult keeps them firmly interested in what's going on.<br/><br/>The story falters a bit toward the end because its trajectory is so apparent. R is becoming more alive, so he'll either become ""a real boy"" again or get killed before it happens, perhaps even by Julie's cold father, the leader of the survivors (John Malkovich). Suddenly we have a war of ideologies between Julie and those that believe zombies have the capacity to change and become more human and those who think they're nothing but animals who'll snack on your insides the second you let your guard down. It's a pretty classic motif, but you probably never figured someone would apply it to a zombie movie.<br/><br/>Some unidentifiable spark between R and Julie, or perhaps between Hoult and Palmer, sticks through to the end of the film, even in the more action-oriented finale. ""Warm Bodies"" also doesn't ever lose its sense of humor, helping talk us down from taking it too seriously. And even though characters such as the best friend (Analeigh Tipton) appear to serve only comic relief, it doesn't try too hard for the awkward zombie joke.<br/><br/>""Warm Bodies"" twists things up with this unusual genre riff and Levine subdues it rather than ramming its uniqueness down our throats. He makes it foremost about two people who seem like an odd fit that come to love each other — and that's really the essence of the better romantic comedies of all time.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","For those who overlooked this funny, entertaining film because, basically, it's about zombies, you're missing out. There are few good and myriad poor examples of the teen supernatural love story film out there these days, but ""Warm Bodies"" falls pretty well into the ""good"" end of the spectrum.<br/><br/>R, well played by ""About a Boy"", ""Skins"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" actor Nicholas Hoult, is a relatively self-aware zombie who does all the right zombie things. He doesn't remember his human life, shuffles around the airport where he ""lives"", grunts ""conversations"" with his best friend M (The Daily Show's Rob Corddry), and participates in feeding raids where he devours the brains of the few remaining humans for sustenance and the chance to live a little by experiencing their memories as though they were his. On one feeding frenzy, after eating the brain of her boyfriend (Dave Franco), R encounters Julie (Take Me Home Tonight's Teresa Palmer) and spontaneously decides not only to not eat her, but to protect her from the other zombies. The more time they spend together, the more human he becomes – gaining more and more speaking ability and knowledge, and less and less desire to mindlessly kill and do nothing. And the awareness is spreading. But danger lurks in the form of super skeleton zombies, who have lost every last shred of humanity (including skin and hair) and are much taller, faster and more agile than your average zombie, and in the human-protection-through-zombie-extermination philosophy of Julie's military leader father, played by John Malkovich.<br/><br/>I'm ashamed to say it took me longer than it should have to catch the obvious play on Romeo and Juliet here (I mean, R and Julie, come on, right?!), but it's a very loose interpretation (as half the cast being zombies alone attests to). The story is straightforward and not overly developed or reliant on heavy mythology. Zombies have already taken over the world when the film starts, and we don't know, or really care, why or how. The commentary by R gives voice to his physically comedic, mostly-silent acting, and is genuinely funny. Hoult and Palmer are an engaging pair of young actors, carrying their irreverent roles with aplomb, and solid turns by Corddry and Malkovich make their roles memorable. Franco and former America's Next Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton, as Julie's best friend, deliver acceptable performances but don't stand out. It's no Oscar contender by a long-shot, but ""Warm Bodies"" is a gore-and-war, comedic, supernatural love story that will make you smile and leave you feeling, yes, warm and satisfied.

","Before writing the main part of this review, lets deal with something else first. There seems to be a lot of talk about Twilight series surrounding this film. The hatred for that series has become so intense – almost militant – that it is seeping into completely unconnected projects. Don't get me wrong, I am most definitely not a fan of those films, but they and Warm Bodies have about as much in common as The Whole Nine Yards and Godfather.<br/><br/>Warm Bodies is a fresh, if not completely original, addition to the Zombie genre. Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland have recently started to bring this horror sub genre to the masses by upping the laughs and limiting the gore; Warm Bodies takes it a step further by adding a much stronger romance sub plot (actually, it could be argued that the zombie apocalypse is the sub-plot here with the romance being the central plot). The film is not without its scares though. The zombies are self aware and for the most part, are not happy with their condition. Those that essentially give in to what they are gradually turn to ""bonies"" – skeletal creatures who are much quicker and more aggressive. Whilst for the veteran zombie fan, these will cause little more than a flutter, for the casual observer they are enough to give the movie an edge. There is also an excellent soundtrack full of classic songs.<br/><br/>There are a few questionable character decisions and bending of its own rules, which are used to take the action to its required destination. John Malkovich is also criminally underused for an actor of his ability and seemingly perfect fit in the role of chief zombie hater. Other than that though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film with a decent, at times witty, script. There's even an early moment that suggests the film is going to tread in Romero's steps and be a social satire too. Unfortunately that never came to be though and ultimately that prevented this film entering the realm of brilliant."

","It's no secret the zombie craze is in full force thanks to some great films and TV shows on the subject. At this point there are so many zombie themed films hitting the market, there is very few that have anything unique to add to stand out. The latest Warm Bodies attempts to step out of the shadows of the others by creating a love story of sorts, mixed with some humor but is it effective or dead before it comes to life? <br/><br/>Warm Bodies follows introspective zombie who, much like the rest of the population is cursed to walk as the undead feeding on human survivors. During a routine feeding, he meets a beautiful woman that he suddenly feels compelled to protect. As their relationship begins to grow so does the temperature in his body as he slowly begins to regain his humanity. Soon this effect starts to spread through the other zombies shining a beam of hope on humanity, but first they must contend with not only the trigger happy humans, but also the ferocious Bonie zombies who threaten everyone. The story is easily one of the more unique to come along for the genre, breaking all the zombie rules, but working pretty well. The first bit of the film is a bit slow, but not in an all bad way. As it moves forward things start to pick up a bit as the audience is given an inside look at the zombie's side of things. There is little explanation as to how the change really occurs, but makes little difference other than being a bit irritating. In addition there are some disconnects here and there in relation to how people would have acted towards a situation, but it is minor enough to not hurt it. Besides that this film works pretty well. It keeps itself pretty light, even during the darker moments and somehow manages to deliver an effective love story.<br/><br/>The looks of the zombies fit the idea and feel of the film really well. They aren't overly gory like the norm, but can't be for this story to really work. Instead they introduce the Bonie's, which are skeleton type zombies that are there just to feast and kill anything in their path. The effects bringing these guys to life works pretty well and adds the much needed kick to keep it from being slow and sappy. If you are a zombie fan, then you will want to give Warm Bodies a chance. If for no other reason as it takes the genre into a fresh new direction, even if the characters are dead and rotting."

","All in all this movie was entertaining. It wasn't that long and didn't have me checking my watch every 5 minutes. That being said it also didn't have me on the edge of my seat. The humor, i felt , was a letdown. This was one of those movies where 90% of the funny parts were in the trailers. Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie but its definitely not Oscar worthy. Its not very scary, its not too lovey-dovey but if also not extremely funny. You'll laugh but not a full belly laugh, more of a chuckle. Definitely not a ""must see"" but if you're looking for away to spend an hour and a half this will do just fine."
