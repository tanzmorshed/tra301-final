"QueenMakeda84","Null","120","138","15 March 2003"," Love this movie!
","How great was this movie? I fell in love with it from being made to watch it in Health class in 11th grade. I love films about adversity within races, and this movie was a classic. Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Of course, it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap, yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue, Rev, Sunshine, Petey, and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well, because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better, was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great, great film. The Titans really were greater than the gods of Greek myth, and these guys were greater than any stereotype."
"Ree59","10","85","99","30 January 2005"," A powerful inspirational film
","Remember the Titans is much more than a story about a high school football team. It is a true story about two men who overcome their differences and help an entire town deal with frustration, anger, and mistrust. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school. In 1971 the high schools are integrated and Coach Boone is chosen to become the head coach of the football team while Coach Yoast is demoted to assistant coach.<br/><br/>Remember the Titans is a powerful film with incredible performances by both Denzel Washington and Will Patton."
"Brogan","Null","95","112","29 September 2000"," TOUCHDOWN!!!!!
","By looking at REMEMBER THE TITANS you are probably saying ""oh geeze, another football movie.  How can this one be any better than the last one?  The only good recent football film is RUDY.""  Well, after seeing this film, you'll be taken by surprise, just like I was.<br/><br/>In 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia, the town's high school football team, the T.C. Williams Titans, are very popular.  T.C. Williams High School current football coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), is nominated for high school Hall of Fame.  But a few weeks before the start of the school year, a white store owner shoots and kills a black man who was suspected in stealing a product.  This causes a racial seperation between blacks and whites in Alexandria.  Then just before the start of the football season, Coach Yoast gets demoted to Assistant Coach in place of Coach Boone (Denzel Washington). What's bad is that Boone is black, and Yoast is white.  Most of the town's residents are angry, and even some of the players are willing to ruin their football career's to quit the team to make a statement.  But at the start of football camp, Coach Boone won't take any racial diversity.  Boone treats all of his players equally, he has his football camp practices appear to be a mixture between boot camp and group sessions.  If the player misses catching a football, he has to run a mile.  If the player doesn't know anything about the person of the opposite color that they are rooming with, they have homework to get to know one another.  With this, it creates a special bond between these men.  Men who act more mature and humane, unlike most of the residents of Alexandria.  But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born.<br/><br/>The way to make a great sports movie is to have it be adapted from a true life story.  Like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, HOOSIERS, and RUDY, all are films that show that what appears to be a sport, is the true triumph of the human spirit.  I really did enjoy the characters in the film, since they are factual, they have very humanistic qualities.  While one loves to hum ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" another gets excited while listening to ""Act Naturally.""  And although you can guess what happens in the end, you don't care.  You enjoy and like the character's so much that you are cheering for them.<br/><br/>I highly enjoyed the acting in this film.  I think if Denzel Washington should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Actor, it should be for this film.  He teaches his team that black or white, these men are a team, and that the only way to win is teamwork.  Washington gives a bravura performance, that it will stun the people who think that Washington usually plays ""racist"" roles.  I also enjoyed Will Patton a lot, he's not playing the cliche coach who gets demoted, and wants to ruin the new head coach. Instead, he understands the message that Boone is giving to the team that he helps as much as he can to help the team succeed.  I thought Patton's role is the best assistant coach role that I have seen since Dennis Hopper's role in HOOSERS.  And the football players are also great, the ones I thought stood out were:  Preston Brant (Jerry Buck, the team's captain), Donald Adensun (Petey, the team's running-back), Kip Perdue (Sunshine, the team's quarterback), Craig Kirkwood (Rev, the team's defense player), and Ethan Suplee (Lastik, the team's leading defense, and by his size, he should be!)  I was glad to see Suplee change his roles in his career.  The last time I remember seeing him, he was the vicious skinhead along with Edward Norton and Patrick Furlong in AMERICAN HISTORY X.  In REMEMBER THE TITANS, he's the exact opposite, he's the first white player who makes friends with the black players!!!<br/><br/>Director Boaz Yakin and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should be commended for this film.<br/><br/>I am pleased to see Jerry Bruckheimer made a really enjoyable and intellectual film, which is the complete opposite of the type of films that he's famous for.  In fact I think this is the first one intellectual film Bruckheimer has made! The message that it sends out is really powerful, and if it doesn't convince you to change, then you are probably dead.  And director Boaz Yakin does a fantastic job with this film, that along with Cameron Crowe, Wolfgang Petersen, and Ridley Scott, he should be nominated best director.<br/><br/>This is quite a film, in fact, I think this is the best football movie that I have ever seen!  I really really enjoyed this film, and as I left it led me to believe in the message that this film was sending to it's audience. And this being only ""PG"" and put out by Walt Disney Pictures, I would love to see both junior high schools and high schools to show this film to it's students.  If they did, then chances are, the violence in schools will go down.  And it took Jerry Bruckheimer, Boaz Yakin, and Walt Disney Pictures to do it.  Great job guys!  Don't miss this enjoyable film! ***** (out of five)"
"MichaelOates","Null","90","108","10 March 2004"," Remember this movie
","""Remember The Titans"" is one of the two best films to have a chance to win an oscar for best picture.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington leads a cast that is young, fresh, talented and determined to make this movie a success. ""Remember The Titans"" is laced with strong performances from Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison and Greg Alan Williams.<br/><br/>Based on a true story ""Remember The Titans"" follows the 1971 T.C. Williams High School Titans football team and their struggles with integration. Washington is Herman Boone, who has run up against racism after he has been brought in to coach the Titans. Patton is Bill Yoast, the man Boone replaced as head coach. <br/><br/>Washington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle, which makes ""Remember The Titans"" a real gem. However, the strength and real beauty of ""Remember The Titans"" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.<br/><br/>I must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter, Hayden Panitierre. In ""Remember The Titans"" this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.<br/><br/>I hesitated to see ""Remember The Titans"" because I didn't want to see another football film, but it is more than just another football film.<br/><br/>
""Remember The Titans"" is a special film that has special performances and is well worth every dollar you spend to rent this film."
"MattyMugan","10","52","61","19 July 2006"," Inspiration
","If their is ever a film to watch to get motivated, it's this. You don't have to be an American football lover, just any sport, or activity. The passion displayed on the screen could get Sven Goran Eriksson in the mood. Their are particular inaccuracies in order to make this into more of a film, but I wouldn't call it predictable. This is based on a true story, and the 13 and 0 record really happened, so this true story was what created the predictable film stereotype. I love the choice of actors in the film. Each person seems to be able to tap in to the feelings of their character, which creates a much more realistic film. It depicts the nature of racism within peoples lives very well and shows how common loves for different things can pull people together so that simple and wrong beliefs are forgotten. Needless to say this film makes me feel better about the world, while making me want to be a winner as well."
"jackjack-2","10","105","130","13 March 2006"," Exceptional movie
","Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like ""Hoosiers"" this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.<br/><br/>Like ""Hoosiers"" this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree, it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools, minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.<br/><br/>Consequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed, I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First, the All-American end on our team, a superb athlete, was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.<br/><br/>But my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.<br/><br/>During my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with ex-collegiate stars and some pros, we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However, because I had black players on my team I couldn't schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the mid-west.<br/><br/>Some critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn't take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school, these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film."
"jhaggardjr","9","61","81","1 October 2000"," Feel good movie from Disney
","""Remember the Titans"" is a movie that by the end of seeing it makes you feel good. And why shouldn't it? You would figure that it'll be a nice little picture since it comes from the Walt Disney Company, and I think it's perfect for the whole family. ""Remember the Titans"" is a comedy-drama based on the true story of a high school in Virginia that is integrated with white and black students, white and black teachers, and white and black athletic coaches. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team, and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington. Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. In addition to Washington and Patton, there are some other terrific performances by the young actors who portray the football players. I see some future stars here. The movie has plenty of dramatic moments with some delightful comedy thrown in the middle of it. It obviously gets a little predictable towards the end which keeps ""Remember the Titans"" from being a perfect movie. But so what? This is a sports movie and usually sports movies almost always ends with ""the big game"". Who's going to win that big game? I won't say who wins the big game in ""Remember the Titans"", but in the end you'll be rooting for the Titans to win, win, win! And that's all that matters. Bottom line: ""Remember the Titans"" is an excellent film, very well made and very well acted by everyone involved.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"

","This movie received a lot of criticism for being a little too ""light"" in it's depiction of racism in that time period. However, the fact that Disney decided to take on the topic at all astounds me. I think that this movie is incredibly effective and an excellent football movie. It really sucks you into these characters and make you feel for them. I am emotionally affected by this film no matter how many times I've seen it, and I think that this movie will stand up over time as one of the most endearing sports classics of all time.<br/><br/>Quote that i believe defines the movie: ""I don't care if you like each other, but you will respect each other. And maybe, I don't know, maybe we can learn to play this game like men.""<br/><br/>My personal favorite: ""I don't want them to gain another YARD, you blitz all night! They cross the line of scrimmage I swear to God I'm going to take every one of you out. You make sure they remember FOREVER, the night they played the Titans."""
"hitchcockthelegend","9","18","22","31 July 2009"," In Greek mythology, the Titans were greater even than the gods.
","Based on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.<br/><br/>As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.<br/><br/>That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.<br/><br/>The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. With two important family roles nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" particularly potent and uplifting.<br/><br/>Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?). So hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired, and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10"

","Other reviewers here have covered the backstory, the direction, the production, and just about everything there is to cover for this excellent and unforgettable film. Except for one thing. It is a peculiarity of the film business that some actors peak early, for no obvious reason, and others just keep on going, like the Energizer rabbit. Michael Caine -- excuse me SIR Caine -- has been making movies for decades. Sometimes he is brilliant and sometimes he is not. Samuel L. Jackson has been in so many movies that (to this reviewer) it seems like the writers have reached the point where they no longer bother naming a character, they just pencil in the margins that they have written a part for Jackson. Denzel, who was beyond brilliant here, it is so hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the conviction and the diction that is his trademark, seems to have stopped doing these sorts of parts (written in 2013) and frankly, more's the pity. Hollywood is like that. So on top of all the other excellent reasons to see and enjoy this film, here is one more. Denzel at his peak. What more can I say?"

","A very good and very well written story about integration of a high school football team in Virginia. In 1970, segregation ended and a championship football team takes on a whole different complexion. Herman Boone(Denzel Washington)becomes the head coach of a team that already has an acclaimed coach played by Will Patton, who stays on as assistant for the good of the team. The blacks and whites work hard to overcome differences and keep the team in winning caliber. The team teaches the towns folk how to come together.<br/><br/>I was hoping for more football scenes, but this actually turned out to be a character drama. Based on a true story, this movie leaves you feeling good and somewhat proud. The most unrealistic thing about this movie to me was the absence of swearing that is usually associated with sports and teenagers. This film comes from the Disney stables and earns all accolades on its own merits.<br/><br/>Many stand outs in the cast featuring: Wood Harris, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood, Donald A. Faison and Ethan Suplee."
"bryaninmaryland","1","58","110","19 April 2008"," Remember the Titans is Awful
","This movie is more extremely annoying. In 1971, I was in 10th grade at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington County, Virginia. We were about 5 miles from T. C. Williams (Titans) and we played them regularly in every sport (including track, which was my sport). I have personal knowledge of the events in that film. First of all, the idea that T. C. Williams had just been integrated is incorrect. Schools in the area had been integrated for 15 years. By 1971, it was routine to have blacks and whites in the same school. Come look at my yearbooks and I'll show you. What happened at T. C. Williams was this: the Alexandria school system decided to change the status of three schools..........Hammond HS, George Washington HS, and T. C. Williams HS. Hammond was reduced to a junior high, and its students were sent to Williams. GW was closed and its students were sent to Williams. Everyone in the ENTIRE AREA knew that Alexandria had just created a super sports school and it was true. With the best athletes from three schools combined into one, there was no beating T. C. Williams. We played them in football that year and they beat us about 49-0, but it sure as hell had nothing to do with integrating a school and everything about creating a super school. Next, the idea that Alexandria was a small, backward town with rampant racial prejudice is laughable. Alexandria is a MAJOR suburb of Washington, DC. You can stand in Alexandria, look across the Potomac River, and see the Washington Monument, Capitol Hill, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, etc. It was and is a rich suburb of DC, and racial prejudice was about as far from being mainstream as I am from marrying Miss America. In my school, the white kids were afraid of the black kids. We didn't initiate fights, we tried hard to avoid them, but sometimes they were forced upon us by angry groups of students who roamed the halls and you sure as hell better look out if you didn't cringe to the side and let them pass. There is one scene in the movie where a white football coach calls the T. C. Williams coach a ""monkey"" on local TV. Good Lord.........that sort of thing would NEVER have been put on a Washington, DC sports channel and that is where ALL the channels received in northern Virginia originated (with the exception of channel 20 which had no news at that time). The people who made this movie had an agenda. I know the facts. I was there. I ran track in that T. C. Williams stadium and they beat the hell out of us because they were a super school. It is both sad and annoying that people will watch this movie and believe that how things are portrayed is actually how they were. They absolutely were not!"
"basilcourt","1","19","34","11 August 2015"," A lie that perverts the history it allegedly portrays and defames people
","This film is one terrible lie. As with a handful of other reviewers here, I was also a victim of the TC juggernaut, having attended Groveton High School during that period. It was a joke to play TC in any varsity team sport: football, basketball, soccer... it didn't matter. Everyone knew that a school three times their size was going to destroy us -- the only question was how badly. They were never, ever, an underdog in any sport — to suggest otherwise is absolute bunk.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, they changed the name of our team from the Tigers to the ""Lions"" (because they felt that Tigers was too close to Titans), and they depicted us as backwater hicks... which was laughable, since Groveton served Hollin Hills, the most intellectual and progressive community in the entire DC area, as well as other upper-middle class neighborhoods filled with career government professionals.<br/><br/>The problem, of course, is that Hollywood dreck like this becomes gospel to those who have no knowledge of the actual events. Rather than accept moral responsibility to make a film based on real life events reflect the truth, they purposefully pervert it to satisfy their biased fantasy and obliterate the historical record.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this grossly insulting film a negative rating, to help make up for those who have embraced it as heart-rending ""truth"", given that they know nothing about the events it claims to document."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","9","18 February 2005"," I remember
","Although it was quite a few years ago when I watched Remember the Titan the first time, I do remember how good it is. When it came on TV, I wouldn't want to miss it, even when it came with the commercial interruptions. It was just as good the second time around, and there are new discoveries. For example, the first time I saw it, Ron Gosling (The Believer, Murder by Numbers, The Notebook) had not yet proved to be such a good actor.<br/><br/>What attracted me to the movie was the football, set around the time Joe Nameth took the Jet's through its most glorious season in snatching the Superbowl from the heavily favoured Baltimore Colts. But this is college football. In the movie, in a vital game when the opponents tried a shotgun, someone in the Titans quipped, ""Who do they think they are? The New York Jets?"" While the movie seems to concentrate on the Titan's defence, it was just a little before the time when the Minnesota Viking's defence, the ""purple gang"", became legendary. But then the Titans set an example for the NFL to follow, they had a ""perfect"" season, a feat the Miami Dolphins repeated in the NFL a few years later.<br/><br/>But this is more than football. It is a wonderful movie about racial harmony, uplifting, feel-good and touching. As one commenter so beautifully puts it, let the cynics sit out on the sidelines on this one, and groan about clichés and all that. This is a movie that will warm your heart, and don't let futile vanity cheat you out of enjoying it.<br/><br/>Nor is the movie a fairy tale. It is based on a true story. It is also realistic. The camp is an isolated environment where wonderful things can be made to happen. The kids themselves understand this when the come back to the ""real world"", as one puts it. But then, through determination and good will, they bring these wonderful things into the real world. <br/><br/>Finally, anything with Denzel Washing in it is worth watching."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","7","11","7 January 2010"," Remember the Titans indeed- promised to be a great film and it was
","Rememmber the Titans is a wonderful film, compelling, compassionate, funny and often moving. It tells the story of a dedicated coach seen tackling the explosive combination of football and racial desegregation in 1970s America. The film is quite ambitious, but it not only really does pack an emotional punch but it does linger long into the memory and is several notches above sports movies I have seen. For one thing, it is slickly directed by Boaz Yakin, and benefits also from wonderful cinematography and a music score of sweeping grandeur, almost epic. Even better than any of these put together, is the marvellous lead performance of Denzel Washington that was worth an Oscar, it seems as though in every film I've seen of his he manages to give a compelling performance and this includes the underrated Cry Freedom. Will Patton matches him perfectly in a smooth, quiet and perhaps low key performance as his counterpart that isn't at all clichéd. Hayden Pannetiere also gives a fine performance, even though I didn't see how her character would ever overcome her differences with her sister. The script is extremely sharp and decisive, the editing is crisp and fast and the football parts are enough to pump up your adrenaline. The epilogue could bring tears to your eyes, as it is so beautifully put. All in all, wonderful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"avenger11250","3","13","24","25 May 2010"," This movie isn't very good.
","I was slightly amused by Remember the Titans. The film is unrealistic in its portrayal of racism and prejudice in the 1970's. The sing-songy happiness of Disney ruined the film in its attempts to portray the prejudice and bigotry that existed then and still is ubiquitous today. As an example, Herman Boone didn't have a brick thrown through his window, it was a toilet. Disney added some useless things to the story in which I am referring to how they said Ronnie Bass was homosexual which in real life he wasn't and never has been. In fact he has a wife and kids. Even though the film was created by Disney, which was founded upon dreams, I say Disney overdid the fictionalization of the movie. The movie may be based upon a true story giving Disney the right to change it, but that doesn't give them the right to change it to the point that it is almost completely fiction. Disney said that the Titans played Marshall in the movie when in fact the Titans never played Marshall and really went against Andrew Lewis and won 27 to 0! The Titans only had one team put up a fight against them, in real life, and that was Woodrow Wilson during the playoffs where the score was 36 to 14 with the Titans being the winners. Gerry Bertier was crippled after the big game, not before. All schools were integrated, not just T.C. which Disney didn't say. This movie is contrived and tripe. I do not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a true story, but to people who want to see a movie with useless suspense. Like all movies made by Disney it has a happy, predictable ending that you won't remember. The only good thing I have to say about this is it has a wholesome, positive message, but I still say it is a waste of your time."

On the upside, the film turns black and white issues into appropriate shades of gray, delivers lots of grid iron action, and waxes to a Rockyesque ""feel good"" conclusion. The fact that females scored this football flick higher (on IMDB.com) than males is telling."

","To say that Remember the Titans didn't stir some emotion in me would be a lie.  Having been out of high school almost seven years, the scenes on the football field stirred that old burning desire to be back on the gridiron cleaning people's clocks and having that sweet taste of victory in my mouth (although that actually happened a lot less than I'd like to admit).  And to see the way the two races forged friendships and integrated did cause a rush of emotion as well.  However, by the end of this movie, I knew all too well that my emotions had been deliberately played with and that this was the entire point of the movie.<br/><br/>This film evokes the typical stereotypes of both a sports movie and a free-you-mind flick.  The whites and blacks who play for the newly integrated Titans are hostile to each other at first, and then miraculously at football camp they all become friends.  They are then met with the same prejudices they once shared when they return home, and the movie chronicles their struggles to remain friends as well as the rest of the communities fight to become more tolerant.  It's a great message, but one that has been done before.  Furthermore, it is such a formulaic account here that it's hardly worth the initial emotion it evokes.  <br/><br/>On the field, the same formula (and this paragraph might be a spoiler, but then again, I'm sure you can already determine the outcome).  The Titans face tough opponents but come together to defeat them all, and, on the last play of the game with only a prayer, they somehow manage to score the winning touchdown and take the state championship (gee, haven't we seen that 300,000 times before?).<br/><br/>If you like the emotional roller coaster ride, then this is your movie.  If, like me, you tire of seeing the same formula plugged into movies with only the names of the characters different, then avoid this like the plague.  All in all, when the emotions subside, I realized that this movie left a bitter aftertaste.<br/><br/>I give it a 3 out of 10."

","It is common knowledge in the film critic community that sentimentality, if used improperly, is among the most hated of all celluloid evils. ""Remember The Titans"" provides a step-by-step lesson in how not to use it.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a high school football team from the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. It is 1971, their school has just been integrated, and their beloved head coach (Patton) has been replaced with a fiery African-American named Herman Boone (Washington). The players encounter a flurry of racial problems, and Boone hauls them all away to training camp to make them become not just a perfect football team, but friends as well. The film then chronicles the Titans' perfect season as they struggle to cope with a hateful, bigoted nation.<br/><br/>From the first to the last frame of ""Titans"", the audience is bombarded with an insurmountable amount of genre clichés and cringe-inducing cheese. To give you an idea of said cheese, let me just say that I cannot count on my fingers the number of times one or more characters randomly burst into song for no reason, usually singing what is sort of the film's theme song, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Diana Ross. This is meant to be heart-warming, playful, and inspiring, but it just comes off as irritating. As far as clichés...lord, where do I start? We have copious amounts of ""soulful"" black characters who want to do nothing but love their ""brothers"", the ""tough"" controversial coach who just wants to unite the team (and his underdeveloped assistant who just acts as someone to feed him back lines so he can essentially have conversations with himself), the promising athlete who is injured just before the ""big game"", the ostentatious ladies' man with a big ego, the sensitive, ""enlightened"" hippie with long blonde locks (who is, of course, considered homosexual), the up-tight redneck who always hates ""c--ns"" no matter what, the lovable ""Bubba"", the ""cute"" ""I'm nine and a half!"" tomboy girl who loves football, not Barbies (complete with a foil little girl to emphasize how much she loves football and hates Barbies!), and two, count 'em, two token ""fat guys"" whose purpose is to simply provide contrived comic relief, usually in the form of singing the aforementioned ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"".<br/><br/>On top of the script being shallow, predictable, conventional, and all too sentimental, I think one of the things that bothered me the most about ""Titans"" was Trevor Rabin's intrusive, grating score. It was nothing but a ubiquitous, inescapable cliché trying to tell the audience what to think. It was, to put it bluntly, insulting.<br/><br/>The acting is capably handled by Denzel Washington and Will Patton (who are both very talented actors who consistently accept awful roles), but everyone else in this turgid mess stumbles through their bland scenes and poorly-written lines with about as much intensity as a dead turtle. The direction, delivered by Boaz Yakin (whose illustrious directing career is comprised of three other films including the fabulous ""Uptown Girls""! He also wrote such fantastic films as ""From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money"", ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"", and, surprise, surprise, ""The Rookie"", another touching Disney sports extravaganza!), is utterly pedestrian. Also, the soundtrack is comprised of '60s and '70s rock songs that are all great, but have become nothing more than mood-setting clichés (someone's been watching too much ""Forrest Gump"").<br/><br/>""Remember The Titans"" also suffers from the severe detriment of taking itself too seriously. It is trying so self-consciously hard to deliver a message that it ends up doing nothing but degrading the audience's intelligence with its obvious agenda. It tries to force us to laugh, cry, and be inspired, but it only succeeds in annoying us.<br/><br/>The only thing that saves this film from falling into the D range are its occasional entertaining moments, but they are far too little to save this twisted wreck of overused morals and tired storytelling vehicles. Denzel, please try to stay away from horrid wastes of celluloid such as this and try to star in more films like ""Training Day"". You can do better.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Remember the Titans is one of the most contrived, audience insulting movies that has ever been made. Where to start with the things that suck about this movie.....<br/><br/>1.) Not all black people break into song every few minutes of their lives.<br/><br/>2.) Not all white people listen to country music.<br/><br/>3.) All state championships are not won on the final play.<br/><br/>4.) A team would not be running the ball with 20 seconds left in a game, risking a fumble. They would have just taken a knee and the game would be over.<br/><br/>5.) There were more than 8 songs released in the 1970's. Apparently, Hollywood never got that memo.<br/><br/>6.) The little girl. Enough said.<br/><br/>7.) The ""transformation"" of the Gerry character happened way too fast to make it realistic. Over the course of a 2 week football camp, he went from telling the coach he didn't need any of ""them"" on the defense, to being the main guy who brought the races together.<br/><br/>8.) Even without knowing the real story, you could see the car accident coming light years away.<br/><br/>9.) No football team would ever just throw guys into a game on defense in the 2nd half of the state championship game who had never played on defense previously.<br/><br/>10.) Awesome waste of Kate Bosworth. ""Now that you've won some football games with both black and white players, I'm willing to shake your hand Julius."" If only she had gone to the training camp. Then she'd understand it all so much better.<br/><br/>11.) Let's throw in a California hippie to show that white people can be discriminated against too. The audience will never see that coming.<br/><br/>12.) We're supposed to believe that the ""Sunshine"" character would actually doubt whether he should go into the game because he can't throw an option pitch?? <br/><br/>13.) Way too many impassioned speeches about being ""perfect"" and this being ""our time"". I was afraid they might run out of music to score these scenes.<br/><br/>14.) Love the slow clap and standing ovation for Gerry's mother. Of course, the TV commentators would announce when she enters the stadium as well. By the way, did they really televise high school state championship games in 1971? <br/><br/>15.) Ryan Gosling's character giving up his spot to Petey because ""Petey's just better coach"".<br/><br/>16.) This whole racism thing is important and all, but I really wanted to make the Virginia high school sports hall of fame. Now that's some big time stuff right there.<br/><br/>17.) Let's use the white coach's trick play on the last play to show just how far these two men have come so they're winners in life as well as on the field.<br/><br/>18.) Apparently, every time a new player comes into a game, he makes a game changing great play within the first two plays that he's in there, propelling the team to an easy victory.<br/><br/>19.) Darn those crazy backup quarterbacks. They'll getcha every time. Can we see a movie where the starting QB gets hurt, and the season goes to hell because the backup QB sucks? There's your reality.<br/><br/>20.) And finally, what a great message the movie gives by showing how winning football games is the solution to all the world's problems. Want to end racism? Just win some football games."

","Racial prejudice is the pariah of our society. It permeates every avenue to making the world a fair place to live. It's not just American society either. It's in the North, the South, and everywhere overseas. Prejudice is counterproductive and ugly. This movie sort of pretends to rise above it. It's a feel good movie in some respects. While racism is at the center of the film, the answers are just a little too pat. It's just a little too easy. Granted, it's just a movie, but I wish it got a little more down and dirty. A trip to a training camp out of town and a lecture on the Gettysburg battlefield just wouldn't do it. Some of these kids are going to hold onto stuff their parents have driven into them a lot longer than this. Now all that said, I still enjoyed the film. The characterizations of Coach Boone and Coach Yoast are well drawn. They are both good men who love their players. They are both excellent role models. And the players and the game scenes are believable (although I am getting tired of every hit on the field sounding like a Buick hitting a concrete wall--this is happening in most football movies). The growth of Gary and the Rev is nicely done and we hope that it really happened that way. I enjoyed the two white guys who just kind of matter of factly walked into practice--Sunshine and Louis--who just wanted to play football. There are some kids out there who don't think about race very much. They are pretty naive, but they are charming. I loved when Louis hugged Coach Boone and told him he was going to college. That's a nice touch. <br/><br/>I could go on, but others have said so much already. It's a good action movie with nice human characters. It just gets a little simplistic at times and it needs to answer for that."

","Tossing it out there like a football, this sport movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer isn't really much about football, but preaching against racism. Inspired by real events, the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff, and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hard-ass man. Most of the scenes, we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, and Ryan Gosling all new, whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye"" Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out, and remember the titans."

","In the last decade, I've realized that perhaps the most difficult ""genre"" of movie to make work is the SPORTS movie! Not only are there only probably a handful of 'great' sports films in the history of cinema, there are really very few 'good' sports movies (relative to how many sports films that have been made). Really, the 1980s is the end of the era of even good sports movies (and most of them about baseball!). It was officially over and done with then.<br/><br/>All the so-called major sports flicks made in the last 10 years are pretty much formulaic and follow the same recipe: tell the tale of a bunch of downtrodden, undertalented (yet scrappy!) ""brothers"" who band together to pull off the impossible...win the big game! And I actually think that this film that I'm reviewing REMEMBER THE TITANS (2000) started this new trend of rather formulaic, soft-headed, cheesy sports movies of the last decade, which include WE ARE MARSHALL and GLORY ROAD, all of which were supposed to be ""fact-based"" movies. The problem with all these movies is that, while they may have gotten the very general details correct (character names, opponent mantres, era costumes, etc.), all these films fail where it really counts: character, dialogue, and story.<br/><br/>Set in a 1971 D.C. suburb and starring Denzel Washington (who really had gotten long in the tooth at this point in his career!) plays yet another typical in-your-face, take-no-junk, proud black man, a hodgepodge of pretty much all the characters he had played up to that point in his career, and it's annoying! Virtually all the characters in REMEMBER THE TITANS (including Washington) are all one-dimensional and cliché. The ever reliable Will Patton does his best to overcome a thankless role as the white assistant coach that Washington's character deposes (and pretty much runs over for the entire movie!); of course Patton's character turns out to be a closet liberal and completely understanding of the man who took HIS job from him! Hayden Pannietierre, as Patton's annoyingly spunky and super-smart daughter certainly shows talent for a child actor (at the time), but what kid in the history of the world has ever acted like this?! Then you have a bunch of nameless, one-note footballers and assistant coaches of both races who somehow learn to LOVE each other! The absolutely most annoying character was that faux-gay transfer surfer dude from California, who is one of the weirdest characters ever to grace the movie screen!<br/><br/>The only tolerable characters in the film are played by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris as the prospective leaders of the white and black players and help bring them all together. Their personal relationship is actually authentic (thus the extra star!), but everything surrounding them is NOT! In real life (which this movie is supposed to be based on), even post 60s (1971 to be exact), I find it hard to believe that opposite races would have hated each other so vehemently at the start of the film, only to end up getting along so famously by the end of it, especially on a team that was literally FORCED to be together!"

Too many films have been made about sports and how they inspire kids to be better or help bring young boys into manhood with a fancy been around the block coach. Denzel Washington plays the part well but his speechifying about respect and race start to drag after a while. Even the cute little girl who throws temper tantrums during the Titans games when they are not playing well or lectures Denzel on the strategies of the sport made me want to say enough. So do yourself a favor and forget the Titans. Plus the fact their singing sucks!"

As the head coach, Denzel Washington uses military-style techniques which have been shown time and again to succeed in creating unity and team spirit among people from different backgrounds.  Big surprise here.  The film's most important lesson is for people to give each other enough respect and trust before making judgements about other people.  The film glosses over the genuine cultural differences between black and white communities.  They do exist, though are generally minimal among people of the same socioeconomic class. This isn't really important except to those who feel this kind of thing has been done to death over the last three decades.  Even they will find plenty to enjoy in ""Remember the Titan's"".  There's plenty of humor and action (some really tough looking football plays).  There is also one truly amazing performance, that of Hayden Panettiere as Cheryl Yost.  Hayden is TOTALLY convincing as Will Patton's football-obsessed daughter.  She's also spunky, charming and strong-willed. There's nothing bitchy about this little girl.  You believe she could tear your head off if she put her mind to it.  Yet, She still manages to be very feminine and cute.  As I said, a truly amazing performance.<br/><br/>This movies a keeper.

I have seen it several times and although it occasionally changes a few minor details of the real-life football team to make the film more poignant, the overall film is truthful and uplifting. If you are curious about these inaccuracies, read through the list on IMDb, though this didn't lessen my appreciation for the film when I read them. That's because despite these changes, the acting still was great, the direction and writing wonderful and highly manipulative (in a positive way). This is a film for anyone--child, teen or adult.

The rest fills in rather nicely as college students or inbred rednecks.<br/><br/>But every character is stereotyped, you know where the plot will take you, and the lines are so, so, so incredibly stuffed and rigid. Nobody says things like that in real life. Every line is like a well rehearsed speech (which frankly they are, since it's a movie).<br/><br/>The football matches are well shot, but not very interesting. If you don't know the game they are too short to really give a feel of the game. If you do know the game, they are too short to be exciting, as you never actually can follow a game in the movie.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, but nevertheless totally predictable, right up to the ending. Dull, dull, dull.<br/><br/>Oh wait, there's a message; Don't judge anyone because of their colour. Well, the bible could probably tell you that.

","This film is a bastardization of black/American history. Now, lets start from the beginning, another film about interracial, or prejudicial/bigotry issues between players on a team (played out to death in modern American movies). I can think of countless examples; Coach Carter, School Ties, Radio, Rudy, Varsity Blues, The Program, and...yes, the list of mediocrity continues, but I'll cut it short! You see, I'm not really into sports, but that isn't why I dislike this film so strongly. My reason is that the whole racial issues aspect is a little out-played/out-dated, the acting-lazy, and the film as a whole, rather corny and pretentious, with a lingering air of belligerence and predictability. The little girl (Sheryl) played by Hayden Panettiere as Coach Bill's outspoken daughter was absolutely unrealistic and obnoxious. She was loud, boyish, and downright rude at times. Her father deserved a slap in the face for raising such brash, insensitive little child. She reminded me of a lesbian version of Rhoda from the Bad Seed (1956). The lead character Coach Herman (Denzel Washigton) had no character-development and was at times overly dramatic, rash, and had an exaggerated confidence that destroyed the intended character. I also found the film to be very mediocre, and if that wasn't bad enough, sexist as well. Yes, I know, the film is about men on a football team, but the women characters that were present (rare), like the wives and girl friends, were plain, waif-like and generic. They mostly had one-liner dialog and scenes that lasted literally seconds. So if you appreciate not-so-predictable, fresh and more captivating entertainment and history told as it is without the commercial addition of crude jokes and bad characters, skip this film. Overall, an interesting premise, but horribly executed and poorly acted/directed."

I don't know anything about American Football and it's probably one of the least known sports over here, because we only get to see something of it once a year: when the Superbowl is on. So that didn't do it for me, but what made me decide to watch it was the fact that Denzel Washington played an important role in it.<br/><br/>He's coach Herman Boone, a newly appointed African-American football coach who will have to lead a high school football team in Virginia, during the early 70's. Racism is still the norm and even though the school has been recently mixed under federal mandate, integration is far from reality. Many white players even threaten to sit out until he is replaced by a white coach. But he doesn't give up that easily and during a training camp, he learns the white and black players how to get along. In the end they all become friends and it's that bond that will get them through the season undefeated. But when the captain of the team gets injured in a car accident, just before the state championship, they will have to prove that they can adapt and that they still can win the match...<br/><br/>True stories have always been a great source of inspiration for Hollywood, but personally I can't name too many of these movies that I really liked. The main reason for that is that they are almost always preachy and as sweet as syrup. ""Remember the Titans"" doesn't completely get caught in that trap, but isn't really able to avoid it either. Or wouldn't you call a movie that shows a coach, who goes with his team to one of the greatest battlefields on the American continent, while giving away a speech about team spirit, fighting for each other and things like that, not preachy??? I certainly do, but I'm glad that not everything about the movie was like that.<br/><br/>The acting for instance was OK. You can't expect anything less than OK from a man like Denzel Washington of course, but most of the other actors did a nice job too, even though most of them were complete strangers to me. The direction too isn't bad. Again, Boaz Yakin is a complete stranger to me, but what he has done with this movie could have been a lot worse. OK, there is nothing exceptional, original or daring about it, but he knows the conventions of the genre and has followed them rule by rule.<br/><br/>All in all I must say that this wasn't the worst movie about sports. OK, it will never be in my list of favorite movies, but there are worse ways to spend your time. I'm sure that it will be loved by the American audience, especially the young males, because this is one of those typical American spectacles. But even the others might give it a try. I did and wasn't completely convinced, but also not entirely disappointed by it. That's why I give it a score in between a 6.5/10 and a 7/10."

Denzel plays a coach of a football team and it's a time when racism and prejudices are common (1971). Denzel decides to have the whites and the blacks train together and they don't like it. He takes them on a camp and you can probably figure out what happens there...? If you can't figure it out I will be glad to reveal that they start liking each other and becomes good friends! When they get home people can't understand how they can like each other and stuff like that, but the team manages to convince some of them that racism is wrong and a super corny scene is when one of the leading roles' girlfriend says something like ""I will try and like them for you"" or some s*** like that! The team gets to the final and they of course win! This was a really corny and gross movie and I can't say that I enjoyed it. It had okay acting and such but all this heroic stuff and corny Americanism made the movie weak! I gave it 3/10 and don't feel that it deserves anymore than that!"
"namilliron","4","5","9","18 November 2000"," Thrown for a loss (with spoiler[s] to those who think it is)
","This movie started out as a straight drama, and took a serious wrong turn towards a comedic styling better suited for MAJOR LEAGUE/BULL DURHAM/REPLACEMENTS and others of that ilk.  <br/><br/>When the guy kisses his teammate with no motivation whatsoever, it's burlesque farce.  When the team unites to sing Motown (and badly at that), it's the equivalent of Romeo and Juliet in character doing a scene on ER. These scenes intercepted the film midway for a touchdown on the side of political correctness and created an inconsistency in styles of performing in the open against style at the end.<br/><br/>To paraphrase the late Robert Reed: ""once a film opens in a given style of acting/writing/directing;  it cannot under any circumstances introduce (let alone accept) a different style"".<br/><br/>As such, I cannot recommend this film to anyone.  For straight football drama done right, rent BRIAN'S SONG or THE LONGEST YARD instead."

When this abomination was complete it let off a stench so foul and heinous it actually started global warming. This should have been one of those garbage straight to video Disney films with unknown actors. That would have been to easy they had to go get the great Denzel Washington, veteran of films like Glory, Philadelphia, Training Day, etc, and drag him down. Worse even then Denzel, they dare to sully the glorious name of Football. How dare these vermin try to castrate America's true National Pastime. I wish I could line up one of those stuffed shirt, studio, prancing, pre-madonna's that green lighted this, and go flying into them helmet first. If anyone's ever played football, or just enjoys the game, they'll realize this film has nothing to do with football. The higher ups involved had better hope there is no God or surely there judgment will be great, prehaps they'll even be forced to watch this film.<br/><br/>If you come upon some individual whether it be a friend or neighbor, co-worker or boss, relative or stranger, big or small, black or white, and in the course of your discussions this film comes up and by some reason they should bring up this film and mention something the least bit positive about it berate them immediately and forcefully, show absolutely no mercy as they deserve none. Remember at this point we may not even be dealing with actual humans that have souls. Let them know they are lowering the bar on humanity, tell them they should not be allowed to procreate and your opinion of them has changed to a degree that it might never be saved. If they start to argue remain calm and go straight to the evidence. Show them the film, I know this opens up an ethical dilemma as to paying money to see it but that's another discussion, and point out the garbage frame by frame and line by line if necessary. If they see the light and error of their ways openly embrace them and tell them everyday will now be better then the last. If however they still like the filth tell them to leave and never bother you again, so that you and your family might live in peace separated from such dastardly swine."

","""Remember the Titans"" is based on a true story which took place in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971 at T.C. Williams High School when segregation was still a huge issue in the South. T.C. Williams was the high school that brought together two football teams, one white, and one black which means ""these guys don't just have to tolerate each other. They have to play together"" (LaSalle). The historical aspect of this movie is a strength. At preseason camp, Coach Boone calls for a 3a.m. run. The players run miles and miles through the woods and end up at Gettysburg. Coach Boone tells the boys that the men who fought in the Battle of Gettysburg were fighting the same fight that they are still fighting for among themselves and that if they do not pull together as a team they too will be destroyed just like the men who fought in the battle. He continues to say to the players and other coaches, ""I don't care if you like each other or not, but you will respect each other. And maybe...I don't know, maybe we'll learn to play this game like men"" (Remember the Titans). It is in the next scene where the team is having practice and they finally come together and learn to play as one team, no matter who is positioned next to them."
"bkoganbing","9","3","5","13 December 2009"," Titans Rule
","Although Remember The Titans is based on a true story from Northern Virginia in 1971, I couldn't help feeling that I had seen this story before. Then I remembered that a short time before the incidents on which this film is based occurred, there was a film made called Tic Tic Tic. This also involved a southern town growing out of the old days and into the new ones with the post Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. In that film a new black sheriff played by Jim Brown is elected in a southern town and he asks the former sheriff George Kennedy to stay on as his deputy to help ease the tensions.<br/><br/>When the folks who were making Tic Tic Tic happen on the big screen, how could they have known that life was imitating their art. This northern Virginia town was being integrated, black people were now voting, the schools and businesses were being integrated, the city fathers had to take into account a whole new population with the franchise. <br/><br/>Successful football coach Will Patton is asked to step aside for Denzel Washington, newly arrived from North Carolina. Patton agrees to stay on as his defensive assistant coach to help the team and not incidentally the town. Because of the good will and good intentions of two strong personalities they make the newly integrated team the Titans work.<br/><br/>Even with two Academy Awards and several nominations besides, I doubt Denzel Washington will ever get a more beloved role than Herman Boone. In addition to coach, Washington is husband to Nicole Ari Parker and father to Krysten Leigh Jones. Later on when Patton's daughter Hayden Panettiere comes over to the Washington household to visit, she spends more time with Washington going over the game than with her peer dressing the dolls that little girls are supposed to play with. My favorite scene in the film is with Washington and Panettiere who loves the idea of a child even a girl taking an interest in what puts food on the table, but not quite understanding it. <br/><br/>The kids make it work as well. Ryan Hurst who was the team captain under Patton and Donald Faison one of the new black players forge their own bond and make it happen for the rest. Those who won't go with the new program have to learn or leave. <br/><br/>My two favorites are the two outsiders who also help make it work. Kip Pardue plays a California hippie type kid who also likes football, if you can fathom that combination and Ethan Suplee who just moved into town and just wants to play football. Neither of them are hung up on all the racial stuff the town was going through, they're presence on the Titans is invaluable.<br/><br/>You won't have any problems in remembering the Titans. This is a fine inspirational film showing that people of good will can put hate aside if the better parts of their person is appealed to."
"tupungato","9","3","5","7 January 2009"," Predictable But Very Enjoyable
","The person who assigns parts to actors always has a very important job, but his choices can become crucial in the case of a movie involving a sport. Miscasting in this kind of movie can subject some performers to ridicule and doom even the most thoughtful and well written story to mediocrity. <br/><br/>In a story about a singer/musician, for example, the woman selected to play the part of the entertainer can learn the lyrics to various songs, sway and smile, engage an audience, move her mouth and her hands. She does not have to truly sing or play an instrument. Similarly, a man chosen to play the part of a United States president or well-known foreign leader can prepare by learning the significant events that took place during the ruler's reign, study his idiosyncrasies and mannerisms, and memorize important speeches - almost a natural task for an actor. He does not have to have ever held a government post as a prerequisite.<br/><br/>I don't mean to imply that an actor with only community theater experience could easily play one of the above parts in a major motion picture, or that a person awarded for his performance in one of these roles would not deserve the recognition. The person who portrays an athlete might in some ways, in fact, have a less challenging job. <br/><br/>But unlike the actor who plays the part of an entertainer or a politician (or who portrays a doctor, a priest, a teacher, a criminal, a soldier, a pilot, an explorer, or a lawyer, for that matter), the one who plays the part of an athlete has definite limits with respect to what he can pretend. He can't fake agility, coordination, a comfortable running style, a natural throwing motion or catching form; he must demonstrate skills beyond his acting.<br/><br/>Remember The Titans moved and inspired me (despite a few scenes and some dialog that sort of manipulate a viewer's feelings) partly because the young men playing members of that football team not only swaggered, jostled, bantered, and jived like high school athletes, they also played like them. This movie benefits from equally impressive performances from the adults. Denzel Washington did a commendable job as Herman Boone, the demanding, domineering, yet fair head football coach, and Will Patton did tremendous work as the demoted head coach Bill Yoast, the mentor with the softer approach and rather folksy style, who must deal with the immaturity of his bigoted friends as well as his tendency to patronize the African American members of the team."
"litto","7","3","5","6 July 2007"," A very inspiring interpretation of what's possible as a team
","Remember the Titans is an excellent sports-drama, written by the American Gregory Allen Howard. It's directed by the seemingly unknown Boaz Yakin who puts his skills to action very well in this film. It is film that's based upon a true story it premiered in the U.S late 2000.<br/><br/>A small suburb in Virginia seems perfect from the outside, but the society is based on racial inequalities of large proportions. But under a federal mandate a school in for Afro-Americans in Virginia gets integrated to T.C. Williams High School. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is a successful football coach who gets assigned to lead the merged high school football team. Tensions arise when this fact is introduced to the Titans, consisting of both black and white students. Due to the segregation within the group, their performance as a team is obviously unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Consequently Herman takes them on a bonding trip, to overcome the racial differences. Herman is not like any other coach, he distinguishes himself as a winner, and he will not tolerate any mistakes. The team's affections for each other become more profound than Herman ever expected. And as the season progresses the team's success ultimately causes the entire community to accept the changes.<br/><br/>The overall performance of Denzel is rock solid all the way through, and same goes for the rest of actors. The soundtrack is also a delight since it's filled with great oldies recognized by anyone. Among these songs we find ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Marvin Gaye and ""Spirit in the Sky"" by Norman Greenbaum just to mention a few. The main symphony theme also blends perfectly during those special, touching, moments.<br/><br/>Personally I got very interested in trying out American football while watching this film. It's also a very inspiring interpretation of what's possible when you work as a team. They Titans believed in their caused and proved for the rest of the society what's possible together. If black and white can cooperate perfectly in the football stadium, why wouldn't it be the same on the outside? I particularly admire this film for it moral values. It surpasses the ethical differences and shows that everyone is capable of respecting each other. I think this is an important message to remember, considering mankind's violent nature, and history, with wars and discrimination."

","Similar to ""Hoosiers"" but a totally different story just the same. Washington was perfect as the hard nosed coach dedicated to winning. His efforts to bring the players together as a unit and the boys attitudes toward him and each other made for a very good drama. I foretold the ending, plus the picture contained some corny scenes, but I still give it a high rating."
"jboothmillard","5","4","8","8 February 2009"," Remember the Titans
","I knew the lead actor that it was based on a true story about American football, and I have to say, for a Walt Disney Pictures it doesn't have that schmaltzy feeling. Basically two schools in Alexandria Virginia integrate forming T.C. Williams High School, and the Caucasian Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) of the Titans, is being replaced by African American Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) from North Carolina. Tensions are formed as he forms a team with both black and white players, creating tensions, but after much training, these are eased at camp in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. When they get back, they get to prove themselves on the pitch, and they prove both successful and accepted by the community. There is the point when they get to the biggest match of all, and a star player is paralysed, but this doesn't damage their spirits and their determination to win, which they do. Also starring Donald Faison as Petey Jones, Wood Harris as Julius Campbell, Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Louie Lastik, Nicole Ari Parker as Carol Boone, young Heroes actress Hayden Panettiere as Sheryl Yoast, Craig Kirkwood as Jerry 'Rev' Harris, Kip Pardue as Ronnie 'Sunshine' Bass, Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth as Emma Hoyt and The Notebook's Ryan Gosling as Alan Bosley. Washington always gives a good performance, and this in no exception, and Panettiere is cute, in a film with a good story about overcoming hostility and prejudice, and going to sporting glory. Worth watching!"

The supporting cast back him up well, allowing us to get a sense of the atmosphere that these young men faced and the struggle that they endured both on an off the field.<br/><br/>It is these performances that facilitate the delivery of several strong emotional punches which will bring you to tears.<br/><br/>Remember the Titans manages to find a decent balance between sports and the human side, bringing both together nicely. As a result the pacing felt quite natural, even if it does feel a tad longer than its one hour fifty runtime.<br/><br/>Overall this film delivers a powerful message in a thoughtful way, with a solid performance from Washington and the supporting cast, leaving you to ponder the nature of humanity and power of sports."

Remember the Titans is much more than your average sports movie about a high school football team. It's a fact based story about two men who must overcome their differences and help an entire town deal with frustration,anger, and mistrust. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast ( Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school. In 1971 the schools are integrated and Coach Boone is chosen to become the head coach of the football team while Coach Yoast is demoted to Assistant Coach. Remember the Titans is a powerful sports movies with excellent performances from Denzel Washington and Will Patton. Remember this movie."
"joshconradson","6","1","1","23 November 2015"," Uplifting, just like all of Disney movies :(
","This is a good film with a lot of good uplifting music but like all Disney films it is highly sanitized and joyful. Its set in the early 70's in Virginia, and yet the only racial slurs used where ""coon"" and ""boy"" both derogatory racial terms for blacks, but still not truly how it would have been back then. That is the problem with Disney is that they try to make every film super clean and G-rated to get the widest audiences but they often forget how to keep it true and realistic to the time and place that it is supposedly taking place. And to top it off, having to compress it into a regular time allotment for a film they sped up the parts of training in which the people actually did bond and become close, but that took most of the training camp for them to do not over night."
"Ddey65","6","1","1","12 April 2006"," Would be a better movie if it were true.
","In 1969, there was a survey taken that rated the majority of Americans' opinion of the Ku Klux Klan as being more despicable than the Viet Cong. Yet judging by the inability of many communities of the 1970's to accept integrated schools, such a sentiment would seem hard to believe. I passed up numerous chances to watch this movie, and when I finally saw it on The Disney Channel(of all places), I realized I missed a good one. Boston and Detroit weren't the first battlegrounds for school integration in the 1970's, but even if Alexandria, Virginia wasn't one of them, southern cities were just as hostile towards it as they were in the 1950's and '60's. I had a glowing review planned for this movie until I saw some of the user comments here, and I almost changed my mind.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays as Herman Boone, an African-American coach, hired on the basis of affirmative action who faces a great deal of resentment for it, especially from former coach Bill Yoast(Will Patton), who is demoted to defensive coach. From the beginning, Boone makes it clear that he's a coach first, and not that much of an activist. Yoast's football-crazed daughter(Hayden Paneittiere), is such an outstanding character, that if this wasn't at least loosely based on a true story, you'd have to make someone like her up.<br/><br/>Needless to say, most of the kids don't get along with each other, but Boone is determined to make sure that ends at training camp, and it does, which nearly creates a rift between first string Q.B. Gerry Bertier(Ryan Hurst), and his girlfriend(Kate Bosworth). What we eventually learn is that there's a sinister plot to make sure the integration fails both on the team and at school in general. Boone finds that he can't lose a single game or else he's fired. So, being the determined coach that he is, he wins every single game. However Yoast finds his white friends are plotting to revoke his membership in the local hall of fame if he doesn't agree to let them dump Boone, so they rig the next game.<br/><br/>Big Julius(Wood Harris) sounds a great deal like Mr. T when he tells an opposing player, that he'd better get used to being on the ground.<br/><br/>As Louie Lastik, Ethan Suplee does a complete 180-degree reversal from his role in ""American History X(1998)"" as a kid from New Jersey who LOVES black culture! This is a kid who knows segregation is stupid and pointless. If he were a kid of anytime since the late-1980's he'd be the kind of kid who drives a pimped-out full-size sedan with huge speakers and chrome dubs.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie suggested that Sunshine(Kip Pardue) really was a homosexual, but that his fellow students just taunted him simply because he was such a hippie. Aside from this, I can't really say anything about this movie that hasn't been said before. Even if the events of this movie didn't exactly take place the way the movie depicted, it was still memorable and glorious, clichés or no clichés."

It does it through the characters' journeys, and experiences, and this seems to come out more maturely, and gets the point across much more powerfully. <br/><br/>I have to say that the only reason this was not rated higher is because I have seen it so many times it is beginning to annoy me.

","I'm giving it a 5 out 10 only because many of the young actors saved the movie. This movie is littered with constant poor action on the football field. If realistic football action is somewhat important to you, don't watch this movie. It's so over the top and unrealistic. Plus, the action is too slow and poorly choreographed. They try to stage every hit or tackle as the biggest and baddest hit in the history of the sport.<br/><br/>There's one moment in the film that was laughable. Of course, it's in the big game and the Titans are struggling. So, a running back breaks through the Titans line and runs basically untouched upfield while a Titan linebacker gets OFF OF THE GROUND and chases him down even though the running back had at least a 10 yard head start on him. It was painfully....comically...disgustingly unbelievable.<br/><br/>Plus, in this movie, you'll see more football players get flipped because of a hit than you'll see in a full season of watching NCAA, High School, and NFL football.<br/><br/>Hey, if you're fine with unrealistic sports action, watch this movie and enjoy it. But if realistic sports action is something that you expect to go along with a DRAMATIC sports movie that you're watching, this isn't for you.<br/><br/>I must admit that I did 'laugh' and 'cry' during this movie.

He exudes a cardboard presence of an army commander throughout the entire film.  Worse is that he is NEVER wrong - entirely unflawed in every way.  His temper is never out of control, nor his slightest words without complete omniscience.  Consider his magnanimous speech at Gettysburg-wait a minute - Hasn't that been done before??<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed parts of this film very much.

"Bob A-2","4","3","6","27 December 2000"," Sticky sweet: halfway through the picture my teeth were hurting.
","I may not be what one would call a dyed-in-the-wool sports buff, but football, combined with mandatory school integration in the South of thirty years ago, sounds like it would make for a pretty confrontational picture. Instead, Remember the Titans gives us a paint-by-numbers cast of goody goods, villainous townspeople and teary-eyed, reformed-overnight racists who suddenly ""see the light"" in time with appropriately swelling musical accompaniment. And of course there's one guy in the hospital watching the final Big Game on television as the others play their hearts out for him: I'm not kidding, it's that cliche. It was unintentionally funny when, near the end, one of the characters said ""Is this really about football anyway?""<br/><br/>
I believe I was looking to Denzel, as the football coach with everything to prove in this one season, to anchor the film a little more forcefully -- the kind of charismatic individual who could bring the warring factors of a newly integrated high school football team together with dramatic, yet plausible energy. Alas, he's a cypher, lost somewhere in the middle of a plot that's on Automatic Pilot anyway -- suddenly Christopher Plummer's character in The Sound of Music looks decisive.  <br/><br/>Funny coincidence is, while I was waiting for Titans to start, I went over to the next auditorium where Men of Honor was playing and watched that for a few minutes. Men of Honor is a film about mandatory integration of the military; I won't know til I see the whole thing whether it's a good movie or not, but I can say safely that there's a lot more material to be explored within that topic than in the relatively ""safe controversy"" and easy targets at which Remember the Titans is aiming."

Most people just think of movies as entertainment but Remember the Titans was so much more than that and people could really learn a lesson by watching this movie. I suggest that every person watch this at least once in their life because it changed the way I look at everybody. Each character in the movie really had an important part and I can't believe that this really happened in real life.

","I know some people who actually lived the events portrayed at TC Williams High. Although there is some amount of liberties taken with characters and events, the essence is true. It was a historic event that took place w/o the notice of most of the rest of the country. So much courage displayed by all those young men on the team as well as their coaches.<br/><br/>The film is so well done, thank God. It would have been a shame for one more amazing true event to be despoiled by a poor script and film translation (aka - Cameron's silly, sentimental ""Titanic"". Real life and destiny provided more amazing and profound stories that would have riveted us all to the screen and perhaps taught us something. Cameron goes for lowest common denominator, overworking special effects and writing the most superficial story that had been done a million times before and far better. Plus poor direction of some very talented actors made it all the more boring.) None of that can be said about Titans. Story, direction, editing, acting, cinematography, music are all so well done. But indeed the film rests on the telling of the tale and the performers.<br/><br/>Denzel is at his best in one more over-looked Oscar-winning caliber portrayal. Also excellent in far more than support is Will Patton as Bill Yoast. Patton is a terrific actor who always turns in an excellent performance regardless of the role (from great films like ""No Way Out"" to duds like ""The Postman"".) The cast of the youthful actors on the team round out the depth of the tale and bring us a variety of characters that are both entertaining and deeply moving. The friendship that develops between Gary Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) becomes the heart and soul of the film. These young actors in particular carry much of the film through their honest and intimate portrayal. This is another cast where all turn in terrific performances from the leads to the minor roles.

","When segregation comes to an end TC Williams High School is created by the combination of an all-black school with an all-white school and, for political reasons, the white head coach Bill Yoast is replaced by black coach Herman Boone. This obviously causes a lot of conflict within he team and it is only to protect his white players that Yoast decides to stay on as the defensive coach. When the players go to training camp the conflicts are everywhere and Boone's first job is to bring the team together.<br/><br/>Usually when movie premieres come onto terrestrial television they are trailed big time and are put in plum spots; so when this film was simply dumped into the daytime schedules at Christmas time I feared the worst and, for that reason, didn't get round to watching it until February. As with many films, there is plenty of good in it but it is dented a bit by its weaknesses. As you would expect it to be, this is a simple story of race conflict being resolved within a group of youths who then become a winning team and, in the telling, it doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. Now that is not to look down on the real story behind the film but the film itself cannot help but spoil it by always going for the easy clichés, the simple and corny bonding moments that summarise a difficult journey and, whenever possible, sticking in some mighty, swelling music to make sure we all understand how emotional that particular moment is.<br/><br/>What this does is reduces the true story of a turbulent time to the level of melodrama and, while I admit it would have been hard to do it any other way, it cannot help but damage the film a little. However despite this it is still quite enjoyable and those that can forgive its self-indulgence will find much to like about it. However for me it was hard to get past the corn and I was only able to see an average sports movie with a core of a ""lets understand each other"" storyline. The sports stuff is OK but never gripping and the characters are a touch too generic to be really involving. It is fortunate then that the performances are mainly reasonably good, certain good enough to keep the film lively and watchable. Washington delivers a good performance even if it lacks any subtlety or edge to it; likewise Patton is right out of the playbook and does what is expected of him. The support cast have some good performances and some corny performances but generally they all do well enough to match the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Overall this is an OK film that is quite enjoyable but doesn't do anything special. While having enough to involve and just about entertain, the film still suffers from being overly melodramatic, corny and loaded with moments that come across as rather clichéd. If you can accept this then it is a good film, otherwise it is just an OK one that will grate on you occasionally."

","Another of the excessive number of football movies made.  This one has a few differences from the others, however.  The acting, for the most part, is good.  The film, visually, is alright.  It is nothing spectacular, however, and leaves much to be desired as far as anything but a 'football movie.' It is not that it is a horrible movie by any means, but come on, it's not exactly Kubrick, now is it?  Very typical and INCREDIBLY predictable.  This is a movie about fanatics for fanatics, and the sadistic coach and disgustingly unintelligent players leave much to be desired in the way of heroes.  It is true that the moral/racial theme behind the movie is the most interesting aspect, and also the most commendable subject, but the Coach might try a little variety, all if his movies are beginning to fade into each other."

","Before putting one's entire faith in the movie as a true story, it would behoove to read the FAQ section for the picture here on IMDb. Even so, the way the film is put together makes for an inspirational tale of athletes setting aside their differences for the sake of teamwork and winning in a competitive environment. Virtually all the characters here are likeable enough, and I particularly enjoyed Louie Lastik (Ethan Suplee), one of the first to bridge the racial divide because his appearance made him an outsider even to the white players. Very surprising to see in the lineup was a young Ryan Gosling, who didn't really look like he should have been on the team based on his size, weight and talent, and who recognized as much in the critical final championship game by taking himself out in favor of a better player. Another poignant scene occurred when defensive leader and team captain Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) had his friend Ray (Burgess Jenkins) cut because of an intentionally missed block to make a black player look bad. Together with head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) and defensive coach Bill Yoast's (Will Patton) willingness to step down for the cause of integration and remain an anchor for the players in a divided community, the T.C. Williams High School Titans become the model of teamwork, dedication and strict discipline necessary to attain their desired championship. Look past the cliches, and you'll find an inspirational and entertaining sports story here that should meet with your approval."

","It's 1971 Alexandria, Virginia. The town is racked with racial strife. A storekeeper has shot a black man. The successful high school football team is coached by Bill Yoast (Will Patton) who is in line to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Political changes mean the integration of the school and its football team. Then coach Yoast is replaced by coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). In order to keep the peace, Yoast stays to coach defense.<br/><br/>It's a fairly standard superficial look at a segregated system being forced together. The best thing in this movie is the duo of Will Patton and Denzel Washington. They do the heaviest lifting acting-wise. They have to act through a minefield especially Denzel. He can't look arrogant but also can't be a saint. He is aggressive and not the most likable character at the start. Will Patton's character is much more the saint in this movie. The players each have limited roles. Ryan Hurst has the leading role among the players and he provides a suitable performance. It is fascinating to see a baby faced Ryan Gosling, and I didn't even realized that Hayden Panettiere played the young loud coach's daughter.<br/><br/>I guess based-on-true-story limits the writing in the movie. However, this is like somebody copied all the stereotypical story lines from other sports-race movies. It isn't very deep, and all the big ideas are touched upon. Every scene is about how race is affecting this school. While the coaches get proper time, the kids are too numerous to get enough space. They need to remember the teens."

","When I started watching this movie, I thought to myself, ""this is an important movie"". This is a movie about discrimination and racism in the early 1970s and the courage it took to deal with it.<br/><br/>And the movie was fairly enjoyable and it was clear who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. Denzel gave a stellar performance. And the actor portraying the football captain did a great job as well in capturing the nuances and subtleties of his character. <br/><br/>But it seemed overly melodramatic. I find it inconceivable that the Board of Education would have appointed coach Boone with the intention of firing him after his first loss. It just seemed a bit much and overblown. <br/><br/>And then one of the referees started intentionally calling bad plays against Boone's team -- I thought it was highly improbable that this happened the way it was depicted in the movie. <br/><br/>And then I started wondering what really happened. Frankly, I would have preferred something closer to reality than what was depicted. It was all a bit too melodramatic and fanciful and not grounded in reality, so much so that I felt fairly cynical toward the movie and wondered if anything outside of the basic facts was even true -- the basic facts being that Boone was hired to coach and his team won the state championship the first year.<br/><br/>As a comparison, imagine a movie where Abraham Lincoln uses his magical powers to sway the course of the Civil War in the right direction. Would it have added drama to what actually happened ? Yes, but then it becomes a piece of fiction and starts to bear little/no relevance to our society.<br/><br/>Similarly, I think there was so much dramatic license taken that, instead being an important biographical work, the movie ended up being a sappy melodrama that bore little no relationship to what actually must have happened. <br/><br/>As a piece of fiction, it's fairly enjoyable and dramatic. As a biographical/historical piece, it's a fairly empty and unsatisfying piece of work.<br/><br/>In sum, it's like junk food -- it tastes good, but it's not really good or healthy for you in the long run..."

Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is brought in to replace Coach Yoast (Will Patton), who becomes the assistant.  Neither coach is very happy about this situation. Coach Yoast doesn't want to be demoted, and Coach Boone doesn't want to demote him. Many of the white players threaten to sit out the season, because they don't want to play for a black coach.  Coach Yoast realizes if they sit their senior season out, they could lose their college scholarships. That's when Coach Yoast agrees to become the assistant. At the start of training camp, the white and black players have some difficulties getting along.  They soon learn how to play together; they even become friends.  The Titans have a spectacular season and go undefeated, but something terrible happens before the state championship.  Titans captain Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) is in a car accident and won't be able to play. After the accident, we see Bertier in his hospital room, and he only wants his black `brother' to be there.  Bertier had said earlier he would never play with a black athlete. The racial harmony that took over the football team spreads throughout the community.  Bertier's mother finally hugs his `brother,' and his girlfriend shakes his hand.  Will the Titans be able to win the state championship without their captain to guide them along?

","Remember The Titans is the story of a newly racially integrated high school football team's run to the Virginia state championship. Alexandria, Virginia's segregated high schools are forced to unite and form one uber-school, T.C. Williams High.  Among other major, obvious problems, one problem, the focalpoint of the film, is the newly created football team. Bill Yoast (Will Patton) had been successful as coach of of the white high school in Alexandria for a long time, so when Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) moves in from the black school and is appointed head coach in the name of affirmative action, naturally he's a little angry.  Now, of course there are going to be a few cliches in this movie, it's movie about football, the most cliche ridden thing in our society, but muchos props to Gregory Allen Howard, the screenwriter, for not making the ""token white coach,"" the ""token racist coach.""  If there's any tension between Boone and Yoast it's purely because of the situation that they are both dealing with. Despite the general consensus of the town's disapproval, Yoast signs on as the defensive coordinator under Boone. The movie continues on through training camp in Pennsylvania, (which includes a stop at Gettysburg Battlefield) where the racial tension among the players slowly eases over two weeks.  Over the course of the season we get served with a large number of predictable events including:  The racist opposing coach who bribes the refs, the one player who refuses to support his black teammates, the token fat kid who helps the players get along better whilst adding some comic relief.  (Ironically enough, played by Ethan Suplee, Seth from American History X) The football scenes are mostly well done, with the exception being the close camera angle that made following the logistics of the play or game difficult at times. One interesting thing to note is the behavior of the citizens in the movie. They were, for the most part, very close-minded and didn't change in these views until the football team started to win.  Whether this says something good about sports for bringing the people together, or something bad about the townfolk for not caring until something good came out of it, is uncertain. Overall, while Remember The Titans seemed very hackneyed at times, it was less so than most sports movies, and superb acting by Washington and Patton made for some excellent scenes and a solid film.<br/><br/>-as Published in 'The Bear' (student newspaper of West Branch High School)"

","""Remember the Titans"" could have easily been entitled, ""Pride and Prejudice"". Pride for one's own self and his fellow brothren, in this case teammates, won over the prejudices and bigotry that was prevalent back in the days of the film's setting.  This exquisite film won over not only me, but the entire multiracial audience in the theater. The acting was superb especially in the interaction between the two coaches played by Denzel and Bill Patton, two foes who united for the good of the team. The writing was true to life even with it being based on a true story. The writer definitely did his research or he had played much football in his day. I was especially impress by the performance of Ryan Hurst in the role of the Team captain. His range of emotions surpass his years and experience as an actor. The supporting cast was equally impressive.  This is a picture that should be the example for other's to follow with regard to the lack of needless violence if only to befit the story, and the absence of needless sex unless pertinent as well. Bravo Disney."

","Two coaches, one black, one white, compete to direct the fortunes of the T. C. Edwards High School football team facing integration in 1971 Virginia. An enormous 300 pound plus blonde good old boy modelled on the late Chris Farley, is the first player character.  He seems to have arrived on the Titans with none of the polarized racial animousities of the other players.  His ready wit softens some of the early conflicts. SPOILER ALERT Two leaders emerge immediately.  One is a beefy white guy with a lot of fairly racist attitudes.  Interestingly, he and another black guy become good friends before school starts as the team works out at a nearby college. Some of the tensions subside as the players get to know one another.  Back on opening day at T.C. Edwards High, however, the brotherhood evaporates quickly.  The Team reenters the real world.  Girlfriends are lost, friendships become tentative, the race problem persists.<br/><br/>A Sports alumni group wants to help white defensive coach Will Patton recover his head coaching job by seeing to it that black head Coach Denzel Washington loses the first game and his job.  Will Patton's acting is neutral and opaque for the first third of the movie.  He gives Coach Washington all the rope he can manage, to hang himself as head coach.  But since Patton also represents our moral perspective, his character is not allowed to actively do battle with Denzel Washington.  No problem. The white Coach has a five year old daughter with loads of attitude, a temper, and football know-how to boot.  Her character is absolutely unbelievable but her credible temper manages to represent Patton's feelings perfectly.  The Defensive Coach's daughter keeps the battle over team strategy hot in the absence of her symbol-ridden father.<br/><br/>Somehow, despite the racial divisions on the team and in the community, the Titans win the first game.  Now it will be a battle to win all the games and the State Championship, a ridiculous expectation, given the divided community.  But, see, this is an opportunity for the various players to bury their animosities and pull for the common good.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a blonde army brat with a perfect quarterback throwing arm arrives to join the team.  He's from California, has long hair, no race attitudes, and he looks like Kris Kristofferson before he was 35, but after Kristofferson's right and left jawbones were surgically broken to give him that high cheekbone look. Oh yaeh, while the girls look on from a window at the school, the California ""hippy"" practices Zen on the lawn.  Coach Washington has reservations. The Quarterback Adonis is given a minor haircut that only makes him look even more appealing. Then there is also a LeVar-Burton-like black guy who starts to show Coach Patton what a winner he is on defense.<br/><br/>The two coaches have an uneasy truce.  Eventually, an effort is made to have the daughters of the two men play together.  Another uneasy stand-off. Washington's daughter plays with dolls.  Patton's daughter wants to shoot some hoops.<br/><br/>The Titans roll through a series of games, each of which presents a new set of obstacles for the Titans, and especially Coach Patton.  Each opposing team has a White Cracker Coach, and typically there is another conspiracy to put Coach Patton back in charge of the Titans if he will only accept complicity in the plot against Coach Denzel Washington.  But Patton resists these overtures and the Titans winning streak continues.<br/><br/>By now, the film is playing race cards as a substitute for drama.  The little playlets always end with a moral that is at least some way toward a position for racial harmony. And sometimes you get the feeling this movie is made with a moral cookie-cutter.<br/><br/>But by two thirds of the way through the movie, each Coach begins to develop some respect for the others coaching abilities.  There is a racial incident when Patton's daughter is endangered after someone throws a brick through ""Coach Coon's"" window while the two daughters are playing.  One coach contributes a set of plays that vastly improves the chances of the team.  The two rival Coaches bond, smile, occasionally slap one another on the back.<br/><br/>Now the movie is starting to roll.  It is no longer necessary to balance every race incident that makes the whites look good, with another incident that makes the blacks look good.  The players are starting to pull together.  The soundtrack is staging a battle of musical tastes since the first practices at the religious college.  The black players try to bug the whites by singing Motown harmonies.  But eventually we are hearing the best of Cat Stevens and other white Seventies Music to help balance the musical equation.  The Team astounds by doing a Don Cornelius Soul Train Pimp Roll onto the field at the beginning of each game. Its as if this movie has collided with the cheer-leading Bring It On.<br/><br/>You can guess where this is all headed.  To the Big Game.  This time there is no problem with crooked officiating.  The other team and its coach are not riddled with the varieties of cracker corruption we have seen from coaches and teams up to now.  The Titans are going to have to pull together despite their problems, because this time they are facing a real team with no particularly grating stereotypes.<br/><br/>I was fairly disappointed  with the films efforts to strike its own racial balance. The way to get the movie mechanism working is to get Coach Patton to relax and smile.  When the film does that, the audience relaxes too. As it does, Remember the Titans gets good.  And when it does it becomes, uh.., memorable.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the inevitable postscript.  Ten years later the Titans gather at the funeral of one among them who has fallen. The roughly 28 year old actors playing these roles need only don suits, mustaches and slightly different hairstyles to play their real ages for the funeral scene.  Meanwhile, the two little girls have been replaced by older actresses and Washington and Patton look exactly as they did earlier.<br/><br/>Of course, this story was based on a real high school team.  The mandatory short profiles of Team members reveal that most of the white guys go on to professional careers.  Despite euphemisms, the heroic black players spend their working years in menial jobs, mostly around the old home town.  Its amazing the filmmakers risked letting old eternal truths like that one break through."

Even more, I loved the idea that THE PLAYERS cared more (by the end of the season) about the team as a whole than themselves as individuals. And the fact that it really did happen!  I gotta give Coach Boone some props on that one cause I can tell you it WASN'T like that when I played highschool sports and I think it rarely happens altogether anymore.

","This isn't your traditional Disney movie.  There are no cute little animals, no evil villain.  But, this isn't a football movie either.  So, if you liked Any Given Sunday, and are looking for the next best thing, look somewhere else, this movie an't for you.<br/><br/>Seeing how this is a Jerry Brockheimer movie I can tell you it has 4 things straight off: great cinematography, great editing, high emotions, and it's probably going to have Will Patton in it.  Jerry (as I call him) has made some bad movies (Gone in Sixty Seconds, Armageddon) and he has made some good movies (The Rock, Enemy of the State, Beverly Hills Cop).  This is one of his best movies.<br/><br/>The movie centers on the racial problems that develop when a Virginian high school is integrated back in the seventies.  At first, the players hate each other, you basic racial hate movie.  But after a long stay at a football camp, they all become friends.<br/><br/>That is one of the best parts to the movie.  The friendship that bonds between the men also bonds between the audience.  The characters are more like real people instead of talking cardboard cut outs.<br/><br/>Let me state one more time THIS IS NOT A TRUE DISNEY MOVIE.  Disney owns a little company you may have heard called Touchtone that is considered the ""adult"" version of Disney.  Jerry just so happens to work for Touchtone. Whenever Touchtone makes a family friendly movie (like Mission to Mars) Disney takes it away from them, and markets it as their own.  This isn't considered stealing because Disney owns Touchtone, making it legal.  There is a lot of content in this movie that kids won't get.  This is just a movie that is ""okay"" for them to see not one that they will enjoy seeing.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is great playing the ferocious Couch Boone.  I haven't seen him this cruelly-energized since The Hurricane (another great racial movie).  He won't win any Oscars for this, but if you're a fan, don't miss this movie.  As far as Will Patton goes, normally I don't like him.  But he does a really good job in this movie., better than I had expected.<br/><br/>
Overall, the movie isn't best picture worthy.  Its emotions sometimes get too emotional, and any macho guys will start to get a little uncomfortable. It can get a little too unrealistic in its friendly tone, but it doesn't cross that line of too nice that Mr. Smith Goes to Washington crosses.<br/><br/>But, despite that, this is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. Husbands take your wives to this.  Take you kids too, they might just like it.  Note: this is a good date movie on top of that.<br/><br/>By the way, as dramatic as it is, the movie is also very funny.  Boone's idea of football camp is really a junior military boot camp, which gets very funny at times.<br/><br/>I give it an enthusiastic 8 out of ten."

Racism is at least pg 13 material, and to bring it down to a tolerable level for a pg rating, goes against all that this movie supposedly stands for. if we are to remember the titans, why not remember them accurately instead of how disney would have them be thought of."

","""Remember the Titans"" reminds us that fear is the only thing standing in the way of a society not divided across racial lines. We fear those who are different than us. We tend to reject what we don't understand.<br/><br/>The film is about the redistricting and forced integration of two high schools in Virginia in 1971. An all-white football team that has had great success its past few seasons must now give up parts of its roster to players from the school it's merging with-who just happen to be all black. The white players have played under coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), who is a nominee for the Virginia High School Football Hall of Fame. The school's athletic board, believing they can prove that integration is a bad idea, brings in Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man, to replace him as head coach. They'll then sit and wait through training camp until Boone's team loses a game, then fire him. Yoast unexpectedly stays on as Boone's defensive coordinator, however, and they head for camp. Understandably, the white players have difficulty with the situation. They feel, justifiably, that their team was just fine the way it was. They know each other. They were winning.<br/><br/>Another great point that Titans makes is that sometimes winning is not important. Coach Boone wants to win but, like all great coaches, he won't deny any kid who wants it the chance to compete and contribute. He designs the two-week training camp to force the boys to get to know each other. Like it or not, this is our team, is what he's saying to them. `I don't care if you like each other,' he tells them, `but you will respect each other.' At first, it looks like they'll do neither. Boone forces them to room with someone they don't know, which usually ends up being someone of a different race.  But this is a Disney movie and heck, a true story, so they do learn to respect each other. Then they learn to like each other. The result is a powerful, almost unstoppable high school football team.<br/><br/>The players return to the real world to find that many of the citizens of Alexandria, the school's town, could have stood to go to Boone's camp themselves. The players overcome their first obstacle, their own fear. Now their new friendships will be put to the test by a backward society that hasn't had the benefit of the intensive bonding experience they just had. Some simply fear the team won't be as good as it was. This fear is quickly diminished. For some, though, it's just plain bigotry. Win or lose, they won't accept a group of black and white boys playing together as a team.<br/><br/>Not only did this film come from the Mouse House, but it's also a Jerry Bruckheimer production. This strange combination has created a gritty film that's still family-friendly. Basically, they were trying to please everyone, young and old, male and female. For the most part, they succeed. Still, the Disney/Bruckheimer factor does hurt it in many ways. The singing and dancing for instance, even if it did really happen, should have been left out. It makes nice footage to put in a trailer, but when inserted into the actual film, it ruins the overall tone. What hurts most though, is that there was no hope of giving it the ending it really needed, namely the Titans losing.<br/><br/>Okay, I know it's a true story. But T.C. Williams was not the only high school that was created by forced integration. A bolder move would have been choosing a different such school, one whos football team wasn't all that successful. Really, the Titans go undefeated. For one thing, from a sports perspective, what fun is that? But most importantly, the dream season they had begs the question: what if they'd lost a game or two? Or three? How would the town have felt about integration then? If the once-intolerant community still comes together across racial lines, it would mean more. All the film really shows is that that Alexandria is willing to accept integration--as long as the team remains as successful as it has been. What's worse is the film's tagline: `History is written by the winners.' What, exactly, is this supposed to mean?<br/><br/>Still, I recommend ""Remember the Titans"" ends up because it ends up being a pretty darn good sports movie. And even though its message could have been communicated even more powerfully, the film is more honest about the relationships between blacks and whites than maybe any other mass-market movie has been. Washington is great as usual, but the real stars are the young actors who play the Titans.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

I found myself honestly hoping they would pull it off, which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for The Replacements.<br/><br/> A theme prevalent throughout the film is racism. You'd never know it from the trailer, but the main obstacle in front of the Titans football team is the fact that they're the only school in the state to have been desegregated. This is dealt with incredibly well throughout the movie, conveying the feeling of pointless hate and prejudice without ever using the vaunted ""N word"".

","Remember the Titans is one of the best movies of this year. As moving as it is inspiring, I'm not ashamed to admit to tearing up at one of the more dramatic points of the story. This movie is remarkable in the way it captured the atmosphere of 1971, when public schools were forced to integrate and the public protested in the streets. Tension between adults was taught to their children, who fought in the hallways at school, and as sad as is the idea of learned racism, it is a fact that our society has fought hard and well against. In this day and age we take integration for granted, and it is easy to forget the way things were just thirty years ago. Remember the Titans is about football, but not to the extent to which it is about people. It is about people learning to live together, overcoming their fears and mistrust to come together as a team and work together toward something great. During football camp, the head coach, played by Denzel Washington, the players are forced not only to play together, but also to room together and eat together. Through the course of the movie, the young men go from mistrusting and disliking each other to tolerating each other, and from that to even liking each other and loving each other. So many lines capture the spirit of this movie, lines that speak of looking at a man for his soul, not his color. I won't get into the nitty-gritty of moviemaking here; the directing, acting, writing, and general storyline are all pretty close to flawless. Remember the Titans is a thoroughly enjoyable tale, and one that speaks of a harmony that America still strives for today. I personally think that every person in America, especially those who are too young to remember those difficult days, ought to see this movie. It does a good job of teaching us a lesson without it coming across like propaganda. Remember the Titans will touch your soul."

","Never having been a football fan, I went into this movie with some trepidation. Within the first fifteen minutes, my worries were laid to rest. Though seemingly unabashedly manipulative, Remember The Titans was, nonetheless enjoyable, as well as inspirational. Yes, race relations and integration in the '60's and '70's does seem to be a pet Hollywood theme, but in this case, it wasn't too heavy handedly done. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a seven out of ten; not great, but entertaining, and thoroughly engrossing.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington gives a commendable, totally believable and entertaining performance as coach Boone. Will Patton, in a departure from the type of role I'm used to seeing him in, actually made me like his Coach Yoast character. It was great seeing him play a good guy, for a change. But the one who absolutely stole the movie, in my opinion, was 11 year-old Hayden Panettiere, who played Cheryl Yoast, Coach Yoast's daughter. Her performance helped to breathe humanity, life and humor into the movie. Hayden's acting seemed so natural that I could actually believe her passions about the game, the team and her father were real. Her scene with Denzel Washington, where they watched post-game films in Coach Boone's home, was one of the best of the movie. Watch Hayden Panettiere; this girl is going places.<br/><br/>
Editorial:<br/><br/>If I had to give a criticism about the movie at all, it would have to fall squarely on the shoulders of the Coach Boone character. Don't get me wrong, as I said, I liked Denzel Washington in this movie. I've seen him in (I think) every movie he's done, and I'll probably see every movie he'll do in the future. It would probably have been somewhat less effective had another actor taken the role, as it does seem as though the part of Coach Boone was written specifically for him. ...And that's the problem. Denzel Washington is slowly becoming, if not a caricature of himself, then definitely range-limited. More often than not, his characters have a Denzel Washingtonesque moral rectitude, and most exhibit an engaging condescension that gives the character a father like stature.

","Denzel Washington delivers another powerful performance playing a true-life role, this time as a high school football coach in a small Virginia town. Set in 1971 against a backdrop of forced integration and mandatory bussing, Washington's character, Coach Boone, struggles to take two teams, one white and one black, and build one winning team out of them. The movie deals with the stereotypes and racial prejudices so prevalent at the time, huge obstacles in the path of one man who just wants to win football games.  Adding fuel to the fire of hatred is affirmative action, which places Boone in the head coaching position over the town's hall of fame white coach, Yoast. Despite these obstacles Boone manages to unite the team, staff, and eventually the town while he leads the Titans to victory, learning along the way some lessons of his own. This isn't your typical Jerry Bruckheimer film.  There aren't any big budget special effects or high-tech glitz.  Instead there is solid acting built around an outstanding screenplay.  The characters are extraordinarily well developed, with great depth, which is no surprise since they are based on living people. Perhaps the biggest fault of this movie is that there was no slow part during which to slip out of the theater.  Get your snacks and visit the washroom before the movie starts, because there isn't a second of this excellent movie you can stand to miss."

","In 1970 (as a complete Yankee outsider) I officiated high school  football games in South Carolina.  I went to little hamlets all over the state and was part of the ritual that was (probably still is) high school football in the South.  REMEMBER THE TITANS did a credible job of bringing back much of that.<br/><br/>(Old Official's quibble - Don't know if it is allowed now, but at that time in high school football a player could not advance a fumble.  That was one of the differences between the high school and the professional rules.)<br/><br/>Football was an equalizer that literally allowed black students to compete on an equal playing field with white players.  That was good for both, something that comes through pretty well in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is schmaltzy with more feel good thrown in than one encounters in real life.  (Especially noteworthy is the  score that crescendoes at moving moments for those too dense in the audience to get it on their own.)  Nonetheless, sometimes I go to the movies to get more feel good inspiration than I encounter in the real world.  REMEMBER THE TITANS isn't a bad way to fill up on warm, fuzzy feelings."

","It's a good movie that shows the prevalence of racism still present in the early 70's, and how ignorance makes matters worse. It was when everyone got together and learned from each other that the gaps were bridged, and sometimes, the prices that need to be paid along the way to bridge the gap, but the ultimate profit that can be earned.<br/><br/>In the tradition of Song of the South, It is the youth who see things clearly the easiest, and it isn't until tragedy strikes home that some of the adults begin to wake up. OK. The little kids still had some problems, but mostly overcame. Others ride the wave of glory to acceptance. Unlike Song of the South, not everyone can overcome the blinders of racism. It's very real, and perhaps that's it's strength.<br/><br/>Once you see the politics of this movie, you will never look at High School football the same way again. Oh, don't forget. This story is based on what really happened in the 1971 Titan football season."

","I have seen several films in my past, and none have really affected me as much as this one. I remember hearing about it in England, just before I moved to Berlin, and I thought to myself that I wanted to see it, but never had the chance to before I was actually out here. The film did not gain as much press and public awareness than it deserved in Germany, but (from what I heard) it did gross well, but then again, we wouldn't expect a film from Disney not to gross well! When I entered the cinema, the film was starting, and (I was unaware of Disney being behind the production) I saw the Disney symbol, which stopped me in my tracks. I was expecting your usual Village Roadshow, certainly not Disney, but I stuck through, and thought that if this wasn't the film I paid for, well .... I could always leave and say, ""You sent me to the wrong theatre!!"" The music to the opening sequence was good, and it certainly created the vibe that the film was going to be an entertaining film to watch, and a fast one at that! And how true it was - the time flew by as fast as one of the moves that the team managed to pull in the final match shown! Now to what the film is about: Two schools, one black and one white, are brought together by the state, causing already disturbance in the streets. A black Football coach is instated, and this causes even more uproar within the small town. However, Coach Boon (Denzel Washington) decides to keep the current coaches and work with them. The plot, which I am going to simplify to the bare bones, is how the football team, which Boon creates changes the views on living in a mixed community in the respective town they live in. I cannot give anymore of the story away, otherwise it will kill the film for you. The acting is good, for a football film, and even those who had to say one line don't give out the impression that they are wooden. And I feel sorry for those boys who had to train so hard for the film, but my goodness, they did make it look good."

A very good look into race relations and how one of the best ways to improve relations is through getting to know the other person (people are rarely what they appear to be).  The key to Coach Boone's bringing the team together was his getting them to learn about each other.  It has been said many times that sports is a great metaphor for learning life's lessons. Remember The Titans drives that point home.  Here is a story of a team coming together and a town learning that and starting to come together as well.  The movie builds itself well, has humor in it, and involves you emotionally.

Now, I'm not really up for movies that base it on a true story concerning sports, don't ask me why, but this one is an exception.  The acting was good and it just shows how ignorant and closed minded people are when it comes to the human race.  If we were all white or black, I'm 110% sure this world would suck.  Heck, the funny thing is when the fights happened in this movie, I pretty much rooted for the black people, not saying I'm going against my own race, but... It was such a joy to see everybody finally getting along and it was also heartbreaking towards the end when they lost their star linebacker to a car accident to only have him watch the championship game from his hospital bed to getting killed in another car wreck 10 years later.  I've only seen this movie three times, but I guess the old saying third time's the charm is really true because I liked the movie before, but I wasn't really as touched as I was the third time.  I think what would have made this movie better is if it took place in the south where the real racial hatred still lingers on today, like in Georgia or Alabama.

","Maybe this movie suffers because I saw it such close proximity to genuinely good movies (Traffic, Shawshank and Ordinary People).  And I am sure that if I was ten or eleven it would have been good to watch.  But the truth is this movie has problems, lots of them.<br/><br/>It is ""based on a true story.""  After seeing the movie, I can believe the following is true: (1) Alexandria, VA exists; (2) the high school there has a football team; (3) in 1971 it won a bunch of games; (4) the coach was newly hired, and black; (5) some people didn't like it, and it took some getting used to; (6) 1971 was a time, in general, in America, where racial integration was a source of bitter contention in many places; (7) Alexandria probably had some unease with the transition.  Everything else about this movie has to be manufactured by Disney.  <br/><br/>I think the low point for me was when Gary's girlfriend runs on the field to shake Junior's hand before the game.  See, previously she was one of the people unwilling to accept blacks into the school.  But now she's learned (somewhere off-screen) that she was wrong.  (1) She recognizes it; (2) she has enough poise as a high schooler to admit her beliefs were ill-founded; (3) she picks a dramatic/extremely inappropriate moment to acknowledge her change.  What poignancy!  Gee, we learned a lot about ourselves.  There were so many ""movie conventions,"" flat, stereotypical characters and cliches in this movie that I felt cheated.  The good characters learn something about themselves and change and grow, the bad characters are called out by the good characters - we don't know much about the bad characters, just that they're bad - and they are put in their place.  The good guys win, the bad guys lose.  Minds are changed.  People grow.  A soundtrack plays.<br/><br/>Also, remember Jerry Maguire?  That kid was cute, audiences love that. Let's put one of those in our movie.  We'll give her lots of lines, and we'll be constantly reminded how unusual she is - most little girls don't know football in depth, but she does!! - and hence, comedy.<br/><br/>Every time I tried to like this movie (and I went in hoping to like it) it spat out packaged non-reality that jarred me into deep irritation.

Furthermore, the program is being taken over by a black coach(Denzel Washington) after the forced exit of a legendary white coach (Will Patton). The racial tensions of the film are excellently portrayed in a very real way. After their initial mistrust and hostility, the players' realizations that they are a team and not that different after all is really riveting to watch, Each of the prominent players has a distinct personality and is portrayed very well.

","The plot of Remember the Titans was pretty good, especially considering that it was based on a true story.  This is definitely a movie for football lovers, especially those who played in high school.  Some parts of the story line were a little jumbled, a little repetitive, but this did reflect the struggles of real life.  In real life problems don't get solved the first time, especially an issue as big as racism and segregation.  The story line of a high school football team interwoven with illustrations of racial discrimination and de-segregation laws of the 70s created an emotionally rich story that will definitely leave a teary eye or two.<br/><br/>
Denzel Washington was at his best again, just like always.  Only he could pull off preaching about football and the desire to win and make anyone want to get up and do some push-ups.  Denzel adds a tremendous amount of power and drama into this film.  Also, the relationship between the two star players of the team, one black and one white, is one of the best parts of this movie.  True friendship is shown by these two characters who stand up for each other, on and off the field, no matter what happens.  They show the strength of the human spirit and the passion in the human heart.  Kudos to the two young actors, Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst.  A few other characters are underdeveloped, but Hayden Panettiere, the little blonde 9 year old cutie, will make anyone smile.<br/><br/>
Overall I liked this movie, it even made me cry and not just a few tears but a lot (along with my chin quivering a bit).  I am not a big football fan but this movie kept my attention for the most part.  I could have gone for more of the characters and less of the actually football playing, but that's just me.  Great soundtrack!  This movie had one good song after another.  Hey, the movie was predictable, but it also was based on a true story and it was pretty heart warming.

And I can understand his concern, there is such a thing as type-casting.  But I, for one, am very glad that he changed his mind.  I'll see a Denzel Washington movie any day, but what his name brought me into this time was a story I might not otherwise not have been all that interested in.  I have to be in the mood to get into a sports movie - they can be very hackkneed - a good reason why I haven't seen the movie about that boxer.  I admit I might have been interested in a movie about a coach after Mike Krzyzewski proved himself so well this year (yes, I'm a Duke fan) and knowing that he's a great person with his players and in general. Still, I probably would have passed if not for Washington.  At any rate, this wasn't a movie just about a coach, even one that we should be proud of - it was also the story of his players.

","Finally saw Remember the Titams on pay-per-view. Rated it a 5. RTT is a curious mixture of two basic stories: the integration of a high school in Northern Virginia in 1971, and the integration of that school's football team.<br/><br/>The ""big picture"" story, of racial integration as a social issue, is painted shallowly. We see glimpses of protest and white people who resist the integration (the African Americans seem bemused by it). But we never really get a feel for how hot an issue this is elsewhere. In truth, the movie makes Alexandria appear bigoted and racist. That's curious to me, because I grew up about 10 miles south of Alexandria and don't recall any of this. Alexandria is a D.C. suburb (more of a feeder community). D.C. is extremely integrated. I would think Alexandria would be more likely to be accepting when the change came. Now if the school had been in SOUTHERN Virginia, that's a different story ....<br/><br/>The ""small picture"" story, of the players on the team (and the two coaches) integrating, is filled with cliches. There is forced bonding and unnaturally quick progress. None of it feels very real. Neither does the football, which is almost incoherent in its speed and flash through games. Never do you feel like the Titans are facing any particular dramatic moment. You just assume they will win, and don't worry about it.<br/><br/>For a movie with such ambition, Remember The Titans is more pretentious than anything.

But Hollywood, this movie as an example, keep making it like the Black way of doing things is the THE way of doing things and it's not. But the wave of that thinking (brainwashing?) has swept over the US for the last twenty years and this movie is just reflection that nothing before Brown vs. Board of Education mattered except the oppression of the Africans. I wish we could just get the over this idea of racism as an emotion or state of mind by and of itself. Racism is a reaction, a defensive, protective attitude just as prejudgice is one's survival mode kicking in and trying to preserve ones state of being. Of course we know where the southern anglo state of being is going these days. This movie did a so so job of showing that Blacks are just as racists as Whites, it mostly showed them as being the better people and teaching and guiding the White folks toward correctness, except for a few token places like the white coach suggesting the winning play.<br/><br/>The way the Titans went onto the field for their games was a joke too. They would have been the laughing stock of the state. It looked silly and only a bunch of queers would do that. If they entered the game this way they surely must have cracked up their opponents and/or made them not take them seriously."

","This movie is great.  I don't see a problem with some predictable movies if they have a good message, like this one.  Also, since this movie is based on a true story, it is inevitable that it would be somewhat predictable. Predictable things happen in real life.<br/><br/>I enjoyed every aspect of this movie, including the bonding and the singing of Motown songs.  I too, have broken out ""in song"" when goofing around with friends or when making the work day a little more ""interesting"" with coworkers.<br/><br/>The friendships, which overcame racial bigotry and intolerance, in this movie is an exact depiction of real life in American society today.  The world is still far from perfect and racial prejudice still thrives.  But we can still see where we were 30 years ago, and where we are today as far a race relations go-and we are still evolving.  I think there are literally thousands of true stories that can be told about unlikely friendships of people of different races...people who eventually saw past the physical, and into one's character and learned a valuable lesson along the way. `Remember the Titans' is just very unique and had the opportunity to be told in a wonderful, tasteful manner.<br/><br/>If I have to point out anything ""unrealistic"" about the movie it would have to be the choice of racial slurs used-they are quite tame compared with real life.  But the script was purposely written that way so the movie can be viewed and enjoyed by vast, diverse audiences.<br/><br/>I am glad I saw this movie, and would recommend anyone else, who is contemplating seeing it, to just see it.  I initially put off seeing the movie due to reading comments about how ""predictable"" it was and comments like, ""Oh just another movie about how some guys over come their odds to win the BIG GAME"".  But the movie is about so much more-our history as a society and about values and lessons in integrity.  You don't have to be a football enthusiast to enjoy it because the football is really just a backdrop to the main theme of the story.  But then again, if you like football, you should also find the football scenes enjoyable."

"nicki875","10","0","0","25 May 2001"," An overall enjoyable family film
","I will definitely say that Remember the Titans was one of the best films of 2000, but unfortunately received little acknowledgment.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the film lacks special effects with bloody, gory bodies. Or perhaps many viewers were disappointed since there were no depressing characters addicted to some type of illegal substance.  Now, don't misjudge me in any way.  I found movies such as Gladiator and Traffic to be incredibly well done and absolutely mesmorizing, however, can't viewers become engrossed in a film that might make you feel somewhat good when leaving the theater?<br/><br/>Remember the Titans offers touching comedy and drama with a lesson of friendship supported by an excellent cast.  Denzel Washington brilliantly portrayed Coach Herman Boone, the tough, dedicated football coach of the new T. C. Williams High School.  A good deal of his performance was due to the writing of Gregory Allen Howard, but a talented actor was still imperative to deliver some of those moving monologues.  Although many would strongly disagree with me, I feel that Denzel Washington deserved an Oscar nomination, not necessarily a win but at least a nomination.  This should also be partly due to the fact that he was robbed of it the year before.  I was also very impressed with Will Patton's performance.  I must admit that I had never thought him to be much of an actor, but he really portrayed Coach Bill Yoast in a manner that led the audience to believe him to be a dedicated coach who cared about his boys.  I'm still trying to understand why he did The Postman.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast was made up of several unknowns.  Ryan Hurst who portrayed Gerry Bertier was easy to overlook in Saving Private Ryan and The Postman.  When the film ended though and everyone was getting ready to leave, he was the one people were talking about.  ""Who played Gerry Bertier. He was great.""  In my opinion, these people are entirely correct.  Ryan Hurst gave a heart-wrenching performance alongside Wood Harris who played Julius Campbell.  The chemistry between the two was absolutely incredible and I am disappointed to say that the two deserved more recognition than they recieved.  The rest of the cast was great as well including Donald Faison as the comical Petey Jones, Ethan Suplee as the unbiased Luis Lastik, Kip Pardue as the good-looking Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass, Earl Poitier as the soul-singing Blue Stanton, Craig Kirkwood as the gentle, religious Jerry ""Rev"" Harris, and Ryan Gosling as the adorable, country-dancing Alan Bosley. I hope you enjoyed my descriptive adjectives of each character.  I also want to point out that although I described Kip Pardue as ""good-looking,"" I must say everyone who wore a football jersey in this film was quite enjoyable to look at.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that Remember The Titans was absolutely superb, I found that there were a few down falls.  Hayden Panettiere who played Sheryll Yoast was quite cute but somewhat annoying at times.  This wasn't the actresses fault though.  Sheryll Yoast was written as a girl who adored her father and all he was passionate about.  But sometimes I got rather irritated when she would yell at the defense constantly.  Yet, Hayden Panettiere was quite good at depicting a kid who was loving along with quite humorous at times.  Another aspect of the movie that I didn't care for involved the character of Ray Budds played by Burgess Jenkins.  The audience is supposed to see the character as ""the bad guy"", yet I must say I kind of felt sorry for him.  But, then again I'm the type of kid who feels sorry for the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood, however, Ray's different from the wolf. First of all, he's not that racist.  He only said ""coon"" once in the film and that's about it.  Second of all, once Gerry befriended Julius, he kind of dumped Ray implying that he should try to befriend some of the offensive players.  It's almost as though a different type of segregation was developing within the team.  I just feel that his character could have been developed more by Howard.  I mean, what actually happened to him after he was kicked off the team?<br/><br/>Although the film had minor defects, I was very impressed that I could become engrossed in a Disney film at age thirteen.  Yes, I'm young, but I'm also quite mature.  I know the supporting actors of the cast will soon become household names.  This is an enjoyable film for people of all ages (and races). : )"

There were the misfit players and the climax which was the state high school championship game where one of the main characters keeps in touch with the game from a hospital room, recovering from an ailment.  'Remember the Titans' has the exact same leading character in Denzel Washington and the same type of climax and feel good flavour and it works.  There is one emotional scene in Gettysburg where Washington explains to his players the value of working together and it doesn't fix the race problem entirely which is affecting the players but it greatly improves the team's situation and the entire movie is never boring for a second.

","We seem to have set a similar standard for sports movies these days.  A team in doubt gets a new coach, and suddenly their self confidence is boosted. The players go on to win a few games and advance to the finals.  You see the tension when they off on the wrong foot, but in the end, they always win. Thankfully, this is not the case Remember the Titans.  Well, maybe a little.<br/><br/>Titans, a Jerry Bruckheimer production, is the true story of African-American high school football coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), who had to build a football team from the roots of racism. Boone's first inference is that half his players are white, and the other half black.  The players, ignorant to the other kind, refuse to even cooperate with each other.  This sends Herman Boone, along with Assistant coach Yoast (Will Patton), on a mission to force his players to get along. Through extensive exercising, and a lot of prep-talk, Boone manages to create one talented -- and most importantly Â–- colorless team.<br/><br/>What separates this film, from most sports movies, is has less to do with football, and much ado with the ignorant community.  The locals cannot even begin to understand how two opposing races can work together.  Ignorance from the white residents tries to dissolve that black coach they've heard about, and prevent their kids from playing with those `monkeys.'<br/><br/>All this works well with the actors, though young and inexperienced, give fantastic performances.  However, the movie falls short of great with it's questionable dialogue (`Who's your daddy?' asks Coach Boone) and the failed attempt to make a story out of the coach, and assistant coaches daughters. Yoast's daughter Sheryl, a tom boy, disrupts the screen with her annoying yelling and dull character.  Another flaw would be the unsatisfying film work on the field.  Director Boaz Yakin game action is too simplistic, offering nothing new, and nothing surprising.<br/><br/>Washington, as always, is great.  His charisma plays well with the audience. Overall, this film works great with Disney, and is well worth a trip to the theatre.<br/><br/>* * * 1/2 out of 5"

","What do you get when you mix manipulative comedy-drama that plays its historical backdrop of racial intolerance in 1970s Virginia too broadly with the slam-bang ridiculous action style of movies from the producing efforts of Jerry Bruckheimer? Not to mention a anti-airtight script that wanders around looking for a backbone! Thoroughly satisfying entertainment, is what I say! Sure it's intentions are obvious from the start (as is the playing out of its climactic ending), but for two hours Bruckheimer and director Boaz Yakin keep you busy enjoying all the talent involved in making this movie about how you gotta have heart to win. And all that jazz.<br/><br/>
Denzel Washington gives his first warmhearted performance as a true-life football coach assigned to a newly-integrated school who has enough troubles with trying to get his team to get along with each other, let alone win some games, let alone win a seasonal championship, let alone resist the volatile intolerance and bigotry that surrounds the school's new political plateau. Despite its predictable nature the film truly is a deserving crowd-pleaser and features some young actors at the peak of their ensemble-hearted form, most notably Ryan Hurst as Team Captain Bertier, Kip Pardue as the native Californian who rocks the whole team, black and white, with his hippy-ness and the very funny Donald Faison (Clueless's Murray) as Petey, the guy who thinks (much to the coach's detrement) that football is FUN. Hayden Panettiere is a scream (and the best performer in the whole film!) as Coach Yoast's (Will Patton) pint-sized daughter, who has her own ideas about how to run a real football team."

","Predictable and sappy, Remember the Titans is memorable not for the story, which has been done, overdone and done again, but for the performances of some of the actors. Hayden Panettiere (the young daughter of the white coach) was incredible -- I find it difficult to believe that she's really that good at her age, so I have to attribute a lot of her performance to the director, Boaz Yakin. I'm ashamed that I don't know the name of the other performer who was absolutely outstanding -- the fat kid who finally got to go to college -- he did a super job. Denzel Washington also did a very good job with a part that was pretty much a cliche. In fact, my wife (who's in the business) mentioned that 'there is really something wrong' because Washington didn't win an Oscar for his performance. I think it's not because Mr. Washington is black, but because it's difficult to give an actor a major award for acting in such a sappy little movie. I was most disappointed in Will Patton, who I think is a very good actor (if you like his work, you must see The Paint Job!) At times it seemed to me that Mr. Patton was almost embarrassed by the dialog he had to utter, and his performance wasn't up to his previous appearances.<br/><br/>The movie is just one cliche after another: a combination of racial (racist whites/noble blacks), regional (dumb, unethical Southerners) and sports (the team with the most heart always wins) stereotypes, and it gets very tiresome. The movie is said to be ""BASED on a true story,"" but it's obvious that the writer took some pretty large liberties with the truth. Sort of like Titanic being ""based on true events""; yes the boat did sink, but...<br/><br/>But all in all, it was an enjoyable movie -- not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination -- but a nice, enjoyable little movie nonetheless, with some uncommonly good acting from a couple of people."

","I absolutely loved this film. And why shouldn't I? I've read reviewers that said it was predictable. Well, it was based on a true story & sorry that for once, the true story had a happy ending (in some ways). This review does contain some info about the plot, so discontinue reading if you don't want to know about the story.<br/><br/>Case in point about the predictability, when Denzel Washington's character, coach Boone takes the boys on a 3am run at their training camp, it seems like just another outlandish way of disciplining them. Even his assistant coach, Yoast, played by Will Patton tells him, hey, these are boys, we're not in the Marines. But he has a purpose. When they finally stop, exhausted, they are standing at Gettysburg where you can see headstones in the background. He tells them then & there that they must come together, despite any differences in color. It is a moving and not overly sentimental speech that has effect for the boys and the viewer. <br/><br/>The friendships that the boys develop while perhaps presented in a predictable way, are still genuine and true to the story. The acting from everyone is first rate as well. Denzel, what is there to say about him? He is outstanding in every film. No doubt he will get the academy award for this film, since he should've gotten it for The Hurricane last year. Will Patton is equally terrific and his character just as inspiring and honorable as Washington's. In a scene that is filled with significance, Patton's character tells him that it's his pride that has lead to some racist people throwing a rock through his window, that happened to be on a night when Patton's white daughter was visiting Washington's daughter. It looks like Patton has the best ""argument"" until Washington's character points out, now she knows a little of what it feels like for my daughter ALL the time. This movie has so much heart and is about the best and worst in all of us. It was very well done & inspiring.

Supposedly, this setting is somewhere else out in the Carolinas, but it doesn't matter.  Racism and other adversarial forces provide a strong undercurrent of constant tension and immerse a football team and it's coaching staff into a monumental struggle to survive and compete.  It just doesn't sound possible, but you have to see the film and see how it is possible.  The leadership and connection to his players that actor Denzel Washington portrayed was a good example of how at times, the only way to deal with cruelty is with absolute spartan style force....not a pretty site for one with a squeamish stomach or a faint heart.  The end result was that he showed players, that character building was the unifying ingredient that permitted a team to become an effective and competitive force to deal with on and off a football field.

Further there are two commentary tracks - one by the director and one by the real people - the two coaches who lived the real life story. I was amazed how much the real coaches sounded like the people who portrayed them on screen.  I was also very impressed that the coaches said that almost all the story was accurately converted to film.  They point out a few small differences and why - e.g. The white coach had four daughters, not just the one, and the one was not quite as outspoken and involved in real life.

","As arctypal as 'inspiration' movies come, 'Remember the Titans' still manages to please. Not the least of its charms are the seriousness with which it takes the race issue and its rating- i.e., this is a movie a whole family could watch together before having a conversation about racism and personal responsibility for treating others with respect. Denzel Washington rarely gives a bad performance, and he didn't here. Will Patton is equally likable. Here are two men devoted to teaching their young charges about life, and realize that it is their responsibility to arm them for battle in the real world. The lovely story of friendship between Julius and the doomed Gerry is poignant indeed. Classy people come from all different races and backgrounds. The one thing that really pulls it together is the audience's awareness that this is based on a true story. I'm sure they've 'Disney-fied' it, but what would come off as incredibly cheesy and manipulative as an entirely fictional story comes off as, well, inspirational when it has at least a grain of truth."

A black football coach, a white coach, and a bunch of black and white kids are caught in an impossible racial situation. Each individual has to figure it out for themselves. Is it about playing  good, honest ball; winning at any cost; or making a racial statement? And how does one's manhood figure into all of this?<br/><br/>You lose yourself. The tensions/resolutions, obstacles/breakthroughs are stitched together with a best-hits list of 'seventies songs -- Marvin Gaye, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, many more -- that keeps things flowing for the whole 100 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Just one criticism, really. The sound-effects attempt to hyper-accentuate the brutality of full-contact football, a la Oliver Stone's recent film. That isn't what this film is about. It's about a great story, the characters and their relationships, and those brief instances of human interaction upon which so much depends -- greater understanding or chaos. This film doesn't need visceral shock as a substitute for content, its already got the goods, get it?"

","Remember the Titans (2000): Dir: Boaz Yakin / Cast: Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, Ryan Hurst: True story set in 1971 that recycles a plot that has been done millions of times since The Bad News Bears. Title refers to reflection upon something great, which isn't this film. The theme is racism where two schools will blend the whites and the blacks and the community is hostile towards it. Denzel Washington moves into the community from North Carolina to coach football. Numerous players threaten to quit because their current coach may be leaving. Predictable elements occur such as fights over race as well as Washington winning everybody over and gaining respect. Directed by Boaz Yakin who, despite having the true story element, does not have a screenplay that inspires anything but sympathy. Washington is a tremendous actor but he is basically wading through clichés and story structure done a hundred times over. That means that he is merely reciting what others having done either better or worse than him. Flat supporting roles by Will Patton, Ryan Hurst and Kip Pardue, and a host of other actors who are led to believe that this sh*t is special because it is a sports film starring Denzel. Patton in particular plays that uptight coach uneasily impressed. Strong themes of sportsmanship, friendship, endurance, honor, exposing racism, and Xeroxed storytelling. Score: 3 / 10"

","Remember the Titans could have been a great movie because the true story on which it relies on is striking, but the way it is tackled turns it into an ordinary feature.<br/><br/>So long finesse, everything here is handled frontally without much subtlety, Boaz Yakin and his writer using and abusing of very conventional scenes, not to say clichées, where the oozing melodramaticism is omnipresent, where every scene seems to seek to shed the viewer a tear with corny dialogues and grandiloquent violins, which turns out to be sickening.<br/><br/>And it's too bad because the cast is very good and with the self sufficient power of the historical fact, there was no need to lay it on thick."

","""Remember the Titans"" is about the 1971 Alexandria, Va football team that dealt productively with mandatory racial integration. On the surface it is a football story, but it really is how the students, parents, and business people of Alexandria were brought together by these football players and coaches.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington as the new coach, coming in to take over, and Will Patton, the outgoing head coach who becomes defensive coordinator, are both fine actors and are never better than they are here. The story is fairly predictable, and the Titans win the big championship on the final play of the final game. The script is a bit patronizing to our emotions at times. But we know this story is a real one, and the characters were real people. Many of them, including the two coaches, were there in the making of the film. <br/><br/>The DVD sound is just great, and you can choose between DTS and Digital Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The extras give a real insight to the making of this film, including interviews of the two original coaches and many of the players. As the writer, who is a black American, commented, during adversity among the races we may not end up loving each other, but at least we can understand each other and appreciate the differences. Well put. This is the kind of movie everyone should see, because it accurately portrays the struggle of school integration, which is still fresh in many of our minds. Bravo to those who had the guts to make this film."

Remember the Titans is a great film, raising important issues like racism in the 60s, years of great changes concerning the black people. The football is actually in the second place, cause this movie isn't mainly about football, but about freindship no matter what is your skin colour.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays brilliantly again, just like he always does. But every single actor in this movie did well and kept up with the great pace that Denzel brings.<br/><br/>There still is a bad point: it's way too predictable.

","The racism portrayed in this movie was done in a way that audiences can relate to in one way or another. The Disney-like happy tone made the movie enjoyable but also annoying due to the unrealistic portrayal of racism in the story. The movie did well in sending out its core values regarding prejudice and that it is important to get to know someone before making judgement. But this is where the movie also does wrong in how they gloss over cultural differences in between races. The movie however does well in showing how racism can be overcome but its portrayal makes it too easy and simple for such a major problem. Even so, the movie still feels good to watch for casual audiences. In the end, it becomes a nice feel good movie about teamwork and overcoming differences, but it's simple and predictable nature may make some people turn their heads away from the movie. The movie is a good watch, although I wouldn't recommend it you can try giving it a watch and see how emotional and passionate the movie can be."
"fanny92","9","1","2","8 May 2019"," I have loved this movie since childhood
","I grew up watching this movie and it has been one of my favorites for a long time. When I was really young, I used to say that I liked it just to impress my dad by liking a football movie (he loves football), but once I got older, I actually did love it. I just love the feel of it, the characters, and the growth that the team goes through.
The movie is about a high school football team that is put together right after the desegregation of black and white students in schools. Throughout the movie, the team grows closer and become a really good football team.
This movie is based on a true story, but it is not very accurate. I think it may be accurate in portraying what it was like after schools were desegregated, but not totally accurate in portraying the specific story of this high school football team. I think a lot of what it shows still applies today even though that event occurred in the 70's. Today, there are still people fighting against change and against people who are different than them. There is still discrimination among many groups all over the world.
The director of this movie is Boaz Yakin. He did an amazing job directing this movie. This is the only movie I have seen that he has directed. Some of the main actors in this movie are Denzel Washington, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, and Will Patton. They are all great actors and played their roles well. I have seen Denzel Washington in other movies and I love him as an actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when Gerry and Julius become really good friends after hating each other. I just loved the connection that they had.
Even though this movie is not very accurate to the story it is based on, I still love it. I thought it was really well acted, and the characters worked well together. I liked that it brought out serious themes like hard work, equality, and treating others with kindness, but was also fun and entertaining. This is a movie that I definitely recommend."

"zkonedog","10","1","2","8 March 2017"," Superb Blending Of Acting & Story
","Sometimes, movies tend to be a bit out of balance when it comes to acting & story. Either the actors overshadow a middling plot, or the plot is solid but the actors don't live up to the billing. ""Remember The Titans"", however, provides the perfect blend of acting and story to create an incredible tapestry of emotion from beginning to end.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Remember The Titans"" is loosely based on the story of Virginia public school TC-Williams going through the integration process in the early 1970s. When legendary white coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is replaced by black newcomer Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), the entire football program (and school in general) is thrown into the type of turmoil that integration would usually produce. At first, All-American defenseman Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) refuses to play with his new black teammates. Helped along by the tenacity and shrewdness of Coach Boone, as well as a friendship with new player Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), Bertier and all his teammates face the choice of either coming together or having the whole program fall apart.<br/><br/>Clearly, the deep racial themes in this film (quite similar to the more recently-produced ""The Help"") are what drive the primary emotions derived from it. As a nation, integration is a topic that both embarrasses and inspires us...all at the same time. This produces a cacophony of emotion that makes for dramatic viewing. Director Boaz Yakin perfectly capitalizes on that emotionally potential by crafting an airtight script/story that never drags or stagnates. Something is always happening (whether on the field or off it) that gives the viewer something significant to ponder.<br/><br/>Only helping matters is the fact that this is one of the most well-casted films ever created. Washington is masterful as Coach Boone (the pivotal role in the film), but even he is matched by the performances of the surrounding cast. Patton, Hurst, and Harris especially stand out, but are also joined by Donald Faison, Craig Kirkwood, Kip Pardue, Kate Bosworth, and Ryan Gosling. A very young Hayden Panettiere even gets in on the acting greatness in a magnificent role. By the end of the picture, you will feel as if you are right in the stands cheering on the Titans, as the characters will come so alive.<br/><br/>Mention must also be given to the musical score, a combination of period pieces (a locker room rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" is a treat) and incredible orchestration from Trevor Rabin. An emotional film like this needed a great soundtrack, and it sure does deliver.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Remember The Titans"" is one of my favorite movies of all-time for its mixing of drama, comedy, historic themes, music, and characters that will absolutely come alive. I don't see how anyone can sit down and watch this masterpiece and not enjoy it."
"mdeshlem","10","1","2","30 November 2015"," One of the Greatest Sports Movies Ever Made
","What can be said about Remember The Titans? Honestly, this movie has just about everything. The movie takes place at a time when racism was still very much at large in the United States, especially in the state of Virginia at T.C. Williams High School. Through all of this, Coach Herman Boone, played by the iconic Denzel Washington, is tasked with the large order of getting white and African American football players to co-exist well together. The film deals with racism, stereotypes and obviously athletics. <br/><br/>One thing that worked very well were the memorable characters in the film. If you've seen the film, there's no way you could ever forget Gerry Bertier, Julius Campbell, Petey Jones, The Rev, Big Louie and definitely Sunshine. Good directors and producers know that to put a film over the top you need good characters that you can connect with and producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Boaz Yakin do just that.<br/><br/>Being a college student, Remember The Titans is definitely a movie I will want my children to see one day. The lessons they will learn from viewing this film are priceless, and they can't miss out on an all- time classic sports movie."
"simensonryan","8","1","2","2 October 2015"," Movie review without spoilers
","Remember the Titans Review<br/><br/>""Remember the Titans"" is a compelling story of perseverance and tolerance that warms your heart with the bond of a tightly knit high school football team. Throughout the movie, there are battles between whites and blacks, and the Titans against their weekly opponents. They are playing to prove that they are the best in the state and that blacks and whites work as one. This movie acts as a metaphor for the struggles of life, which makes it easy for anyone to connect with the movie. ""Remember the Titans"" is set back in 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia, less than 10 years after the Civil Rights act was passed. Tension between blacks and whites is at its highest in Alexandria when the high school becomes integrated and Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is hired as the head coach of the high school football team and he replaces, now assistant head coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton). This change causes the white kids to second guess playing football because they don't want to play for a black coach or with black teammates. But both coaches come to agreement and take their appointed roles as coaches. They haul both black and white players off to football camp so bonds can be made and they can learn to play as one. The director, Boaz Yakin, does a great job of showing that friendships are important through the plot of this movie. Boaz gives us an important example of finding who your true friends are. He illustrates this point by showing us a scene where a white player breaks up with his girlfriends because she didn't approve of his interactions with the black players. This one decision made by a white teammate proved to most of the other players that whether they were black or white, that they could put aside their differences and just be friends. Boaz Yakin presents the dialogue and setting of this film in a way that makes you feel like you were watching a movie developed in the 1970's. Like explained before, there was still tension between blacks and whites at this time. This movie really gives you a good demonstration of what life would be like to be black, friends with blacks, or even what goes through the mind of white people who discriminated blacks. This is another aspect of the film where the director does a great job.. Though I really like this movie, there is one thing that might take this movie down a notch. That factor is that it isn't very original. This isn't the first movie ever made that shows the integration of blacks and whites in sports. Also, there are characters that have been used in previous sports movies like the classic fat kid. Or the guy that joins the team and has never played before who ends up being a key player. Then there are the moments where two guys that fight each other end up being the closest of friends. Even though they may not be original thought, I think the director and the actors do a good job of using these ""old news"" situations and making them intertwine with the plot of the movie. The overall mood of ""Remember the Titans"" is excited or happy even though there are some sad moments. I say the mood is exciting because there are lots of moments where your skin begins to tingle from what just happened or from what is about to happen. The mood ties in with the acting and the atmosphere very well. Just look for a slight smirk from Coach Boone or listen to the roar of the crowd. Those small bits in the movie make you feel part of the moment and give you flashbacks of good times. ""Remember the Titans"" is a good movie. It has everything a person could want in a film and everything you really need. I personally feel that everyone should watch it, either just to watch a good movie or to have a very good message illustrated for you. I give it an 8/10."
"dillonhaef","4","1","2","8 April 2014"," Great movie
","This movie really surprised me I didn't think that they would all get a long. Everyone didn't like the coach and was a little worried about what would happen to the team. The minuet I seen how the coach was treating his players I knew that they would make it to championships. The boys pull through for each other and make one of the best teams in the state. The actors played their roll perfectly in this movie. I didn't think that that was a good way to run a football team is by saying if the new coach looses one game that the old head coach would have his spot back. I think that all the fighting in the movie was more anger than it was hate. The reason for that is when the teams combined the whites were mad, they thought they were going to loose their starting spots. The titans played as a whole team not just one individual player. They ended up pulling everything together and became friends."

","Remember the Titans<br/><br/>Courage, strength, brotherhood, are a few words you could use to describe the movie, Remember the Titans. This movie shows the struggles of southern states in the 1970's, and what one amazing team went through to prove judgment can't be passed based on the color of ones skin. Remember the Titans is a Disney movie but that does not mean it is meant just for kids. People of all ages will enjoy this movie. This is a heartwarming movie that shows the hardships the team goes through while remaining light hearted. The production, script, and acting were very well done and the social themes still have rapport today.<br/><br/>The premise of Remember the Titans is based around the south in the 1970's. In the city of Alexandria, Virginia segregated schools are forced to integrate. The conflict arises when two competing football coaches are forced to integrate the football team as well. Production that went into this movie creates a spot-on interpretation of this time period in America.<br/><br/>This production shows an accurate portrayal of the era. The costumes are well done in having the hippie look or flared pants along with big collared shirts. The costumes are apparent on picketers outside the school. The props used in the movie, such as the cars involved in the car accident, were pristine examples of the 1970's. Framed by the battlefield of Gettysburg, there so much bloodshed of the civil war occurred Herman Boon (Denzel Washington) gives an inspiring speech to his players about bigotry that was fought then and still experienced today.<br/><br/>The stand out performance given by Denzel Washington is aided by a well-written script. At the start he seem like a tough cold guy at times who wants to win at all costs. As the movie progresses you start to see past his tough exterior and begin to see the love and passion he has for the team. The inspirational speech given by Washington's character provides insight into the racial inequality's African Americans experienced at the time without coming off as clichÃ©. The locker room speeches he gives come alive not just because of Washington's performance but because the way they are written strike a chord in the competitor in all of us.<br/><br/>Disney never fails to produce a wonderful movie that anyone will enjoy. Unlike the animated movies, it is more serious at times and dramatic, like the movie Glory Road (2006). Years later this movie is still enjoyable and timeless."

I've seen some of the sports films, but I think this comes across as the most epic film I had ever watched in my entire life. The story is very original that teaches us the important of teamwork and I think that the ""americans-and-african-americans-working-together"" concept worked really well throughout the film. It moves along very nicely and it has lots of great scenery; not to mention it's great cinematography.<br/><br/>The cast did great with their roles. Denzel Washington is very appealing as the lead role while Will Patton and Hayden Pantierre did excellent as the coach and his daughter. The direction is pretty good too and the script/dialog is witty and compelling, but the strongest aspects would have to go the football sequences and the sweeping music score from Trevor Rabin with it's epic moments that could easily make you teary-eyed.<br/><br/>Overall, Remember the Titans is an epic masterpiece in sports film history and is always recommended to those who love American football. To those who haven't seen it, I suggest that you watch it!"
"nicholaschong133","7","1","2","10 December 2012"," Good Attempt but still lacking
","Without a doubt, the movie ""Remember the Titans"" tries to depict the challenges and difficulties of racial integration after the Civil Rights Act was implemented. In the case of this movie, this film tries to show racism within a particular high school football team. Their attempt was promising but the movie's aim was not to show the racial harmony and problems but rather simply about football. <br/><br/>This movie is based on a true story that talks about an African American football coach named Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington) who is hired by a Virginia High School during 1971 to coach the Titans on his first year in T.C. Williams High School replacing Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) whom is beloved by the school. Both men are not happy with the situation and circumstances they are put into. But they agree that for the sake of the team, they must cooperate and achieve their goal. A great example would be when Yoast tells Boone to treat his players like marines rather than high school students and does so. <br/><br/>I thought that both Boone and Yoast were portrayed quite nicely, Boone does not show any sense of noble or arrogance and neither does Yoast show any signs of racism of being a racist for that matter. In fact, both characters show their ambition to win and how skilled they are at football. Another scene, which I personally enjoyed, was the ending where there was the closing touchdown, I felt that it resembled the end and victory over racism. <br/><br/>The Film somewhat historically accurate but I felt that there was a lot of drama throughout the film. Of course, Hollywood loves to alter certain parts of the story to make it more ""interesting"" or ""compelling"". It also seems that the film was ""exaggerated"" but overall, the film was quite accurate. <br/><br/>But there are some raising questions during the film, such as we could only see that the Whites are afraid of losing their positions in the team thus not wanting to play with the blacks, but what about the blacks themselves? Didn't they transfer from an all black school? This film shows that the white people are very possessive and want to resent the blacks, and that the blacks themselves are feeling grateful and happy due to transferring to a better school. <br/><br/>Another questioned raised is that what happened to the coach in the all blacks school? Why was Boone transferred to coach but not the coach from the all blacks school? This shows that the film has left out some possible information that might affect the movie dramatically. <br/><br/>""Remember the Titans"" is a predictable and heart warming film with strong emotional themes and powerful music but there are some areas where the film was lacking such as stated before, over-exaggeration of dramatization and the limited solution of racism depicted during the film. Overall, I would give this film a rating of 7/10.<br/><br/>-Nicholas Chong"
"user-551-312947","7","1","2","9 December 2012"," Remember the Titans
","Remember the Titans Engaging But Exaggerated<br/><br/>Even though the film Remember the Titans, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman was a very emotionally engaging and entertaining movie, the sequence of events that occurred were seemingly exaggerated. The film Remember the Titans was inspired by the actual events that occurred in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, which explores many of the fundamental issues of racism in the 19th century.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Boaz Yakin, follows the story of Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), an African American who comes to T.C Williams High School to coach the T.C. William's football team, the Titans. Racially divided, Herman Boone faces difficulty in getting the boys on his team to connect with each other, and also faces many instances of conflict with his white assistant coach, Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who had previously been the head coach. After going to training camp together and forcing the African American boys and white boys to further integrate and get to know each other, eventually the team learns to come together despite the racial divide that is still present in their town, Alexandria, Virginia. As the movie progresses, the bond between the players of both races develop and grow stronger, despite the initial hostility that plagued both the blacks and whites on the team. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst also star in the film, playing the characters Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier, respectively. Both characters play important roles in the film, leading and setting an example of the strong relationship that can be developed regardless of skin color. Initially facing a lot of discrimination from other teams, parents, and townspeople, together the Titans eventually start to change the views of the common people through football, in which they continue to have an unbelievable season. <br/><br/>The film Remember the Titans was overall a very well made drama that at the same time also informed viewers of the issue that surrounded that time period. Through out the film, you begin to gain a great love for football after seeing how it affectively brings together the whites and African Americans in the movie. Furthermore the choice of music further enhanced the emotional connection with the film while also exaggerating it to make it more amusing. An example being where the song Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terell was played in a scene where everyone was joyfully singing together in the locker rooms. The storyline seemed well developed and was easy to follow, always leaving the viewer interested and engaged with the film. However, in comparison to how the events actually occurred, the screenplay did seem exaggerated and in some cases, the characters misrepresented. For example, near the beginning of the film, on the street you see angry citizens, both black and white, ready to attack each other while standing on the opposite side of the street, divided by only a few policemen. Even though at that time there was a lot of racial tension, the film did over exaggerate the conditions. Ronnie Bass who was portrayed by Kip Pardue in the film was quoted saying, ""They had a community divided down black and white, and it really wasn't like that in 1971 Alexandria,"" in an interview with the Greenville News. Besides this, the scene in which Herman Boone woke his team up at 3:00 am to go to the Gettysburg battlefield to give a motivational speech seemed far fetched from what actually happened. Furthermore, it was Ronnie Bass who also seemed to have been misrepresented in the film. In the film, Ronnie Bass was portrayed as being a hippie who was attracted to guys, where in one scene even ends up kissing a fellow teammate on the lips. However in actuality, these events did not occur and was only added for audience amusement. <br/><br/>As for the historical accuracy of the film, the producers and directors of Remember the Titans did affectively present the issue of racism and discrimination in towns and schools at the time. However when looking at a historical timeline of the events that occurred, the film seemed to be a little off as well. In the film, T.C Williams High School is seen as the first high school in their championship tournament to fully integrate black and whites together in 1971. However in reality, T.C Williams High School saw the integration of white and black students in 1965 where at that point, other schools had also began to integrate sports teams and classes as well. As stated before, even with the racial tension that was present at the time, it was not as bad as what was portrayed in the movie, where people were protesting on the first day of school. <br/><br/>All in all, the film Remember the Titans is a well-produced film that keeps you emotionally engaged through the events that occur and the characters that are portrayed. Remember the Titans is definitely a movie to watch that will leave you satisfied, but should also be known that in some cases, the events that occurred are slightly exaggerated and inaccurate."
"MovieGuy109","7","1","2","26 November 2011"," If you enjoy sentimental films, watch it.
","Remember the Titans is a sentimental picture about racism and teamwork done in sappy, emotional style. It's very corny at times because it deals with a melodramatic issue. Any Spike Lee film takes on these issues better than this, but the messages are true and everyone puts on a good performance. However it is Washington that pulls the film across in his powerhouse performance as the head coach. I liked the dialogue, especially when Washington is saying the lines. The execution is melodramatic, but if you like films about this type of thing than you should enjoy it a lot. I admit the film is honest and sincere and is often quite funny."

"Bpete33","10","1","2","14 March 2011"," The theme of Remember the Titans is that even against all odds, a united group can take on anything.
","***Spoilers***<br/><br/>The theme of Remember the Titans is that even against all odds, a united group can take on anything. In 1971, Alexandria, Virginia was a town against the integration of the black and white high schools much like the rest of the south. Obviously, this sentiment is going to trickle down to the newly combined high school and its football team. The tension in town really increases when black head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is chosen as the high school's football coach. Herman Boone is given the difficult task of trying to coach a football team that is divided by color. The football players are constantly fighting and at odds with each other. At the center of team's conflict are two pivotal players. The black players' main influence is Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) where the white players' tend to be Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst). Even Herman Boone is not exempt from the conflict as he constantly runs into problems with the team's assistant coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Through all of this, the team starts to come together after an influential run to Gettysburg. The lighting really made this part even more profound and impactive. It presented a bleak, gloomy mood as Coach Boone spoke about the reality that many men died for what was still relevant in 1971. This tied to the theme as there is not a more important uniting time then when soldiers are fighting in wars together. I also think the angle was important as it effectively made the scene more surreal as we are listening to Herman Boone talk. The angle helps us really focus on what is being said. It works because it really makes you think about his words as Coach Boone is speaking. Collectively, this scene symbolized the darkness that racism and prejudice can present. It was also a foreshadowing for the adversity the team would encounter after getting back to Alexandria and starting high school. The team might have been ready to look at each other as men and not skin colors. Unfortunely, the rest of the town is not. The team gets back to the real word and is met with this harsh realization. This in turn helps emphasize the theme even more. Even though it is two different genres of film, I can see a comparison of this film to the movie Wildcats which stars Goldie Hawn. This is simply for the fact that my chosen theme could fit both of these movies effectively. In closing, Remember the Titans epitomizes what fighting against all odds can really be about."

","There are some movies which have the same effect on us whether your watch them on silver screen or TFT screen. And ""Remember the Titans"" is truly one of them. Its really inspirational, appealing and powerful movie that shows how nothing is impossible if we really strive for it. <br/><br/>The characters in the movie are well chosen and well played as well.The role of 'The Coach' played by (one of the most likable actor) Denzel Washington is really puissant. The plot of the movie is woven around how 'an indomitable will' of few youths acted in good faith and leadership (by the 'Coach')can make big difference in the society, be it in field of sport or racist-nuances. The movie portrays the building up of team spirit and unity ,(filled with effusive touch of small subtle interactions)overlooking the differences between them, very well. <br/><br/>The Story is inspirational,Direction is at par, Screenplay is excellent, music is peppy for the background,Acting is homogenous but Denzel Washington stands out not only because he is the lead in the film but also because of his innate style of dialogue delivery which always gives strength to the role and weight to the character he plays. A must watch for those who like engrossing and piquant movies. I am sure its effect will not wear easily and who knows you might also ""Remember the Titans"". Watch it and you will know what I mean."

"TheUnknown837-1","8","1","2","25 September 2009"," if one examines it at a subliminal angle, ""Remember the Titans"" is not as conventional as it may seem
","I freely admit that the primary reason why I dislike so many motion pictures of the 21st century is because they are repetitive. They are predictable from start to finish. They are hackneyed and tiresome. They just do the same thing over and over again. But amongst all of those examples of reused themes and stories, there are a few individuals that stand out as not only passable, but even glorious and inspiring such as Boaz Yakin's conventional, but surprisingly moving ""Remember the Titans"": a film about the true story of the T.C. Williams football team that not only became one of the first integrated football teams in the nation, but the one that went on to become one of the best despite the ups and downs they had from the start.<br/><br/>The movie stars Denzel Washington as Coach Herman Boone, who not only was hired to supervise the integrated team, but was promoted to head coach over Caucasian coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) who had been the head coach for years prior. Boone and Yoast take the reluctantly integrated Titans under their wings and very slowly begin to transform them from racially divided groups into a unification that begins to inspire change in their southern town.<br/><br/>Now, the plot and story of ""Remember the Titans"" is one that has been used over and over again and will be used again and again in the future. The story is entirely predictable. You know how it's going to start. You know how it's going to end. You can even make some pretty accurate guesses about what's going to happen in the middle. But what really surprised me was what an involved film came out of all of this convention. Director Boaz Yakin is due enormous credit for this as are the writers, but the primary thrust behind the hand of ""Remember the Titans"" are the characters of the two coaches and the actors who portray them. Denzel Washington, one of the finest actors we have today, is hands-down brilliant as the school's first African American coach and Will Patton is also very good in the movie as well and their performances strengthen what the screenwriters did.<br/><br/>The irony is that although the plot is conventional, if one examines certain aspects of the movie at a subliminal level, it's not as recycled as it may seem. A typical conventional football movie about integrated teams would have the white coach be a racist, perhaps due to change, perhaps not and the black coach a thoroughly perfect individual. But here, that's not the case. In fact, Washington's character is not all that noble and Patton's character not all that prejudicial. These men are portrayed as professionals, but also as human beings with strengths and flaws.<br/><br/>Now in regards to the players themselves, there are some high points and some low points. The focus set on the team is a friendship between a white player (Ryan Hurst) and a black player (Wood Harris) and their struggle to convince the rest of the team and their families and school that people are people regardless of the color of their skin. Their story I found interesting if conventional. Another great touch was Coach Yoast's ten-year-old daughter who loves football as opposed to dolls. There was also a good subplot about an obese player and his strive to make it to college. But there are also some weak points and characters such as one in particular who backs out on his team at one point and the movie doesn't really center in on that moment the way it should have. And there were a lot of supporting characters that didn't strike with the impact that I think they were meant to be. Perhaps the filmmakers tried to include too much given that it's a true story.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it is conventional, perhaps too conventional for the tastes of some people, I was very enthralled and absorbed by ""Remember the Titans"" and the two stellar performances by Washington and Patton. The message of racism and the strive to dissolve it has been carried out better (and worse) in other films and here it plays its part just fine. It is a Disney movie, so it doesn't get carried away with itself, but rather just tries to communicate a good, inspiring message for the whole family, which is what a movie of this sort should do. It takes a certain genius to mold something inspirational out of a convention-packed formula, but Boaz Yakin has scored with ""Remember the Titans."""
"coltsfan1693","10","1","2","1 August 2009"," A feel-good movie! Definitely worth watching
","Many people get into a fuss about it not being ""factual"" - the thing is that it is Hollywood guys. It's not going to be absolutely perfect in how it is portrayed, even if it is one of those based on a true stories. One of my neighbors used to live in Virginia back in the 70s and while the racism wasn't as bad as it was portrayed in the movie, she said that there were many people who went out of their way to show their bigotry. The point of the movie is that it happened...there was a school named TC Williams and there were two coaches named Bill Yoast and Herman Boone that worked with a young team of black and white football players who overcame their own barriers towards each other. These two men are outstanding and Will Patton and Denzel Washington did a marvelous job portraying them and re-creating their best and even bad moments. It is Disney so it is a feel good movie which I think, is what most people enjoy - without being cheesy of course. It is a movie that can be watched over and over again without ever being tired of seeing it. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."

","Based on the incredible true story of high school football team the Titans this film mainly works because of the wonderful cast, and of course Jerry Bruckheimers key production values. The film is about football but that is not the real reason for the story what the writer mainly focuses on is the racial strife that the team first endures. The movie flows very well and is extremely entertaining and for only being a two plus hour movie I think the writer did well in crafting the script and bringing out the important themes of the film. I now would like to say a few things about the cast first off none of the guys look like they would be in high school, that being said they can all act. I don't think that one performance is better than another everything just kind of flows together and with out all the members of the cast it would be a completely different film and might not be as good.

"Boba_Fett1138","6","1","2","11 January 2009"," Decent but the best the genre has to offer? I really don't think so!
","I'm actually quite fond of sports movies, no matter how predictable they always are. I'm also a bit fond of American Football and occasionally watch a match on TV. I even watch the Super Bowl, even though it gets aired literally in the middle of the night for me, till early in the morning.<br/><br/>So this movie sounds like a perfect one for me to watch, since it features ingredients that I like. I really wasn't impressed with the movie though. It lacked a bit of everything, making it just a bit too much to regard this movie as an above average one. It lacked in good sports moment, it lacked in character development and it lacked in overall credibility, even though the movie in essence got based on a true story and real-life persons.<br/><br/>For an movie focusing on American Football it surely is missing some good match sequences. During the matches you hardly ever see any wide-shots, making it hard to figure out how the game is progressing and what exactly is going on and who is doing what. It's not remotely as adrenaline pumping all as portrayed in some other and much better movies, involving American Football.<br/><br/>But of course American Football is not the main essence of the movie. It's all about the racial issues. The movie is set in the early '70's and focuses on the State's first racial mixed Football high school team. Of course in the beginning they have difficulties working as a team together at first and the different groups don't accept and respect each other. I don't think I need to say how this is changing in the movie though later on and how the story is progressing. That's one of the difficulties of the movie. It's formulaic and predictable. Not just the story but also the different characters and their reactions toward each other. Basically every character within this movie is one big stereotype.<br/><br/>This brings me to another problem of the movie; It's characters. Because it's all so predictable and because the characters are such stereotypes you'll also feel hardly involved with any of them. The movie besides really doesn't feature the best character development I have ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless they are still being somewhat made interesting by the actors that are portraying them. The movie has some big names in it, such as Denzel Washington and Will Patton. It besides feature some new faces, that are now some well known established actors, such as Kip Pardue, Hayden Panettiere (as an 10-year old in her toughest role out of her career yet), Kate Bosworth and Ryan Gosling. Denzel Washington is especially great, like always.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit too short though. Sequences often feel rushed and lots of things are taking for granted, just to keep the movie going at all times. This is of course also something typical for a Jerry Bruckenheimer production but in this particular case it doesn't help the movie much. They could had easily resolved this by just letting the movie be like 15 minutes longer.<br/><br/>It's also a pretty 'clean' movie. It's a Disney produced movie, so there are no swearing characters, no sleeping around with the cheerleaders and the movie is heavy on its themes and morals, such as acceptance and team work. A supposedly homosexual character and a real fat and slight backward guy are almost immediately being accepted into the group of tough pride, athletic, all-American youngsters. A makes the movie just a bit too 'clean' and therefore at the same time also really not the most credible movie around.<br/><br/>It's overall a maintaining movie that is certainly watchable, with a fine style and acting performance. But it's also a real lacking and far from perfect one, in more than a couple of ways.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","While a film like this may not be what everyone is looking for, since some who want a sports movie ONLY want a sports movie, 'Remember the Titans' is a fantastic film that works on multiple levels to deliver not only a great film on football, but one that speaks well on the racial tensions of the time period. It may not take the racial problems as seriously as it should, but as it's a Disney film, it's hard to be entirely put off by that.<br/><br/>The story goes as follows: When two schools (one primarily white, the other primarily black) are integrated, the football team is put under the control of black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). This causes strife between the players and community. As the racial tension rises, Boone must work harder to unite his divided team.<br/><br/>The script has a nice blend of drama and humour. From the gut-wrenching moments of racial battling to the hilarious ""Who's Your Daddy?"" scene, 'Remember the Titans' works well as more than just a simple sports flick. Adapting the script to the screen. director Boaz Yakin (this film being, essentially, his masterpiece (without much competition)) captures the 1970s Virginia setting quite well and does a good job of portraying the action of the game of the football. The acting, as expected, is mostly fantastic. Denzel puts forth his usual awesome performance and, excluding one or two of the players, the rest of the cast does well along with him.<br/><br/>All together, 'Remember the Titans' manages to be one of the most well rounded & well made sports movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8.5/10.<br/><br/>-AP3-"
"mb415","7","1","2","7 December 2008"," Class project. I was required to review the movie, and post it.
","Movie Review: Remember the Titans Remember the Titans, released in 2000, is a heart-touching movie relating the game of football to the struggles of racial tension and friendship. Director Boaz Yakin uses just the right amount of drama and action to create a movie deserving a five star rating. Remember the Titans is a narration that not only tells a story to the viewer but it teaches a bit of a history lesson. Based on a true story set in 1971, Denzel Washington shows off his admirable acting skills as he plays Coach Boone who is named head coach of a football team that has recently integrated blacks and whites. While the teammates are more concerned about skin color than football practices, Coach Boone along with Assistant Coach Bill Yoast played by Will Paton, set out to teach them a lesson that is truly priceless.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a series of establishing shots as the Titans head off to Gettysburg College for a week of team bonding and football practices. Right from the start Boone forces the players to tolerate their teammates of another race by forcing them to not only sit together on the buses but also room together. Allowing their differences to affect the way they play the sport of football, at first the Titans are no team but rather individual players selfishly tossing around a football. Especially in the scenes where the players are butting heads, close ups on the actors faces are used to show frustration as well as the clash between races and the problems caused by the integration. After a couple days of grueling practices, constant bickering, and a tiring yet meaningful run to the Gettysburg battlefields, the players begin to understand the importance and meaning of equality. Yakin uses low-key lighting in the battlefield scene to show intensity and suspense. As the week progresses the Titans transform from simply football players to a football team. Just as any team has to work hard and communicate with each other the Titans learns to not only communicate but see their teammates for who they are, not by their skin color. Viewers watch as the Titans become a brotherhood, forming friendships, inside jokes, and an overall respect for each other. Actors such as Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris do a particularly good job of really showing the difficulties the team and town were facing. Upon returning to their small town of Alexandria, Virginia as a well bound team, it's up to them to prove to the rest of the town that all are equal, white or black and that the Titans are a winning team.<br/><br/>As the Titan's overcome the struggle of segregation and return back to town, it becomes very apparent that they're not at camp anymore. While the Titans work their way to the top, beating not only the opposing teams but leaving racial issues in the dust, they teach the rest of the town ""how to trust the soul of a man, not the look of him."" While the team takes on Marshall for the title it marks much more than the end of the movie, but rather the start of a new era. Denzel's intensity, Patton's gentleness and Hayden Pannettiere's comic relief, along with the all the actors make Remember the Titans the remarkable movie it is. Not only is it a movie that touches the heart, but one that people clearly put their heart into making, making it a movie well worth watching."
"jlwolff","9","1","2","2 December 2008"," NOT your typical sports drama
","Do you love sports dramas but are sick of the same plot played out over and over again? I know I was too, so I wasn't anxious to check out the movie, Remember the Titans (2000). However, from the moment the opening credits started rolling, I knew that this was not only a movie that would hold a place in my DVD collection, but in my heart as well. Due to the fact that this film was based on a true story, it draws the audience in. The story begins in 1971 Virginia at a time when race is a major conflict. A school by the name of T.C.Williams had just been established, forcing black and white students together. The battle of overcoming prejudice was raging not just in the schools, but also on the football field. Players and coaches alike needed to find a way to put aside their differences and work as a team to reach the common goal, a perfect season. The task was not easy, however, as we witnessed several heartbreaking altercations between the players. <br/><br/>The turning point of this inspirational tale proved to be an early morning run as part of training camp at Gettysburg College. Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) delivered a speech telling how the team was still fighting the same battle as their ancestors did during the Battle of Gettysburg. Upon returning from camp the team is finally viewed as one, instead of the black players and white players.<br/><br/>It seemed that every scene in this film filled me with a different emotion. From one moment to the next the audience is thrown about from the excitement of winning the first game to tears whenever the unexpected happens. The movie is shot in a way that the viewer experiences what the players are going through. This is evident during the football games when I found myself on the edge of my seat, feeling as if I were a Titan.<br/><br/>What seals the deal for Remember the Titans is the stellar cast. As always, Denzel Washington nails the part of Coach Boone, giving the character passion, but also determination. His counterpart, Coach Yoast (Will Patton) delivers a love of the game that fuels the boys' desire to win. Standout performances by Wood Harris (Julius Campbell) and Ryan Hurst (Gerry Bertier) allow the audience a glimpse into the inner workings of the team. <br/><br/>I was very impressed by this film. From the intense football drills to the touching portrayal of the characters, Remember the Titans has me hooked. At the end of the movie, an adult Sheryl delivers the following quote: ""People say it can't work,black and white; well here we make it work,everyday. We have our disagreements, of course, but before we reach for hate, always, always, we remember the Titans"". After watching this movie, I promise that you will too."

When the Titans are returning from a game, Ronnie Bass (Sunshine) is seen wearing a Lettermans Jacket; Letter awards are not given until after the season is over..........The movie dealt about the problems that occurred in the south when athletic teams were integrated. One of the most poignant issues was how the team came together thru the football season including both coaches. Whatever differences that started with the schools integration were soon worked out by the athletes themselves.

I think it portrays a lot of themes which can be applied to real life. Sports are something which can really bring people together because you have to work as a team for the good of a the whole. I think all the personalities and different characters in this movie worked really well. I think the acting was really great. The actors worked great as a team to make a really heartfelt movie that is entertaining to watch. There are a lot of sports movies out there, but something about football just really hit home for me. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sports and like great dramatic films with a lot of heart."

Great cast.<br/><br/>While some weak and cheesy moments, particularly the final football play (fumble & TD)..... There are so many great moments & vignettes in the film. Denzel Washington's character is portrayed as flawed and that I appreciated.<br/><br/>Scene's I loved include the Racist Restaurant, the Football scene's, the Fixed game, the warm up and the true camaraderie.<br/><br/>Always get choked up watching it, especially considering it is a ""True"" (although dramatized) story."

","This movie is a basic archetype for all other inspirational sports movies. Pride of the Yankees was good but this movie has everything that is an American film. Overcoming prejudice and uniting to become one of the greatest football stories ever told.<br/><br/>So many movies have followed the example of this one; Coach Carter, Glory Road, Gridiron Gang, Friday Night Lights, and more recently Pride. All are good in there own way but they seem almost redundant compared to Remember the Titans. Probably one of the best family films of all time and a movie that i have seen probably over a dozen times and can still seen over a dozen more."

","Just to let you know this may not contain spoilers, but I didn't want to get blacklisted. Its not very often that I rate movies 10 out of 10! Most Disney movies are OK,I didn't even know this was a Disney movie, I didn't know anything about the movie period. I had heard of something about football, and that doesn't really interest me. All I knew was it had Denzil Washington in it, so it might be OK. The first few seconds the music started, put a chill down my spine. Movies with an excellent score (lord of the rings trilogy, brave-heart, titanic, last of the Mohican's, etc) they help the movie be even better. I knew I had heard the music before, but had no idea, maybe when I was channel hopping or something. Anyway, back to the movie. We were taken away from our work for a couple of hours because our team had really come together for a few hard months, and won a quarter at work so we were rewarded with a couple of hours off... so Kudos to ""CitiBank"" for that:) But its a team building movie. Denzil Washington was amazing as usual, Will Patton, excellent, and all the young talent. Everyone was so incredible. There were times the movie was so... moving.. tears welled up in my eyes, and it wasn't even the sad part in the movie. Overall... best movie I have seen in a long long time. I recommend this to family's, not so much for younger kids, IE 5 or so.. probably wont appeal. But to 8 and above, and the rest of the family. Definitely one I will be buying in the near future."
"freaky_dave","7","1","2","2 February 2007"," An okay football movie in my book
","With the Superbowl coming up, I decided to watch Remember The Titans. I knew it was about high school football and dealt with race. It was based on a true story in 1971 which involved integration of both black and white students into one school. I found it quite interesting.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone. He is brought into the school to replace Bill Yoast (Will Patton) as head coach of the high school football team the Titans. Yoast is upset at first, but then he decides to stay on as defensive coordinator of the Titans, and together these two men find away to get through their differences and bring a football team of both black and white students together as winners. Both give very good performances <br/><br/>The young cast is also splendid, especially Wood Harris as Julius and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier. These two are the team captains of the Titans, and they are the first to break through their discrimination against one another and become fast friends. Honorable mention should also be given to Hayden Panettiere as Bill Yoast's young daughter Sheryl.<br/><br/>What makes this film work though is how race is not one sided. You see the good and bad from all sides. A recent movie that did just this same thing was Crash from 2005.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. There were some things in Remember the Titans that just never quite fit. The character of Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass (even though it was a decent performance by Kip Pardue) was one, and all the singing was another. Was Sunshine gay or not? There's one moment where you think it's true, but then afterward it's never really explained. The singing that was used in the movie also went a little too far and distracted somewhat from the movie. Other than that, this was a pretty good film."

But... NOT THIS TIME! It was a fantastic movie, my eyes were not off the TV, Denzel Washigition played a amazing roll in this film, and so did others. I really enjoyied the movie, I even rented it out of school. <br/><br/>This movie is great, it's a high quality drama, that kids off all ages can watch. Some people I know Thought this movie wouldn't be good, because its just about football! No, It had a sensational storyline to the movie, It had times when you could laugh, and also had times when you could almost cry. This movie isn't just about sport, its about the times, when things were hard for everyone. The movie was based on a true story, so all the events were true, You should really rent this movie, I will guarantee you would like it. <br/><br/>good movie <br/><br/>8/10"

","Well, this movie is a definite must see (as is obvious from my summary). If you love sports movies, watch it. If you love dramas, watch it. If you are interested in civil rights, watch it. Pretty much if you are alive, watch it. The only problems is that it ruins sports movies for you, it is so good. Seeing any of the new ones is just painful to me, because I want to have Denzel Washington in it, giving speeches and such. Every single character in this movie is amazing, from the star players, to the coaches, to the one liners. Everyone is fabulous. I don't even like football especially, but this movie just interests me to the very end."

","This is by far my favorite movie in history. This is the story of two races from two different places putting there differences aside and binding through the great story of football. Even what the parents and the town people told them they would not listen as friendship was to great for them. This movie is feel good with the music to the team comedy. It shows every aspect of racial differences, and how where not all that different. Denzel Washington gives off a breathtaking performance as the coach who never quits and Will Patton who gives up his life long dream to be in the hall of fame to see his team shine. It is a great story of team-work, and should never be forgotten. I give this movie a 10/10. It is the greatest football story ever portrayed."
"janell5","10","1","2","2 November 2006"," movie review
","Remember the Titans are one of the best movies to come to theaters. Denzel Washington was portrayed as the coach of the only black and white football team in the district. His part in the movie had him under a lot of pressure and he played it real well.<br/><br/>My favorite part in the movie was the moment when the football players finally started to play as a team and stop fighting each other for whatever reason. I think this is a great family oriented movie that will stay on the top of the charts and will soon be a classic. Denzel Washington is self explained. It's like whenever he's in a movie, you know its going to be good. I think Remember the Titans is one of the best movies to come around. I've probably seen the movie 50+ times and I still get a warm feeling inside every time I see the scene when they win the championship game and everybody is happy and jumping for joy. Its sometimes brings tears to my eyes."

","This is a very moving and heart lifting film. I am a fan of sports films in general because of the way they lift your spirits and are great if you're looking for the feel good factor. But this film is extra special. It has a fantastic cast (Denzel Washington is amazing in this film) and the way the film deals with the issue of race and how it was dealt with in the 70's is really strong. It has all of the feel good factors of a sports film but manages to deal with important issues along side this. As the film is based on a true story, it makes the storyline and the characters much more identifiable and you really care about what happens to them. I like the way that the film portrays the prejudices of both races. It doesn't focus on one point of view and try to place more blame on one culture. When the boys come together at bootcamp it is incredibly heart warming, in particular the relationship between Julius and Gary. These characters are the ring leaders of the two groups in the film and their union brings the whole team together. They have one of the best film friendships, it seems incredibly genuine. 'left side...strong side.' Another friendship that develops throughout the film is that between Coach Boone and Coach Yoakes. They are never going to be the best of friends but the film follows their journey as they learn to respect one another and learn 'to trust the soul of a man and not just the look of him.' All in all this film is a fantastic sports movie and incredibly touching, so i would strongly recommend it."

Ryan Hurst, Wood harris, Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee and Ryan Gosling and the rest of the characters that made up the team were all impressive.

"elkabong-dd","7","1","2","2 July 2006"," How did I miss this one?
","I must admit: I avoided this movie in the theatres, then I avoided renting or seeing this movie. A white boy who's seen enough ""integration"" films that his heart is really hardened to that sort of thing, and really I care little to see any more of this sort of film.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, after finishing Remember the Titans tonight -- I was a fool.<br/><br/>It's a movie about football, but, to me at least, it was very little about football, and very much about people. It's about one life touching another, and how hard it is to change people, and their outlooks on life, and especially their outlooks on other people, and MORE especially their outlooks on people different than themselves.<br/><br/>It would be simple to make a movie about a hardened group of white people who are ""turned"" into more understanding individuals, as if by magic. It would be simple to make each person tolerant, and to watch everyone around them fall like dominoes into this more tolerant attitude. We've all seen it a million times.. This movie doesn't do that.<br/><br/>As each person is transformed somewhat into a more enlightened person, they are pulled back by those around them. We see time and again the small respect that grows between the two ""sides"" is torn down. As one person makes strides, their family or loved ones pull them back into their racist ways. It's a struggle clearly defined, and beautifully played in Remember the Titans.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie an 8 out of 10. While I did find it striking, and nothing short of enlightening, there were enough of the Hollywood trappings and stereotypes to bring it down a bit for me. Still, there are few movies I have enjoyed more, and none I have enjoyed more that cover this tricky subject."

","Remember the Titans has got to be one of the all time greatest movies that I have ever seen. The movie about T.C. Williams High School, in Virginia, where they are schooling black and white students, and combining the races on the football team, is truly an inspirational story. Coach Boone constantly has to deal with his players fussing with each other over race, but they are able to come together for a perfect season. In the movie, Boone says, ""In Greek Mythology, the Titans were greater than even the gods. Well, that field out there, that's our universe. Let's rule it like Titans."" is truly an incredible inspirational quote from the movie, and I would choose this quote to describe to someone what this movie was about. All in all, this was a great movie, and it is one I would watch several times."

","When I first saw this movie I immediately fell in love with it. I saw that this movie had a profound impact and a lot of it comes from the fact that this was based on a true story. It teaches us to respect people and to judge them from their character and not by the color of their skin. It also shows how difficult obstacles that are on both the playing field and off of the playing field can be over coned through the powerful bond of teamwork. It also shows how a small group of young men playing football influenced an entire community on how to respect and work together with people of another race. This is a must see film for anyone and if you are not moved by this then I don't know what to say to you."
"lastliberal","8","1","2","16 April 2006"," An Easter Story
","Of course, I had seen it before, but to re-watch Remember the Titans on Good Friday was appropriate. Some may call it sacrilegious to compare the resurrection of Jesus to the resurrection of a Virginia town through football, but I see the Easter story in this movie. The self-importance exhibited by the Pharisees and the resulting hatred of those different, was no different from the hate exhibited by the town fathers in Virginia. The insistence of brotherhood by the coach, as played magnificently by Denzel Washington, resulted in a rebirth of the town - a resurrection from the hatred that blinded, and sometimes still blinds, the sons of the Old South. None of us is perfect, but we can all come together and form a perfect society. That was the vision of Jesus and the vision of our forefathers. Remember the Titans reminds us of what we can accomplish if we try - and if we try with love."

Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) are combining blacks and whites; many people were racist back then, and the coaches wanted to put an end to that.<br/><br/>Thanks to hard training, the boys finally made a great team, and that team won the state championship.

""Let the boys play,"" appeals Coach Herman Boone!<br/><br/>Supported with humor, interesting and likable real-life characters and their actors, as well as the classic and alive music of that era, you're transported to a time in America before the 21st Century, when our culture was less jaded and world-weary, with more vitality, vulnerability, jubilance, and depth. <br/><br/>As the movie ends I wish I could continue to know these people and experience more of life's twists and turns and ups and downs in their company. You want to watch them continue to grow and see what happens in the lives of people you've come to know. As a result, I've looked up here in the IMDb the movie's writer, director and actors to find more of their movies, especially Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, and Hayden Panettiere!(Denzel Washington was already a favorite.)"

Based on true events, there may have been limitations on Artistic License, but this story may not have needed much of that. <br/><br/>I laughed, cried, and was so moved by the actors in this film. If, however, I have seen this correctly, I can't believe that this film, nor the actors in this film, were not even nominated for Awards; i.e. Academy Award, Oscar, etc. It did received some (please don't hate me for using this term, I just hadn't heard of these awards) minor awards and nominations, but not the ""Big"" Awards.

The movie is based on a true story where an African American coach is hired to lead a high school football team in a town in Virginia, USA, in the 60's where racial tension still existed. The racial differences accompanies the whole movie, and the audience can see how the friendship that emerges among the team members and their struggle for common goals (to win as a team) can diminish the racial tension among the team members and further on in the hole city.

Denzel Washington, acting as coach Herman Boone put forth a superb performance which i found to be very believable and motivating. Watching the extras on this DVD was just as good as the film. Being able to listen to the two coaches talk about their experience that year and show their solid friendship was great. I also think it was a very classy move by the school to name the gym after Gary, that guy commands respect and was giving his rightful amount.

","In a year of many bad movies (USA Today reported the year 2000 was one of the worst year for movies in 75 years), this was one of the year's best.<br/><br/>This movie received very little hype and fanfare compared to many box office ""turkeys"" of that year did. It seems as though Disney did not have very high expectations for this movie, considering the little promoting they did and release date they gave it. This was grossly underrated.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington was excellent as Coach Herman Boone. A highly qualified coach who is tough, but fair to his players. He has faced racism and discrimination throughout his life, is given the head coaching job at T.C. Williams high in Virginia, because of his race.<br/><br/>Will Patton as was wonderful as Coach Bill Yoast. Another highly qualified coach who will experience what Coach Boone has, as the head coaching job is taken away from him and takes a demotion as Assistant Coach to Boone, after the white players said they would sit out the season in out of loyalty to Coach Yoast, but mainly, due to their prejudice to Coach Boone.<br/><br/>the rest of the cast was good as well. Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, Ryan Gosling as Alan Bosley, had to overcome their prejudices and fears towards their African-American teammates and coach, while Wood Harrris as Julius Campbell, and Donald Faison as Petey to name a couple, will have to deal with their teammates' prejudices I mentioned and come together with their white teammates to become a team. The cast was wonderful. I could go on and on about it, but it there's more to this movie than the cast.<br/><br/>Director Boaz Yakin seemed to capture the turbulent times of this era; The post Civil Rights Movement, integration of the public schools in the south and racism in particular. I almost felt like I was there, having to deal with this. <br/><br/>I liked the football scenes as well. Once again, I almost felt like I was there cheering on the Titans as they were going for the perfect season and their battle for the Virginia AAA state football title.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was taken in immediately and I said to myself I will add this DVD to my library. Needless to say, I have it.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing is, when this movie is shown on television, I'll watch it. Normally, I won't watch it because these movies have scenes edited out, parts of the dialog is bleeped or dubbed, due to the inappropriate scene, time and/or language content. In addition, you have to deal with those annoying commercial breaks.<br/><br/>The reason why I'll watch it is, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor for whatever reason on the theater and DVD version. On the latter. you can find it in the deleted scenes section on the bonus features of the DVD, but on the television version, those same deleted scenes, you can find them back in the movie. On a particular note, you can see Lucinda Jenney's only scene in the movie as Coach Yoast's ex-wife, Arleen Yoast, when she gave custody to their daughter Sheryl to him. <br/><br/>Another scene is where Julius and Gerry are at a barbecue and they are discussing their futures. Julius says he wants to go to Ohio State and play for then coach Woody Hayes. This is interesting, because I don't recall seeing that scene when I saw it in the theater and you will not find it on the DVD version of the movie or in the deleted scenes section.<br/><br/>Besides being one of the year's best films, this is also one of the best sports movies ever made."

","In the 70's, in a Virginia High School where there were only white students, students have to deal with the arrival of their new football coach and black students. But they will learn about each others, they will be stronger, they will be the Titans.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie I was really surprised because I was sure that Remember the Titans was a long and boring football movie, but it was not. It's also a movie about the acceptation of racial differences and friendship. I think that each person who is racist should absolutely see this movie. At the beginning, white and black team's members were enemies but at the end of their training camp, they were friends. They learned to know and to understand each other as well as a big family. When they came back to school they realized that acting like they did was stupid. I think the best example is Garry's girlfriend. I can understand that sometimes some people can be afraid of difference but I can not understand people who are acting like her."
"rook01","6","1","2","27 February 2005"," The Titans movie does not remember the Titans
","The film is still a decent movie. As a history buff, I decided to look up the real story of the Titans to see what they changed.<br/><br/>First Denzel Washington's character had already been hired at the black school in the film. He was not a new coach. Three schools were closed and consolidated not two.<br/><br/>Second the Titans did not have any close games except for the Marshall game which they won 21-16 and not 10-7. However that game was the fifth game of the season and not the state championship as in the movie. The Titans crushed their opponents by double digits in every game on the way to the state championship.<br/><br/>The film was strong on getting many of the key racial relationships correct. What would been wrong showing the Titans as a dominant football team. Sports clichés such as winning on the last play of the game need to be eliminated in movies unless it actually happens.<br/><br/>What made Miracle a strong film is that they did not rewrite what happened in the US Soviet hockey game. Of course more people know the events of the US and Soviet Hockey semifinal game than the Titans high school football team in the 1970s. But in a film whose movie title is ""Remember the Titans"", I want to remember them as the dominant team they were."

This is life and death and your whole future rolled into one.<br/><br/>The only thing is, this is high school. The men are supposed to be seventeen year old boys. The coach is just an ordinary teacher. I think about the school I come from where the teachers have to do unpaid after school sports training for disenfranchised students who often have to be nagged, cornered and marched on to the field to get a complete team together."

","This movie is so good on so many levels. The acting is superb by both Denzel Washington (as Coach Herman Boone) and Will Patton (as Coach Bill Yoast). The movie focuses around the football team of a recently integrated high school in racist Virginia of the 70's. The team battles the heavy racism of the town and overcomes with a spirit that brings the entire town together.<br/><br/>The film features more than just the story of a team winning it all with some sort of magical happening as many other sports movies are. This film shows a group of teenagers who can overcome the racism that lives relentlessly in their lives and go on to turn it around and bring the entire town together. The differences between all of the boys on the team are set aside as they instead come together in a way that allows for them to go all the way and win in the face of racism.<br/><br/>I highly recommend everyone to see this movie, not because it is just a good movie about football, but because it is a good movie about settling your differences with others. The movie reminded me much of the story of the US hockey team (which was recently made into a film too, also by Disney entitled Miracle). It is a timeless movie that I can still watch and enjoy."

"irish_psycho","8","1","2","21 December 2004"," Denzel Washington & Will Patton on top form
","I just watched this film this afternoon and boy was I surprised how all it takes is a great story to make such a great film. Stories like this are not made up, they're written in history. Its about a black man (Washington) taking over as coach from a white man (Patton) of a High School back in the early 70's in Alexandria, Virginia. As you can imagine the whites do not take too friendly to this, especially when Patton's character is a championship coach. Denzels task of then trying to make a winning team is clearly hardened as both sides (blacks & whites) of the community are split down the center.<br/><br/>But Denzel does more than get the team talking to each other in this heart warming film. He brings the whole community together in Alexandria. Of course this film is about football but the strong theme of racism and how to overpower it really does overshadow this, making it not just enjoyable by sports fans. The story is predictable at times but it's the journey that you go on in the film is what matters.<br/><br/>This is a real heart warming story that should leave everyone feeling good at the end, recommended for everyone.<br/><br/>8* out 10"

","In the past several years, there has been an influx in the US box offices of sports movies, particularly football. These movies often carry cliché messages and dull character interactions. Remember the Titans, directed by Boaz Yakin, is exactly the opposite of these drab movies.<br/><br/>The story of T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA, the movie tells much more than the story of a football team. With the school recently forced to integrate, racial tensions are running high not only among schoolmates, but across the town. With the new black head coach, Herman Boone, the team is faced with the challenge of overcoming their differences.<br/><br/>Yakin shows us through the film the teams roller-coaster ride through its season. From the beginning of camp, when players of other races are reluctant to sit on the same bus, to the end of the season when a white teammate proclaims one of his black teammates his brother, Yakin shows us the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.<br/><br/>He uses their success on the football field as a way to convey their struggles in life and society's. He shows us exactly how the players are feeling, instead of only how good of football players they are. The triumphs of the team not only inspire the players and the coaching staff, but the entire town to attempt to lay aside their differences and respect their brother."
"Enchorde","8","1","2","16 November 2004"," Entertaining, important
","** HERE BE SPOILERS **<br/><br/>For the first time, the schools in Alexandria is integrated, and that means for the first time the schools football team will be mixed black and white. Coach Boone (Washington) is politically appointed to coach the team in place of coach Yoast (Patton). They have the work cut out for them, as they have to bring the two societies of black and white communities to work together as a team. To complicate matters, the coaches don't really trust each other either. To bring the team together, all the players go to training camp were they're forced to live and work together. But problems arise again when the team come back to town, and the ordinary life begins again and the divided community try to tear the team apart. However, they are successful on the field and for every game they win, they come closer to the championship.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining movie about an important topic. It is really great to see that a movie can show an important, and still current, issue and still be entertaining. This is mostly due to a nice plot and story, well thought through, that don't shy away from hard interesting situations and the very good performances from the entire cast. Both Washington and Patton is great as the coaches and the team is good as well, especially Hurst and Harris. Another part that makes the story very good is that there is time for individual development in the characters, and there are a lot of interesting characters in and around the team. The use of music is also very good, both the music in the movie and that from ""outside"". All in all, interesting cast, good acting, story and directing and an interesting topic. Very good.<br/><br/>8/10"

","When I learned that I had to watch this film for my sports film class, I was not very happy about it. I just knew I wouldn't like it. After all, I'm a girl and the subject of the film was football, my least favorite sport. What could I find enjoyable about the film? Plenty, it turned out. This was by far one of the best sports movies I have watched. Yes, a great deal of it focused on football, but it was about so much more than sports.<br/><br/>The film centers on the 1971 football team (the Titans) at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA. The school system is working on integrating a previously all-white school, and the team is doing the same. For the first time, African American and white kids are supposed to play ball side by side, whether they like it or not. In the beginning, all of the players are angry at the situation and the team suffers because of it. As the story progresses, the two races eventually begin to accept each other and even begin to befriend kids of the opposite race. The movie focuses on the racism the players face from their peers and students from other schools and how the team deals with it. Of course there are a fair number of football scenes, but they add to the story rather than detract from it and shift the focus to sports. They help to show how all the individual players, regardless of their race, could come together as one to face a common opponent in whichever team they were playing. By the end of the film, the players realize that the color of their skin doesn't matter. They all face the same problems and have the same dreams.<br/><br/>If you were to simply hear the film's premise, I don't think it would convince you to go see it. Sure, it deals with the serious problem of racism and has a lot of cool football scenes, but so what? On their own, the plots and sub-plots don't seem that special, but when combined with the superb acting skills of Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris and Hayden Panettiere, the film becomes a winner. Washington is great as Head Coach Boone, and Patton is equally amazing as Coach Yoast, but the film would only be tolerable without the performances of the guys on the football team. I would strongly recommend seeing this film just to enjoy their performances. They manage to portray the strong racial opposition in the beginning of the movie, and as the film progresses, the way they depict the team's relationship is remarkable. I found that as the movie went on, I became attached to many of the players and their struggles. By the end, I was rooting for all of them to overcome their individual obstacles. They all became real people to me, not simply characters in some film. <br/><br/>Adding to the film's appeal was the great soundtrack. The songs played throughout the movie were a mix of Motown, gospel, and 70's rock. They gave the film a fun, relaxed feel and set the time of the film at the same time. <br/><br/>If it is at all possible, please go out and see this film. It doesn't matter how old you are. People of any age can enjoy it. The story is interesting, it doesn't get too serious and the acting is top notch. I would give this film a 9 out of 10."

","This film is worth watching. And then it's worth watching again. And then again.<br/><br/>As entertainment, Remember the Titans is unique. <br/><br/>For starters, it's exquisitely acted and the music is nothing short of sensational -- a catchy collage of favorite oldies against a score combining sporty drumbeats and sentimental drama at appropriate plot junctures.<br/><br/>Then there's the touching, sometimes-cliffhanger of a true storyline.<br/><br/>Based on the tense experience of a Virginia city unhappily facing its first court-ordered school integration, Denzel Washington portrays the real-life Coach Hermann Boone. He acts the part with dignity and enough foibles to convince us he's a human being as well as a tough, drivingly-ambitious football coach. <br/><br/>Only thing is, Coach Boone, a PhD, is an African American tossed for political reasons into a formerly all-white high school arena. (Why not unleash the lions, as well, viewers might wonder?) <br/><br/>The school's key established team members decide not to play *for* Boone or *with* the bussed-in newbies. As if that weren't challenge enough, the old-line coaching staffers react with attitudes ranging from surly defiance to mutinous fury. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Boone is expected to elevate this football team, the mighty Titans, to its first championship. <br/><br/>Will Patton's performance as the deposed head coach with no choice except to defer to Boone is touching, at times bordering on magnificent. Watch for changes of facial expression and body language, often so subtle they're barely perceptible, as Patton's character gradually morphs from resentment of his new head coach, to openly-expressed admiration.<br/><br/>The cast of young teammates turn in believable performances, each and every one. A so-called lesser supporting cast also includes brief-but-pivotal appearances such as the confused-but-compassionate hospital nurse, Alice. The gal who plays the part reacts with such perfect timing, her 15 minutes of fame are well deserved.<br/><br/>Even the film's final credits hold audience attention. As cast and crew names scroll by, it's fascinating to see flashed images of the young team members and their coaching staff, including Boone, and to learn what's happened to them since that tense season.<br/><br/>My family and friends probably rewatch the film, in part, because it restores serenity via value lessons sorely needed in a nation torn for so long by bias and illogical hatred. There's an underlying current of decency despite the horrifying strife and struggle. It's also refreshing to see good guys finishing first, thinking, ""Hard to believe this really happened."" (It did.)<br/><br/>Watch the film, then watch it again. You *will* Remember the Titans."

","Enjoyed the characters and most of the interplay on the roster of players. Enjoyed the demoted Asst.Coach as Will Patton does a nice understated role. Even Denzel Washington who is normally terrible does an acceptable job, but something is missing.<br/><br/>First of all the story is too Disney, too contrived, almost where you can pick out where they veered from history.  The little girl is incredibly annoying...why does she have such a role?

Yes it's ""based on a true story."" Well if the true story is really this corny it should have been adapted. Disney might as well have made the movie as an animated feature. The stereotyping and exaggeration are as extreme as they often are in Disney toons. I rate it a 4 as it is watchable, but certainly no showpiece.

"Boyo-2","7","1","2","16 July 2002"," Profound message given Disney treatment
","Movie has a ton of value and much to teach audiences of today.  If for no other reason than to make sure that its shown that racism never was a good idea and its still not.  It shows the struggles of a town to come to terms with its inter-racial beginnings.  <br/><br/>Denzel gives his customary humorless performance.  He is never intense when he is supposed to be, and even when its time to celebrate or actually breathe, he can't seem to do that.  The only scene he seems to be giving anything to is one where the Titans beat a hated opposing coach who referred to him as a non-human - in this scene Denzel gets to give the guy a banana. Perhaps Denzel was uncomfortable with the subject matter, but its not like the script was going to be changed so everyone was holding hands from the start, right?<br/><br/>Will Patton is worse.  He's THIS CLOSE to playing more psycho parts like he did in that Kevin Costner/Sean Young thriller that I can't remember the name of.  He whistles when he speaks and its annoying.<br/><br/>The worse is his daughter, a nine-year old who thinks she should be coaching the team.  I loathe children in movies who act like they're 39 and she epitomizes that.  <br/><br/>Too much is sugar-coated and too much is never even shown.  Also you never see any prejudice on the black side. I am sure there are blacks who are prejudiced against whites as well and were extremely vocal in their feelings about that.  No one's black mother is shown reluctant to meet her sons' new white friend. Why?  This is what I meant by 'Disney treatment' in the title..some things will never change as long as movies like this are never fair. <br/><br/>The best actor is Wood Harris as Julius, followed by Ryan Hurst as Bertier and Kip Pardue as Sunshine.  This seems fitting, as the movie was about them anyway.  Harris has a great moment, when a cop car pulls up next to him. Guaranteed that's unfortunately happened to him much more than it should have, and for all the wrong reasons, but this time the police officer is congratulating him on a great game.  His look of shock combined with relief and genuine thanks is worth ninety other movies and says everything you need to know about this movie.  8/10."

Take the movie for what it is.  Yes it is a feel good movie.  I do agree with the one comment about the song at the end of the movie, kinda threw me for a loop, but didnt destroy how much I enjoyed the film.  The film was funny, racy (of course), nail biting, it had it all.  I dont cry during films, but I felt that feeling coming, but sucked it up of course.  I dont know much about the factual side of the movie, but beyond all that, it was a great moving film.  Denzel was stellar, but then again when is he not.  For those who are saying that I must not know anything about film, your wrong, I am a film major and have work on REAL films, short and feature (not just PA work either).  The problem with most people who know anything about film is they think that movies have to have deep underlying messages, extremely compelling acting, and bar none directing to be a great movie.  Learn to look at movies as they are, dont go into them expecting a glorious work of art all the time.  Those that are will stand out for that.

","Finally - a reason to boycott Disney that actually makes sense.  As I hunkered down to watch the DVD version of `Remember the Titans' - a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a diet soda in the other - what did I discover, to my amazement and horror, but that there was NO widescreen edition of the film anywhere to be found on the disc!  As a lover of movers, I long ago made a pact with myself that I would try to watch every movie in its purest possible form and that includes seeing it with its original theatrical ratio in tact.  What good is watching a movie when up to half its original picture is missing?  That is why I love DVD so much.  It almost always provides us with that option.  Watching a film that has been panned-and-scanned to fit the requirements of a square TV screen is as anathema to me as watching a film spliced-and-diced to meet `broadcast standards' or to make room for oodles of mind-numbing commercials selling products you wouldn't want even if they were given to you free of charge.   All this is prelude to saying that the review you will be reading from here on out is based on at best 90% of the movie that was shown in theatres around the country (and that's a conservative estimate).  Yes, I know there is a widescreen DVD version of the film on the market.  My point is trying to fathom why Disney feels the need to separate its full and wide screen editions when many of us may not have access to both, since we often find ourselves at the mercy of numbskull video storeowners who wouldn't know a jump cut from a freeze frame if their lives depended on it.  Furthermore, once a person gets home with a video, how many of us are going to want to go through the hassle of returning to the store to pick up the widescreen version?  Get a clue, Disney!<br/><br/> `Remember the Titans' is a near-perfect film for young people to see.  Not only does it open their eyes to just how recently - a mere 30 years ago - blatant institutionalized racism was woven into the fabric of many segments of American society, but the film shows them just how far we've come in rectifying that situation in a very short while.  Stylistically, `Remember the Titans' emerges as an effective distillation of two sure-fire popular genres:  the inspirational true-life sports story and the inspirational consciousness-raising racial drama.  Although the more cynical among us may feel a bit `inspirationed' out by the time the film's closing credits go rolling by, the rest of us will probably find ourselves dewy-eyed and emotionally uplifted by the experience.<br/><br/> Based on a true story, `Remember the Titans' takes us back to the year 1971 when a high school in Alexandria, Virginia - like schools all over the South - was just beginning to cope with the hot button, highly emotional issue of court ordered desegregation.  Into this hornet's nest of bigotry and rancor steps Herman Boone, a black football coach, hired to replace Bill Yoast, a top-notch coach who has led his team to no fewer than 15 championship seasons.  Credit `Remember the Titans' for tackling this issue in a unique way.  By acknowledging the unfairness done to Yoast (ironically, in the name of `fairness'), the film makes the reaction of some of the whites at least  comprehensible.  Few films of this type seem willing to delve into the moral complexity surrounding the sensitive issue of racism and choose instead to paint their characters literally as well as figuratively in black-and-white terms.  `Remember the Titans' doesn't do that.  We are allowed to see the issue from the white people's view as well - and to understand a bit where  they too are coming from.  Indeed, the basic theme of `Remember the Titans' is that anyone can change, given the proper chance and the set of circumstances necessary to bring it about.<br/><br/> It is with this set of circumstances that `Remember the Titans' most concerns itself, as it chronicles the gradual but inexorable change that takes place not only in the individuals involved but in the community as a whole.  The amazing thing, too, is that `Remember the Titans' manages to do all this without resorting to the use of a single four-letter expletive - an accomplishment that is not only rare in this day and age:  it is positively unique!  This, along with the salutary theme, makes `Remember the Titans' ideal viewing for schools and youth groups as well.  Director Boaz Yakin and writer Gregory Allen Howard are to be commended for crafting a film that is believable, fast moving and emotionally powerful all at the same time.  The actors are all superb in their various roles, with Denzel Washington, as always, serving as the solid center holding the whole project in place.<br/><br/> `Remember the Titans' could be dismissed as just another cliché-ridden, feel-good film designed to appease a smug, self-congratulatory liberal audience, making them feel superior by confirming their own goodness.  If it is such a film, so be it.  When a reminder of our common humanity comes along that is as good as `Remember the Titans,' the cynics will just have to be content to sit this one out and bitch from the sidelines."

"reedmilder","4","1","2","6 September 2001"," Overhyped and unbearably cheesy!
","I knew Titans would not be my favorite movie of all time, but I did expect to see a solid picture.  It received favorable reviews and has received a decent rating on this site.  However, this movie is barely worth renting from the video store.<br/><br/>First off, Titans is horribly unrealistic.  This was especially disheartening, given that it is a true story.  The role of the white coach's daughter is so completely detached from reality that it is almost painful to watch her scenes.  Sadly, her scenes were not the only ones that asked far too much of the viewer (for example, the scene of the girlfriend talking to the black player on the sidelines).<br/><br/>A second criticism is that the actors did not remotely appear to be 17-18 years of age.  Granted, this is a common problem in many movies.  However, isn't it about time we expected more out of Hollywood.  The fat kid looked 35 and the white linebacker looked at least 25.  It would truly be a concept to actually hire actors who are the age of the characters.<br/><br/>This is not the worst movie I've seen, but it truly disappointed.  Sadly, there are not any really great footbal films out there, but Any Given Sunday and, believe it or not, Varsity Blues are superior efforts.  As far as race is concerned, there are innumerable films that are more interesting (To Kill a Mockingbird is my fav).  Go ahead and rent Titans for what it's worth, but for god's sake don't buy it.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"

","I've never seen a sports film where I understood the sports footage less. How are points scored in this kind of football?  Are there goals?  Are there goalposts?  (I didn't see any, but the action was all in extreme close up; I didn't see anything much.)  Does one score by simply placing the ball on the other side of one of those lines?  Must one PLACE it over the line?  Is throwing allowed?  Is kicking?  What's the difference between those who play ""offence"" and those how play ""defence""?  And as for tackling - when is it allowed, when is it forbidden?  What does it achieve, anyway?  Are there penalties for fouls?  What form do they take?  Who's winning?  How can you tell?  What the HELL is going on?<br/><br/>And you know, it's truly amazing how little my ignorance mattered.  They may as well have been playing some now lost Babylonian game - although such a game would probably be more comprehensible to the average modern viewer - for all the sense it made, but for once I didn't care.  This is the kind of film that gives slickly made, manipulative, fascist sentimentality a good name.  I loved it - even though I meant it when I said ""fascist"".  If the football camp failed to look like something Mussolini might have designed, that's just because the Italians were much more laid back.  (I suspect even the Hitler Youth were more laid back.)  But, well, you know ... there was all that stuff about crossing racial barriers, so somehow the nastier elements of the story didn't seem to matter such a great deal.  I suppose it's because the film, more than most of its kind, was willing to acknowledge the underside.  Boone got his job by unfair means.  He was brutal and arrogant.  He won the adolescents to his side by methods that could easily, in another context, have made our blood run cold.  Yet because the film made no great effort to deny any of this, or to hide it, it didn't leave the sour taste it might have.  We were free to concentrate on Boone's one redeeming virtue: he was the only character who was unracist from the very beginning.  (Actually, he's much less of an actual character than half a dozen other people in the movie - he's more a symbol, a mechanism of change.  This is just as well.  I suspect it's another reason why his virtue weighs so heavily with us.)<br/><br/>""Cool Runnings"" is a far superior Disney sports film (more humane, less mechanical), but this one somehow leaves just as warm a glow."

(Or is that football helmets?) And of course, they all live happily ever after. (Except one guy, but we can't give that one away, can we.) Based on a true story it may be.

","Remember the it exactly what you would expect from Disney, a highly watchable , feel good movie and that is not a critisism. In fact ,in my opinion Disney do not make enough movies of this ilk. Denzil Washington comes up trumps again with this film. Apart from his superb acting ability , he has a unique knack of picking great scripts, even De Niro picks his fair share of duff movies but not Denzil. Another two actors who impress in this film are Child star Hayen Panettire and Ryan Hurst. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary in this film , it is a film about winning while battling against nasty racist bigotry and is a little predictable in that respect but maybe that shows my prejudace by saying that. One question that springs to mind is Were the white Americans really this racist and if so are they still? If so , im glad i live in a country that has a good racial blend and mixes with each other without the racism of the U.S Sit back and enjoy this film , you will like it. 8 out of 10."

","This movie is nonsensical, not only the timeline doesn't match but the method to overcome racial differences is a bit shallow. Firstly, the school in real life have been racially integrated before the merging happen in 1965. White people are portrayed as the hero in this movie as they are portrayed to be the antagonist yet they resolve the conflict themselves. Although this movie seemed to support black in a glance, the black are portrayed as the weak who can only rely on white to resolve their conflict which can be seen through how Bertier (white) sacrifices himself in order for society to approve the blacks. It's ironic that some stereotypes regarding social class are still imbedded through this movie although the main objective was to discard those classes. Throughout the movie, white are shown to be prideful shown where Bertier (student) confront coach Boone (black) degrading him.<br/><br/>It's yet another cliché plot where coach Boone (black) took over coach Yoast (white) job position and fight for their place which in the end agrees to accept each other. Blacks are portrayed as dictatorial through coach Boone showing how they are thirsty for power destroying the good impression towards black. This movie also shows black as the upper social class through their clothe when they are not."

","African-American football coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is appointed head coach of a Virginian high school team. His appointment initially causes friction as he is set to replace their current coach the highly respected and decorated coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). However, his appointment has farther reaching implications when Boone insists on integrating black and white members in to his team in a school and area that are deeply hostile towards black people...<br/><br/>Remember The Titans is about as predictable as they come and it's fair to say that there are no real risks taken in the narrative (everything plays out more-or-less as you'd expect). However, it's a Disney film and its main purpose is to uplift and in this respect it achieves its goal.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is a key ingredient to the film's success; his performance here as firm, but fair coach Herman Boone was superb and some of his pep talks and speeches were very amusing. Whilst this is perhaps not Washington's best performance I would certainly put it up there as one of his best.<br/><br/>Although the narrative is predictable, Remember The Titans is a very well-directed film. It's a well-paced film whereby the first half of the film sees the majority of the team harbouring animosity towards those of the opposite skin colour whilst a slow-burning bond also starts to develop amongst them as a unit. This in itself provides for some amusing exchanges (particularly in the way some of them overcome their natural prejudices). The second half of the film focuses more on the team's gradual ascent to the top in which they ultimately play that 'final game.' By this stage they have mostly overcome their differences and begin to focus on winning the Championship. In some ways the second half isn't quite as strong as it mostly focuses on the ball games for about an hour and sadly a rinse and repeat approach is mostly used (the only thing to separate them is that there seems to be incidents created involving different players). It's all still quite good, just a little less impacting than the first half.<br/><br/>For what it is and what it does, Remember The Titans does work; it's uplifting, inspiring whilst also raising awareness on the pointlessness of bigotry and racial hatred (yes we've seen it all before, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded now and again). Remember The Titans is a message film so it's only natural that it gets a bit preachy (it does but thankfully not often and not in a way that it hurts the overall quality of the film). It's definitely worth a look particularly, if like me, you're a sucker for these type of films."

"generationofswine","10","0","1","7 July 2019"," An Honest Review
","OK, well, reading through the bad reviews there are some grudges here based on, well, how the other teams were depicted because 1971 wasn't long enough for some of the people that played them to pass on their mortal coils.<br/><br/>I can relate to that. I grew up countryfied and have tasted the salt of playing against a school that was three or four times our size, schools that could afford to cherry-pick who played. Schools where the defense could rest when the offense was on the field...apparently T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.<br/><br/>I can sympathize with some of the negative reviews here...because, honestly, if they made a movie like this about Woodstock, I'd give it 1 star out of principal. Seriously, no, we might be hicks, but we rotate from linebacker to offensive tackle. When you faced off against schools that had an actual student body, you knew you were going to lose, the only question was how hard were you going to make their victory. Sounds like T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.<br/><br/>OK, rant done.<br/><br/>I caught this on TNT and the music drew me in right away. Hear a good song it catches your ear and drags you in.<br/><br/>And this has the acting to back it up. It's very... nice seeing Washington NOT playing the smart-cop role or a variation there of. He can act, he can act well, and this is one of the movies where he's not playing the same role over and over again. So, when he comes out of that shell and gets a gig playing a role he doesn't always play... it's kind of a treat isn't it?<br/><br/>Of course the highlight was really Hayden Panettiere, not because she was absolutely adorable in the film (which she was), but more because she did a great job of turning a little girl into that parent, on the sidelines, that thinks he's Ditka, so she was not only adorable but hysterical.<br/><br/>The Hippie, Ryan Gosling?, was another little gem, not because he did a particularly good job acting, though it was fair enough. No, he stood out because anyone that's payed football knew someone like him. It gave it a bit of an authentic feel.<br/><br/>The only real downside was that, by 1971, schools were integrated and been for a while. It kind of lost that authenticity when they went that route. But, you know what, who cares, it was entertaining enough despite that.<br/><br/>It was a solid football movie.<br/><br/>And for all the 1 star reviews, particularly those written by people from the smaller schools that had to go up against the Titans... I feel for you. I remember being in that situation and I'd be bitter too if the giant school had a movie made about them that suggested they were in anyway the under-dog."

","I can't pick just one favorite scene. The entire movie as a whole was really amazing and inspirational. The plot of the movie was that football is a way of life for some people. The local school board was forced to integrate a black school and a white school. Both of the schools were really passionate about football. Having put both of the high schools together forced them to combine the football teams. Footballs great tradition was put to the test. I knew that schools were segregated, but I didn't know that school boards could force integration amongst a black and a white school. I just thought that progressively white people just started accepting and almost welcoming black people into ¨their¨ areas. I have seen many movies set in this time period. I think every movie i´ve seen regarding segregation has been an awesome movie. In the movie, the boys on the football team got along pretty quickly. I thought that was a little bit weird because usually from what i´ve learned throughout school, it was not rare for whites to be absolute jerks for no apparent reason to POCs. Boaz Yakin was the director of this movie. I wholeheartedly believe that he did a really amazing job in portraying this movie the way that he did. The way he directed the boys in getting along with one another was honestly so beautiful.
I liked how the boys got along rather quickly. I liked how the movie wasn't ALL about the boys and football. They incorporated a couple other things into the movie. I would 10/10 recommend this movie to my friends. This movie was really just amazing."

","Set during the aftermath of the Civil Rights movement, a Black man is hired to be the assistant football coach in a desegregated high school. Black students want to play football with white students, but the white students don't want the black students to play. The coach doesn't really want them to play either, but there isn't a lot he can do about that. Racism is still a large part of the everyday. Coach Boone, the colored coach, sends the boys that want to play to a boot camp and it really helps them get close as a team. All the white boys have to sit with one of the colored boys on the bus and share a dorm room with their bus buddy, there is quite the protest for the first few days and it takes Coach Boone yelling in all their faces to get them to shut up. Boone does a lot of yelling in their faces throughout the course of the movie and it is really funny to watch. The head coach hates that Boone is yelling at the boys. He thinks that it'll make the boys afraid of him. Boone tells the head coach that he doesn't care what the boys think of him. They need to learn how to work together. It isn't about black or white while they are on the field. They are just a football team there to win the game.
Coach Boone is a little mean to the players, but they need to learn that your coach can't always be your friend. It doesn't work like that. Just like your boss or your teachers can't always be your friend. They are your teacher or boss first and foremost. Not every person in your life is going to be your friend. That just isn't how life works. The team has to learn that they are a team, no matter what their skin color is.
I'm aware that there are many historical inaccuracies, but they can be easily overlooked because the overall quality of the film is superb. The daughter of the head coach is honestly my favorite character. She was doing exactly what coach Boone was doing and her father got mad at her because she wasn't the coach. She was more of a coach than her father was. Her father was only concerned about being the players' friend. He wasn't worried about being their coach. Sheryl didn't care. If she thought that the players weren't working hard enough, she'd let them have it and she gave it to them hard. Definitely not their friend. Coach Boone was very similar and after Sheryl watched him coach a few times she gave him her seal of approval. I wonder if her dad ever got that.
Overall a really well-done movie. Can't just watch it once. There is a fair amount of racially offensive language mostly directed at Boone and his colored players. One player's girlfriend dumps him because he wants to spend time with one of his colored friends instead of going to the lake and doing whatever."

"Uriah43","6","0","1","20 March 2019"," Entertaining to a Certain Degree but Historically Inaccurate
","Set during the turbulent years of the civil rights era, this film centers around a new black football coach by the name of ""Herman Boone"" (Denzel Washington) being hired to take over a high school team that was predominantly white until a court order implemented the merger with a nearby black high school. This hiring, coupled with the fact that their existing white coach named ""Bill Yoast"" (Will Patton) was highly regarded, fueled racial fears unparalleled in that particular area of Virginia which not even a winning record could totally alleviate. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although this film was entertaining to a certain degree, there were susbstantial historical inaccuracies which were rather difficult to ignore. For starters, Coach Herman Boone didn't take a team that was in extreme disarray and build it into a powerhouse by his sheer ingenuity or charisma. Far from it, as many of his own players and staff were highly critical of his coaching style which they believed was unnecessarily cruel and abusive. Likewise, there are several other blatant distortions which can easily be ascertained if the viewer chooses to do so. But all of that aside, the fact remains that Herman Boone was a very successful coach and his overall record proves that point. Additionally, most of us will never know the pressure he had to go through-especially during this particular time in history. I just wish Hollywood hadn't taken so many liberties with the truth. That being said, while it may not justify the ""based on a true story"" advertisement, it was still an enjoyable film for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

","In Remember the Titans, Herman Boone is offered a head coaching position to coach the TC Williams High School football team to help unite the African American and white players. However, Boone is threatened with losing his head coaching job to white assistant coach, Bill Yoast, if he loses a single game during the season. Remember the Titans does a great job of displaying the problems of segregation in decades prior by effectively analyzing the different characters, using various camera angles, and utilizing skilled actors.
Throughout the movie, Remember the Titans deeply explains the relationships between the main characters and their individual personalities. For example, the two coaches, Herman Boone and Bill Yoast, are very selfless characters who prioritize others over themselves. Initially, Herman Boone was going to decline the head coaching job, but after realizing the positive impact that it would have on the black community as a whole, he decides to take the job. On the other hand, during one of the games, Bill Yoast realizes that the game is rigged by the referees. As soon as he makes notice of it, Yoast threatens to report the scandal if the referees don't call the game fairly from that point. Since the team ends up winning, Yoast loses his eligibility to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, but he does it to give his players the best opportunity to win the game. At the same time, the movie closely analyzes the relationship between Julius Campbell, the African American team captain, and Gerry Bertier, the white team captain. This relationship is a symbol for the relationship between the white people and African Americans during this time period in general. Initially, the two star players did not get along with each other, but eventually they create an unbreakable bond. After Gerry gets paralyzed from a car accident during a team celebration, Julius and the rest of the team visits him in the hospital. Julius has a talk with Gerry in his room about how far the team has come from the beginning of the season and the ""brotherhood"" that they have created. Through the analysis of the four main characters, Remember the Titans is able to effectively showcase how far America has come in regards to segregation. Compared to years prior in which there were no integrated schools at all, the black and white students were now amicable with one another for the most part.
By using various angle shots in different times, Remember the Titans reinforces the concept of a team as well as the ongoing segregation. For example, towards the beginning of the movie when the camera shows Herman Boone along with the rest of the coaches, it uses a close shot featuring Boone in the center. This is important to emphasize the fact that Boone is the leader of the coaching staff and has the upmost authority. Also, in the scene where the team is just outside the bus, a long shot is taken from the area where the large white crowd is facing Herman Boone. This is used to help indicate the large white population that is against the smaller black community. The long shot displays that Herman Boone is essentially fighting the entire white population alone without the help of anyone. Occurring towards the beginning of the movie, this is crucial to show that ending segregation was a bleak option in this point in time. However towards the middle of the movie when the team has a meeting inside the gym, a long shot is used to capture the whole team gathering in the center of the gym. Displaying all the white and African American players, this shot is essential to emphasize that the team has united despite the two distinct ethnicities. In comparison to the previous example of showing that integration was a bleak option, this moment proves that ending segregation is slowly becoming in reach. The close shots and long shots are incorporated throughout the movie in various times to help emphasize certain moments or characters. These camera angles ultimately help to portray the ongoing segregation during this time period.
In Remember the Titans, the two main actors are Denzel Washington who plays Herman Boone and Will Patton who plays Bill Yoast. These two actors perfectly suit there role within the movie as they each have their own unique talents in regards to acting. Denzel Washington is a very eloquent speaker who thrives in delivering moving speeches that tend to impact the audience. As the head coach of a football team that is battling the problems that come with integration, Washington is tasked with giving many inspirational speeches to his players in hopes of uniting them. On the other hand, Will Patton comes off as a very soothing person who tends to comfort other people. As Herman Boone's assistant coach, Patton must step aside and follow the lead of the head coach. Known as a strict, demanding coach, Boone expects a lot out of his players. Thus, Will Patton is often the person who consoles all the black players. Patton's ability to effectively do this played a large role in the movie to help show how far equality has come throughout time. Having the privilege to have two very talented, well-suited actors, Remember the Titans was able to successfully convey the concept of equality and teamwork.
Overall, I thought that Remember the Titans was a great inspirational movie that included an interesting plot. Since I enjoy both watching and playing football, I thought that the concept of a football team facing the hardships of integration was a really interesting idea to emphasize the tough times of the past. Remember the Titans is a great movie for everyone to watch but more specifically for the black community as well as football fans."

","""Remember the Titans"" tells the story of a high school in Alexandria, Virginia and its football team. In 1971, coach Herman Boone is hired to coach the school's football team at T.C. Williams High School, a school integrated black and white students. Boone is faced with many obstacles throughout the season mainly the rising of racial tensions between his football players. Boone became head coach and coach Bill Yoast got the assistant coaching job. Yoast was the former head coach the year before. Yoast at first refuses to coach but his white players say they'll quit the team if he does not coach. Throughout the movie, there are great visual scenes between black and white players that ultimately reach toward the goal of ending racial conflicts and discrimination. During the season, coach Yoast is told that he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame after the Titans lose one game implying that he wants Boone fired because of his skin color. This was one of the bigger conflicts throughout the movie. During the season, Yoast sees the chairman in the stands and realizes that they've rigged the game for Yoast to get the Hall of Fame induction and Boone out of the head coaching job. The Titans have a storybook ending and go on with the season undefeated and they win the state championship as Gerry Bertier is paralyzed from the waist down watching the game from the hospital. The relationship between Gerry Bertier, a white team captain returnee, and Julius Campbell, the black leader of the team per say plays a big role in the integrating of the team and fighting through the obstacles between the races. There a lot of great scenes between the two actors but you'll have to watch the movie to find out all of these instances leading to the teams success and legacy. ""Remember the Titans"" is a great watch because of the talented acting by a few actors in the movie.
 The movie ""Remember the Titans"" is based on a true story although it has many added scenes to show the viewers a better representation of how life was during this time. Although this is not completely the true story, it's a great movie to watch. The character play by Denzel Washington as Coach Boone is award winning and eye opening. Coach Boone is faced with all kinds of different struggles throughout the movie, with his family, team, and the community. How he reacts to all of this is why it's a must watch movie. People and reviewers say that he got to play Martin Luther King Jr. And Vince Lombardi in one character in the historic movie. His dedication and drive to end the discrimination and his ideas and philosophies of a team is deeply instilled into his players, coaches and even the T.C. Williams High School community. Because of the such professional acting by the characters, it outweighs the predictable and cheesy scenes throughout the movie. Denzel Washington is known today as a talented actor and in ""Remember the Titans,"" he exemplifies that and shows that extremely well. The movie opened well in 2000 grossing over 26 million dollars in its first weekend and staying in the top five movies for six weeks straight bringing in a total of over 136 million dollars worldwide. Denzel Washington along with other actors in the movie were nominated to many things and won awards including the Best Actor Bet Award by Washington, Human Rights Award by the Political Film Society and much much more. The actors and actresses are a big role in the movies success and a awesome reason why ""Remember the Titans"" is one of the greatest if not the greatest sports movie. 
 Overall I would recommend anyone to watch this movie because of the exceptional acting of many actors including Denzel Washington.

"ztett","10","0","1","10 October 2018"," Remember the Titans Review
","Remember the Titans is a movie that focuses on the racial issues that were going on during that time and the struggles a football team had to overcome to make it to their championship game. Coach Herman (played by Denzel Washington), plays the role of the first African American coach to coach a team with mixed players. He is assisted by Coach Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who helps him as his defensive coordinator. I think this is such a strong movie because it gives us a good view on how bad these issues were during these times, and it was based on a true story on the Williams High School located in Alexandria, Virginia. Ryan Hurst (who played Gerry), was the captain of the white part of the football team. Wood Harris (who played Julius), was the captain of the black part of the football team. I think these two characters made this movie because they broke through the racial barrier and take this team to the championship. But most importantly they became best friends. In fact, towards the end of the movie they refer to each other as brothers because they grew that close to each other. Another aspect that I enjoyed so much was the music choice. The music that they put in this movie really brought out an exciting view to the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I would rate this a 10/10. I think everyone should watch this movie even if they do not like sports because this movie is so much greater than just sports. It is a very touching story of a group of black and white kids creating an unbreakable bond in the form of a football team. Or to better describe it, a family."

","All sports drama films tend to hold their worth in their ending - win or lose and this dynamic must prevail. A comparison can be made to another 'true story' film, Gridiron Gang (2006). Both films are manipulative, set against orchestral and heart strings. Both have a social message, a rah rah rhetoric, and are well produced with their hearts in the right place.
The Titans of 1971, is a little more ham-fisted and predictable; the Kilpatrick Mustangs in 1990, as reforming criminals, is less hard hitting but less pretentious. But, intolerance and corruption lingers and intimidates at every turn in Remember the Titans which is why it is bound to have broader appeal."

As Coach Yoast's fear activate through love and support from the team, I also like Yoast is honorable people who always do what is right. At first he was unwilling to accept the position of assistant coach of the name. The white players threat to boycott if the season head coach Yoast set aside his pride and accept the coaching position. Before one of the games during the season, the school board said it would resolve Yoast next game so that it can continue shooting.He is also not a racist , he always play fair with white player in his team and that was a good coach suppose to do."

It is a true story about two men who overcome their differences and help an entire town deal with frustration, anger, and mistrust. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school. In 1971 the high schools are integrated and Coach Boone is chosen to become the head coach of the football team while Coach Yoast is demoted to assistant coach.<br/><br/>This is a great film from the story, to cinematography and of coarse the acting was brilliant by their entire cast."
"holmantaylor","8","0","1","24 April 2016"," Remember the Titans:Crossing the GOAL LINE
","On April 15, 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. Twenty- four years later in, ''Remember the Titans,'' we are still fighting the very same battle. Based upon a less well-known episode in the racial history of American sports, the integration of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, it provides an awful lot of swelling from within. <br/><br/>No matter your skin color, ""Remember the Titans"" is bound to put a lump in your throat and bring out emotions that you may have never known you had. This movie is not strictly about football. ""Football teaches you to control your anger"" Denzel Washington says in the movie. ""Remember the Titans"" provides a compelling and convincing portrayal of how a single group of people, no matter their age, can unite people together. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) goes to visit Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) who had just been involved in a serious car accident. As Julius enters into Gerry's room the nurse tells him that visitation rights are for family only. Gerry's response is one that can show you the transformation throughout the movie. He responds, ""Ma'am, can't you see that's my brother?""<br/><br/>Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) meet in the beginning of the movie and Coach Yoast shares his concern that his players won't play. Coach Boone then says that the best player will play, skin color doesn't matter. Coach Yoast then responds with, ""Coach, I'm afraid that is the only thing that does matter right now."" Coach Boone and Coach Yoast do an unbelievable job of balancing the effects of racism in developing these young football players into men. They use football to teach them to control their anger on the gridiron, but most importantly, in real life. <br/><br/>One defining moment comes after Coach Boone issues a challenge for each player to get to know a player of the opposite race every single day and report to him what they learned. Julius and Gerry are undoubtedly the leaders of the team, in particularly the leaders of their race. As they accept the challenge they interact in a heart to heart conversation that could seem confrontational, but to them it was eye opening and inspirational. <br/><br/>One event stands out so clear in my mind on the maturity and impact these players have in the small town of Alexandria. Gerry and Julius were talking on the first day of school when Gerry's girlfriend, Emma Hoyt (Kate Bosworth), approaches Gerry to talk to him. Julius was trying to be kind, and gently extended his hand to greet Emma and officially meet her. She refused his handshake and just walked away, which lead to Gerry apologizing to Julius. You could easily see that this was something that Julius was used to, so there were no hard feelings. This is something that you will see occur quite frequently in this movie. <br/><br/>In the end of it all, this movie crosses more than one goal line and overcomes defeat. The Titans defy the odds and conquer defeat in the game of football, but more importantly, in the game of life."
"rmax304823","6","0","1","25 December 2015"," Football As Metaphor.
","This is a corny but still moving story of a football team becoming integrated in 1971, with the whites led by Will Patton and the blacks led by Denzel Washington. I know ""blacks"" and ""whites"" are obsolete terms but that's the way the movie pitches them.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good. Denzel Washington is always reliable and Will Patton has done some superb turns on film. He was my supporting player in one of his lesser efforts, ""Everybody Wins."" The team members vary in chops, with some better than others, but nobody torpedoes the film, not even the lovable and pathetic football player with the build of a sumo wrestler, the kid so fat he can be seen from outer space.<br/><br/>The movie more or less divides itself into two halves. I found the first half more interesting than the second. The first half deals with bringing two mutually antagonistic groups together. The second half, a moral vacuum, deals with winning the Pan-Tidewater and Okefenokee High School Championship or something, and not an opportunity to stir the rabid enthusiasm of the crowd or to milk a tear out of the audience is missed.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that the philosopher William James once described sports as ""the moral equivalent of war."" You know -- get that pent up anger out of your system in a peaceful and rule-bound manner? I don't think he'd make that argument today, not with riots so common after soccer games that England banned them, and not with a dispute over soccer -- what IS it about soccer? -- having provided a trigger for the so-called Football War between El Salvador and Guatamala. Three thousand people died.<br/><br/>I don't want to get too far off the gridiron here but let me add that Denzel Washington is the first black coach of the Titans, the high school football team, most of whose members look old enough to have been held back for four or five years. How does Washington run the team? Like Marine Corps boot camp, right out of ""Full Metal Jacket."" He's a real hard-ass. Color means nothing to him. He's pitiless. And his ruthlessness lends the story some meaning. Let me introduce some experimental evidence for that claim.<br/><br/>(1) The famous ""Robber's Cave Experiment"" by Muzafer Sheriff. Sheriff brought together two antagonistic groups of matched twelve-year-old boys, gangs that had been labeled the Eagles and the Rattlers. They hated each other. Then they were both faced with a difficult task that could only be achieved by cooperation. Sheriff called it a ""superordinate goal."" It resolved the antagonism. I'm simplifying this but it's easily Googled. And I refer you to Ronald Reagan's musing that if the earth were invaded by UFOs it would draw the disputatious nations of the world together. <br/><br/>(2) A 1959 study by Aronson and Mills that demonstrated that the tougher the initiation rite, the more group loyalty you get. By browbeating them so mercilessly Washington enhanced the solidarity of the Low-Country and Panhandle Titans, blacks and whites together. Basic training aims at the same end, and the harder the training, the greater the loyalty. Just being in the Armed Forces is not enough. You have to have your butt kicked. It's why you sometimes hear, ""Once a Marine, always a Marine,"" but never, ""Once a Coast Guardsman, always a Coast Guardsman."" <br/><br/>There's an element missing from the story, though. We see a lot of white antagonism towards blacks but very little in the way of black solidarity. Many African-Americans have built a wall around themselves and punish each other for associating too closely with white people. A hint of that reality would have turned this into an edgy adult movie instead of something that resembles a Hallmark special.<br/><br/>The direction is okay. The football scenes are exciting and every impact of shield-clad body with shield-clad body is accompanied by an explosive WHOMP on the sound track. The same effect is applied recklessly to a football pass landing in a runner's arms. The musical score is loud and signals with reasonable precision exactly what emotion is expected of you during a given scene."
"ErlendJMallberg","6","0","1","5 October 2015"," Remember the Titans – A great story, but the movie is such a cliché
","""Remember the Titans"" is a well-known film that goes under the category ""Drama, Sport and Biography"". The movie was released by The Walt Disney Company in year 2000, and was directed by Boaz Yakin. Gregory Allen Howard is the writer of a story set on a background of American football. The film cast is also starring a few famous actors such as: Denzel Washington (two times Academy Award Winner) and Ryan Gosling (Academy Award Nominated). Actually it is very fun to see Gosling in his young days playing a character that don't have much time on the screen. ""Remember the Titans"" was actually the first real movie Ryan ever starred in. <br/><br/>The film starts at a funeral around 10 years after the main action takes place. First we get a short introduction to football and the Titans from the narrator and daughter of Coach Yoast, Sheryl Yoast. After a bit we get to watch the whole story from when the team first met, until they were united. <br/><br/>When two schools in Alexandria, Virginia, together forms T.C. Williams High School in the early 1970s, black and white students have to go to the same school. The American head coach (Yoast) of the school's football team (The Titans), is also replaced by an African American coach (Boone) at the same time. Problems arrives when players of different races have to play on the same team. Many problems get eased when the Titans travel on a two-week training camp in Pennsylvania (this is the first time they get to know each other), but still there are disagreements. When the players return home, many of the citizens have turned against the state because of the race mix at the new high school. When the football season starts, the players also start accepting the facts of the changes. As the season progresses, many of the players with different skin-colours even get close friends. After the Titans win the football season as the only team with players of different races, the team and the city stands closer to each other than ever before. <br/><br/>""Remember the Titans"" is a beautiful and memorable story that really happened back in the start of 1970 in the U. S. Still it felt like Walt Disney threw a good plot away and made a ""typical Disney-movie"". Walt Disney movies are often very good family- and children movies. Unrealistic actions, conversations and happy endings often makes them a cliché. Not too many of the Disney movies are non-animated pictures, and one can understand why. Non-animated movies made by Disney is very typical, it's like you've seen them before. The picture also have some great sides. One of the positive things is Denzel Washington. Washington is one of the few actors in this movie that really acts believable. He also have what I believe is the most important role. This is because of the character he plays, which I think is the most important character to make this title a dramatic, and in some places, an exciting movie. <br/><br/>""Remember the Titans"" is for sure a great and inspiring story. On the negative side I think it is a typical Walt Disney movie with much bad acting, and unrealistic happenings and episodes that is portrayed in a bad way. I know that the main story is based on true material, but the movie also tells us that some of the characters and episodes are fictional, and dramatized inside the main plot. Positive sides are things such as the great acting delivered by Denzel Washington, which really helps to improve the movie. Another thing that I think is good described and portrayed is the friendship of Gerry and Julius. I don't think neither Ryan Hurst (Gerry) nor Wood Harris (Julius) are delivering the performances of their career, but still I think they really manage to act the drama between them becoming friends in a way that absolutely works."

With his job on the line, Coach Boone must lead his team, the only racially mixed team in the league, through an undefeated season. With the season winding down, unexpected events lead the team to form a family bond in order to overcome challenges the whole state thought would tear the team apart. Only once all the coaches began to ""trust the soul of a man rather than the look of him"" could the team fulfill their destiny.

He was totally against the idea of a combined team but at the end of the movie he loved it, and fought to keep it together. He helped team learn how to overcome their differences and play as one.

","This inspiring drama written by Gregory Allen Howard and directed by Boaz Yakin is based on the true story of a Virginia high school football team and the two coaches, one black and one white, who led them during one season to great triumphs both on and off the field. As a team, they learned to practice reverence. ""Remember the Titans"" is set in Virginia, where in 1971 high school football was everything to the people of Alexandria. But when the local school board was forced to integrate an all-black school with an all-white school, the very foundation of football's great tradition was put to the test. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a young black coach new to the community, was hired as head coach of the T.C. Williams High Titans over Bill Yoast, a white man with several years seniority, a steadfast following and a tradition of winning. As the two men learned to work together, they found they had much more than football in common. Both were men of integrity and honor, with a strong work ethic.<br/><br/>Although from vastly different backgrounds, these two coaches not only molded a group of angry, unfocused boys into a dynamic, winning team, but also helped guide them into becoming responsible young men. Their determination to work together and win brought together a town torn apart by racial prejudice and intolerance.<br/><br/>Remember the Titans shows how radical respect — or, to use the religious term, reverence — is a flinty antidote to the virus of racial hatred and bigotry. In a variety of wonderful scenes, the filmmakers show us how these black and white boys learn to respect the inner beauty of each other's souls. The sport of football(rugby) becomes a basis for racial harmony and common effort. In addition to the stirring performances by Denzel Washington(as Coach Boone) and Will Patton(as Coach Yoast) as sterling moral leaders, mention must also be made of Ryan Hurst as Bertier and Wood Harris as Big Ju, two of the better football players whose interracial friendship serves as a galvanizing example for the rest of the Titans. The extent of the racial hatred shown might hit some people a bit too hard, but having never really known the extent of the problem, I'm definitely not in a position to comment on it. A mention must also be made of the sublime music direction by Trevor Rabin, better known for his stint as the guitarist in the British progressive rock band Yes. He weaves in beautiful lines of music, intelligently composed to never sway the viewers attention while reinforcing each and every move the script writer envisioned, making this a truly complete movie."

The action gets quite tense at times, even with the knowledge that the team will probably win in the end, which is admirable.

"jmlacke","9","0","1","24 February 2015"," A moving film about football, prejudices, and change.
","Synopsis:<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Remember the Titans follows the newly integrated TC Williams High School football team through their difficult yet prideful experiences in the early 1970s. This action creates extreme outrage locally within the community. Situated in Alexandria, Virginia, racial tensions are already high and desegregation is a fresh idea during this time. Denzel Washington, playing Herman Boone, is assigned the head coaching position at the school. As the team heads off to a two-week camp, hate and disrespect towards the opposite race engulfs the players, making fights amongst them and sloppy plays on the football field a reoccurring issue. However, with the help of the white former head coach, Bill Yoast, and both of their assistant coaches, they are able to gradually put their own differences aside for the name of the game. Through a myriad of strenuous practices, and the even harder task of talking and getting to know one another, positive relationships amongst the players finally begin to develop, bringing the team together both on and off the field. Gerry Bertier, the white captain, and Julius Campnell, the colored captain, serve as a memorable example of true leadership and a blossoming and beautiful friendship. Upon the arrival back home, the town of Alexandria, and more specifically TC Williams High School, appear to be in even more turmoil over the integration. The football team's newfound chemistry and undefeated record eventually set an example for the community and constructively brings them together. No longer black versus white, but the beginning of a 'greyness' that will make history. This movie touches many in its accurate account of a not only upsetting, but also amazing time. <br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Heartrending. Superb. Eye opening. Brutal. Life changing: Remember the Titans never fails to fully amaze its viewers. The effects of this movie are not limited to a select group of people. Reaching from blacks to whites, males to females, children to adults, each and every witness to this film is enlightened and touched by it. Focusing on the football team of the freshly integrated TC Williams High School, this motion picture recounts accurate events of hate and racism, friendship and leadership, as well as success and progress within the local community of Alexandria, Virginia. <br/><br/>Racial tensions are at a frightening high in Virginia during the 1970s. When the government mandates that two schools of different races integrate into one high school, the already existing conflicts do the opposite of die down. Currently living in a time and place where discrimination is rarely an issue, it is arduous as a viewer to see the sheer odium that truly prevented people from living a hate-free, just life in this film. For example, the girlfriend of Gerry, one of the main characters and a white player on the team, refuses to shake the colored Julius' hand. A few of the players, Sunshine, a 'gay' Caucasian from California, along with two of his colored teammates, are kicked out of a bar solely because the owner refuses to serve black folks. A divided and unfair society is never a pretty one. The apparent prejudices and subsequent destruction of a community witnessed throughout this movie makes me fully aware and thankful that I live in a significantly changed time. <br/><br/>The importance of putting aside differences in color and personality traits is vital to a functioning society as well as a solid team. Although animosity fills the players, true leadership is first seem through the rising captains Julius and Gerry. They come together and realize the team cannot succeed if the white men do not have the black men's backs, and vice versa. The leadership and love for the game these two leaders exhibit critically improves the team dynamics. This cultivates into a strong brotherhood between these two boys especially off the field as well. This friendship is sure to melt the heart of any human. This kind of player and person is the most admirable of traits, one that will always be respected by all. <br/><br/>As the boys and coaches form a bond thicker than bone and stronger than steal, their football season remains undefeated. Seemingly the most difficult and impossible task at this time, joining together is thoroughly exemplified through the Titan's efforts on and off the field. Fans and opponents are stunned and some very angry about this. However, the remarkable victory rate seems to bring everyone in the community closer together and farther from their racial differences. Stemming from the TC Williams football team, the progress made between the people of Alexandria in regards to their dissimilarities, is sincerely inspiring and moving. Even just one team of players and coaches working to put prejudices behind them ignited the same goal locally, as well as sparking change in other areas and for the future. <br/><br/>Only the most powerful of movies can accurately outline historical events dealing with prejudices and malice, and watch these negatives degenerate into integrated love and respect, and lead to unforgettable accomplishments that start on a football field and lead into an entire community. Heartwarming, enlightening, and overall uplifting, Remember the Titans is a film that requires viewers to open their eyes to the unpleasant reality of prejudices, and teach life lessons that truly leave a mark on one's heart. It is not common to find a movie that truly changes you; that makes you want to be a better person and love and accept everyone. We will all be exposed to tough situations in life. However, this film shows the importance of looking over differences, being the bigger person, knowing your morals and stances on issues and stick to them, and believing that if you work hard enough, you can achieve any goal you make for yourself. Always remember this beautiful story. Remember the vital lessons taught in it. But of course, Remember the Titans."

","Yes, ""Remember the Titans"" is formulaic and yes you can probably predict where the characters will end up (no one makes a movie about the team that loses every game of the season, right?), but isn't that true for every film ""based on a true story""? It's got good performances, likable characters and mixing a sports film with a story about racism in the U.S.A. gives this enough material to keep you entertained and engaged even if you're not a huge fan of football. For families it's a definite winner, bringing to light the important issue of racism (and if you think it's not relevant today, you have not been paying attention to the news). For people that have not been victims themselves or are simply unaware of how bad it can get even today it will make them think about the issue, but it's not a movie that makes you feel guilty or bad about it. Ultimately, it's a movie about a sports team filled with underdogs, now doesn't that sound like something that would be thrilling to watch, particularly when the athletes get their game together and start winning? Adults will have probably seen movies that push the boundaries a lot more, but it's still an enjoyable film that is sure to please. (Dvd, July 18, 2012)"

","OUR OWN DEAR Old Dad, Clem Ryan (1914-74) had a saying that ""Truth is stranger than fiction."", or something very much like that. Perhaps this was not an adage of his own design; but, nonetheless, there is a lesson to be learned here.<br/><br/>IT SEEMS THAT every couple of years or so, a story taken right out of the headlines (or at least the Sports Pages) makes it to the screen. In recent years, we've seen the likes of HOOSIERS, RUDY, THE BLIND SIDE and now wee see that one will be coming out about a High School Football winning streak by a team from a De La Salle school by name.<br/><br/>IN CASTING THE role of Coach Herman Boone, the selection of Denzel Washington, the success of the film at the Box Office was virtually assured. The only question was, could he handle what is the role of a more mature individual? If so, would the movie going public buy it? <br/><br/>WE NOW KNOW that the answers are all in the affirmative, but hindsight is always 20-20.<br/><br/>ANOTHER FACTOR TO be taken into consideration is that just about any Actor relishes the chance to be cast against type and be afforded the opportunity to expand his repertoire s swell as to add to his resume. Mr. Denzel Washington did just those very things. The name of the game is acting and that's just what they want in testing their limits in expanding their characterizations.<br/><br/>WHERREAS THE STORY takes place in an earlier time, where not many Black men had opportunity to coach white kids or even in an integrated environment; of which very few even existed then. Even in the Northern urban areas, there was de facto segregation; if not by design of Law, de jurie. The story tells of the difficulties encountered by those who went first in previously uncharted waters.<br/><br/>IF THERE IS indeed a 'message' here, it's very subtle and elemental. Put simply, it's the Golden Rule of ""love your neighbor"", coupled with the notion of judging each individual on his own merit.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH WE KNOW that this is based on real life incidents, there is of necessity much embellishment of the story, in order to, make it into a coherent screen play. Our favourite bit concerned the coaches' daughters. In the story, the Black Girl is the one who has no interest in going out for sports. She prefers her dolls and is all female all the way. It is the White Girl who is a veritable 'Tom Boy' and shoot hops an knows all about other games, including her Father's football team.<br/><br/>SEE WHAT WE meant about going against typecasting, or in this case, it would be ""stereotyping."""
"mirza-faizan-baig","7","0","1","9 July 2014"," What I learned from ""Remember the titans.""
","The main theme I concluded from the movie is the ability of a sport to make a substantial difference in people's lives in a community or a team. Race is indifferent, in order to succeed one must set aside differences like race, creed and ethnicity. The main advantage of setting a specific goal in a team is that each individual sets aside trivial and minute differences and everyone meshes together under one common objective, which is achieving the set desired goal. To be a truly remarkable team, each member must have faith in the ability of his fellow members, be comfortable playing with them, be honest about how they feel and most importantly respect them for who they are and from where they are. Difficulties arise, fights happen and misunderstandings occur, but overcoming those and rising head held high, is the ultimate triumph. The staff and coaches must also have a mutual rapport among themselves; they must be willing to make sacrifices and protect their team from all sorts of animadversions. Prejudice results from lack of understanding and in order to overcome that, one must first approach and understand the life and hardships of the other, in order to possess the power to decide to become their friend or another just a passer-by."

","Disney films have a tendency to be laden with schmaltz but Remember the Titans is not overly hampered by that sickly sweetness. There are genuinely uncomfortable scenes in the first half - with pithy dialogue and plenty of confrontation. The lines and sentiments are very clearly drawn. An inspirational performance from the masterful Denzel Washington holds together what is a moving portrayal inspired by real events. Grid-iron fans should find the football scenes, where many such movies fail, reasonably convincing, and the second central relationship between Julius (Wood Harris) and Gerry (Ryan Hurst) is well handled and sensitively portrayed, every bit as convincing as the rivalry between Washington and Will Patton's characters. The second half does become a bit worthy, and sometimes clichéd, treading the same ground as the majority sports movies that have gone before, but Remember the Titans has an advantage over these in that it confronts much bigger issues. Well worth a look."

","Everywhere We Go-o, People Wanna Know-o, Who We Are-are, We are the Titans, the Mighty-Mighty Titans! This line is sung out by Titan football players as they warm up before their games in the 2000 Walt Disney drama ""Remember the Titans"". This isn't your ordinary football team however, and not just because of this song they sing. This 1971 T.C. Williams High School football team is one that is racially integrated, the only one in the surrounding Alexandria, VA area where whites and blacks get along together like oil and water. Remember the Titans is a true story about overcoming differences with tremendous acting, particularly from coaches Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) and Bill Yoast (Will Patton), leaving viewers touched and inspired by the T.C. Williams Titans.<br/><br/>1971 was a time of much desegregation in the South and it is decided that T.C. Williams High School be the home of two combined schools, one black, one white. African-American Herman Boone (Washington) is newly inserted into the head coaching role at T.C., replacing successful, long-time coach Bill Yoast (Patton), much to the dismay of the white community in Alexandria. The two are polar opposites and Coach Yoast plans to move on to other avenues but because he doesn't want to let down the community or his former players, he accepts a defensive coordinator position and the two try to band together a mixed group of opinionated young boys.<br/><br/>The conflict between the two coaches is one that is shaped brilliantly by director Jerry Bruckheimer. Throughout the movie, Yoast isn't afraid to let Boone know when he is being more of a military commander than a football coach and vice versa when Boone criticizes Yoast for coddling the African- American players. There are some intricate scenes in the movie and each coach figures out what role they need to play to deliver the best message.<br/><br/>Much of plot in the movie involves the continuous clash between the white and black players. There are multiple instances where a fight breaks out and it is easy to sense the hatred the players have for their opposite counterparts. However, near the end of the movie, All-American linebacker Gerry Burtier (Ryan Hurst) gets injured in a car crash and the only person he wants to be with is his black teammate, Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), one of the most touching parts of the entire film. Another dimension that adds a great sense of optimism to the movie is the upbeat rock music that is played whenever the Titans are on the rise including songs such as ""Spirit in the Sky"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"". Bruckheimer makes it impossible to not root for the Titans as they form a tight brotherhood and play every game with an incredible amount of heart.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is deep and inspirational, as there were multiple moments where I was left with goose bumps. Both Denzel Washington and Will Patton are at their finest and deliver sensational speeches on and off the field. Many of the Titan players have a difficult time adjusting to ""Big Bad Boone's"" dictatorial style, but as Boone inspires his players to see past the color of a man's skin, the players rally around coaches and become champions.<br/><br/>Remember the Titans is a perfect blend of drama and football. It exhibits a real life story about fighting through adversity, offering countless heartfelt moments. This movie isn't just a must see for all football fans, but for anyone who needs a feel good story to boost their spirits."
"eve-nich","10","0","1","18 February 2013"," Movie Review
","Remember the Titans is a movie that incorporates a plethora of topics, issues, and discrepancies during the time period in which it was set in. At first, the movie just looks like a typical football movie; a terrible team that comes together as the season progresses and, in the end, wins the ""big game."" You are in for a surprise if you think this movie is anything similar. Based on a true story, Boaz Yakin, the director, goes deep into racial ties and segregation, dissolving the stereotypes resulted form the Civil Rights era. Yakin does a fantastic job of demonstrating racial issues during the movie through the portrayal of his characters and the development of plot.<br/><br/>After a court order forces three schools (two white and one black) to integrate, the football team has to learn to deal with the differences in race. Not only is this difficult for the players to deal with, but the faculty and the parents are also enraged by this change. Throughout the plot of the movie, both races have to face hardships to get along and fight through tough events. After the two sides get into a heated altercation, the team takes a run to Gettysburg where the battle of Gettysburg was fought. This is the key turning point in this movie and it takes the movie to a new level. The two primary characters in the movie are Gerry and Julius. Gerry is an all-American linebacker who plays for T.C. Williams High School. Gerry is the heart and soul of the white student body of the football team. Gerry is the best player and leader of the white group. The other character, Julius, is the face of the black race and black football group. Julius and Gary must overcome the obstacle of race to bring the two sides together to disband segregation amongst the team. Both of these characters, in the end, result in being best friends. Along with these two characters, Yakin incorporates two coaches with different races, whom correlate perfectly with Gary and Julius. The white coach, Bill Yoast, was forced to give up his head coaching job due to the integrating of the schools. On the other hand, the black coach, Herman Boone was brought in and was immediately despised and loathed by the white community. Throughout the movie, both of these sets of characters have to overcome the issue of race. During training camp, the team runs to the battle of Gettysburg, where the issue of race is brought to light and emphasized in order to win. The head coach Herman Boone, who happens to be African-American, makes a speech standing in the empty field that resulted form the battle of Gettysburg. Boone's speech is extraordinary in its language, ""Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fightin' the same fight that we're still fightin' amongst ourselves todayIf we don't come together right now, then we, too, will be destroyed."" This quote, taken from the movie, is a parallel to the setting and time of the movie. Coach Boone is alluding to the Civil War and relating to how the South lost to the North. The speech is also symbolic in the movie due to the fact that he gave that speech on the battle ground of Gettysburg, the final battle of the Civil War. Remember the Titans is a movie that is made out to be great by the events of the plot and by the portrayal of the characters. Sports movies are just often times about how one team defies all obstacles and manages to win at the end. Remember the Titans does that, but it also teaches about racial uproar. The director Boaz Yakin decided to take this touchy topic and turns it into something truly inspirational."

","This was such a outstanding movie with very memorable performances. This wasn't just a true story but it also had a strong racial background and how it was back then and the changing of views. Some people might have missed the subtlety that what coach Boone (Denzel) put the kids through summer camp was similar to a boot camp. He had to put them through hell to reduce everyone to the lowest denominator of misery so that you learn the only way to stop the pain is to work together as a single unit. This is what made him successful in integrating the players. This movie illustrates well how bad racism was and how it played out on and off the field. Although there were corny moments in the movie and the actors were clearly too old, they were minimal and didn't detract from the power the film. If you are looking at this movie as just another football movie or sports movie how much better can it be than ones in the past. You will be sadly mistaken and you will find this movie to take you by surprise. The film takes place in the early 70's in Alexandria Virginia with the T.C. Williams high school. Will Patton plays the current head coach that is going to be nominated to the high school hall of fame. Then bad luck strikes and a white store owner shoots a black man he thinks has stolen from him and he is wrong. The event causes big racial tension. To try to ease racial tension Yoast gets demoted to assistant coach for the new head coach Boone (Denzel). since a black man replaces a very popular white coach the residents become very angry and players are even willing to throw away their careers and quit the team. To make sure he has the best chance of winning and integrate the white and black players, he doesn't treat either better then the other. He ends up sitting the offense and defense all on different buses black and white. During camp he makes people run a mile for almost every mistake they make. Each and every player has to sleep and get to know their racial counterpart as their homework. They all start to create a special bond and start to act more humane and mature, lacking in the residents of the town. When the team starts to win all race issues are eliminated, and true team work on and off the field is born. With this being a true story and showing the triumph of the human spirit and the positives of change make this all the more enjoyable. The supporting cast do a great job and really make you care about all the characters and what happens to them. This movie shows that when working as a team anything is possible and makes you feel sad and the situation in the past even some now are silly when it comes to racism. See this movie and you will not be disappointed."

","Remember the Titans is a racial parable with a sports premise in the foreground. This is one of the selected films that does a great job at two different things. It doesn't get too preoccupied with either, and winds up making the two flow nicely without being heavy-handed or incoherent. It has great lead actors for the coaches, great character actors for the players, and a nicely concocted, if simple, moral that ties the ribbon on the package.<br/><br/>Despite a few noticeable flaws, the high rating is because the film excels at things other sports films don't even bother touching. We'll get into that later. The film is based on the true story of Herman Boone (Washington), an African American man who becomes the head coach of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virgina, docking long time white coach Bill Yoast (Patton) to defensive coordinator.<br/><br/>It's 1971. The Civil Rights movement has recently taken place, and the blacks now have equal rights, but unequal opportunities. It's that awkward period where they have rights, but still seem like they are fighting to prove they do. The blacks, who try out for the football team, are proud to see one of their own coaching a high school. The whites are furious, yet accept that they will be playing in an integrated team, with a black head coach.<br/><br/>The town has mixed reception towards the idea. The whites are very sour and skeptical, and the blacks are overjoyed, respectively. The team soon proves themselves worthy of recognition by winning game after game, when they are put through Coach Boone's long, painful, unforgivable drills at a two week camp.<br/><br/>There are a wide variety of students on the team, as one would expect. They are religious Jerry nicknamed ""The Rev"" because he is always praying (Kirkwood), tough guy Gerry (Hurst), bad boy Julius (Harris), stocky and simple Louie (Suplee), and many others. Even a young Ryan Gosling shows up in many scenes.<br/><br/>My favorite character, by far, was Louie. Ethan Suplee has a natural screen talent for the sweet and simple type, but plays the role not as a caricature, but in a very humanistic way. That's the key word here; humanistic. One of the many things Remember the Titans gets right is that it develops its characters, and doesn't believe it will happen automatically without any amount of effort. Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard gives almost all the football players their own story to tell. Regardless of what they are, he tries, and succeeds impressively.<br/><br/>The role of Herman Boone could only be played by Denzel Washington. When you hire Washington to star in your film, you take one look at his serious face and know what you're getting. A fearless leader, that can carry a movie on his shoulders regardless of length or content, and never stumbles or trips up on anything. It is clear he learned something from working on Spike Lee's Malcolm X. In that film, he was a determined Civil Rights leader, looking to do anything for equal rights. Here, he plays a determined football coach, looking to do anything for equal opportunities on and off the field.<br/><br/>Like I said, there are some minor things that stuck out to me, more for the worse than the better. For one, the film feels a bit neutered. Sure, this is a bit pushy for a Disney film, nonetheless a PG rated Disney film, but everything feels a bit too simple. A bit too genial. Surely more abuse was caused by the townspeople rather than most happening on the field. There is never really a major conflict that isn't resolved within minutes. Also, the ending is a bit hazy. It doesn't really cement change in a very strong way. It almost makes it seem like the problem of racism and inequality depended on the outcome of a football game.<br/><br/>It is common for films involving a teacher, a coach, or a counselor, to take one or more characters ""under their wing"" to teach them greater things or to think outside the box. Yes, Boone inspires virtually the whole team, but we never see him interact with any of the team members, sincerely, one on one. He tells Louis in one scene that they'll go over his test scores, and I desperately wanted to see what those scenes could possibly unfold into, but they never came through. The man on man sentimentality lacks, but there is still plenty of motivational speeches to sweeten the pot.<br/><br/>Remember the Titans accomplishes a great deal, even if it isn't perfect. The levels it succeeds in, storytelling, characterization, and motivation, are some of the hardest to achieve greatness in, and the film appears to do if effortlessly. Washington steals every scene he is in, the football scenes are crisp and effective, and the feeling we're left with is a keen sense of optimism. For a Disney film to do all that is quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Starring: Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, Ryan Gosling, Ethan Suplee, Kate Bosworth, and Hayden Panettiere. Directed by: Boaz Yakin."
"Kevinsmith_53","8","0","1","18 December 2011"," You'll Remember the Titans After Watching this Movie
","An American classic, combining two symbols of our culture: football and Hollywood. Remember the Titans is a movie that brings a deeper message than what you find in its plot. Using T.C. William's High School in Virginia, the movie combines the dramatic effect of Hollywood and places emphasis on outstanding football performance in order to showcase how the sport of football can unite two clashing cultures and ethnicities. <br/><br/>The Hollywood aspect was used well in showcasing a problem that is still inherit in today's society, although not as widely seen as it was in the 1970's. The movie itself is about T.C. William's magical run towards a state championship, in their first year as an integrated school. The movie highlighted T.C. William's memorable moments throughout the season, including a heart-stopping championship game win. Racism was something that started off as a problem at the beginning of the movie, but with the teams run to state, very few were mad about the differences in race, as long as the school kept winning. With fights between white and black players, riots between parents and rocks thrown into the black head coach's house, the movie never shortcut how bad the situation of racism was at the time. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Denzel Washington and Will Patton did a great job playing the lead roles for this movie. Developing a strong personality towards both of the coaches really gave a feel for the movie. They work together to fight racism within their own career, as they help others move on as well. One white coach and one black coach who put aside their differences for the good of the football team made it possible for their future success as a team.<br/><br/>Personally, Remember the Titans is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. This movie combined aspects of humor, drama, and seriousness in order to convey its message pertaining to racism. I would watch this movie again as it helped me believe that sports can have a deeper meaning than just winning or losing."

","As one of the most talked about films in recent history, Remember the Titans is an engaging movie bringing drama, sports, romance, and historical race issues together in one movie. This film is set in 1971 in a formerly segregated suburban school that recently adopted the idea of integration due to federal law. With the new concept of integration, Coach Herman Boone, a black man, was hired as the head coach onto the football staff at T.C. Williams High School in place of the former head coach Bill Yoast, a white man. Anarchy engulfed the team, white players and white coaches fought this integration begging the change in position to be returned to the way it was. Coach Boone continues to push through and as the football team heads into their preseason training camp, the team finds out race means nothing when it comes to football. <br/><br/>During camp players are pushed to their limits as Coach Boone tries to bring his team together. Through a number of ""up-downs"" and lots of running and even a history lesson on the struggles in the past between the two races with a visit to a civil war battlefield, the team and coaches learn that the only thing keeping the team from being successful are themselves. Once this is realized and the team comes together, the team shocks the predominately white league. With win after win, the only thing one could expect is a state championship game. The parents and the community remain bitter towards the idea of their son playing with a ""negro"", but with because of the success of the players and their unity on and off the field they teach the coaches and even the community to remove their thousand year old hierarchy of race. With the team heading on the road to the state championship a tragedy strikes and threatens their undefeated season and possibly the very lives of members of the team.<br/><br/>The director does an amazing job with this film and really brings you into the setting of the actual events. Through the use of common wardrobe of the seventies including chucks, bell bottoms and a hang ten T-shirt and even the props such as the bus they ride in to the cars they drive in really sets you back into the carefree seventies. In scenes such as the state championship game, the director uses a foggy haze over the field that almost emulates the haze and unsettled dust of a Civil War battle trying to cross-reference the battle that the team is facing and the battle the two races faced during the Post Civil War Civil Rights Movement. The old buildings that the director used as the school and the town also added to the seventies feel of the movie. <br/><br/>If the video of the movie doesn't sell you enough to watch the movie, the nondiegetic sound will surely make you watch this movie. With the sounds of Marvin Gaye, James Taylor, Credence Clearwater Revival, The Hollies, and Norman Greenbaum, the director only adds to the movie the feeling of the seventies. Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", James Taylor's ""Fire and Rain"", and Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky"" all spent time on the Billboard Hot 100 in the number one spot and they will surely have you dancing and singing while watching this movie. Remember the Titans brought songs from the seventies to kids growing up 30 years later and this will only continue on into the future since the popularity of this movie has only continued to expand.<br/><br/>Director Boaz Yakin does a phenomenal job with this movie but it only gets better when consider the cast of the movie. With an award-winning cast of Denzel Washington as coach Boone, Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, the captain of the Titans, Will Patton as coach Yoast, and Wood Harris as Julius Campbell, the only thing that could of come from this movie is success. Denzel Washington really goes all out in this performance giving you a real feel of the emotion that was felt between blacks and whites during such a hard time. From overcoming the suppression of whites to actually learning from them, Denzel seems to easily fall into character playing a key role in setting up the emotion behind the movie. <br/><br/>Not only does this movie provide great acting, directing, and story but it also provides people today with a great message. Though race issues appear to be dwindling from the extent that they were during the time of this movie, a lot can be learned about the history of race issues and how the world has changed from 40 years ago with the help of this movie. The movie also contains a great message about humility. While Boone does have to deal with the problems of being black in a formerly segregated area, he stills manages to learn about hardships beyond race through players and other white coaches through a little bit of humility. <br/><br/>Remember the Titans was released in March of 2001 and made 20 million dollars in its opening weekend and to this date has made over 115 million dollars overall. With an income like that, this film was put up for a number of nominations including best actor, Denzel Washington, best feature film, and best screenplay. It provides an award-winning cast with an award-winning screen write resulting in a award-winning movie. It brings the problems of race in a small high school football team to answer a bigger problem between races in the real world with a compelling heartfelt story as well. This movie is sure to please any movie watcher and as far as I am concerned it is a must watch movie for all."

","Remember the Titans is a movie about a football team and its struggle through the integration of the black and white schools. The movie displays the racial tension between races in the south at that time. In the beginning of the movie the black and white players do not respect each other. The coaches have their differences as well. Through their training camps and season they realize that they have more in common than they thought. The players begin to bond and figure out that they can be great if they work as a team. There are many unfair rules that the black head coach played by Denzel Washington faces. One of these include that he will be fired if he loses a single game.<br/><br/>This movie has good acting and a strong message. There are many arguments between players or coaches that get you thinking. You're not sure which side is the correct one and in some cases they are both valid arguments. The only problem I had with the movie was the football game play scenes. They were slow passed and didn't look realistic. The plays didn't get you fired up because of their lack of intensity. Overall the movie was enjoyable to watch and left you with a good feeling about societies ability to overcome adversity."

","I thoroughly enjoyed Remember the Titans and enjoyed the theme of equality and tolerance that this movie emphasized. The film based in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971, and on the T.C. Williams' Titans football team, a local high school. The head coach of the Titans, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), who was nominated for the High School Football Coach Hall of Fame Coach of the Year. The film provides excellent background information to allow the viewer better understanding of the plot. A scene in the beginning of the movie sets the emotional stage for the rest of the movie, when a white store-owner shoots and kills a black man who he suspected of stealing. The resulting protests causes' racial tension in the city of Alexandria and that is furthered by the integration of races in T.C. Williams and effects the players of the football team as well as Coach Yoast. Coach Yoast finds that the school board has replaced him with Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) as the football teams head coach. Some would think that this is a normal part of high school football, the major conflict that both Coach Yoast and the rest of town have with Coach Boone is that he is black and Coach Yoast is white. However, Coach Boone will not allow racial tensions to split the team and during training camp and the entire season, he focuses on promoting diversity by incorporating it into the practices and making the team bunk with someone of a different race and getting to know all of the team throughout.<br/><br/>When the team wins the State Championship Game, after losing a star player and banding together to play hard, Coach Boone realizes that his team has made a difference in the community and although the racial tension is still prevalent, a greater understanding among those who are willing to see past physical differences and realize all people should be judged on who they are and not what they make look like, changes are made to make Alexandria a better place to play high school football. Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased, and the true meaning of teamwork is born. <br/><br/>The film uses great use of lighting to emphasize the emotional atmosphere during certain scenes. The single scene that, I believe, uses this most effectively is the early morning run to Gettysburg. The scene was shot with a low light to emphasize the effect of events that previously happened there. In addition, the fog that used to illustrate the magnitude of the scene was just the right amount with the lighting used. I think that any difference in the amount of fog or light would have rendered the impact of the scene less effective. <br/><br/>I think the director did an excellent job of using the sport of football along with the actors themselves to emphasize the theme of equality amongst all people and that we as a society should not judge a book by its cover but only after we have read it in its entirety."

","Remember The Titans is truly an inspirational especially because is based of a true story. I use to live in Alexandria, VA and I have always heard the story how things were there before, during, and after segregation. Some the horrible events I used to hear about would blow my mind, but when this movie debuted and I actually got to see stories of people who experienced these trials and tribulations of those struggling to be excepted regardless of their color and the battle of people trying to except those they didn't understand, thought they couldn't relate, or just plain out thought they were better then. Coach Boone and Coach Yoast both had to learn how to co-exist before they could bring the Black Student football players and the White players together, but once these young saw past the color of each other's skin, they would help their city past it too. Even though there was that one member of the team named Ray who was one of the White members of the team who just could not see past color and was eventually kicked off the team by one of his White teammates because he realized that the prejudice had to stop eventually. This movie is a great story in showing how no matter what the color of one's skin is that no one person is better than another. This movie should be required to be shown at schools once the topic of segregation is brought up in history class because it is a very diverse film and it gives a real inside look of the hardships and glory of segregation."

","First things first, this is a Disney movie, so you know a few things before the movie even start:<br/><br/><ul><li>There will be no profanity or particularly offensive remarks, (even though this is an historically accurate race relations movie). - Even if they don't win, gosh darn it will they try. - Everyone will learn a lesson and be a better person for the experience.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, it's 1971, and in attempts to ease touchy race relations two Virginian schools are integrated, by force. <br/><br/>And as a concession to the black population Coach Boon, a black coach with less experience than the white coach Yoast is given the head jo role.<br/><br/>This leads to much unrest, some garden variety rioting and a rift between the black and white students. Coach Boone, (Denzel Washington) immediately sets parameters, he will not play favourites, and insists it don't matter if you're black or white, he'll play you if you're any good.<br/><br/>Initially Coach Yoast resents the implication that he is a lesser coach, but when the white players all decide to compromise their future by sitting out the season in protest, he decides to hang around for the year in an assistant's role. Coach Boone welcomes him and allows him to coach the defensive team, while he takes the offense.<br/><br/>Training camp is pre-school year, whites are roomed with blacks, and the players are only segregated by position. This being the early 70s in the South of America, white folks bait the black guys constantly, and the black guys often take the bait.<br/><br/>(Now, this being a Disney movie, matters of race must be handled very carefully, and the latter parts of training camp are sickly sweet, with blacks and whites almost unanimously setting aside years of negative conditioning to go arm in arm. I realize that the acceptance came, just not in a two day period. This being a movie, one must accept this and move on.<br/><br/>Oh, and the white guys are almost always the instigators, they are shifty, resentful and spiteful, while the blacks are cool, suave and laid back. Just pointing out that in attempts to appear not racist sometimes the filmmakers hedge in the PC side.)<br/><br/>Anyway the team bonds and everyone is buddies, a quarterback transfer shows up with hippie hair looking a lot like a trailer trash Juliette Lewis - which in my mind is the everyday Juliette Lewis.<br/><br/>They get back home to find that America still don't understand racial unity, but they stick together anyway, and the season starts off well, until factions and selfishness begins to emerge.<br/><br/>Again being a PG learning movie this is sorted out pretty quickly, then the Rich White Guys step in, they aren't happy with the arrangement and try to rig the system so that Coach Boone can get ousted.<br/><br/>Anyway of course things go as they do in sports movies, the team gets all the way to the finals and you can work it out for yourself.<br/><br/>I learned a few more things myself by the end of the movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>Ethan Suplee, Randy from My Name is Earl was once wayyyy fatter than he has been in recent years, and he is still very fat now.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Only a Disney movie can have a ""spunky"" 9 year old girl, who calls her own Dad ""Coach"", give him the vital tip at the pointy end of the big game.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Every sports movie has many montages of two types, the ""Oh no we're losing"" montage where everything goes wrong: and the ""Oh man we can't lose"" montage were everything works.</li></ul><br/><br/>Apparently the 9 year old girl is now a fairly famous actress from Heroes, though she overacts like a mofo in this, she is rude, annoying and more opinionated than any 9 year old should be, or at least her Dad should have sorted her out. She deserves around a dozen backhanders in this one.<br/><br/>Everyone learns a lesson, black or white, people grow and mature, and bonds are made that will never be broken. I keep telling ya it's a Disney movie, what did you expect? Cue much inter-racial hugging and tears.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. I once saw that NBA player Jason Terry watches this movie 50 times a year. While I must admire the message, I think he is easily pleased.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

The supporting cast like Will Patton and Ethan Suplee were very memorable.

","Remember The Titans is a movie that I consider a classic; it's a must see! It appeals to everyone's movie preference; it has tragedy, comedy, sport, inspirational, and drama. The best part is that it is based on a true story so you can see how those events could happen now and learn more about a specific event in the past and possibly learn from that event. If you aren't someone who cares about watching a movie based on a true story this movie is still a good football movie.<br/><br/>Though it is one of my favorite movies not all of the facts are completely accurate on the other hand it wouldn't be a great movie if Hollywood hadn't exaggerated the truth some. There is one scene in particular that had nothing to do with the plot of the movie, nor was it true which is the locker room scene where Ronnie Bass kisses Gerry Bertier. I feel that the movie would still be a great movie even if that scene wasn't in it.<br/><br/>If you like movies that are based on a true story, inspirational, and that are about football then you should definitely see Remember The Titans and also check out Invincible. Invincible is based on a part of Vince Papale's life where he tries out for the Eagles football team and makes it as the underdog.

"Sandcooler","8","0","1","9 June 2010"," Worth it for Denzel Washington
","The best parts of this movie are the long motivational speeches by Denzel Washington, who plays that typical sports coach from the movies that we're just supposed to believe can actually exist somewhere (this one's even based on a real person, apparently). I wonder where they keep all those intelligent, well-spoken dream coaches, but let's move on. Apart from Washington's performance, the movie isn't particularly thrilling yet still enjoyable. It works around that old theme of hatred between black and white, unfortunately most of the characters aren't really compelling enough to focus on. Some are however, and it's also just heart-warming to see some of the ignorant rednecks growing more tolerant as time progresses. ""Remember The Titans"" isn't great cinema though, the writing just isn't smart enough for it to truly be a classic. Still pretty good though."

Also I had plenty of black friends, and I can'nt ever remember going out to eat and not seeing blacks and whites together. I was very offened by the way they portrayed our area. Other things minor. TC Williams did not play night home games. ANNADALE high school colors were red.

","What was nice about this movie, is that everybody is shown to be imperfect, Denzel Washington is too confident and extrovert, Will Patton wants to please everybody, both Bertier and Julius have to overcome certain racist tendencies, and so on. Even Denzel Washingtons daughter is portrayed as stuffy and pedantic. That is what makes it refreshing, we're not watching a bunch of Angels here, we're seeing real people. Possible exceptions: Ethan Suplee and Hayden Panatierre: ya gotta love the fat guy who uses his naiveté as a weapon and the Wise Kid, whose great value isn't that she knows so much about football, but that Panatierre delivers her lines with so much realness, she's a great actress, a shame she became visually a woman so soon.<br/><br/>This movie, I know i am supposed to feel better about this movie, but frankly, I did not feel better. It's like Brubaker in the sense that you see a movie about some bad, bad historical situation, and usually you can stomach these things by thinking 'but NOW, it's all good'. Well, like Brubaker, with the un-benefit of hindsight, we know that 20 years after, prison-life is not really improved, and we know also that race relations in America haven't really improved. Well maybe in 2000, the end of the Clinton era, there was still hope, but this here is 2006, y'all, and judging by the aftermath of Katrina, white people don't care about black people, starting from the toppest of tops down: shining example and Commander-in-Chief Bubyah! And way down to animals who thinks its necessary to drag people behind their trucks. And it looks like dubya's gonna be rewarded for it too, come November and 2008. So, while I recognize and even enjoy the occasional pockets of brotherhood and kinship between black and white displayed sometimes, in the back of my mind, while watching this flic, is always: there is still a HUGE divide! The fact that we had to wait for 2005 for a TV-series created by a black woman (Greys Anatomy), says enough and is a sign of how slow things go. Yes, there's Oprah and Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters, but also and far more importantly, there are decreasing numbers of black college students, the increasing numbers of all-white TV shows, segregation via money and bobjones university!<br/><br/>And of course I'm moved when watching this film, but, I'm very sorry, but when I see it, I can only think: Well, 35 years later, things aren't that much better, really."

The movie shows the tensions not only between the students, but also between Boone and the white coach (Will Patton).<br/><br/>I guess that the movie is OK for what it is.

The telling issue for me is that my son, who is not a football fan, also thinks that this is a great movie. That proves to me that this movie isn't really about football, but about overcoming racial bigotry and how the human spirit can be united regardless of the odds under the right conditions. This film features outstanding performances, especially from Denzel Washington and Will Patton as the black head coach and his white assistant, and wonderful performances from the boys on the 'team' also. The musical track, including the composed music and the songs selected for background music during games and at other times, adds to the power of the performances and lifts the story beyond just a sports analogy and makes it appealing to those like my own son who really don't care about football. He sat rapt, watching the story within the story of young men uniting against racial prejudice and taking an entire Southern town with them into a new age of tolerance and respect. I highly recommend this film to football fans, families looking for an uplifting and positive experience, and to those looking for a real-life example of how much better we are united as human beings than segregated as 'races'.

The ability for the cast to both know how to play the game and know how to act at the same time, creates a feel that the boys playing in the game on the screen are actually the boys who played in real life. Their ability to both act and play created a dynamic friendship between the players that helped transfer to their friendships on screen making it more than believable, it made it almost real. I believe this movie to be one of the more better made football movies in a great long while, with the exception of 'Varsity Blues'.

The town is upset by the school boards decision to let Coach Boone take over the team, because he has a different color of skin than them.

This movie lets us see how much rivalry blacks and whites had back in the 1970s. The Titans helped to show that if we just give somebody a chance it may all work out in the end. There was no black and white by the end of this movie. They were all the same, no matter who they were. This movie shows how we can overcome anything in life as long as we put our minds to it. <br/><br/>The thing that really touched me was the way these two different races were so against each other; but when it came down to a game of football, the boys could all learn to get along with one another.

I was a high school student during the time of this story and remember the daily tension as our school was forced to bus kids from inner city schools to the upper middle class schools and vice versa. In most cases, the kids adjusted well but the adults hung on selfishly to the traditional values of separate but equal. <br/><br/>I don't know of a better film that portrays the actual struggles of that time period with regard to integration of sports programs.

","Remember The Titans is about the Roanoke High School Titans of the 70's(or the 60s?).

Denzel Washington plays a coach with unfair odds stacked against him but still overcomes to coach the team to an undefeated record including the playoffs and the VA state championship, his performance is powerful and I was really moved by the Gettysburg graveyard scene which officially sparked the unity between the white players and the black players - coach Boone makes an extremely valid point in this scene. But what I really appreciated was the fact that there were two white players that didn't give a damn about the segregation to begin with(Kip Pardue and Ethan Suplee[who gives a complete opposite performance from American History X]).  The character development is present in most of the characters but I particularly noticed Ryan Gosling and Kate Bosworth who play somewhat racist characters but then realize that the black people are people just the same as them.

","A movie that has the american dream written all over, but it works anyway, and it shows what is the best thing about us, it's a strong movie, and it's gonna make you drop a lil tear, unless you're ice cold, but it sure is a winner movie and it shows how winner mentality can unite people, even in times where racism rules america.<br/><br/>And Denzel Washington, who i think we can conclude is the most unique characteristic actor in many years, he does a great job here as well, it's not as good as in Malcolm X, but that's ok, becuase that was as near to perfect as it can get, but he does a damn fine job here as well.<br/><br/>I generally think it's a pleasant movie, it has a morale, but it's more a description of what went on, the morale is the history, and i think it's good to see that people can unite even when everything and all odds are against them, it's a blast to see them unite, the movie really takes a turn, and i can not imagine how it must have been to live in such a racism environment, but i think it's wonderfull to watch how the players on the team slowly unite with each other to form the team and actually find out that they have common interests, there will always be made movies about the former racism in america, but there are some we should never forget, remember the titans!<br/><br/>7/10"

","I watched this movie 24 hours ago and am STILL thinking about it. I loved it! Yes, it was sugarcoated, the racism was over-simplified & some of the actual facts were changed, but it's a 2-hour movie & during that time it made me connect with all the characters, as well as laugh & cry & take a deep look inside myself & think about the times that I had prejudices & stereotypes & how I can become a better person. We all have room to learn & grow & this movie helps you realize that without making you feel defensive. It's definitely a `feel good' movie. Some of the messages on this web site ask ""Why so much football in this movie?"" I think it's because they were trying to show that when people have a common bond, they are more apt to get to know each other - it's human nature to want to be with someone like you. So with racism, people dislike/hate other races because they talk different, look different, eat different foods, etc. OK, I am over-simplifying this, but you get my point. Another example - 9/11. All Americans came together with a common bond - we were attacked.  Our differences as blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, etc. were gone because we had a common spirit at that moment.  Obviously this movie was on a much smaller scale & did not address an array of other deep issues, but it was just trying to show that this group of guys who first hated each other, ended up bonding through their common interest of football which helped them look past initial prejudices & become one (team or group).  When they played other schools, they were ONE - the ""Titans.""  By being forced to look past their outside differences (skin color, economical background), they realized they were basically the same inside - just wanting to play football/sports, hang out, sing/dance/music, maybe go to college....just be teenagers!! REMEMBER THE TITANS is definitely one of my favorite movies now. I love it when a movie makes you feel happy, sad & doesn't end with a total fairy-tale ending....IT MAKES YOU THINK! I can't wait to see it again! I give it a 12 out of 10!"

This film puts a great light on a time in American history, a time of struggle and a time where a few people pushed us through a dark time in our history, to make us realize the potential in everyone, regardless of their race. It makes us wonder about a time gone past and does it through great story telling, and a story of sports, of people, and over all human nature.

","At the beginning and the end of the movie (but not in between), Sheryl as an adult is narrating.  A funeral is taking place in the early 1980s. Then the movie goes back to 1971, where people in the Washington, D. C., suburb of Alexandria are rioting because a white business owner has killed a black teenager.  If that's not bad enough, two of the schools have been combined to form the city's first integrated high school and the people are very upset about that.  Coach Yoast, who has been very successful in the football program at the white school, does not like having Herman Boone, who is black, hired as an assistant coach. Unfortunately, things get worse. Coach Boone is named the head football coach because the area has no black head coaches.  The white players do not want to play for anyone except Coach Yoast.  Unfortunately, if they don't play where they are assigned, they don't play without paying a lot of money to go somewhere else. Eventually, the nearly all-black football team gets its white players back, and Coach Yoast returns as an assistant.<br/><br/>Coach Boone runs training camp like boot camp.  He expects nothing less than perfection, and he expects the players to get along despite their racial differences. Eventually, the team must return to the 'real world', where the people need lessons in tolerance.  It's an exciting football season, and the team has its ups and downs.  When I saw it, this was a 'Wonderful World of Disney' movie (with additional footage not shown in theaters or even on DVD), though not as clean as most, and you pretty much know what to expect. This movie is based on a real story, though, so you don't know exactly how the Disney formula will work in this case.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington did a wonderful job.  His character showed no fear and stood up to all obstacles that came his way. Yet he still managed to show a tender side when it was appropriate.  Hayden Panettiere gave the other standout performance, as Coach Yoast's 9-year-old daughter Sheryl, who knew almost as much as her father about football.  I thought pretty much everyone gave a good performance.  The movie was a little on the long side, and it did contain some offensive terms used by those who hate people just because of their race.  There were also a couple of suggestions of homosexuality. However, there was little violence except on the football field.  And even there, it was mostly the usual for football.<br/><br/>There was some comedy.  In addition to Sheryl's precocious behavior, there were lots of great moments where players were learning about each other. Such as when one black player was forced to listen to Buck Owens.<br/><br/>
This movie showed a football team and a town that had more than the usual obstacles to overcome, and in many ways the people in this movie showed us all that some things can be done which seem impossible."

","There are some comments about this movie that are from people who are either too young to have experienced the era, or have just never had the thought that some of this could have actually occurred.  Some small spoilers may occur in these comments.<br/><br/>I was the age of the coaches daughters in 1971, and I can remember the tension in the nation during this period of integration.  This movie captures that era - captures the feelings that were being spread at that time.  It's obvious the language was cleaned up for Disney - the brick would have said Coach N, not Coach Coon.<br/><br/>By the same token, what it does also show is how a sports team in a community can bring pride to the community, no matter what the divisions are.  It doesn't matter whether you understand football or not - the plays on the field were not the defining moments of the movie.  Simply having one of your supposed teammates let you down - and then having to re-examine your own values because of what happened - THOSE ideas are what this movie is about.<br/><br/>Denzel gives in this movie an Academy Award winning performance.  As a sports movie, this ranks up there with the pantheon of basketball movies, Hoosiers.  (If you don't get football, then don't come to Indiana and ask about basketball.  Football here is a sport - basketball is a religion.)"

","This was a seriously mediocre movie. It would be a good TV movie I guess. The direction was stupid, the screenplay incredibly predictable and clunky (esp. the first 1/2 hour!) and above it all, it was FOOTBALL FOOTBALL FOOTBALL. I just do not GET what the hell it is with football. At all.<br/><br/>
I mean, watching it, I had a lot of questions, like ""Is that guy's job being coach for a high school team? That's his job?"" Now, forgive me, I'm a Yankee, football had not so much meaning up where I grew up, so I'm totally confused. Is that normal? If so, give me a break! I've never heard of a public school coach who wasn't a teacher FIRST. So that confused me a lot. Second, all those resources. For football. Why? Everything about the set up in the movie (and yeah, I know it's a movie!) screamed ""Damn, this is a cash cow!"" It was like going to one of those palaces in German with all the gold leaf -- sure, it's pretty, but the money from it came from the people's sweat and tears. <br/><br/>On the positive side, I thought ""Sunshine,"" the gay quarterback was cool and noted that hell, overall that team had a LOT of sissies in it, which was an interesting sub-plot underlying in there.

The movie doesn't show the whole world coming together because of sports.  The town in the movie came together because they had a great football team that just so happened to be inter-racial.  It wasn't about trying to heal the world of racism, the movie shows how a team full of racists, and a team full of African-Americans can not only come together of the football field, but in life as well.  I think you should pop the dvd in your player again, and see what the movie is really talking about.  Assuming does nothing but show YOUR ignorance.<br/><br/>This movie was a very good movie.  I wasn't around back when the movie was set, but I did hear from a guy who went to that very school, the very year the movie was set, and he said the racial tension wasn't as bad as the movie suggests, but you have to look at what the movie is symbolizing.  That a town full of racist bigots can come together and support a team that is racially diverse.  I give Denzel a 25, give the guy who plays Coach Yoast a 20, and I give the rest of the film a total score of 8.5.  It does lack certain things, but this is by far one of the best, if not the best, sports films of all time."

","Remember the Titans is a film about integration of two societies - black and white - in Alexandria in the 70's. The movie shows how a newly integrated school, T.C.Williams, its new Head Coach and the Assistant Coach, and its football team change a society. In the movie you will find the ugliness of racism and how teamwork and friendship can overcome the colour of your skin(no, nothing about football). The acting's great, structure's okay but it's somewhat predictable, and is visually disappointing. If you are a football fan, don't see it, if you're a visual person, don't, but if you're anything else try it.<br/><br/>Year 1971, Alexandria, Virginia - two races of America collide with each other when a white shopkeeper shoots a black student under dubious circumstances. To satisfy the angry black population the town decides to integrate a white school and a black school together into T.C. Williams and to hire a black football coach for the school's head coach. The new Head Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is reluctant to accept the position offer and the old Head Coach (now assistant coach) Yoast(Will Patton) cannot imagine himself, the hall-of-the-fame nominee, working under a black person. However they manage to work together and try hard to train the team hard and to change the racist attitude of team members and other people in town, but they have a lot to face...<br/><br/>Characters in this movie are great. Denzel Washington skillfully plays his part as a mean - but sympathetic - heroic coach who teaches each member of the team the importance of respect and teamwork. Will Patton is excellent in his part too, and his inner conflicts - pride, success, doubts - are well shown. Coach Yoast's little daughter Cheryl may be annoying to some viewers in the first half of the film but it gets better. How many of us don't know a little girl like her? The characters are realistic, and it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>
The circular structure of the film - how it starts at a funeral, tells the story and goes back to the funeral - is used well to show continuity of the film. They could've done more than just giving the players' moustache to show that they are older, but it was a good attempt.<br/><br/>Shots - this is where the major problem comes in. Yes, we love seeing Sunshine on the close-up and Petey's feelings are better expressed this way but where's the action? The film hardly has any establishing shots or long shots, only midshots to close-ups. This makes the movie dull - even without the cameras it is obvious that the film is trying to follow the documentary format. Could've had more action in it.<br/><br/>Predictability is another major flaw - and perhaps this is why this movie attracted only a few viewers. At the first meeting Lewis Lastik kind of gave it away, even though Bertier tried to make it look menacing with his army-like pals. Also, the story primarily focuses on the white students' distress at having to deal with unwanted black students - if the storyline had some depth in it they would've shown how black students felt about being put into a place they were uncomfortable at; Gerry's girlfriend talks, where's Julius's?<br/><br/>Although 'based on true story' movies are often badly exaggerated and seem more fictional than the fictional ones, Remember the Titans is an exception. It seems real enough, and it deals with an important issue of racism, if rather superficially. A 7 / 10 ?"

","Out of all the movies I've seen, sports involved, Remember The Titans is one of the best. It was done in a very serious way, and not only uses sports, but racial issues as well. The fact that this was based on a true story adds to the emotion felt while watching it.<br/><br/>The Titans, a football team, has just been given a new head coach. A black one, played by Denzel Washington. This causes conflict, but once the boys on the team have bonded up at camp despite racial lines, they are forced to come back to school and face reality. The issues between the two coaches are interesting and audiences will find things to like and hate about both of them. In the end, this movie shows people's love for all things, not just sports; and how you can move on with new friends."

The story itself is sugar-coated and so politically-correct that it can make the more stone-stomached viewers sick.  Teamwork, that is the point.  I am happy to say that there is no stereotyping here, but the movie falls into more of a Forrest Gump category of crowd-pleasing.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is the typical good guy who is always right.  I swear, he could be on Jeopardy and beat Stephen Hawking since he's so smart.

"stomassilli","Null","0","1","20 May 2003"," An overview and brief analysis of the leadership characteristics demonstrated my the characters in the film.
","`Remember the Titans' takes place in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971.  This was a time where segregation still took place and the government was attempting to integrate society.  T.C. Williams High School was becoming an integrated school bringing together students from other schools around the area.  For this very racial divided town, most did not agree with what was happening. The students and staff were told to just make it work.<br/><br/>
Coach Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) was the schools white football coach who led the team to fifteen winning seasons.  When the decision was made to integrate the school, Coach Yoast was demoted to assistant coach and Coach Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), a black man from another school, was to take his place.  Neither Yoast nor Boone liked what was going on but both new they had a responsibility. The high school football team was comprised of two distinct groups of people that were not willing to work together as a team.  A team is all about working together to achieve a common goal and Coach Boone and Coach Yoast taught the boys how to work past racial prejudices and come together as friends and teammates.<br/><br/>As the film unfolds and the students start looking past the color of their teammates' skin, two of the boys' friendships clearly stand out.  Gerry Bertier (played by Ryan Hurst,) the white team captain, and Julius Campbell (played by Wood Harris,) a black player, form a true friendship that no one, not even a girlfriend could break apart.  Toward the end of the film Bertier gets into a very bad car accident that paralyzes him from the waist down. While in the hospital, the only person that he wanted to see was his `brother' Julius.  Bertier had once said that he would never play football with a black and here he was referring to him as his `brother.'<br/><br/>Coach Boone and Yoast had helped the students overcome and breakdown the once racial barrier of the team.  The 1971 T.C. Williams High School football team was undefeated.  For the first year as the only integrated team of the area, the coaches led their team to championships where they won.  For the Titans it was not only about winning on the field, but it was about winning the battle of racism.<br/><br/>Throughout `Remember the Titans,' many concepts/ideas from class are presented.  Motivation, teamwork, and multiculturalism are just a few of them that are portrayed through the story line.<br/><br/>Coach Boone is the teams' key motivator.  When he took the job to be the head coach for the T.C. Williams Titans High School football team, not only did he have to motivate the players to break racial barriers and work together as a team, but he also had to motivate his fellow coaches.  He came in coaching for a team that was already very good and had won championships for the past fifteen years.  Coach Boone realized how good they were and decided to take the team to camp anyway.  His purpose of camp was not solely intended to teach the kids about football, but more about how to work as a team and put racial prejudices aside.  He made the students dress alike and become acquainted with team members of the opposite race.<br/><br/>After not even a day of being at camp, two of the boys, and then the entire team, got into a fight because of their differences.  Coach Boone brought the team together and told them that they were to redirect their anger and use team effort to achieve perfection.  His goal was to bring these kids from different backgrounds together to transform them into a team. During the Titans first game of the season, Coach Boone talks with the boys before the game motivating them to work as a team.  `Don't let anything, nothing come between us.  Nothing tears us apart.  In Greek mythology, the titans were greater even than the Gods.  They ruled their universe with absolute power.  That football field out there tonight, that's out universe. Let's rule it titans.'<br/><br/>While Coach Boone was the base influence for motivation, two of the players really stood out as being the advocates of coming together and working as a team.   Gerry Bertier and Julius `Big Ju' Campbell showed their fellow teammates what it was like to surpass racial prejudices to come together. At the beginning of the movie, Bertier, the team captain, does not want blacks to be playing on his team and his attitude toward the players shows that.  In one of Bertier and Big Ju's first conversations, Big Ju says to Bertier, `attitude reflects leadership.'  This conversation was the stepping stone for them learning to respect each other both as teammates and friends.<br/><br/>Coach Boone and Coach Yoast encountered the same challenges that the players did.  They too had to overcome racial barriers and work together as a team. Both Coach Boone and Yoast and Bertier and Big Ju were the main influences of the story.<br/><br/>The entire movie deals with issues such as communication, influence, power, motivation, teamwork, conflict, problem solving, authority, responsibility, decision making, and multiculturalism.  It was a very moving film and I recommend it to everyone."

Of course, it's not a true story (it never said it was, it said it was BASED on a true story), but it felt played and tiresome.  I like moral movies that have football in them, but this was a football movie with a touch of morality in it (the same reasons The Rookie didn't really work for me and many I know, but substitute football for baseball).  *Yawn*  The real reasons I didn't enjoy this had to do with the Sunshine character and his gratuitous kiss with the captain of the football team, but I won't go much into that.  I hate when people use these reviews as podiums to voice their outrageous and unfounded opinions.

","Even though most movies about sports conclude with a victory, none makes me feel the same way as ""Remember the Titans"". It's not the goal that matters most, but how you get there, and in this movie the journey is far greater than the goal. The moral of the story is delivered in a superb way. And on top of this, Denzel Washington is doing a great performance (as always) as the new head coach, trying to overcome all obstacles.

","Being a rugby player who was too small to play football and opted for soccer in high school, I was touched and inspired by this movie.  Kudos to Disney for putting it out and not making it too saccharine.  Those that have said it was too ""clean"" miss the point.  Disney's goal is to entertain, not necessarily provide social commentary and they succeeded here.<br/><br/>
When movies based on true events move me, I look up the real story.  I was surprised to find out the movie was pretty faithful.  For those who are interested, there is a website out there put together by the '71 Titans. As is almost always the case, the truth does not always match the story, but in these cases, the fudging of facts made the movie more entertaining. Some interesting things I found out:<br/><br/>1) Ron ""Sunshine"" Bass is not ""gay"" as was implied in some other comments. He works for ABC and is married with 3 kids.  Unlike the movie, he actually beat ""Rev"" out for the starting job.<br/><br/>2) Gerry Berthier did get injured in a car crash and became a wheelchair athelete.  However his accident took place on the way to an awards dinner AFTER the championship game.  He actaully played in the game. Also the friendship between him and Julius really occurred.  What's interesting is that in the Titans website there is a picture of Berthier and unlike the movie, he wears glasses and had shoulder length hair! He died when his car was hit by a drunk driver in 1981, which is when the movie begins.<br/><br/>3) Lewis Lasik didn't transfer in from NJ but had been a student at TC Williams all 4 years<br/><br/>4) Apparently, the TC Williams team blew out their opponents in every game, including the championship.  In a USA Today article, one of the Titans says that combining two teams made the combined team exceptionally strong and they dominated their games.<br/><br/>5) Alexandria VA, is not ""red neck"" central.  TC Williams High was, and is considered one of the most diverse schools in the VA area.<br/><br/>6) The last discrepancy is a sad one.  It involves Coach Yoast's daughter Cheryl.  Sadly, she married, had 3 kids, but died a few years before the film was made.  I, for one, am glad this was NOT mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>None of these discrepancies should take away from an excellent movie that has a lot to say about brotherhood and achieving a common goal.  With all the crap that passes for ""great movies"", we need more like this one.<br/><br/>Rating: 9.5 out of 10 (the soul singing by Lasik WAS a bit corny) :)"

I am sure though that they felt the same as the Black Men do, but we were a defeated people.  Not because of wisdom or a strong back.  But for many different reasons that we all know and are afraid at times to discuss.  But the Blacks have come out on top in my opinion.

","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (`Top Gun', `Beverly Hills Cop', `The Rock', `Flashdance', `American Gigolo') is a master of bringing crowd-pleasing films to the public.  Once again, Bruckheimer hits with this inspirational human-interest story.  This script was rejected dozens of times before it found its way to Bruckheimer's desk.  He immediately saw the potential and began shopping it around until Disney picked it up.<br/><br/>It is a true story of a high school football team in 1971 during the first year of forced integration in the Virginia.  The team members are compelled to confront years of racial hatred and bigotry if they are to come together as a team and win.  To add to the tension, a black coach is installed as head coach, replacing a popular white coach with a history of having winning seasons.<br/><br/>Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) runs the team like a marine boot camp.  He forces the boys to put their prejudices aside so they can coalesce into a winning football team.  He faces obstacles within the team as well as those from the parents and the school board.  Everyone is waiting for him to fail so they can pounce on him.  He never gives them the satisfaction.<br/><br/>This is an stirring story that accurately represents the open racial hostilities of the time, especially regarding forced integration.  It gives us excellent character development of coach Boone and coach Yoast (Will Patton), as well as players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris).  Though the plot is predictable, it is such an inspirational story that it doesn't become tedious.  There are a few oversimplifications of complex issues, like when the team overcomes a lifetime of bigotry in two weeks of football camp.  However, there are also a number of memorable and emotional scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific across the board.  Denzell Washington gives the coach a very hard edge while maintaining a certain tough charisma.  Will Patton does an outstanding job portraying coach Yoast, a man stuck in the middle of forces that are ripping his life apart.  This is the best performance I've seen by Patton, who has always been a solid supporting actor.  The selection of Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst for the student leads is a bit of a stretch age wise (Hurst is 25 and looks older, and Harris is 31).  However, both actors deliver brilliant performances, supercharged with intensity on and off the field.  Eleven-year-old Hayden Panettiere is fantastic as coach Yoast's football obsessed daughter, stealing every scene in which she appears.<br/><br/>The DVD has a good deal of interesting material including interviews with the real coaches Boone and Yoast as well as player interviews.  The DTS sound on this DVD is nothing short of awesome, making the music powerful and sounds of the action on the field explosive.<br/><br/>This film is classic Bruckheimer.  It sweeps us up and gets us totally involved with the characters, while putting impediments in their way so we can root for them.  I rated it an 8/10.  For most viewers, this will be an uplifting experience."

","It's not often that you find a film, especially in the 90's, and especially coming from Hollywood or Walt Disney for that matter, that brings out an emotion and the true meaning of bonding between racial differences.Sure many filmmakers have attempted to create  highly charged films about acceptance between a white and a black man and expect the audience to be clapping by the end of it, but rarely do the movies successfully depict a story about understanding and love between two races into a unity, and rarely does a film allow the user to be buried deep into thought about the very soul of a humans' consciousness for respect, respect for oneself, respect for one another, and cherish every moment of it. 'Remember the titans' does just that. By the telling the story of a struggle of white and black highs school football players to merge as one team in a time period where racial mistrust was high,Boaz Yakin has successfully created a film, that though predictable at times, enables us all to ultimately appreciate the better qualities of the human being."

"lou-50","Null","0","1","4 December 2000"," One brief shining moment
","""Remember the Titans"" starts out with a group of people revisiting the gravesite of an old friend and then whisks us back ten years in time.  This is a film with 'formula' written all over it, from the team that wins against all odds, to the bigger than life Coach Boone (skillfullly played by Denzel Washington) who rules with an iron hand, to the tragic accident before the big game, and finally to the hero who comes off the bench.  Yet, ""Remember the Titans"" excels at the very things that 'Coach' would expect - great acting and a memorable story.  At the heart of this film are human beings trying to figure out how to live with each other - be it getting a team together to win, finding the courage to follow one's convictions, or doing what is morally right rather than following the crowd. The only blemish is that the film glorifies the mistaken obsession, as prevalent today as ever, that in high school sports winning is everything and losing is not an option.  There are many poignant scenes, two that are particularly revealing involve the little girl, Sheryl, (well acted by Hayden Panettiere) once when she is sobbing in a lonely grandstand with her father Coach Yoast (in a strong performance by Will Patton) after he has told her he will not be elected to the Hall of Fame because he could not allow the officials to corrupt his game, and the second when she stares down at her father to swallow his pride if he wants to win the game.  ""Remember the Titans"" spends a lot of  focusing on the moment.  Black and white players forced to interview each other about their families, two white 'outsider' players who blend in so naturally with their black teammates even as the white players are floored by what they see, the stern warning Coach Boone gives to his fellow coach not to cuddle the black player lest they become crippled to deal with real life situations.  Because the film deals with the moment, it is disappointing that few of the participants become bigger stars after their unbelievable triumph including the two coaches who never eclipse their particular glory.  Uplifting, inspiring, healing are all appropriate words for ""Remember the Titans"", a film that freezes a golden moment in a Virginia town for all of us to savor."

","As Bruckheimer films go, this was something that was a stretch from his usual ""Action Packed/Cinematographer friendly"" film formula. The usual dose of ""eye candy"" was evident in some of the slow motion scenes, but it didn't rule over the film. What did was the strong emotion each scene garnered from the audience. Washington is his usual self, putting on a wonderful performance as Coach Boone, and after several years in the film industry Will Patton is finally getting the parts that make his ""villainous-bit-part"" past a distant memory (i.e. ""The Postman""). Trevor Rabin scores the perfect music to the scenes that need it - action and emotion alike. Some of the actors were fitting to play the parts of the players... Wood Harris as Julian finally broke into the big time with his role as a team leader along with Ryan Hearst as Bertier, neither will see any starring roles in the near future, but both should see scripts coming their way for supporting roles. This motion picture allows the audience to run the full spectrum of emotions (a very seldom occurence with any Bruckheimer produced film), but Boaz Yakim shines in this presentation of a Remember the Titans - don't get comfortable Boaz I still remember your other films: The Rookie, The Punisher and most recently From Dusk 'Til Dawn 2... you need to create some more quality pictures before I nominate you for a Best Director Academy Award.

And to be truthful, it's not like *that much* has changed in 30 years.  There's still a lesson to be learned here and movies such as these are as helpful as any hard-edged, ""face the facts, God-damnit"" type of flick.<br/><br/>This may all seem too simplistic for those who hate football, but there really is a purity when football is played at this level.  There aren't many other places where this sort of *coming together* could happen.

This scene also happens to be the scene right before the fate of Gerry. I was oblivious to what was going to happen when we went to see it again, and I totally lost it when this certain fate happens. I left the theatre feeling betrayed, but incredible touched. It took me 24 hours to love this movie after seeing it. The characters in this movie are perfect. The two main football guys, Gerry and Julius, are heart touching, in fact, every single football player on the team is lovable (especially the dude who is loved the stupid music and danced a lot). The young Yoast girl was hilarious, and should be hooked up in a movie with H.J. Osment. Coach Yoast and Couch Boone were awesome, the way they looked at each other was even incredible. I was amazed at how brave Gerry was after his disability, he truly was a champion. Here I am praising the characters, but it was the ACTORS who made these characters.

Boone, not only has to contend with the divisiveness of the local community, but with the job of creating a black and white team that will work together to play and win on the football field.  Washington's Knute Rockne-like orations to the teens are surprisingly straightforward and sincerely delivered. During a boot camp training period he gradually gets the boys to jell as a team and, more surprisingly as friends and equals off the field. In particular, a speech to the boys on the grounds of the Gettysburg cemetery is particularly moving. This carries over to the high school population in general when the team comes home, and helps the community at large deal with integration. Performances are top notch all around. Fine use is made of period music and the expanse of the wide screen. Even wise use of surround sound brings the audience right into the thick of the battles on the gridiron. Best of all, the film is rated PG. As beautifully written by Gregory Allen Howard, use of coarse language is at an absolute minimum, and it doesn't adversely affect the film one bit. All in all, this is so far the best of the fall releases; one the whole family can see and enjoy."

","Remember the Titans, despite some cheesy Disney lines at the outset, is truly an uplifting film.  Although it is not technically or thematically special, it is just a great film with a great story.  A true feel-good movie, which all of us need sometime.  Denzel Washington is also exceptional as the football coach who becomes responsible for uniting a high school football team and its home town despite initial racial tensions.  What makes this film a notable one though is the mere fact that the story it depicts is a true one."

","Of course this is a feel-good movie, and a very well-done one, at that. But this is a movie that I have been urging friends and coworkers to take their children (ages 8 & up) to see. Though race relations in this country are far from ideal, it's important for youngsters to see how much worse it was just a few decades ago. Hated *can* be overcome, and children must see that they can stop it."

","SPOILER: This movie was worth missing sunday football just for the football alone, and my team won that day. The entire cast is fantastic. You will root for them through the whole movie. I know I'll be going to see this a second time. Very moving, and a real butt kicker, just watching gets you yelling at the coaches. I hope to see more of these guys."

","Greetings again from the dark!  ""Remember the Titans"" caught me a little by surprise.  The Disney name and previews did not prepare me for the predominant theme of racism throughout the story.  Because of this, I cannot proclaim this movie to be the first really great 'football movie'.  However, it is a well-made movie loosely based on 1971 racial tension at a high school campus.  Denzel, as usual, dominates his scenes with an in-your-face, holier-than-thou acting style.  The role seems to have been written for him. Only in a Disney movie could you deal with school integration and not once hear the N-word. There are scenes that bring a touch of reality to this film, but most attempts are pretty lame.  The movie is very well paced and beautifully filmed.  Director Boaz Yakin shows flashes of being the real thing.  I am looking forward to his next outing.  Will Patton again shows that he is truly one of the best character actors working in Hollywood today.  Three other actors jumped off the screen.  Ryan Hurst, as Bertier, has the look and presence of a young Russell Crowe.  Child Soap Opera star, Hayden Panettiere, steals her scenes as the young football expert.  A little polishing and she could develop into a true film star.  Kip Pardue, as Sunshine, may be the prettiest actor since Robert Redford in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".  Hopefully he will accept roles that don't alienate us male viewers.  Translated: be a good actor that happens to look great. Overall, I think this movie could be a nice, low-key introduction for kids into what the struggles of racism entailed, as the message is delivered within the confines of feel-good football story."

","Naturally, any movie that I rate an 8, I liked. It was an excellent story about racial tensions within the world of high school sports in the early 1970's - a period I can identify with since I graduated HS in 1971.<br/><br/>The movie was a tightly crafted retelling of a true story that took place in Virginia. As with all ""true"" stories, you have to wonder how much of it was embellished to make it more marketable.<br/><br/>Actually, I do not believe some things happened the way they showed. I wouldn't have bought them even if it was fiction, so I certainly can't buy them as nonfiction. And, they did detract enough to lower my rating from about 8 1/2 to 7 1/2. Interestingly, in either case, I would have given it an 8 - so in that respect, it was irrelevant except to the enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>I had just seen another football movie - Any Given Sunday, so I was thrilled to see a decent football movie after that fiasco. But, as football movies go, the best I have ever seen is Rudy."
"Special-K88","Null","0","1","6 May 2002"," an uplifting film
","Triumphant, feel-good film set in 1971 centers around tough, opinionated football coach Washington who's brought in to replace local coach and town hero Patton at a newly integrated Virginia high school. In order to succeed and overcome the town's heated resentment, the two must put aside their differences and unite to lead their team to victory. Conventional elements in the script are heavily upgraded thanks to remarkable performances from the young cast, and rock solid performances from Patton and Washington. Warm, moving film, based on a true story, rides to glory highlighting elements of humor, prejudice, and human spirit. Definitely one to remember. ***"

","Oh how rare it is to find an inspirational movie such as this.  Something people don't make anymore.  This will have you welling up with tears of joy at seeing white/black people getting together for the better.  I loved it when the kids got together.  This is a must watch for anyone who is having a bad day and needs some cheering up. :)<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10"
"stamper","8","0","1","8 June 2001"," Another good Bruckheimer
","Jerry Bruckheimer is commonly known to make films with big explosions and a lot of actions, but he also knows how to make a good thematic film, which he has shown us by making for example Dangerous Minds. This is yet another one of those great films, which have a thematic element and good actors to deliver a message to people and I think that the biggest achievement in making this film is, not to glorify it too much or to Â‘Americanize' it with big emotions (like Armageddon). Well done.<br/><br/>

"mcfly-31","Null","0","1","20 May 2001"," tries to be too cute
","Forget the fact that this is billed as a racial underdog drama, and focus on the real plot:  play oldies every 3 minutes and have big, bad football players sometimes sing these oldies every 5.  Ugh, got old real quick.  How many friggin' times do you expect to be able to fall back on the same damn thing and not end up in the desperation category?  Here, let's try and look cute by throwing in a bunch of dancing and singing.  What is this, sports movie or musical?  And as far as the sports element, aggrevating as well. Washington, in his most unlikable role ever, works to death a team of high school pigskin kids.  He quickly turns into a jerk, and I didn't care what happened to him or his team.  And the constant, constant, CONSTANT in-fighting between the black and white players.  Such tired, tired, tired scenes, and it's gosh damn endless!  And of course the team kicks butt and Denzel is looked at as a Godsend...enough.  The performances are decent enough (how the hell did journeyman Patton get a 2nd billed role in a film?!) but this predictable, cutesy fluff has been overpraised.  And it's based on a true story?  Doesn't make it any better.  One smile I got from it was from the title.  Made for a good joke: ""Remember the Titans""?  What is that, a film about condoms?"
