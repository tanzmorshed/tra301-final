","WHY? It did not have to be romantic. The first end was more beautiful. Why did not it end? If it was so, I gave it 9 points. Apart from that, it was a pleasant film that was exciting. The show was clearly the best film. Entering new characters was also nice.<br/><br/>Serie Total Review: My favorite character was Rosalie. Most do not even know the character. Bella was a really absurd character. The writer did not really do this job. It is in Jacob.
Edward character was a simple, stereotypical lover character. There was no feature. It was unsuccessful.
Generally the characters sucked. I did not know any characters."
"icecaralee","10","171","186","3 September 2018"," great adaptation of the book
","People are weirdly bitter about this saga. It's a great adaptation of the book. The whole series of movies does a good job. Some of these reviews are from people who've not even seen the other films let alone read the books. These movies are for the book fans. They are cast perfectly; the acting is exactly what it should be, overdramatized and slightly disjointed but perfectly in tune with the awkward Bella, hot tempered Jacob and out of his element Edward. Even the poorly animated baby still goes with the book. It's not meant to look like a real baby. People are just taking these movies way to seriously for what they are; young adult fantasy movies made for fans of a book series."

","Even though I loved the movies, there were some really awkward moments in the first one. I'm glad that was cleared up. I only rated this 9 stars bc it's my least favorite of them all. I hate that Edward leaves. I've watched all of the Twilight movies at least 15 times a piece. When it comes to this one, I basically fast-forward through the entire middle/Jacob parts, and to the end when Edward comes back. Jacob (as an actor) doesn't show the same chemistry that Edward does with Bella, and it made me despise the middle 60 minutes. Lol"
"prahasta_samiaji","10","131","143","16 December 2012"," Truly epic finale!
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the best in the Twilight Saga series. Below is my personal list sorted from the best: (1) Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2) Eclipse (3) Twilight (4) New Moon (5) Breaking Dawn Part 1<br/><br/>Some remarkable things from my observation (spoiler alert!!! stop reading here if you don't want spoiler!): <br/><br/><ul><li>Great fighting scenes. Final fight against the Volturi is simply cool. There is tension development before the fight until the very end of the fight. The fight scenes themselves could have been better as not all vampire's special powers have been used in the battle for example Benjamin should have utilized more his power to control elements, Alec should have attacked from long distance to deprive the senses of the Cullen's &amp; allies, there should have been Felix vs Emmet. In other words, it would be perfect to see some strategies being deployed to win the battle (not just ""randomly"" attacking the opponents). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Epic Finale! Why epic finale? In the movie, the audiences are given fighting scenes and this is a must for action lovers (without this, I myself would have been disappointed). On the other hand, we also want to see happy ending. It is not happy ending to see Jasper died, Carlisle died, etc. And that is why they don't actually die :) ...This is truly the beauty of the ending but I know for sure that some people cannot see it that way (according to them, had the fight scenes been real it would have been perfect!). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great plot development. Starting from Bella being a new vampire (learning to control herself from human blood, being the strongest in the house, learning to pretend to be human, etc). And then it continues to develop as Reneesme is reported as immortal child. The cullen's try to gather witnesses from other vampire clans and along the way the practice their special powers for the battle.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Vampire Bella looks beautiful in this movie. Last but not least, vampire Kate is awesome!</li></ul><br/><br/>I am planning to buy the DVD so that I can watch the movie again and again :)"
"aquaticsea","10","136","149","28 November 2012"," Out of all the series, this one was the best.
","I'm not a twilight fan, but I loved the ending to this movie. Out of all the series, this one was the best. <br/><br/>Bella is new and improved as a vampire after childbirth killed her mortality. And although her union with Edward was fully accepted amongst the vampire community, their new baby Renesmee (a composite name of Renee, Bella's mother, and Esme, Edward's ""mother"") wasn't so lucky. After a false accusation, the new family is in grave trouble with the powerful Volturi who only happen to be the largest vampire regime. Even still, the Cullen's are prepared to use their special gifts against anyone who threatens their family.<br/><br/>There are certain details of this film that one has to accept in order to appreciate it. First, aside from the vampires' requisite to drink blood, the Twilight saga movies focuses on the majestic viewpoint of vampires rather than their dark side. And, when assessing the situation in that way, it might make it easier to digest that teenage Bella was literally dying to be a vampire in order to be with Edward, unbeknownst to her parents and only has to loose her soul to do it. Furthermore, even with Bella and Edward being married, there's no way around the fact that Twilight glorifies teenage pregnancy.<br/><br/>If these details can be accepted or moved past for the sake of fiction, this film is awesome! I've seen the previous films in the Twilight saga and I thought they were captivating at times but I've never been impressed this much. For starters, it continues to evolve the intense Romeo and Juliet type romance, with a twist. However, the writing in Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 seems to be the best yet. I found myself laughing out loud. The storyline is more witty, interesting, cleverly done and the action scenes are completely unexpected.<br/><br/>Even the actors gave better performances. The highlight performances for me were from the beautiful Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan. Not only did she give a believable performance as an incredibly strong vampire in such a tiny frame, but she made it funny and fascinating to watch. Also giving an always reputable performance was Michael Sheen, who plays Aro, one of the three leaders of the Volturi. There's something about his malicious depiction that is so grimy, yet you'll love to loath him! Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, was funnier than I ever remember him being. Taylor Lautner, whose character is Jacob, gives another vigorous performance and the other wicked actor that amplifies inhumanity is Dakota Fanning.<br/><br/>I saw this movie surrounded by a packed theater of energetic Twilight fans. It was almost as equally entertaining to watch the film as it was to be amongst the energy of the crowd for Team Edward vs. Team Jacob. And especially all the boisterous fans who were anti- Volturi. Of course the second Jacob took off his shirt, girls in the audience went bananas. Aro and his crew got an equal amount of rowdy boos.<br/><br/>Regarding the topic of appropriateness for young impressionable teens, this film warrants at the least a conversation to your youngsters on issues like intense sexual content, violent murder and teen defiance.<br/><br/>Overall, if you've never seen any of the Twilight saga films, this is the one to see. If you're a fan already you will be blown away with how this final movie goes out with a blast. Go see Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2; it's worthy! Surprisingly, one of my favorite films this year!"
"hollywitch71","8","119","130","27 November 2012"," Twilight Saga Finally Hits Its Stride-- In The Final Film.
","I was really psyched for this final film in the Twilight Saga. The first Breaking Dawn did a fine job of setting up the finale, though having read the books, I was a little curious as to how some elements would play on screen. (WARNING: Spoilers from here on out.) On the page, the final confrontation with the Volturi was only exciting on a psychological level, as it's essentially just a bunch of random vampires standing around in the snow. However, the film does action fans a solid by capturing the content of what Alice shows Aro will happen if he does not alter his plans. This in itself makes for a compelling, tight sequence that will leave fans of the books screaming ""NO! That didn't happen!"" Haha, turns out they're right, but it's some cool special effects porn nonetheless. A LOT of heads get twisted off, vamps and dire wolves (oops, wrong franchise– werewolves) display their unique fighting abilities in excess, and the very elements get drawn into the fray. It's an FX maven's dream.<br/><br/>However, there's a lot of movie between the moment newborn vampire Bella opens her now-red eyes and this big-budget (and entirely manufactured) confrontation, and it's a bit of a mixed bag. Where the film shines is in its depiction of Bella's adjustment to her new way of life, and Kristen Stewart has never appeared to be more comfortable in Bella's skin as she does now. I am not sure if this is the difference between Human Bella and Vampire Bella so much as Stewart at last having fun stuff to do on screen, which admittedly there's been little of in the past films. In the first film, Bella didn't do much, besides bite her lip a lot and nearly get (passively) killed a couple of times. In New Moon, she rode some motorcycles and tried to (passively) kill herself a couple of times. In Eclipse, she got to punch Jacob (Taylor Lautner) but spent most of the movie being protected from this and that, and in the first Breaking Dawn she got married, had a baby, and sorta died. But none of this looked particularly fun to play, in the way that portraying Bella as a vampire looks fun. Stewart looks to be actually enjoying herself, no matter what Bella is doing this time around. The lip-biting thing seems to be over, replaced by a real smile. Bella, in becoming a fantastical creature, has never seemed more realistic.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without its flaws. The passage-of-time voice-over Bella delivers feels painfully contrived, and the absence of Ashley Greene's Alice from most of the proceedings, though storyline- dictated, leaves a big hole in the Cullen family dynamic. (I could say the same for Jackson Rathbone as Jasper, but he has been criminally underused on screen throughout the series anyway. TEAM JASPER!) All the Volturi, with the exception of Dakota Fanning's Jane, and a few of the Cullens' vampire allies are overacted (though this is lamp-shaded somewhat when Jacob notes to Bella that the Transylvanian vampires are ""creepy"" and has a big laugh about it). But for all of this, the movie gets more right than it flubs. Bella's delight in her newfound abilities is a joy to watch, as she takes down mountain lions, beats Emmett (Kellan Lutz) at arm-wrestling, and flings werewolves around like stuffed toys. There are difficulties in how she adjusts to her condition– her craving for human blood, as seen when she and Edward (Robert Pattinson) accidentally encounter the mountain climber, frightens her; no less challenging is how she copes with keeping her father, Charlie, in her ""new"" life while being unable to tell him the whole story (as usual, Billy Burke's Charlie gets some funny lines), and the very natural rage she feels when she learns Jacob has imprinted on her baby daughter. Bella's motherhood feels believable despite her young age and her daughter's rapid growth. Mackenzie Foy is charming and ethereal as Renesmee, whose very existence, through a misunderstanding, elicits the wrath of the Volturi, and who has a special ability of her own. And of course, since at its core The Twilight Saga is Bella's and Edward's love story, there's some tastefully presented sex, handled less awkwardly than in the first Breaking Dawn. <br/><br/>Overall, the film was a satisfying ending for the franchise, which finally came into its own with this installment. It's been a long trip, but the series saved the best for last. And for those suffering a withdrawal from movies based upon the works of Stephenie Meyer, this spring we have the film version of The Host to look forward to. Completely different universe and characters, but the first trailer looks good. So cheer up, fans! The SeriouslyFluffy Final Grade: A-"
"kidzmail1","10","138","152","19 November 2012"," great movie
","I originally expected the movie to have some of the basics of the book except at the have a fight instead of then talking it out. But I was pleasantly surprised when is showed a Combination of the two. I also liked how it used some of the music that was in the first one it brought back a lot of good memories of watching the series and reading it. I liked how when bella showed her thoughts to Edward and it flashed back through out the movies how she fell in love with him. It honestly brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me of why I fell in love with twilight in the first place. During the fight I was pumped and ready for the volturi to get their ass kicked and it made me angry when they killed some of the Cullen's. But cool thing was with Alice when it all turned out to be a vision. I still think its sick and perverted that Jacob is like in love with renesmee even if its a wolf thing it is still creepy. I do liked how the credits not only showed the breaking dawn cast buy the whole series cast. The directing was great and the whole movie was beautiful to me. I would definitely go see it again. I cant wait to get it on DVD. I still don't like Kristen Stewart as a person or an actress. But overall the cast acting was pretty good."

","I'm a guy and I watched this movie finally while I was randomly scrolling through channels on the TV.
I had read the books a long time back, and didn't think I could watch the movie as it would mean going through the heartbreak of seeing a series end.
But boy, these guys have presented it so beautifully!
10/10 from me, a fan of the books."
"spec-4","10","150","166","8 March 2013"," Oh, it's so hip to not like Twilight, aren't we cool?
","That's right, I gave the thing a 10 because I fully enjoyed it. Call me someone who enjoys movies - someone who enjoys leaving reality for a bit - someone who's well being doesn't depend on every thing coming together perfectly in a movie as I critique every stupid piece of dialog and scene. The only conclusion I can come to is that it's so fashionable to hate this movie that people not only feel the need to write review after review stroking each other's egos about how couth they are by not liking the movie at all, but seem to aspire to disliking it as if the mere thought that they might like it would get them banned from Mensa. Congratulations, you're all so cultured it makes the rest of us want to puke. The final scene was fantastic - what can I say. I heard one reviewer claim that the fact (spoiler ahead) it was a vision was a disappointment. WHAT!? I was so relieved that Carlisle was not dead!! Also another reviewer says something about the actors being emotionless. Hey! That's there characters! They're Vampires - that's the bit! Any way - if you take yourself too seriously, if you have a bug firmly lodged up your backside, and you're not secure enough with your masculinity in the first place then you probably won' enjoy any of theses movies. Better stick to trying to find more ways to looks manly like growing a goatee, shaving your head, and buying a pickup truck."
"kez0","10","139","154","16 November 2012"," Could Not Have Been a Better Ending
","Yes, I am giving this movie a 10/10, and not just because I am a fan. Here's the reason it deserved the ranking: <br/><br/>This movie was completely astounding as the end to a series of movies and books. As a Twihard, I was completely satisfied, and then some. <br/><br/>This movie, which is heads and tails above the others in the saga, had many laughs, romance, drama, heart racing action, and even some sweet nostalgia (I teared up at the end, realizing that this was the last Twilight movie I would see on the big screen). <br/><br/>The cast, which has been so criticized for the past movies, was incredible. You could tell that the actors really knew and understood their character and were very comfortable portraying them. Very little to no awkward pauses, dialogue was easy and not forced sounding, and no cringe-worthy lines. As I said before, the story was perfect. <br/><br/>The theater buff in me was also awed. The settings and landscapes shown were absolutely gorgeous. The costumes, although modern, fit the characters so well and aided in the story line. If you followed the other movies, you can tell how the clothing changed with the plot, thus adding to the story visually). Yes, some parts of the CGI and other computer animated elements were a bit cheesy (not as bad as I was expecting based off of some of the trailers), but overall they were very well done. Also, I picked up a lot of makeup tips because there were many closeups. <br/><br/>****SPOILER**** I saw the movie a couple of hours ago, and I am still shaking. For the one scene (and anyone who watched the movie will know which one I am talking about), was I the only one who almost needed to have my heart restarted?? ****END OF SPOILER****<br/><br/>This movie will NOT disappoint those who follow the Twilight Saga! Perfect ending to a history-making story!"

","Although this was not my favorite movie of the Twilight Saga (New Moon was!), I loved it. Far better than Breaking Dawn Part 1, it offered complete satisfaction with the culmination of the saga. I sat in the theater enthralled with the movie, enjoying every moment of it. It was fun to watch Bella the vampire and Bella the new mom. I finally grew to appreciate Jacob and his connection to Bella. I actually cried at one pivotal point in the movie and was sad when Breaking Dawn Part 2 was over. No more Twilight movies! I will re-read the books and have my own Twilight Saga marathon. I was not disappointed and don't believe any true 'Twihard' could possibly be. Cudos to the entire cast and crew for giving the viewers what they wanted in this movie!"
"kgurg1","10","132","146","27 November 2012"," a spin on the horror genre
","Over time, movie viewers have had different views on what components a movie needs to actually be a horror movie. Buckets of blood, monsters, and gore are always among the top favorites for horror movie viewers. However, a recent film takes these elements and changes what a movie needs to be a horror film. While many twi-hards, or twilight fans, disagree with the fact that The Twilight Saga does in fact fully fit under the horror genre, the elements in the movie, while not always shown to the extreme, make the saga into a successful group of horror movies. From the werewolves that show up through the movies to the vampires and the blood that comes along with them, The Twilight Saga tries not to scare its viewers, but incorporate a bit of horror into this romance/thriller movie. Jacob signs the packs up to fight against the Volturi after Alice has a vision of them coming to kill the Cullen family and Renesmee. They want to kill Renesmee because she appears to be an ""immortal"" child or a child who was bitten, not born, and cannot control their hunger. After imprinting on her, Jacob needs to do everything in his power to protect Bella's daughter, therefore travels the world with the Cullens to find witnesses to prove Renesmee was born; then he signs the wolves up to fight against the Volturi when they come to kill. There is a graphic flight seen between the Cullens, their family, friends, the wolf packs, and the dreaded Volturi. This seen involves heads being ripped off left and right, adding to the horror factor because you never know who is next to die and the scare factor of watching someone's head get ripped off their body. The Volturi come for Edward and Bella's daughter, Renesmee, when they believe she is an immortal child, bitten and not born. The Cullen's relatives and the wolf packs stand up against the Volturi, causing them to flee the situation and protecting Renesmee."
"jspattzfan","10","124","137","26 November 2012"," I loved this film
","Unlike so many of the other reviewers, I loved this movie. I enjoyed the books(although I realize that they are not great literature) and I feel that Bill Condon did an excellent job with some difficult material. There is a lot of action, a twist at the end(which I did not feel ruined the film as a few others do) and a nostalgic finish.It's a good companion piece to Breaking Dawn 1. The actors continued to make the most of their roles- by this film they were family.The fact that it (and the others) have made so much money attests to the fact that some people do like it, and they are not all teenage girls. So count me as a Twihard who loves the story and the way it was portrayed. It's a classic love story that resonated with a lot of people. It wasn't meant to be ""War and Peace"", guys."

"bettyboop_fan","10","190","217","17 November 2012"," With All These Bad Reviews...Did You See The Movie?
","I like this board for the idea that you can give your opinion on movies. However, what I see a lot aren't reviews by Twilight lovers, but haters. I am questioning whether they have even seen the movie? Our theater was packed and the reaction was nothing but positive at the midnight showing. <br/><br/>As the computer technology has improved, so have the CGI wolves. They have come a long way in the last four years. They were believable characters in this movie. The whole concept of a baby with teeth was most likely why the baby looked like the E-Trade baby. You don't expect a newborn baby to have a full set of choppers. However, this film was the perfect amount of action and romance. This is exactly what fans needed. I can see why they needed to make this into two movies. <br/><br/>Since this was a continuation of the last movie, I can see why some people may not know what is going on. These are characters most of us have grown to love over the last 4 years. You are expected to know these characters without a lot of flashback. The actors as well as characters have matured over these years. Kristen Stewart showed both emotional and growth in her acting abilities. If they would have kept Katherine Hardwick, I am not sure the series could have progressed the way it did. <br/><br/>The only thing I wish they would have spent more time on is Bella's change. In the book, she isn't allowed to see Renesmee and has a longer transition period. Also in the book, the Bella/Charlie meeting takes is longer. The twist ending had everyone in our theater gasping. The battle scene was awesome and they did a nice job casting the the other tribes. The pace of the film was good also. I didn't once want to get out of my seat, although my seat was horrible uncomfortable. <br/><br/>I thought this was a great ending to the series. As a true fan of both the movies and books, I left the theater overall satisfied. It is a great thing Stephanie Meyer became an producer on her own vision. She was able to give input on the characters. <br/><br/>This is a must see for ""Twilight"" lovers."
"junkstuff-12","9","122","138","17 November 2012"," Redemption
","This was the best movie of the series since twilight itself. Clearly people who have not read the books are at somewhat of a disadvantage, but if you watched the series from beginning to Breaking Dawn Part I, then I would definitely not miss this one. It is obvious that Lionsgate's influence on this movie had a positive result and I wish that influence extended to the others, because of Summit's former 'make it cheap' attitude. The books deserved better, because the movies focused more on character relationships and less on an important theme from the books which was you can choose to be a predator, or not and the results of those choices. For me, bringing the books to life was very fun and being an old person, a nice diversion. If you haven't seen the prior movies, or read the books, then I'd skip the movie as it won't make much sense. (Hence a prior review comparing it to X-men. Really?!?!) Otherwise I think it tied in twilight's original feel and look, which made it best movie since twilight. I will be going back again to watch in in theater and buying the DVD."

","This will only be a short review, summarising all of the key points in this fantastic movie.<br/><br/>As this is not only Blockbuster but Twilight its in its own different league from the millions maybe billions of fans. I went into this movie with very high hopes and it truly indeed delivered, i can't fault one thing. It has every ingredient of a blockbuster however the ingredients are used to make one master gore-may dinner.<br/><br/>Every part of the film was fantastically used, from the intense action scenes, to even the moving soundtrack that gave that extra edge that was needed. The movie starts straight from the first part which is a important role in my opinion. the action scenes were intense, i was sat in awe because of the films intensity and beautiful landscapes that were used. The actors again filled the roles exquisitely, it was like they were Tailored to play the characters. <br/><br/>I rated this film a 10 because i couldn't find one floor with the film, however i did watch this movie in 2D so i have no opinion on the IMAX screenings. I do have to say that if you do wish to see this film, it would be worth the money for the IMAX its not a disappointment."
"nicolebrown16","10","202","234","18 November 2012"," Going out with a bang
","I always read the books before I see the movies. I just prefer to have sort of idea of what I am getting myself into. I loved the Twilight Saga. The books were very well written and enjoyable for any age. Then the first movie came out. I agree with anyone who complains about Kristen Stewart's acting. She IS terrible. She acts like she is trying to force everything out of her mouth. The acting from everyone in the first couple of movies was pretty blah. Come Eclipse and Breaking Dawn 1, things were getting better, with the exception of Kristen.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I had been told that they had pretty much re-written 1/3 of the book, but as is tradition for me, I had my ticket for the 10pm showing on 11/15. I was in love with the movie. Even Kristen Stewart had improved with her looks and acting. She still wasn't great with her acting, but it was better than before.<br/><br/>The casting was great. However, the character of Alistair wasn't how the book portrayed him and that was disappointing. Lee Pace as Garrett is by far my favorite casting. Talk about Hort!!! McKenzie Foy playing Renesmee was so great. She is a beautiful, talented little girl and has a very bright future ahead of her.<br/><br/>Now, I will admit, I was ready to walk out of the movie when the fight scene started. The moment Carlisle was killed, I wanted to run. I couldn't believe that they had changed the book that much. That was going overboard. In the back of my mind though, I had a feeling that it was all a ruse.<br/><br/>The director sure did a fantastic job sending the saga out with a bang. I have already seen it twice and can't wait to see it again and again and again."

","Hello, Hello all, I'm here with another movie review. This time I'm covering the latest in the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, and I hope to shed some light on the final episode of the series. Now you've seen plenty of debate in this series with many hating everything about this series, while others think it's the best vampire series to ever exist. With all the bias towards this series, it may be hard to determine whether this movie is worth spending time in the theater or should just be blown off. Let's see if I can shed some light on the subject.<br/><br/>With last year's rather over-hyped prequel, I'll admit I wasn't looking forward to the second installment of Breaking Dawn. Although the trailers showed some interesting direction, I had my doubts that they could actually do something to extend the last few pages of the book. However, the directing team was able to accomplish their goal, in what may be the most impressive movie yet to hit the series. Just what makes this movie so great though. My first strength was the dialog. While most of the movies lines are overemotional, lovey dovey, one dimensional quotes from the book that made me roll my eyes, this one was a little different. I found this installment to have more balance still sticking to some of the classic lines, but throwing in some well-timed comedy. The insults and banter between Jacob and the vampires were quite entertaining to the audience and me, and I thought some of the extra characters even had some funny moments with the parts they played. Charlie (Billy Burke) in particular had me laughing the most, with his awkward comedy and real facial gestures combining to be very funny. Aside from the comedy, the movie did have some good dialog play on other parts, particularly when it involved making plans involving the Cullen's battle against all odds. Of course being Twilight, this movie also had its share of romantic dialog, many being lines quote from the book, which should comfort die-hard fans of the series. While some of the romance was captured in these mooshy quotes, some of it still made me laugh or roll my eyes at the cheesiness that still remains. <br/><br/>Aside from the dialog what else was good about this movie? I guess my next biggest thing is the balance this movie has. While this Twilight still has that romantic feel that will have fans crying awe, this film had other things to keep the movie going. For one thing there was some suspense to the movie, as all the behind the scenes of the book were brought to life on screen. The Vultori's movements, the attempt to control hunger, and even the training scenes were all well shot to keep the suspense building. Between these scenes, fans are certain to enjoy the love dynamic not only between Edward and Bella (which includes a seven minute love scene), but spread amongst the other members of the family, especially Renessmee. I felt that there was actually a family dynamic between the Cullen's this time instead of them all just being in the same room and just hugging each other's mate and giving that Abercrombie and Fitch smolder. Throw in the extra vampire's backstory and loyalty, and well you have quite a story builder that keeps the movie going forward much faster than the other films. Yet there was still another dynamic thrown into the mix that helped bring this movie to a full circle, the action. Now many reviews and commercials are going to say it's the most action packed, which is true, however don't think this means its Cullen slam fest 2012. Most of the 105 minutes stays true to the romantic soup I previously mentioned, but there are a few scenes of fast running and fighting thrown in to pick up the pace. However, the action to mention is the battle at the end, which takes up ten minutes of the film and has plenty of impressive moves that impressed me, and some simple punches that didn't. While the fight is impressive, there are some things that needed some work to make it better, the biggest being some rather spastic camera work during the fight.<br/><br/>Still not impressed with the movie? I have a few other points to cover that might change your mind. The soundtrack for this movie was rather good, with many of the musical scores fitting the scenes' emotions perfectly. As for the acting, well it has somewhat improved, but still remains the same model poster, cardboard acting that has made the series famous. Kristen Stewart continues showing her unemotional acting skills off delivering most of her lines in that awkward monotone way, and fails in her attempts to be angry, which is rather funny. However, most people going in know the acting isn't the best, but go for the looks of the characters. Yes, my fans there are still plenty of hot body scenes to go around, as both Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are still present. Unfortunately for you girls, Lautner keeps his tight shirts on for most of the movie so you might be disappointed in that aspect. Guys , you're not out of the loop on this one though, as the new vampires not only bring guys, but a few beautiful girls as well, especially the blonde cousins. <br/><br/>Breaking Dawn 2 finally has the balance the series has needed and wrapped up the series impressively. Although the acting, editing, and dialog still need some tightening up, most of the mistakes from the previous films have been corrected or improved upon. My opinion is to catch this movie in theaters as it is worth a second trip for me, but definitely hit it up on Netflix. My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5 Series: 9.5 Contact me at rkarim11@su.edu for more discussion or constructive criticism."

","Don't care what the critics say, this is for the fans. I was overwhelmed, it was so moving to me and I'm glad I went to see the movie alone so I didn't have to explain or be distracted(like I did last year when my sister took me to see Breaking Dawn Part I) from one glorious moment. For me it did not disappoint! The movie was meant to be entertaining, pure escapism and it accomplished that. The movie was true to the book(s) and I've read them all. Great cinematography, just beautiful locations, Director Bill Conte is incredible. It's amazing given the storyline and subject matter that this series doesn't have to resort to the gratuitous gore factor. For the record I'm Team Jacob."
"PlatinumRosebud","9","182","227","14 November 2012"," Entertaining...
","Whew! I just finished watching an advanced screening of Breaking Dawn Part 2 and I must say, the second half of the series' final installment is better than the first. Director Bill Condon knew what the audience crave and gave it to them. Jaw dropping scenes (especially for Twihard fans) will keep you glued and might stop you from reaching for that popcorn. Let's just say that some Twihards in the cinema with me was shocked and some even cried as the latter part of the movie unfold then, BAM! The presentation of the baby Renesmee in my own opinion is necessary so as to be consistent with how the girl looks later in the film. Just watch it and be entertained. I enjoyed my evening watching it with some newfound Twihard friends. :)"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","250","322","15 November 2012"," A satisfying conclusion...
","After the movie's opening credits (the use of red, black & white, combined with the images we see, are so artfully done/very beautiful) we pick up right where we left off - on new vampire Bella's red eyes. While Part 1 may have been slow to get going for some, Part 2 wastes no time getting into the important stuff, like Bella learning to control her strength/bloodlust as a newborn. Then there's the rather amusing scene where Jacob breaks the news to her that he imprinted on Renesmee (Bella's initial reaction will satisfy those with similar concerns about what 'imprinting' is/means, but she eventually comes around to understanding what it actually means). After we get past the creepy CGI infant version of Renesmee (it tries its hardest to look real, but still looks freaky), we thankfully move onto fine little actress Mackenzie Foy playing the role. Charlie gets brought in on a 'need to know' basis, and before too long everyone's in danger when the Volturi are under the impression that Renesmee's an immortal child (a big no-no) thanks to Irina.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart does some of her best work in this film, I think. Everything's been leading to her getting to play Bella as a vampire, and she's more than up to the task. She looks/acts very different, including mannerisms - she sells both that and the animal nature Bella's now fighting against. The movie goes to lengths to show what being a newborn is like for her. She & Edward are on more equal footing now, gone is the imbalance between them. She also seems happier than she ever was as a human. She's not the only one. Edward smiles I think more than we've ever seen previously. It's such a relief for him that his easily breakable Bella is now strong and confident. Pattinson also gets to have more fun in his role than we've seen in a while. The two are perfectly matched. I was happy the Cullens got a bit more focus. Their characters/family dynamic has always been interesting to me. I liked seeing Rosalie's lighter side, Emmett challenging Bella to an arm wrestle, and Alice playing a major part in the conclusion of the film (as well as kicking some major butt - which all Alice fans should be glad to see). All the actors are great. Those who might've seemed unusual choices in the beginning have *become* their characters, and I can't imagine anyone else in their roles.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner finally gets to play Jacob free of his Bella obsession. A great weight has been lifted, and now his role is that of protector towards young Renesmee (we get a vision of her grown-up too, which is when they'll eventually become more). Jacob proves how much more likable he is when he's not lusting after Bella and can get along with Edward (their dynamic is so good). Charlie, the father who you can't help but feel sorry for, does what he does best: makes you laugh & tugs at your heartstrings, thanks in no small part to Billy Burke (such perfect casting). Given what he goes through/learns in this movie, Charlie should be up for a Best Dad Ever Award. The Quileutes don't get much to do in human form (they kick Volturi arse in wolf form, though). The new characters introduced are the different vampire covens. Some are more memorable than others, but all get their moments. I especially liked getting to know the Denali Clan more after their brief appearance in Part 1. Tanya & Kate are more developed, and we even see the start of a relationship form between Kate and new addition, Garrett. The training scene, as they all hone their abilities for battle, is especially good. The big development is Bella learning of her 'shield' that can block other vampires' abilities.<br/><br/>If you don't know about how this film differs in the climactic confrontation scene to that of the book, then you're in for a hell of a surprise. If you have heard/read about it...then you're still likely to be quite shocked. Those who read the book & were dissatisfied with the lack of any actual *fight* will be pleased with the mother of all vampire battles we get to see play out here. There are major casualties on both sides. Unexpected or not, it's heart-pounding stuff. There were more than a few gasps in my theatre. If, however, you feel an actual fight was unnecessary, then rest assured the book has not been drastically altered just to meet the demands for more action. It's not so much a 'change' that's been made, but rather just filling in the blanks (ie. what was mentioned in the book but never seen). The films have always done this really well. Inevitably, things are bound to be left out in all book-to-film adaptations. But the Twilight Saga has always been pretty good at hitting the majority of main/important points from each book (including dialogue). Not everything you may want may make it in, but the films have ensured the essence of the story remains intact.<br/><br/>The music throughout, as always, is exceptional. The movie soundtracks have never failed to fit the films perfectly. They're always the right songs for the right moments. Director Bill Condon shows he was more than up to the task of tackling this tricky two-parter. It looks exquisite. The direction has obviously been made with care and love for the source material and its fans. You need look no further than the film's closing credits (which give everyone of all the movies their due, even ones not present in this film). The inclusion of actual pages of the book was a nice touch. I'll greatly miss these characters who I've enjoyed seeing brought to life for five films now. For those who appreciated the books, the films and the actors involved, this should be a satisfying conclusion for you. I know it was for me."
"menotseen28","8","15","20","6 December 2012"," The best in the series of ""Sparkle"" Vampires
","I wish that they had done this when they started and not given us a terribly slow movie to begin with on this series. This movie had it all from showing how strong Bella is, showing the baby and her growth even though she was really creepy looking as a child because of CGI. This movie with the best twist ending that I have seen to date was the only thing that I could focus on while I was sick. I even tried to fall asleep during it and couldn't. Most movies I do have to fall asleep through and watch later. It was nice to see all end well and basically know that its over now. I really love how the final moments are,showing them laying in the field of flowers. This is not the best series of movies by far but they did an amazing job with the last movie, if you haven't seen it yet definitely give it a watch."
"eelin-lim","7","18","25","20 November 2012"," It really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was actually fine
","To be quite honest, this final installment of Twilight was not as bad as most people have made it to be. The only kicker is that you need to know some background story. If you're a guy following your girl to the cinema because of obligations, chances are you're going to not get this movie and will likely give it a very bad review. But if you would just play along with the plot, listen to your girlfriend for info and accept the supernatural aspect of the story, you might just enjoy it. Just sayin' guys. Don't be hatin' just for the sake of hatin'.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought Breaking Dawn Part 2 did the Twilight series justice. It was a great finale, and dare I say, surprising good too? It was.<br/><br/>I was a bit worried after watching the trailers that they may have somehow made this into boom-boom-bam movie filled with action scenes to please the I-need-insta-gratification crowd. But no. It was very true to the book, despite the proclaimed twist. It was, really, a very clever representation of the story from a different perspective. Bill Condon did an excellent job. And I am also glad that the Twilight Saga is finally over. Phew."
"LeahJayne","7","21","30","15 November 2012"," Fans of the series will not be disappointed
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 is easily the best film in the series. Although if you're not a fan of the series, I guess that's not saying much. I personally enjoyed it very much. Part 2 introduces a lot of new characters, including Renesmee played by a very talented Mackenzie Foy. She is well-suited to the part, conveying a grown-up maturity inside a child's body. I liked Jacob the most in this film. Now that he's finally over his obsession with Bella, it's like a weight has been lifted from him. It was nice to see him finally get his happy ending. Edward and Bella are also at their best in this film. The dynamic between them is the most like how it is in the books. Bella is finally the strong, confident vampire she was always intended to be, and she and Edward are now free to be together without restraint. You can see Edward's relief that he no longer has to be so careful with his once very breakable human love.<br/><br/>As for the big twist at the end, I knew almost immediately what they were up to, and I have to say it was pretty clever and certainly dramatically effective. I loved the reaction in my theatre. Even though I knew what was happening, it was still shocking and I gasped out loud a few times.<br/><br/>I loved the ending. It wrapped up everything nicely, and included a flash forward to when Renesmee is full grown. The very last scene with Edward and Bella in the meadow is probably the sweetest moment in the series. I actually found myself choking up a bit, which I was not expecting. When Bella removes her shield, there's a lovely montage of memories from her mind. This was one of my favourite moments from the books because Edward can finally see what Bella has known all along. I liked the inclusion of words from the book.<br/><br/>The credits, or curtain call as I call it, was a nice touch. I thought it was a great way to close the film, including all of the characters even the ones who didn't feature in this one.<br/><br/>Well, that's it. It's done. Kind of bittersweet for fans of the series. If you haven't been a fan by this point, this film is not going to convert you. But if you are a fan, go see it. You won't be disappointed."
"eriador-3","8","16","24","3 December 2012"," Cozy and comforting
","I can imagine a lot of people discarding the Twilight movie series as teenage werewolf crap. Indeed, one needs to be strong to swallow wish-wash like ""Oh no, he has just imprinted on my baby!"". It is also unwise to try to find implausibilities such as how it is possible that plain humans don't know about the vampire's existence. But if you can look past the vampire and werewolf bullshit, you will find a truly great movie. Because apart from these complaints, all other aspects are simply marvelous: great acting, beautiful visuals, nice special effects and some exciting action scenes. And what really sets Twilight apart from other beautiful movies are the cozy one-big-happy-family feeling and the comforting we're-on-top-of-the-world atmosphere, amplified by the great soundtrack and the beautiful woody environment. I wish more movies would breathe so much happiness, friendship and warmth.<br/><br/>True: as this is the fifth part in the series it is more of the same, but it is very well done all the same. I feel like the series grew on me. Maybe it is because the makers have fine-tuned their work, or maybe it is just that I became immune to the vampire nonsense. Nonetheless I think this was the best part in the series and I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone."
"music_maniac0102","7","17","26","17 November 2012"," Love Letter to Fans
","The final movie is a love letter to fans. If you're a fan, you will be quite happy, and a little sad too. Of course, the movie only touches the surface on the storyline, but the entertainment value is still there. It's the perfect end to the franchise. It's truly Bella's movie. Her emergence into being a vampire fun to watch, but only if you know the details from the book. The baby is a little off putting; the CGI is clunky for her like it was in the beginning for the wolves, who now are seamless and better done than ever. No it won't win any awards, but it was the best attempt at trying to bring a book to life that inexplicably touched people in ways they couldn't fathom. Nicely done."

"misterkevinoh","6","16","27","16 November 2012"," Not A Twilight Fan- Still Enjoyed It
","Now look, I'm no Twilight fan. I watched the first movie and forgot it after an hour. I talked to some Twilight fans in the theaters to fill me in on what the movie was going to be about. I came in with prior knowledge of what imprinting was, what Bella's daughter was like, all the good stuff. From what I understood, this movie was basically The Deathly Hallows Part 2(a terrible movie by the way). My thoughts were, ""Oh no! Not another fan service movie with no soul!"" I sat down and awaited the eventual sleep that would take me out of the boredom I would experience from such a bland movie. <br/><br/>BOY was I wrong. This movie was FUN. It had a quick pace (which I think was by accident), fast editing (again, I don't think they intended such a blatantly quick movie), and absolutely ridiculous situations. Now I am of the belief that you can make anything stupid look really cool. This movie took that idea and made them look really funny. Bella jumping up and biting a cougar on the neck? That is hilarious to me. The audience thought so too because they erupted in laughter, and it seemed to me that this was a theater full of Twilight fans (it was the showing before the midnight premiere... I know, that doesn't really make sense). Were we making fun of the movie? No! We were all just having a good time. The movie can be really funny sometimes and thats OK. Its a movie that I felt understood the criticisms around it and just ran with it. This movie was 2 hours long, but it felt like 1! If any movie does that for you, that is an impressive feat. <br/><br/>The audience was such a big part in making this such a fun experience. There was so much laughter and enjoyment that it made everything feel as though it were a part of a bigger event. It felt like I was sitting in a room with a bunch of good friends who were enjoying this movie with me. And it wasn't jerk laughter that was disrespectful to the movie and it's fans, it was the sort of laughter that just sparked out of people just having fun. I haven't seen a single movie in theaters that did that this year, so kudos to you Twilight. <br/><br/>Now, the actual movie, was it good? Well... it's definitively something. There are definitely redeeming factors of it that make the movie interesting, but in the end, it feels like giant B-Movie without blood. It just does things that I feel only films that understand they're going to be ridiculous or terrible will do. Kristen Stewart continues to disappoint me with her acting (Snow White would have been a much better movie if she wasn't in it), the characters don't really make sense to me other then the fact that they just want to be beautiful and sleep with each other all the time, and the way it was filmed was just... horrible. I don't remember if the first movie looked so bad, but man, what the hell did they do here? It looks like they shot the entire movie against a green screen with my friend's low-end DSLR. I absolutely can't stand it when a movie looks like it was shot on video. Skyfall was partially (or wholly, not really sure) shot on video and it looks drop-dead gorgeous. And the script... OH the script... That oracle, the one who can tell the future is THE worst storytelling tool in the world. She absolutely takes the drama out of EVERYTHING. And drama is the most important tool a movie has! Don't trick me into feeling sad when a character dies only to find it was vision. Don't tell me what happens down along the line with Jacob and Whatever-Her-Name-Was. Don't tell me... don't tell me stuff I don't need to know! Now look, I don't think death is necessary in every story (a la Dark Knight Rises) to make it good. But this movie uses it as an emotional adrenaline and give the audience both the battle they've been waiting for AND the happy ending that they want. It's... after all... a business. <br/><br/>But hey, in the end, I needed to just sit and enjoy it with the people I was watching with. It's by no means the best movie ever, and it's debatable whether it's a good movie at all. But this movie is bigger than itself for all the people who love this series, and I was glad I could have shared in an experience that they thoroughly enjoyed and thought was really good. Because hey, who's to say it wasn't?"
"markdroulston","6","31","59","17 November 2012"," Terrific awfulness
","It's with a hint of sadness that the Twilight franchise has come to an end. Sure, they're terrible, terrible films (and books I assume), the popularity of which paints a sorry picture of the tastes of today's youth, but now that all is said and done, on reflection it was worth enduring the first three insufferable disasters (Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse) to get to the unbridled mayhem of Breaking Dawn (my thoughts on part one can be found here).<br/><br/>After seeing part one, it was difficult to see where the story had left to go. We had seen the unending wedding of Edward and Bella, the banal South American honeymoon, the shocking and genuinely upsetting pregnancy/birth, and the werewolf falling in love with the baby. It seemed like an appropriate place to end it, but Summit and Stephenie Meyer obviously had other ideas, hence we have Breaking Dawn, part 2.<br/><br/>While perhaps not as off-the-leash nutty, Breaking Dawn, part 2 maintains a lot of the weirdness of the preceding chapter. Picking up exactly at the point where part one ended, Bella (Kristen Stewart) finds herself having to adjust to her 'newborn' vampire status, learning to control her superhuman strength and fighting the urge to hunt humans. Edward (Robert Pattinson) begins to assume a mentor role, but for whatever reason Bella learns so quickly that the learning plot is pretty much dropped.<br/><br/>Here's the first and biggest of the many problems of Breaking Dawn, part 2. For at least the first two thirds of the film, plot threads and characters are introduced with enough fanfare to make one think they're going to be important cogs in the larger machinery of the story, only to be forgotten or abandoned with zero explanation. Perhaps it's fan service, and people familiar with the novels will be able to link things up, but for newcomers it becomes increasingly hard to keep track of who everyone is, why they're involved, and what on earth is happening from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>The character of Alistair (Joe Anderson) is a good example. Following the development that the Volturi, the ruling council of vampires last seen in New Moon, are coming after Edward and Bella's daughter Renesmee, the Cullen clan assemble a team of vampires from across the globe to defend the child, the last of which is the enigmatic Alistair. Yet after an introduction to suggest he will be a character of some importance he merely ends up lurking in the background, and popping into one random and pointless scene with Bella. He's always there, but doesn't actually do anything significant.<br/><br/>It's this scattered and overloaded approach that really damages an already abysmal film. On top of the lack of charisma in the stars, the questionable storytelling is a real hindrance for anyone set on enjoying Breaking Dawn, part 2 at all, not to mention how simply ugly the thing is. There's an over-reliance on terrible green-screen work, shoddy visual effects, and whatever lunatic decided that an almost completely CG Renesmee was a good idea needs to be removed from the business of movie making.<br/><br/>However, much like the last film, a part of me loved Breaking Dawn, part 2. As I said, it may not seem as insane as part one, but in some ways that's a good thing. I loved part one because I was caught completely off guard by the madness, but was appalled by it because much of the content really shouldn't be part of a film made for pre-teen girls. Part two dials back the more troubling aspects of the previous film and just revels in the stupidity of Meyer's writing. It's weird as hell, but really pretty harmless, aside from all the decapitation. Oh boy, there's a lot of decapitation.<br/><br/>Director Bill Condon and his cast seem to be having a lot more fun here. The most ridiculous thing about the first three films in the series is how unwaveringly serious they are, but with both parts of Breaking Dawn, it feels like Condon and Pattinson in particular are winking at that portion of the audience who, like myself, are simply there to see how off the reservation this daft franchise can go. It manages to achieve a delicate and kind of wonderful balance of satisfying the true fans (the Twi-hards) with its creepy romantic melodrama, while clearly acknowledging the bizarre and quite frankly awful story Meyer has crafted. The awareness of this final chapter is perhaps its greatest asset, and if you're willing to abandon all logic and actual critical appreciation, then Breaking Dawn, part 2 delivers a great time at the cinema.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"Matt_Layden","5","136","338","20 November 2012"," The Best & Worst Twilight.
","This is the first time I sat in a theatre to watch a Twilight movie. I think the theatre experience maybe helped me enjoy the film more than I should have. Nevertheless, Breaking Dawn Part II is not only the best entry in the franchise, it's also the worst. How can that be? For a good 20 minutes, the film tries to be daring and does something different. Yet it is all undone by playing it safe and ruining what came before it. <br/><br/>I have to stress that yes, this film did NOT have to be broken up into two. The first film was an hour and a half of filler, followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness. This entry is an hour and a half of build-up, followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness X10, followed by the worst decision the series has ever made to date.<br/><br/>I have seen every Twilight movie, I'm not a fan, nor am I a hater. I'm always objective when it comes to these movies. The highest rating I've given one of them is a 5, that went to Eclipse. Breaking Dawn Part II could have easily gotten a 7 from me, had they had the balls to go through with what we were witnessing. A twist so inane, that it actually made me boo at the screen. I don't think I've ever booed at any movie in the theatre before, so congratulations Breaking Dawn Part II, you achieved something. <br/><br/>Now, that awesomeness that I was speaking of, it is indeed awesome. I was cheering, I was laughing, I was having a blast. The people around me, I'm assuming fans, were gasping at the carnage they were witnessing. I had a giant smile on my face. Did the creators finally take the series in a bold direction? Did they finally have the balls to do something different? Yes, they did, but then they ruin it. I can't stress how awful that made me feel.<br/><br/>K-Stew, finally has something to do other than swoon over Edward, resist the urges from Jacob and act like a whiny teenager. She is a vampire, so she has to learn to be one, although it seems she has no problem with the thirst and heightened senses. There is no struggle for her, which makes this whole aspect a bit shallow. Jacob, unfortunately has nothing to do in this entry other than glare at everyone who comes near Renesmee. So the character shifts his focus from one girl to the next, nothing more for him to do, yawn. <br/><br/>Speaking of Renesmee (stupid name), we have what is probably one of the creepiest babies to ever grace the silver screen. Why they chose to use CGI for the face of the baby, other than using a normal one is beyond me. It looks unnatural and comical. The movement doesn't flow and for some reason they decide to keep this CGI face with the kid as she grows older until they finally have the older actress in the role.<br/><br/>As with every Twilight film, there are moments of unintentional laughter, bad acting, dialogue and CGI. Michael Sheen seems to be having fun acting like a complete weirdo and the others seem to be happy they are finished with this series. Now, to be completely honest, this entire saga could have been told in three movies. Twilight for the set up, Eclipse for conflict, Breaking Dawn for the closure. Eliminate the pointless New Moon and condense these two movies into one. <br/><br/>Twilight is finally over. No more sparkling vampires, no more team Edwards or team Jacobs and no more shirtless scenes of young men. Good bye Twilight, I do not look forward to the inevitable remakes."
"charvey48","1","168","463","26 November 2012"," Unbelievably Bad
","I can't believe I sat through this entire movie. I can't believe Stephanie Meyer approves of it. I can't believe the acting is so dreadful. I can't believe some people actually think this is an all-right, let alone great, ending to the movie franchise. Admittedly, I am inclined to be negatively critical of movies that are not faithful to the original story or characters on which they are based - especially if I liked the original. I was mildly tolerant of the 4 movies leading up to this one because I felt the important parts of the story lines were there even though the actors didn't measure up to the characters that had formed in my mind from reading the books. This final movie, on the other hand, rushes through the story barely touching on some parts I feel are important, in order to include a culminating scene which is not part of the original story, and which itself has to be absurdly unbelievable to any fan of the book series. Two actors, Lautner and Sheen, do the best they can with the terrible dialoge they were given, but not one other character utters a believable syllable the entire time. I should have stayed home and re-read the book, and would heartily advise others to do the same."
"mark635","1","161","443","16 November 2012"," Worst movie EVER
","I have to admit, I've never seen any of the Twilight movies previous to this one. Accompanied my girlfriend on this one since she went with me to see Skyfall...<br/><br/>Caveat--I'm a guy and this is definitely not my type of movie. But I say with no equivocation that I tried to be open minded...I REALLY DID. I mean...she dragged me to the indie film ""The Paperboy"" and I actually enjoyed that.<br/><br/>OK. This was the worst piece of tripe I have EVER SEEN. I couldn't find one redeeming thing about this abomination of a ""movie"". Did it really have a budget of $75,000,000???? The movie effects looked so fake (The CGI effects used to make the baby were HORRIBLE. The scenes where the characters are moving at some sort of hyper-vampire speed were a joke). The lines were so cheesy and hackneyed (and horribly delivered by the actors) that it was laughable. The story line was completely disjointed...there was no flow to it at all.<br/><br/>I saw someone's earlier review here where she stated that she asked her friend ""Is this a real movie?"" Exactly. I found myself in disbelief the entire time.<br/><br/>My girlfriend...who admitted that this franchise was a guilty pleasure of hers---said she loved the other movies---FELL ASLEEP halfway through. This is someone who loves this franchise. In her words--this movie was a complete waste, there was no reason to break the final movie into two parts. They could have summed up everything that happened in this one by adding 15 minutes onto the last one and it would have made a much cleaner ending.<br/><br/>Biggest waste of two hours in my entire life. Waiting in line for two hours at the DMV to have one of their employees perform a root canal on me, while listening to Britney Spears perform ""Oops I Did It Again"" live would have been less torturous."
"RichardSRussell-1","2","138","388","29 November 2012"," Revenge of the Department-Store Manikins
","This movie cost a reported $120,000,000. In only 2 weeks, it's already doubled that take at the box office, but what I'd like to know is where all that money went. Not on sets or locations, since it's mainly set in the woods. Elegant costumes, to be sure, but you're not gonna blow 9 digits' worth of bucks on epaulets. The effects are sparse and nothing special. Fersher not on the writing (execrable screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg).<br/><br/>So it has to have been on the actors. And boy, did they ever NOT get their money's worth. The entire film consists of people standing around like statues, reading dialog to each other, with an occasional flicker of attempted facial expression. Really, this is not an exaggeration. 80% of the film is literally people just standing there like an array of department-store manikins, spouting inane, vapid dialog.<br/><br/>The entire premise of the film is based on the idea that the Volturi, self-appointed overlords of the vampire world, will not tolerate a human child being turned into a vampire (with some justification, based on terrible experiences in the past, when the tykes had tantrums and couldn't control their appetites). And now the Volturi mistakenly believe that Bella and Edward's new child, the regrettably named Renesmee, is one such, and they're coming to wreak vengeance on her and the entire Cullen clan — having politely given several weeks advance notice. All of this could have been cleared up with a little home video, or perhaps a Skype call. Ditto for the Cullens' attempts to round up witnesses to little Nessie's amazing growth spurt (newborn to an apparent age 6 in a couple of weeks). Could they just ring up their friends on their cell phones or e-mail them? Nooooooo, gotta travel twice around the world to ask them in person. And then they all show up in the Pacific northwoods, where they get to stand around like statues like everyone else. When there finally IS a flurry of action, the cameras move so rapidly and jerkily that you can't get any sense at all of who's doing what to whom.<br/><br/>This is a terrible movie, all posing and posturing and protestations of undying love less sincere than a Twinkies commercial."

","I have just come home from watching this last installment of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2 with my wife. I don't know what is with these Twilight movies that we look forward to watching them, simply to see how bad they are. Haha! The poster showing the three main characters running did not hold much promise of a better film.<br/><br/>This film starts where the last film left off. Bella has just given birth to her daughter Renesmee. This supernatural birth brings Bella close to death, so Edward saves her by making her a vampire. Now, when the Volturri find out about Renesmee, they consider her a threat to their existence and hence seek to kill her. Will the Cullen family be able to protect Renesmee and themselves from ultimate destruction?<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie are filled with the same clunky scenes and corny dialog that we have all seen and cringed to in all the previous movies. The very long scene showing Bella's reaction to Jacob's imprinting is particularly hilarious. There was also the requisite Jacob striptease scene strictly for Team Jacob fanatics.<br/><br/>The climactic battle scenes between the Cullens and the Volturri were another matter though. Sure it was pure computer generated mayhem and violence. But for those who have not read the books and just followed the films, there was some imaginative storytelling at work here for a change. I am actually curious how this part of the story was written in the book. I will give this movie an extra point for this part.<br/><br/>In the closing scenes set in the familiar field of purple flowers we have seen before, the whole Twilight saga ends with an incredibly thick serving of cheese. I am not surprised. It ends as it started: cheesy. It never really aspired to be more, so let the Twi-hard fans enjoy this last film while it lasts. So now that it all ends, I'm pretty sure the rest of the world will also be missing Bella and her two other-worldly consorts. We won't have a next film to look forward to nitpick anymore."
"Peaceful224","2","3","4","7 January 2018"," Awful
","I usually don't write negative reviews, but I had to give my opinion on this movie. I had originally only watched parts of it, but my mom forced me to watch a huge portion of the movie. It was awful, just awful! I've never been a huge Twilight fan to begin with. The only reason I have any interaction with it is because of my mom, who is a die hard fan. I haven't read the books, but I've seen most of the movies. I only like the first one, and mainly because of the amazing soundtrack.<br/><br/>There were so many things wrong with this movie. First of all, I cannot stand the disgusting CGI baby. Why would they do that? There is seriously no reason for it at all. And the fact that the baby from the very beginning is supposed to have an imprint with Jacob? Like maybe there is a possibility that she will grow up and fall in love with him and be with him? I find that weird and disturbing. I know that it's not supposed to be like that... But still... Also I hate how they try to make seem Bella all cool, strong, and tough now that she's a vampire. I find it really annoying. The acting isn't really that great and the jokes are nearly unbearable. And really, they can't tell Bella's dad that she is a vampire but they can tell him Jacob is a werewolf? Really? And Bella knew for many years as a human that they were vampires. 
All in all, I recommend people watch the honest trailer on YouTube for this movie, it is so hilarious! It will really show you how bad this movie is. I even read some other reviews on this movie saying that Stephen King said this story was bad. I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I know he is an excellent writer, so that's really saying something about how terrible this movie is."

","Well, it's over. For some it's sad. No more shirtless Taylor Lautner (he strips all the way down to his skivvies in this one). No more cheesy- looking CGI that laughably tries to convince us that these vampires are kin to The Flash. No more horrid acting. No more horrid writing. Yes, gone forever is the cheap-shot money-maker that is ""The Twilight Saga"" soap opera. In the latest episode, which amounts to nothing more than an unenthusiastic excuse to showcase every person who was ever in these films and convince us that the ""saga"" was something bigger than it was (it's not), we wave goodbye to all of these things one last time. Sometimes, what looks great in your head as you read it in a book just doesn't work as well on the silver screen. This is a prime example. But sadly, no one really cares. This meritless movie franchise made money off of a brand, and that's all. What a waste of a pop-culture phenomenon. Oh well, I hear they're already rebooting it.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"
"newhpfan","2","99","295","20 November 2012"," Thank God for the last 20 minutes
","It is actually impossible to rate a twilight film as ""good"" because it's an established fact that those films make zilch sense and do not provide any remote sense of satisfaction to the general moviegoers apart from the amazingly passionate legion of fans called ""twihards"". So when a person who is not a fan of the series says a twilight movie is good, it means that it is still terrible but not as terrible as the other ones.<br/><br/>The final instalment of this outrageously successful series, called Breaking Dawn part 2, tries the patience of the viewer for the first 30- 40 minutes. There is hardly anything that happens apart from the trademark Edward and Bella moments and a little bit of shirltess Jacob. There is also a poorly done CGI baby which is called Renesmee, Edward and Bella's daughter. Just when you contemplate walking out of the cinema hall, you get to see something that can be perceived as a successful attempt to placate the disappointed audience. There is a very well-executed battle sequence with a clever twist that makes you wonder why such scenes were so sporadic throughout the series. Yes, the battle sequence was effective damage control.<br/><br/>The performances were mediocre as opposed to the hitherto awful monotony that the cast put up in the past four movies except Pattinson,. who still continues to look jaded, but you can't really blame him. <br/><br/>On the whole, for an non-fan, this movie would visually punish you for a while and then give you a breather during its last 20 minutes. If you think the ticket cost is worth those 20 minutes, I suggest that you watch it. Bland film otherwise"

","Actually it's a 0, but that score doesn't count. We have vamps and wolves as friends, in cool houses, (wolves are with shirts on for a while until Taylor does a little gay strip for Kristen's dad, so teen girls can watch his chest. The story is this: Volturi are after the offspring of Kristen and Robert because Remesmee (yeah, great name, lol) is half human, half vamp. Apparently this can't be, so the Volturi are going to kill her. They talk amongst their friends around the world to have witnesses (whatever that is for the film's purpose) to claim she's not a threat. We then have 90 minutes of nothing with this, apart from some random vamps jumping just for fun. In the end, Alice (who sees the future) takes the hand of the Volturi chief, so he can see it too. After this moment, battle (as in all of this saga thing) ensues, etc etc, just to learn in the end that none of it happened at all. Alice showed the Volturi guy what would happen, and the battle never took place. They part, each side, the couples kiss, and the movie ends. Bravo Stephenie for making vamps with lipstick and shining under the sun, and werewolves whose only obligation is being naked for teens' purpose a SAGA! 0 out of 10"

","The Twilight Saga: It is known by many,yet hated by so many.The Twilight Series is one of the best book series ever written,and I love the books with all my heart,Stephenie Meyer wrote books where Humans,werewolves,and vampires all come together,and where there was true magic,suspense,drama,love,and much more.Now I've read a lot of reviews where people have ONLY saw the movies and have NOT read the books,and then assume that books are just as bad as the movies,but there not the books are truly amazing,and just by watching a movie based off of a novel doesn't mean the story is any weak than the films they made out of them.Another thing I hear people say is ""I wanna kill whoever came up with these"" Oh please give me a freaking break,just because you haven't read the books,and it seems some people don't even know that the movies are based off of award winning novels.Yes the movies aren't as good as the books but that's to expected I mean really do you honestly think that any movie based off of a book will be the same?No it won't I mean let's think for a second here,the Hunger Games,a wonderful book series that I also love,but the movie wasn't as good at all but I still really enjoyed it.The thing is when a movie is being made off of a book things will be cut out,because they can't fit everything in when it's a film adaptation.I think that that the twilight movies were made perfectly and are no better than the Harry Potter movies,or the The Hunger Games.So if you haven't read the books (Which a lot of people seem to have not)Then you're missing out on something amazing,because the books are wonderful,so if you hate the movies at least give the novels a chance,you will be surprised on how much good stuff you've been missing out on.So yes I think the movies were perfectly done and the ending I think was the best of all!So if you haven't read the books,go get them,open them up,and have yourself an awesome time getting lost in a world with pure magic,love,suspense,drama around every corner."

"pennyelenabooks","1","9","19","19 June 2015"," not good enough
","The final chapter of the twilight saga finds Bella as a vampire who tries to protect her daughter from the Volturi. As a fan of the twilight movies, having watched the first one more than once, I can say with certainty that this one was the worst one. Surelly the movies decreased of quality and interest as they go, with the New Moon being not as good as Twilight and Eclipse even less so, the two parts of Breaking Dawn were difficult to watch. I don't know if it was the story itself that lucked of interest, or the many other things that made it impossible to like, but the very last one was a big disappointment, considering how strongly the saga started. For the Breaking Dawn, part two now. The visual and special effects were way out of normal. They looked like they were made by someone twenty years ago who didn't know how to use them. I mean, the movies today can use the special effects so perfectly that they can look so real. But for Breaking Dawn, they just didn't work. For me, the baby was the worse one, as it was creepy and looked very unreal. The make up wasn't that good also. The vampires looked uncomfortable, and more like zombies than the undead. The performances were really horrible as well, with the actors looking like they didn't really want to be there. Of course the script didn't help them, as the story drag on and on, and some parts of it were simply unnecessary. And finally the battle scene. To be honest, when the first vampires started to die, I've got really excited, as that would have been something very original and interesting. But the twist just took all that away. And so the last twilight movie ended up a poor finish with many clichés, a wick plot, a horrifying baby and non chemistry actors. And that's why I'm giving it a 1 out of 10."

","Firstly I would say don't listen to the bias haters who have cast there votes giving this a low score without even watching it.........<br/><br/>The film was superbly shot. There were some very nice scenes and the transition / editing between scenes was very fluid. The action scenes were much better than all the other twilight films with heads being ripped off and a couple of half decent scraps.<br/><br/>Whilst the dialogue was a bit lacking in this film they made up by presenting a whole host of different characters, there was always something on screen to keep us interested. The character development was also a bit lacking. I would say this film was entertaining but no more. I gave it a 10 to make up for all the haters casting silly votes like 1! There's no need for me to describe the film IMDb does that on the title page. I'm just going to say you will like watching it but don't expect to be intellectually challenged!! It's a popcorn & put your hand down your girlfriends skirt kind of film......"
"downunderallison","1","10","22","9 January 2013"," Just when you think it can't get any worse....
","I went with my 13 year old step daughter to see this movie. She is a die hard Twilight fan with all the books, I have seen the other movies and wasn't really impressed but I could see why a 13 year old girl would like them. So I went into this thinking well it can't be any worse than Breaking Dawn part One or Eclipse. I was so wrong.<br/><br/>I enjoy fantasy movies, and can usually go along with bizarre story lines when there are accompanied by great acting. That's where this series loses it. Kristen Stewart looks like a severely depressed junkie and in every shot the same blank expression is on her face. When Jacob reveals to Bella that he has imprinted on her infant she is a little upset but pretty much lets it go. Are you kidding me?! The guy you almost left Edward for just told you he is in love with your newborn daughter and that's not weird? So her daughter has no choice in this bestiality marriage? Then here comes Edward, who just allowed this to happen to his daughter, he almost seems pleased with this idea. I wanted to punch him. The fact that I was able to stay awake after this ridiculous turn of events is a miracle. Also, I agree with everyone that says the CGI face on the baby was awful and unnecessary. Then, Bella's poor Dad is cheated out of a relationship with his granddaughter because the vampires have to lie to everyone. Fast forward through the terrible scenes where the vampires can run fast in the forest(so stupid) and you find out they are going to assemble some type of vampire dream team to convince the evil leaders that the hybrid kid isn't a danger to anyone. If these people really wanted her dead why didn't they just run over there flash style and steal that kid in the night? Instead they are going to take their sweet time so the Cullens can get back up and meet them on the battlefield. OK so if you believe all of that, the ""twist"" isn't really a surprise. Dakota Fanning was the same character as always. Aro was the only one that seemed to be trying to get into character. I felt cheated after they revealed the battle was a vision. It made much more sense for there to actually be a fight. The vision lady could have just fast forwarded that whole scene to the end where Aro sees he's going to die. Problem solved.<br/><br/>Most of this movie just felt like an effort to get terrible actors screen time without telling a real story. I agree the series could have been three movies if not two. My vote for the most overrated series of all time. My only prayer is that this franchise loses it's momentum after this and we can stop seeing twilight merch everywhere."

","This movie is definitely a gift to those that have enjoyed the books and the movies. This was a gift made just for them, hand made, hand crafted, hand packaged and delivered just for the fans. When you receive a gift that is made especially for you, then you can overlook the obvious flaws and receive the gift for the love that it was intended to show.<br/><br/>Sure the CGI, at times, wasn't on par with more expensive films and yes, the makeup (as in the first movie) had glaring errors and also, like the first movie, the film is grainy and would have looked much better as a digital film, but then, the errors would have probably been even more apparent.<br/><br/>When I read this book, I was pretty much bored throughout the entire book. I read it so I could discuss it with my wife who is a definite fan of the series. But let's face it guys, this book was written for the gentler sex and they will glean a whole lot more from this series than we ever will.<br/><br/>in the book, I was really dissatisfied with the ending<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!! Don't read past this if you haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>I wanted there to be a big battle! It never happened.<br/><br/>My favorite character has always been Alice. She's beautiful (like a female vampire should be), she's brilliant, talented and dresses very well. She's clearly the best of the whole coven.<br/><br/>The movie stays pretty much with the book, but I knew that since movies are visual...that the ending would definitely HAVE to be changed! At least, I was hoping it would be.<br/><br/>When the big battle broke out, I was literally shouting at the screen ""Get him!""....""Now Jane will get what she deserves!"" and other such emotional nonsense. Regardless, I was having a GREAT time seeing the ""bad guys"" get there comeuppance especially now that the leader of the coven (Carlisle) had been the first to die. <br/><br/>The battle was definitely exciting and then when Aro was about to be burned by Bella, then flash to Alice who removes her hand from Aro and informs him that this is what would happen if Aro didn't change his mind and go another course...myself and every member of the audience let out a HUGE gasp! Why? Because the entire big battle NEVER happened! It was all just Alice saving the day by showing Aro what would happen if they actually went to battle...it would end with HIS DEATH!<br/><br/>I haven't heard an audience react like that since Darth Vader told Luke, ""No...I...am your father"" in the Empire Strikes Back! This was a huge twist that clearly rivaled the Star Wars twist or the famous twist in ""The Sixth Sense.""<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the Mormon aspects of the film (since the author is LDS) of eternal love and eternal marriage, that love can last forever. The idea of an immortal body experiencing no pain, you won't get tired, never having need of sleep. Also that our eternal ideal is to have joy. Now no...the vampire aspect is NOT an LDS belief! Vampires and giant wolves are just make believe. But I see some of Stephanie's faith being written into the books and the movies. Hopefully, people won't catch on and have to scrap all the books and movies like they did with the original Battlestar Galactica when they introduced eternal marriage and Kolob! Heaven forbid that some parts of the LDS faith should be exposed to the public!<br/><br/>All in all, I thought this was a very good film. The love scene was probably a bit too intense for the younger set and I did notice a couple of parents rushing their kids out of the theater during their love scene. Please bear in mind that this IS a PG-13 movie and that this movie is definitely NOT appropriate for young children! So, please parents, don't bring them and expect this to be a G movie. It definitely isn't.<br/><br/>So if you enjoy the books...the movie is a gift of love made for the fans. Others may want to think twice before going.<br/><br/>I have also enjoyed some of the previous comments from some people saying the acting is stiff or like in a soap opera...well duh!!! They're vampires guys! The walking dead! Also many of the guys blasting the film because it isn't like last week's James Bond film. Well guys! This movie is NOT for you, its for the larger movie going audience...females! So stay home and play your video games.<br/><br/>But bottom line for me...my favorite vampire...Alice...saved the day (single handed) and proved she is the best of any of them! GO ALICE!!!"

","Ah hello old nemesis; we meet again. What once started as the trifling egging of a college friend has become a movie franchise released from the gates of hell itself. What was a sudden and heart wrenching annoyance has become a cataclysmic migraine, nay an unholy, malodorous bowel movement from which the stench is enough to wake the dead. Yes, I, a straight male whose only stake in the franchise is that I vowed to eventually finish it has finally put the final nail in the coffin. It has finally been done. I finally sat back and watched the last Twilight (2008-2012) movie on DVD.<br/><br/>I write this review slightly inebriated due to the saving grace that is the Twilight Drinking Game. Without it, I surely would have had to spend my tax return on speckling the myriad of holes in the wall. Instead of uncontrollable rage, I watched the face-palm-fest that is Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2012) with a whimpering sense of futility. For those unfamiliar with the Twilight Drinking Game, the rules are as follows:<br/><br/>Take a shot/sip when 1. Someone says the word vampire or wolf or any variation including ""newborns"". 2. Whenever someone sparkles. 3. When the father appears in police uniform. 4. Whenever someone is brooding. 5. Whenever an obnoxious hipster indie song is being played in the background. 6. Whenever someone doesn't have his shirt on. 7. Whenever someone gives an unrealistically generous gift, does a foolishly gallant act or otherwise bends the rules of common sense for Bella.<br/><br/>Drink the rest of the bottle when<br/><br/>1. Someone unattractive or out of shape is on screen.<br/><br/>2. Something in a scene makes you feel anything other than sleepiness or the need to plant your face in your hands.<br/><br/>Doth one protest too much? Would one be dead after watching the last installment of Stephanie Meyer's abomination? Well, I'd stick with beer instead of the multitude of high alcohol content boozes. It's not good for your health.<br/><br/>The story begins with Bella (Kristen Stewart) familiarizing herself with her new found living-dead-ness. Since the last film She and Edward (Robert Pattinson) have birthed Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) the first known human/vampire hybrid. The Volturi headed by Aro (Michael Sheen) fear the child is a newly turned vampire child who can't control its appetites so they become determined to snuff it out before humans find out their kind is real. In order to avoid all out war, the Cullens recruit a gaggle of vampire clans to witness the existence of Jesus, I mean Renesmee in the hopes that if enough people know the truth, the Volturi will call the whole thing off.<br/><br/>Let's take a brief moment to recap the whole story in one giant ugly looking nutshell: plain Jane falls in love with a vampire. Werewolf gets jealous; girl marries then has sex with vampire and gets pregnant, is turned into a vampire just before giving birth. Werewolf ""imprints"" on newborn child because, you know, it's a werewolf thing. big cabal of vampires is angry about everything and wants to destroy the child because vampire children can't hold their P's and Q's.<br/><br/>As the film progresses we meet a multitude of new characters including a vampire who can manipulate the elements, a duo who can change one's perception of reality and one with Taser hands. This is in addition to Ashley Greene's character who can literally see the future. Who knew Twilight was just a bad rendering of the X-Men. Had they introduced these characters sooner we might have had a worthwhile premise on our hands.<br/><br/>The new glut of characters along with the principle cast do take advantage of their powers in the final act...sort of. Suffice to say that the last twenty minutes of the film changed Breaking Dawn Part 2's status in my mind from being the best movie of the saga to the worst by virtue of having the biggest cop out moment in modern movie history.<br/><br/>In the immortal words of famed film critic Roger Ebert who's wisdom definitely apply here; ""I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.""<br/><br/>I feel like I have been the victim of an elaborate scam perpetrated by the creators of this film and book series. The artificial edifice of the entire series mixed with the vacuous, besotted romance is interminably out of place with its utmost earnestness. The professionalism of the actors, the polish of the cinematography, the dedication of the director all fail when faced with the sheer ineptitude of the story and its absolute insistence on insulting its audience. If I knew any better I'd think the creators of such dreck were doing it on purpose a la the works of Douglas Sirk and Luis Bunuel but I doubt the production team could be so sly.<br/><br/>Thankfully with this last insipid movie the multi-million dollar Twilight film franchise has come to a merciful end. Nevermore will we have to deal with the banal reflections of the distastefully irksome Bella and the moping Edward Cullens. The world will be at peace no longer having to choose sides between Jacob and his shirt-wearing bloodsucking doppelganger. It's all finally over and unless I'm feeling especially masochistic or know someone with an IQ lower than their shoe size and a gift for persuasion I never, NEVER have to watch the Twilight movies again.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","By saying I was disappointed with this film is an understatement. This movie had potential. It had some good villains (Volturi) and an interesting premise (violating vampire law by creating an immortal child) and some background on the premise (immortal children are uncontrolable as proved in the past). A fellow vampire sees Bella and Edward's daughter and reports them to the Volturi. The Volturi then set out to deal with the situation. Bella and Edward are made aware of the Volturi's awareness and seek out witnesses to certify that Bella and Edward's child was born and not an immortal child. In short, the defense is gathering evidence as in a court of law. All of this makes sense however the problem we encounter is how it was all presented in the film. I've been able to summarize the plot in a paragraph and in a film it should been summarized in around 10-15 minutes. This is not the case, the pacing of the film leaves a great deal to be desired. Nothing much except for filler material happens for the first hour or so. Kristen Stewart's acting is dry as in all the Twilight films. Edward is so stiff that he reminds me of the character Data from Star Trek the Next Generation. Jacob is the only character who has some emotion. The most disappointing aspect of the film has to be the last 30 minutes. Here we are treated with a good battle between good and evil. I admit the battle was tense. Around 70% of the cast dies off. However there issues with the battle that turned me off completely. The first is, that one of the ""Good"" Vampires takes his fist out and creates a fissure in the ground that swallows up the vampires on the battlefield. From a military standpoint that action from this vampire was ludicrous because he ends up killing most of his friends in the process and very few Volturi. The second, the Volturi, especially the three Elders were such wimps. For being as powerful as they say they are, they all died very easily. The blond one, Cauis was killed in about 3 seconds, the tall one Marcus, was killed so fast that I don't even know how he died, I saw two vampires run at him and then he was dead. Aro, fought with Edward and Bella for about 10 seconds until they lopped his head off like a doll. To top it all off the entire battle sequence was just a vision. When this twist came about I felt robbed because it felt that the battle sequence was just included in the film to add some tension in an otherwise slow paced film. In short, I can't see why other than trying to rack in as much money as possible, why Breaking Dawn was split into two films. The entire battle scene could have been ommitted in the film. If the battle scene wasn't a vision and actual reality along with the Volturi putting up more of a fight I feel this movie could have been much better received. As it stands, it will only barely be enjoyed by Twilight fans."

","Finally the twilight torture is all over finally we can sit back and forget twilight as one of the worst movies ever come on.

I hope this movie never gets rebooted and gets forgotten as one of the worst vampire series of all time all the people that thought that this movie was the best surely you guys have no taste in movies. Watch Life of Pi thats a great movie that surely is way better than twilight. Acting 3/10 Story 2/10 Movie Overall 2/10 it was to boring i was half asleep in some scenes"

","You would think over the past couple of years of being spotlight actors, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson would have picked up a few acting techniques. After viewing the recent Twilight film I found this not to be the case. The fact that Stephenie Meyer would even allow this to be shown in theaters tells you all you need to know about the Twilight Saga. It was not the product of a creative mind. It was an elaborate get rich quick scheme based on what could have been a good story. I would have left 20 minutes into this movie if it was not for my girlfriend sitting next to me entranced in this joke of the film. I would save your money and YouTube the Final scene which was the only scene worth watching."

"derekdiercksmeier","1","8","17","15 December 2012"," A Truly Painful Viewing Experience.
","I've always hated the ""Twilight"" movies, but ""Breaking Dawn, Part 2"" is an atrocious film. Director Bill Condon has disappointed me greatly by making a movie that is cheesy and joyless. Until I saw this movie, I did not realize how awful Kristen Stewart really is. Stewart is a terrible choice for the role of Bella and she nearly ruined ""Snow White And The Huntsman"". Taylor Lautner's performance is unintentionally funny, but not exactly painful to watch. However, Robert Pattinson Is A Wonderful Actor. It is unfortunate that he is totally wasted in the role of sparkling vampire Edward Cullen. Pattinson was very good in both ""Water For Elephants"" and David Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis"" earlier this year.Lee Pace, who was absolutely brilliant in ""Pushing Daisies, turns in a terrible performance as one of the vampires. Yes, the performances are really, really bad, but the movie has virtually nothing positive. When I say ""virtually"", I mean that the score is pretty good. The film's story is vapid and preposterous. When the film finally ends, you will breath a sigh of relief.I would rather be locked in a supply closet for two hours than sit through this horrible movie once more."
"potterus_25","1","8","17","9 December 2012"," An anti-climax of the twilight saga
","My best friend never understands why I watched this franchise in the first place. After BD II, I don't understand either. This movie is fail in so many ways if not all ways. It is a total garbage. And I don't say this because I hate the books. I do like the books. But even a fan like me, can not help this final saga reaches even 1.5 out of 10 score.<br/><br/>The screenplay rips off all what matters in the books. I could not say I was satisfied with BD part I, but the excitement to watch Bella becoming immortal, made me feel part II was worth waiting for (I am totally wrong). The process of Bella being a first born take pages in the book.So yes, this should be an important moment. That is not merely showing Bella exploring her new vampire senses,but also how it has created this tense atmosphere among other vampires to deal with a first born, an uncontrollable-always-thirsty-vampire. The movie should use this moment and develop it into some amazed scene, like when we watch superheroes get their first power in the movie. It should be exciting. And of course, to give other characters more lines rather than just listening Bella narrated it for the first 10-15 minutes.<br/><br/>The story plot makes no sense at all.The exposition runs in speed pace, and most of the time narrated, or what I call, summarized by Bella's character. The rising actions feel dry. Alice missing should be the beginning of building up the conflicts in the story. Instead of save some minutes to develop it,the writer, again and again, only mention it between Bella's long narration. The moment where Bella get her tangible power seems no special at all. When it reaches climax, well, it should have reached climax ,no one realizes let alone feeling that.I remember asked my friend what time it was because I could not believe the war scene already there.I was not in climax mode yet.<br/><br/>In the last book, Bella and Edward character have developed. There is this new level of maturity and parenthood that comes along with Renesmee presence.Bella's mother side grows and it is heartwarming to see her effort try to save her family alone during Alice missing. There is a heartbreaking moment in the book when Edward says goodbye to her daughter that I actually cried when read it. Again,the movie fails to show it, not even in dialogs, not even in scenes,not even in gestures.<br/><br/>The baby CGI part is the worst.And what's with the wig? I don't want to be cranky person. But the CGI and the wig are little yet annoying things that make me hard to fall in love with Renesmee character. Seriously,when a baby moves her head and looks at people like that,it is just creepy.<br/><br/>The war scenes didn't blow me much.With war scene, you suppose to feel this tremendous feeling, a high point of tension. But since the plot fails to gradually take me to that point, I did not have time to catch emotional ambiance with the scene. But I have to admit it was not a total bad twisted-scene considering how the book has let us down in that particular part. A little action would be nice, Ms Meyer.<br/><br/>The actors/actresses performance were disappointed.Yet,can't blame them 100% because the dialogs given are not great either. Stewart, again, could not stop bringing her own Stewart's personality to every characters she plays. In Twilight, I thought it was pretty cool that Stewart made Bella's character a little bit dark than the book. But after watching her other works (I've followed her from Catch That Kid,Panic Room,Into the Wild,Adeventureland,etc.), I realize she doesn't try to make different version of Bella. She just plays her own self. The same thing when she played Snow White. She's got to get out from her comfort zone. She should take a complete different role from her own character. I suggest she takes more girly role like Reese in Legally Blonde, so just we could now that she can act.I can not say much for Pattinson. Never really seen him beside Twilight franchise. I think he pulls Edward off. But again, Edward's never been a complex character.<br/><br/>It is sad that after 5 years, they ended the journey of Bella and Edward like this. Such a big disappointment."

","Overall I think the end of the Twilight saga was better than I had expected.The beginning was miserable and awkward. The lines felt unreliable and a computer animated baby? Come on! I was considering leaving the cinema - seriously. I have read all the books and had higher expectations. But then I just loved what happened next.. I will not reveal too much... But I was really surprised and was at the edge of my seat. WAUV! I kept trying to figure it out... The movie turned into something very interesting. Unfortunately the end once more was disappointing. Of course I knew what was going to happen, but I think the last 20 lines was unnecessary. Too romantic, teenage high school awkward. However I must simply watch this movie again to review the middle...I'm sure the Twilight Fans will love this movie. Non-fans and men in general - not so much. Might be annoyed by the robot baby and fake lines. I rate it 8 stars for the beautiful scenery and the battle scene :-)"
"nabeel_lives","8","9","20","16 November 2012"," Not bad - just a little bit more and it could have been epic!
","I think the trailer of the movie pretty much clarified to everyone that BD II would be on the same lines as eclipse (my favourite in the series). Relaxed at the start, then some bad news and then the build up to the main fight scene. I personally always admire all fight scenes in daylight.<br/><br/>One more thing that went in favour of the movie, was the fact that Breaking Dawn was all out crap and it sort of kept expectations on the lower side for part II.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much, I must say that the buildup to the main fight and the fight itself was pretty good. A little longer fight scene and more of one-on-one action, would have made this my favourite ever vampires' fight scene. In the end, i think the story writer had two options on how to end the story (reminds me of Harry Potter when its final novel was being written and an ending was being decided) - the option used is the one that probably kept everyone happy in the end.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, there were some funny moments, some grim moments, good tension and suspense...with a U-turn ending...."

","I'd really rather not give this a rating of 1 star, would it be possible for IMDb to put in a zero rating, because this movie doesn't even deserve the 1.<br/><br/>Anyway, I s'pose if I have to pick out something of interest here, it would have to be Mackenzie Foy as Nessie, at least she brought something fresh - however squashed it ended up being - to the finale.<br/><br/>I'm really glad there won't be anymore Twilight movies. If they ever decide to make a film adaption of Meyer's Midnight Sun - Twilight all over again from the vamp's POV : BORING! - I won't bother with it.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel sorry in a way for the people involved in this series and for those who've read the books because honestly, it's really hard to get attached to/be interested in characters that have no substance; if you're going to put a character on the page, screen etc, at least make them interesting! Everyone involved in the series did the best they could, but the Twilight series is finished!<br/><br/>How bad is the Twilight Saga? Even legendary writer Stephen King doesn't like it!"
"thesar-2","1","21","57","18 November 2012"," As Funny as Part 1 and Part 1
","I finally got it. After three real movies and an obscene attempt at extracting more money by splitting up Breaking Dawn into two parts, I understand what this series is all about. It was meant to introduce a new audience to soap operas since most of the daytime programs have been cancelled.<br/><br/>There is no other explanation. Both the soaps on TV and the Twilight films have paper thin plots, terrible dialogue and acting so atrocious that even Michael ""ahhh-oh-AHHH!"" Sheen must've known when signing on he gave up any hopes of getting an Oscar in the future.<br/><br/>But, I will give this movie some credit and make note of one scene that will make the entire nightmare worthy of a watch: in an incredible series of accidentally amusing segments, they actually taught Bella to become Kristen Stewart. I was already laughing so hard during the comical special effects to the creepy digitized demon baby to the close ups so near to the screen that I was glad that it wasn't in 3-D or their nose hairs would've been closer than desired, but when they literally tell Bella to be a stiff actor, emotionless, melancholy and slow, I lost it. Bella, meet Kristen Stewart.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if they were acknowledging Stewart is one of the worst actresses of all time and the scene was tongue-in-cheek, but it was funny, nonetheless.<br/><br/>What wasn't funny was the endless, sad and racist stereotypes portrayed throughout. It's almost as if the novel's writer was a Mormon. Oh, wait<br/><br/>Anyways, everything reverts back to the original film with the amount of stares, the sometimes there and sometimes missing white faces, the terrible CGI including Bella running through what appears to be the Moon of Endor, but ends up looking more like in she's jogging in an awful 20 cent 1980s music video, the sickening jokes and the joyless, pale and blank looks between the actors. That last one was one of my favorite scenes as the camera panned from one dumbfounded face to the next. I found myself pointing off the screen as if directing the camera to film the next boorish and expressionless glare.<br/><br/>Those were the similarities of the original Twilight. Since they just ""had to"" split the (oh, God, let it be the) final book into two, the screenplay, if there was one, appeared to be completed on one side of a toilet paper square. And if you are curious to see this film, much like that square, you'll know exactly where the final project ended up.<br/><br/>Let's see if I can write the entire movie down on one toilet paper square:<br/><br/>Bella and Edward are newlyweds. Bella's a ""new born"" who needs to feed on cartoon animals. Jacob now smells and put his stank on an infant, which never gets less disturbing. The supposedly strong, though never proved, high council is upset a half-breed might harm their ""race."" Different clichés from around the globe are summoned to negotiate. A ""battle"" ensures.<br/><br/>Yep, it all fits and I still have room for<br/><br/>And that's what this movie is. No two ways around it. People who like this crud will continue to defend it. More power to them – for liking what they like. Soaps were around for decades and though I didn't like them, I saw their appeal to desperate housewives.<br/><br/>As everyone has a right to their opinions, no one should ever be dishonest to themselves and think these are well made movies. There is not a single scene – from the aren't-we-past stock footage shots to the panning from one endlessly shocked-expression face to the next to the blatant racial discrimination to the poor and immature dialogue and monologues – that constitutes a quality film.<br/><br/>Despite how much fun it is to watch these unintentionally hilarious films, this series is just plain trash and I'm glad it's over."

"Jinn","1","4","7","10 April 2016"," CLEAR! CLEAR! CLEAR! Sadly even Dr Cullen's best efforts could not save this awful addition to the Twilight Saga... And also the Voilturi do NOT approve!
","Even as a devoted Twilight fan I was DISGUSTED by this movie. It was rushed in both parts, they had more than enough time. What happened to Alice's fashion sense? Bella showed an awful dress in her lovely cottage and said Alice picked it out. I thought Alice was supposed to have a good fashion sense. This was forgivable, however the atrocious ending was not. I hated AWFUL the fight scene. It ruined the Twilight movies completely. Devastated at how they portrayed Aro, making him so evil. Take him OUT of that godawful, hideous military uniform. Rigid, ugly and mechanical. Aro's supposed to be elegant and flowing. Put him in something sinister, yet elegant, like a black waistcoat with a silver dragon, or silver and gold snakes. Did Summit actually *read* the books? They also ignored the canon that Alice can't see the future when it involves the wolves.<br/><br/>Carlisle and Alice were portrayed badly. Alice can see the future and would *know* bashing Aro into the air would not make him a happy camper. Carlisle would *know* attacking the Volturi would spell disaster and way out of character. That said, I still adore the actors. There's only so much fantastic actors can do with awful, stupid scripts. The characters were written into a corner. The Cullens and Volturi are my favourite Twi teams so I'm 'Team Switzerland!' They were portrayed two-dimensionally. Stephenie Meyer wrote deep, meaningful, complex and insightful characters. I hated how they were squished into black and white Hollywood molds of good VS evil. I have never felt so betrayed in my life. When I saw Stephenie's name in big letters as producer, I felt relief that the movie won't be wrecked. So much for that. The Volturi are antagonists, rather than 'bad guys.' Stephenie even admitted later, the battle was too one sided and unrealistic that mostly the Volturi died. Why wasn't this amended in the script writing phase? Fans deserved a way better movie.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella seemed flat in the fight scene. In the book, Bella came into her own, realising her powers without resorting to violence. The saga revolves around Edward and Bella, whom I adore, but that does not mean the other characters have to be ruined especially when that severely deviated with how they were written. In the book it was *Cauis* who smiled when the Denali coven's mother and immortal child were killed, *not* Aro. In the book, Caius wanted the others killed. Aro declared they were innocent and spared them. This scene was conveniently omitted from the movie, making it easy, lazy and convenient to make Aro the bad guy. I was also upset to see very little of Carlisle. I especially wanted to see the scenes with him rousing Edward and the scene at the end where he was even prepared to forgive Aro. I adore Carlisle as he's so sweet and kind and Aro as he's so peppy and when I saw a poster of him from 'New Moon', those deep red eyes, I fell in love with him because he needed love.<br/><br/>The 'fight/vision' scene was an interesting twist, however to stay truer to the book, it should have been Caius who started it as he wanted to in the book, attempting to spark the other side off by killing Irina. This would've been another twist as the others are waiting for Aro to start something and it's Caius who shocks everyone (including Aro!) If Hollywood *had* to have a fight, it would have been better if Aro had tried to stop it and in the end being the only one who survives, perhaps with his body guard Renata and learns something about how to use his power wisely and relieved it was a vision! The fight scene made me sick, numb, betrayed and powerless. Portraying Aro way more crazy and evil is not a good thing for those suffering from mental challenges as it only serves to spread the fear that we're all violent psychos, which is not the case. Things like that increase being hurt physically and emotionally and finding it even harder to be accepted in society. My Aspergers has been a challenge as well as a blessing and has definitely made my life very interesting and very painful and I don't want to go around harming people. It makes me more insightful and open-minded and I would not trade those special insights for the world. If anything people like Aro, who in real life, are like frightened children who need nurture, love and understanding. This move hurt me so much and so deeply, it's been very hard to write about it and post until now.<br/><br/>I'd love to have the money to remake that scene into something that is much truer to the books, much deeper and more meaningful. I am envisioning Summit re-thinking that movie and be a forerunner in Hollywood for breaking that typical mold. Perhaps they can re-release the entire Twilight Saga at the movies with extra footage and do it as a huge charity drive.<br/><br/>They did a good job with the other movies and the costumes (bar some of the *awful* things they had Bella in like her birthday dress and prom outfit) I just wish with all my heart and soul that they had not ruined the entire saga with how they cheapened the charters and made the ending very clichéd in BD2. I loved the scene where Renesmee touched Aro's face and he softened and we saw a gentler side to him.<br/><br/>And yes that awful military suit made Aro look fat ;) A least I still have my sense of humour after all this... Yes, Aro knows I tease him. As long as it's meant in fun, You're allowed to tease the ones you love. That's the Law. Even Caius will tell you that ;)"
"robertgonzalezx50","1","34","102","16 November 2012"," Quite possibly the worst thing I've seen
","I want to start of by mentioning that I've never seen any of the previous movies from the saga since I assumed they would be awful, and I was right. The only reason I saw this film was because of my significant other. The acting was awful and so were the special effects, which surprises me since the movie did have a 75 million dollar budget, but then again it's a movie directed towards women so the effects were probably the least of the productions worries. One of the other things that I really thought was absurd was the idea of ""vampires"" with powers other than the usual, such as being able to control different elements and read minds. I mean really have vampires really come this downhill. That actually wasn't the worst part either. The infinite amount of decapitations with no blood. Okay I understand it's PG-13 but couldn't they have at least done something better with it instead of decapitation every second of the final battle scene. What ever happened to wooden stakes, as in ""real vampires"" not sparkling 20 year olds. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even to a casual movie fan."
"jasminestan","2","7","15","9 December 2014"," I wanted to like this one...
","...but it was just too much.<br/><br/>The movies in this franchise just got worse and worse. Probably because the books did as well. I have some serious issues with the twilight books including but not limited to the message that it sends to teenagers. Mrs. Meyer has written a book that makes young people think that physical and emotional abuse, obsessive behavior and manipulation are acceptable parts of a relationship (romantic or not) and the majority of her readers adore her for it. How this became one of the most successful book-series is beyond me.<br/><br/>Now, the film...<br/><br/>The plot is flawed and told very poorly. The writers of this script dropped the ball big time. I know they tried to be faithful to the book but it was painfully boring and contrived. Ugh, the dialog is awful.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's acting is bland and emotionless, at no point is she believable as a mother. She reminds me of how I feel when babysitting a child for the first time. The relationship between Bella and Renesmee is awkward at best. The casting of Renesmee could have been better. I liked how she looked but felt she was too old. In the books she's supposed to be aprox. as tall as a three year old and Mackenzie Foy reaching to Stewart's shoulder just made the whole thing even more unbelievable. Robert Pattinson seems to know he's in a crap movie saying crap lines but embraces it. Like Michael Sheen, he doesn't take his character too seriously and I like them for that. Taylor Lautner proved again that he's mainly there to run around without a shirt. The other actors didn't have much to work with and looked bored at times. They mostly just stood there looking pretty.<br/><br/>I had hoped that the film would at least look good and have some decent CGI but even that was too much to ask for. They have had 3 films to practice with the wolves and still they couldn't do it right. The vampire speed thing looked weird and that baby was just creepy.<br/><br/>The only thing they did right in my opinion was the massive fight scene. I was pleased that they took a risk and then disappointed when it turned out to be a vision. Seriously? Wat a cop-out.<br/><br/>I give one star for Pattinson and Sheen who made me grin and one for the fight scene."

The plot was comical and the scenes had absolutely no connection.<br/><br/>I wanted to turn this off after the first 15 minutes for the simple fact that it was so boring and the acting was non existent. Oh yeah and what was the explanation for wolf boy hanging around the vampires home 24/7? Terrible movie to an over priced and over grossing series."

","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Maybe this saga is a great movie for teenagers, i'm not sure, but it is definitely not for someone who is a fan of vampires! first of all the ""actors"" are bad, just like in any of the Twilight movies. <br/><br/>the movie itself is very boring, only the ending part, the ""fight"" is entertaining. i was actually excited that some of the characters died, but then they had to ruin it.....it was all a vision! what? why? just have a real fight, please, after all, this is supposed to be a movie about Vampires: blood sucking, thirsty, dead monsters, who can try to behave and look like human if they train, but don't really need to do it. <br/><br/>also i'm sorry to say, but vampires don't have sex.... they can't have children as they are DEAD! they can fall in love and be passionate, but not conceive a child. to sum it up: the books and the movies are for teenagers (not the smart ones :) ) it's just boring and in no way entertaining. and seeing Kristen's frozen face for 2 hours is a bit too much. no hating, just the truth."
"jnoyes99","6","7","15","19 November 2012"," A review from a guy fan who didn't read the books
","Having gone to the previous 3 movies with a girl friend I kind of became a bit of a fan of the series. After Edward and Bella's run in with the Vulturi in New Moon I was really looking forward to seeing the inevitable showdown. This showdown was actually the biggest reason for me wanting to see the next two movies.<br/><br/>So after about an hour of talking about feelings, relationship stuff, family stuff, child rearing and the raising a small rebel vampire army, the stage was set for the epic final showdown.<br/><br/>The fight was literally one of the best fight scenes of any movie I've seen. Major characters were dying all over the place. It became chaotic and unpredictable. I actually felt legitimate suspense because I had no idea what was going to happen next. I was loving it!<br/><br/>..only to suddenly have it all taken away. I was not happy. This was the showdown I was waiting to see since New Moon. I was told afterwards that there was no fight in the book, so the movie stayed accurate, but it still felt like it was a cruel trick. <br/><br/>Could you imagine if in Return of the Jedi we find out that the epic final battle was just a vision the emperor had, and since he knew he was going to die he negotiates a truce with the rebels and the movie ends like that? That is how Breaking Dawn part 2 felt to me.<br/><br/>It was major disappointment."

","At first, I've told myself that since this will be the final Twilight movie, it would be the best of the series. Unfortunately, it's the same with its predecessors, which is terrible.<br/><br/>I'm trying to understand what genre this movie should be considered whether it is a comedy, a drama or a teenage flick. They should've studied the film context and delivered their intended theme/genre for this film.<br/><br/>In the Philippines, a CBCP supported group is insisting that Twilight Film has connection with supports on ""Anti-RH bill"" movements. This is ""ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS AND COMPLETELY HILARIOUS"", nobody in his sane mind would ever associate Twilight to the Philippines' worsening condition and ""Anti-RH"" bill movement. These are blood sucking vampires you idiots. They've even place ""SUPPORT THE FAMILIES"" in every Twilight poster here in the Philippines.<br/><br/>I would've given this film a ""5 out of 10"" but thanks to a CBCP supported group propaganda, I'll give this film a ""2 out of 10""."
"td01241","1","37","114","19 November 2012"," The ""Saga"" disgracefully, and finally, comes to an inauspicious end
","I am not a fan of this series, in fact I was drug to see this movie by my girlfriend who is a huge fan of the books and first 3 films, so that should probably be considered with my perspective on this movie. Breaking Dawn Part 2 does not bring forth one redeemable quality, in my eyes, from beginning to end. It starts with our lovable hero and heroin kindling around their new born hybrid baby, in what appears to be a cabin generally reserved for families vacationing deep in the Colorado mountains. It pretty much retains this general setting for about 75-80% of the movie (this is definitely not a good thing). The main problem presented in this movie, is whether or not the world can accept their mixed child, not kidding. THE ENTIRE MOVIE (2 hours) IS SPENT ON THIS....and yet somehow they never seem to move in any real direction. They acquire ""witnesses"" for about 35 minutes, generally only detailing what their specific power is. Then we spend about 30 minutes on a scene that doesn't happen, and everyone walks away peacefully. The special effects and CG were just atrocious. I mean really, the baby in the beginning? How they are shown moving quickly, I know I know it isn't really but damn...common. Lastly don't even get me started on the script, the dialog was abysmal. ""You named my kid after the lochness monster"" is an actual line from 2 minutes into the movie. Acting wasn't much better outside of the main 2 characters everyone was bad...real bad. I just don't understand how anything so atrocious, so nefarious, and so desperate, ever got the almost ""cult"" status this had received. Makes me really worried about our countries youth.."
"RolloTomasi","2","11","27","25 November 2012"," Run away
","I am usually not one to hate on movies too much. I have seen the other 4 of the films in this series. I did not read any of the books. The other films were intriguing. They were entertaining enough. Not that I care all that much, but this finale was not the ending even the most passive of Twilight followers (me) could hope for. For four films, the story just hinted, just toed the line of complete ridiculous stupidity. The wolves that first appeared in New Moon. That was tough. I laughed inside. But I got over it and enjoyed the rest of the films. The wolves arguing with each other though mindspeak in B.D. Part One--again, tough. Again, Twilight almost lost me, but I hung on. Then, as has been the tradition with all of the others in this series, I'm out of town, in a small town, a (way) secondary movie market and it's one of 3 films showing and there's nothing else to do. Bond, Legend of the Guardians, and Twilight. Already saw Bond. No brainer, right? Anyone see Legend of the Guardians? Do I wish we'd gone to that one instead. But we didn't. So anyway there we were. Part Dos. Nice opening credits sequence (seriously. it was good work). Bella Swan (seriously, going way back to the first Twilight, that's her name. Bella Swan) is now a vampire. She's a ""newborn"" though, which we learned in Eclipse meant that she would have difficulty controlling her thirst for mortal blood. Being a newborn means was also stronger than mature vampires. She and Edward, a weaker, mature vampire, have a daughter. A half human daughter named, eh, Renesmee (another shaky moment from B.D. Uno). She's half mortal. Oh God Bella might eat her! Seriously! The movie spends time on this issue for all of two minutes. the whole newborn storyline comes and goes in 3 minutes. I don't know how much of this territory Stephanie Meyer covered in the book but--this is rich ground to mine. Spend some time there! Spend a whole movie there! Instead we move on to the 'evil' vampires, the Vulturi, and their mistaken impression that Renesmee is a baby vampire (even worse than a newborn), an immortal, which breaks all existing vampire codes on the books. She must be destroyed immediately. The Cullen family must gather together an international coalition of vampires, summoned from the ends of the earth, to attest to Renesmee's mortality, and therefore, innocence. Many vampires from different cultures come to town--France, an unnamed middle eastern nation, U.K. Oh and the Amazons. Tall women dressed in tribal attire who understand English. You know, Amazons. You mean there really are tall warrior women living deep in the jungles of South America? Oh yes and they even wear face paint. And know English. (crickets chirping) And we're done. I did sit through the rest of the movie and found out that another missing link was found--again deep in the Amazon rain forest, again, perfect English, who was half mortal, half immortal. Before we got to that though, there was this protracted sequence of completely bloodless fighting, mauling, beheading, and severed head burning. A squandered opportunity to redeem the movie slightly and actually kill off a main character or two, seeing as the entire thing ends up just being a vision anyway. Oh and Bella's father--STILL doesn't know she's a vampire. I'd ask for another film for all this stuff to be worked out but I'd be afraid of what we'd get."
"MegaGothmog","2","9","21","24 July 2015"," There are two types of reviews for this movie. I'll try to be the third one.
","OK. I know this movie came out years ago and people still love it, or hate it. The reason why i post this review anyways is because it was on TV and i thought: ""What the hell, why not. Lets check"". I am not a Twilight fan, or a mindless hater, so i'll try to be as neutral as possible.<br/><br/>Lets start with the good sides, because i'll be lying if i said that the movie doesn't have those. The story on it self (this includes part 1) is good to follow, even if you didn't see the previous movies. I could understand everything without issues, and i'll confess; The story was not as horrific as people made me believe.<br/><br/>There are also a few actors in the movie that seem to know what they are doing. Not all of them but there are a few that are not bad.<br/><br/>That is all i could think of when it comes to the good side of the movie. Now lets go for the bad part, so please ladies and gentlemen. 'Fasten your seat-belts.'<br/><br/>The general acting is nothing near immersive. With the main characters like Bella (Kristen Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) i got used to their way of acting. It is not very exiting to see them act, because they have a very passive way of acting. They don't shine on screen, and if they show major emotions, it is only for a few seconds. As for the other characters? Every time they introduced a new character, they seemed weird and a bit... 'over the top'? No... out of place? Yea. something like that.<br/><br/>Lets also dive into the lore of Vampires and Werewolves. I HATE THE VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES IN THIS SAGA!!!!!! So, now that i released that, lets explain. The vampires in (almost) every other story have the 3 basics: Sucking Blood (or else they die), Deathly vulnerable to sunlight, and have enhanced abilities like speed and strength. The vampires here only have the enhanced abilities, but they kind of need blood, but animal blood will do just fine. So why are they a threat to humans if they can feed on your cat just fine????? Also they are not weak to sunlight, but sparkle in them. THEY!!! FREAKING!!!! SPARKLEEEEE!!!!. I am sure that Bram Stoker is spinning in his grave and Dracula just committed suicide. The vampires also seem to have a random grab-bag of powers that make no sense in any way, and are not related to Vampires at all. This dude can control the four elements? What is this? Avatar? Someone else can generate lightning in her fingers? ehhh... right? Needless to say, these guys suck. And with that i mean ass, and not blood.<br/><br/>The Werewolves are also dumb and can transform into... a normal wolf form. Just a bit bigger. Whenever and wherever they like! This is not a Werewolf, but an Animagus from Harry Potter. Also they are in full control, do not go into a feral rage and do not need the full moon, or the moon for that matter.<br/><br/>The CGI in the movie looks weird and amateurish. Especially the running of the vampires. They just look like they are played in fast- fore-ward. <br/><br/>They story also has incredible weird and even disturbing moments. Given the fact that a Vampire (whose body is actually dead) has sex with a human. Therefore: Necrophilia. Also a Werewolf guy gets over his childhood crush by instead falling in love... with her creepy, CGI baby, while excusing it as 'Imprinting and he cannot control that'. Ugghh, this takes underage romances to a whole new low.<br/><br/>With all of that i think it is safe for me to say that i will never watch this movie again. It was not as horrific as i feared, i did not have to puke every time during the commercial-brake, and i did not throw it out. But the movie stays incredibly bad, with terrible lore, acting, CGI, romances and basically everything that makes a movie bad. Now please excuse me, while i play Castlevania. I really need to see a real Vampire."
"andre-bed","1","9","21","24 November 2012"," The worst Movie I didn't watch...
","This is the worst movie I didn't watch. Yeah, I would never, ever pay to watch this piece of s***. All the spoilers I am going to talk about other people told me. So let's see: <br/><br/>In the first part of this terrible end many things happen: Bella gets pregnant and.. and.. well that's it, nothing else happens. <br/><br/>In the second part what happens is absolutely nothing.. The movie begins and stays like 30-45 minutes beating around the bush.. It was, in fact, an strategy of the producers.. They were giving time for the audience to leave the theather. It was just as if they said "" Hey, this c*** is about to begin, leave while you can !"" Or suffer irreversible brain damage ( ops, fans of this movie are already mentally impaired ). <br/><br/>The movie kind of start after 40 minutes and Bella is more confident, stronger, determined.. Finally there is a male figure in this relationship between her and Edward.. And she is the male, of course.. <br/><br/>Jacob decides to tell Bella's father what is going on ( how come this guy doesn't know anything ? ). He starts taking his clothes off to tell Bella's father the ""Truth"".. How awkward can it be ? Why didn't he just say ? Aaarrtggh !! <br/><br/>Bella's daughter face is made in CGI.. While you watch it you feel like her face is melting,.. Horrible ! <br/><br/>After some weeks Bella's father sees her grand daughter again and the girl is the size of a twelve year old girl.. He just says.. ""Wow, you've really grown"" What ??? Didn't he find it any strange ?? Aaaarrgghn !! Again ! <br/><br/>Finally, there comes the only part of the movie which is interesting. The battle of the vampires. But before that the Cullens gang try to gather some of their friends and then it becomes X-Men. There are some vampires like Bruno Mars, two Russians, two Brazilian ( transvestites and Indians ) and they start showing their ""powers"". One vampire controls the elements, the other the electricity, the other one controls something by blinking his a** hole, etc.. Totally stupid.. <br/><br/>And then there is the battle. Finally something interesting, real action scenes, vampires dying, etc.. <br/><br/>But hey ! it was just a vision !! It's what one of the vampires sees in the future ! They decide not to fight and everybody goes home . NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS S*** !! <br/><br/>What a waste of time !!! G-zus ! How can anyone be pleased with this f***** S*** ?? <br/><br/>Gosh ! Thank God I didn't watch it !"

","I've read the books... I've seen the movies. Some made me cringe (Twilight), others left me actually smiling when I left the theater (Eclipse & Breaking Dawn Part 1). However I've never seen a movie before that I felt so powerful about that I had to write a review until tonight, when I saw Breaking Dawn, Part 2. <br/><br/>Within the first 5 minutes of the movie, I asked my friend if we it was a joke and the real movie would soon begin and she assured me this was the actual movie. When she said that, I knew I was in for a long 2 hours. <br/><br/>There's no beating around the bush here - it was awful. So awful that I stayed through the credits {made absolutely amazing by ""A Thousand Years"" by Christina Perri} because it signified the end of the worst lost opportunity I've even seen in a movie. <br/><br/>I know it's a sappy love story about a clumsy girl who falls in love with a misunderstood and soulfully tortured vampire while her best friend must watch from afar with only his rock hard abs to console him. But when Bella is turned into a vampire, there was an incredible opportunity for some amazing special effects. She's strong, beautiful, graceful and full of abilities she's never had before. She can cross miles in seconds, destroy trees with swipe of her hand and crush boulders with the touch of her finger. She has a cool ability too and so do all of her new friends. Unforuntaely the Bella we were treated to was equipped with absolutely none of these qualities. <br/><br/>Yes, she could run, in slow mode apparently meant to make her appear faster than light but only made me realize that I'd watched cartoons that looked more realistic. It was like watching two plastic dolls running through twigs and grass. She could scale a mountainside with ease but just ended up looking like a stilted animated toy being controlled by a 2 year old. She demonstrated her ability to crush a boulder, except the boulder was made out of paper. And while we're on the subject of the boulder, why in the world was Emmett's face so pale in this movie? It didn't even blend with the rest of his body and you could practically see the white line where his makeup ended. Actually, most of the actors had an overall plastic quality to their look, with the exception, of course, of Bella and the few chosen ones.<br/><br/>Then there's Renesemee. The young actress who played Renesemee, the child, was adorable. Since the character communicated mostly through touch, finding an actress who looked the part was very important. I felt this young lady was very close to Renesemee's description in the book, and I have to give her props for hanging in there. However the ""baby Renesemee"" just should have been left on the cutting room floor. It was such a poor simulation of a real baby that I blurted out ""Are you kidding me"" when I first saw it. <br/><br/>There were allot of ""Are you kidding me"" moments in this movie and this list is not all inclusive - it just contains what I haven't managed to purge from my memory yet: 1. Bella's awakening 2. Bella's first hunting trip 3. Baby Renesemee 4. The ""boulder scene"" 5. The Volturi (especially when Aro squealed in delight over Renesemee) 6. Bella's ""shield"" 7. The fight scenes (pick one, any one... really it's no contest – I've seen more suspense and horror on daytime soap operas back in the 80's) 8. The be-headings – nope, you can't call those be-headings. It was more like pulling the head off your baby doll. No muss, no fuss.<br/><br/>But wait... there's more. I think there were actors who didn't utter a single word. They just conveyed their strength and power through laughable makeup, bulging, glaring eyes made cartoonish through the use of contacts, heavy mascara and lots of eyeliner or by sneering with blood red lips. But they were the luck ones. Other actors had actual lines, even if it was just one word. <br/><br/>I know, I paid to see this movie. And I paid for what I had hoped would be at least worth the $20 I shelled out, including popcorn and coke so it was a relatively cheap date. But really.. This didn't even come close to being worth the money I spent. <br/><br/>Knowing this franchise has a large fan base, there has to have been quite a large amount of money generated from the books, movies, accessories, etc. But you did not see any of that money invested in this movie. It was cheaply made, poorly acted and I'm still in shock that this was the final cut. <br/><br/>Now, I admit I liked the twist they put in to justify the fighting scene. The audience's reaction to how the scene ended had me exclaiming ""Are you kidding me?"" again. I can't remember if this scene was part of the book or not, however my daughter is adamant that it was not. I thought it added a better alternative to just watching everyone try to glare each other to death. On second thought, if they had just glared at each other the movie would have ended sooner so maybe not....<br/><br/>So save yourself the money and lost time. Grab your kid's plastic dolls, go in the back yard and pretend like the dolls are running around. Add some grunts, mumbling and high pitched squeals (just for the audience's reaction to Jacob's undressing scene) and you've made a better movie than what you would have seen.<br/><br/>Just call me disappointed in the south.... I'll watch some TV instead. At least then I'm guaranteed I can find some quality entertainment (Thanks AMC, TNT and USA)."

","This is movie is SO BAD I just want to advise you NOT TO GO AND PAY A CENT FOR THIS S*** I am so disappointed I felt nauseated during the last part of the movie. I wanted to leave before the end but I wanted to be fair and watch it all so I could give a real opinion on it and here I am. <br/><br/>First I must say what is incredible is the difference between the first movie and the last one. It's like they changed the way they act or directed it for their public. This movie is good for people between 10 and 14 years old when the first movie could be watched by anybody. I'm not saying everyone could and should have liked the first movie I'm seeing it was bearable. I personally loved the first movie I thought it really respected the book and that pleased me since I had read all the books before the movies went out. Here it's like they took so much time during part 1 with two hours for 100 pages of the book that they have to go suuuuppper fast to catch up and the rhythm of the beginning is just awful. Everything goes too fast and you just have not time to get into the transformation of Bella. <br/><br/>Secondly everything in this movie is bad. The acting is awful, actors that were once good are overacting everything. The actors are so photoshoped or are wearing so much make up they look fake or like dolls... And PLEASE how can Kristen Stewart still have contracts in Hollywood???? She just cannot act. Her acting is poor, bad, horrible I just don't have enough words to say how baaaddd she acts... She is awful she destroys every movie she acts in...PLEASE FIRE HER I don't know do something just make sure she doesn't act anymore...<br/><br/>Thirdly the direction is WEIRD. There are so much close-up you just wanna yell STOP THE ZOOM. You have their faces non stop on the screen... furthermore you pass from a scene to another abruptly. There is no sense of rhythm at all. I felt it was the first time I saw a movie that was directed so badly.<br/><br/>Fourthly everything is so ""à l'eau de rose"" that it just makes you wanna puke. Even the sex scene is bad. First time in my life a sex scene is failed. I mean there are sparks in her hair oO<br/><br/>To conclude I think is the worst movie I have ever set eyes on. IF I just wish I COULD PUT ZERO giving ONE STAR FOR THIS ANNOYS ME...I wish Sheldon had invented the Time machine so I could go back in time and warn myself."

","I'm no longer a young adult - I'm quite elderly, in fact. But I have to admit I loved the book series upon which this movie franchise is based. And I have been tolerant of the 4 movies leading up to this final one, mostly because they have been pretty faithful to what I felt were the important points of the story lines. Even though the acting skills of the major characters have been sad throughout, I have been able to blame that mostly on poor direction and I could find much otherwise to enjoy. But in this final movie of the series, I just feel let down by everyone involved with it: director, actors, script-writers, special effects people, casting, producers (yes, Stephanie Meyer herself is included here!). It had been a long time since I felt cheated out of the price of a movie ticket, but I really regret wasting not only $8 for this one, but also the seemingly interminable 2 hours I lost trying to find some redeeming value while sitting through it. For a fantasy story about vampires, werewolves, and half-mortals, there was nothing remotely believable in this movie. I know nothing of making movies, but I think I could have come up with something better than this, and for a lot less money."

Two; these vampires are day-walkers for no apparent reason. Three; they look rather pale for vampires who get so much sunlight while socializing with the locals. Four; Bella's father's wannabe dumb act is hopeless. Wow! your adopted daughter has grown super quick in the last twelve months what're you feeding her?

"u_sims","1","86","296","19 November 2012"," Finally, it's over! (with spoilers)
","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is the fifth and final film in the Twilight film series, adapted from Stephenie Meyer's novel ""Breaking dawn"" and the sequel to Breaking Dawn - Part 1. It stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner retaining their lead roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen and Jacob Black. Also returning are Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Michael Sheen, Dakota Fanning, Peter Facinelli, Jamie Campbell Bower, Nikki Reed, Kellan Lutz, Maggie Grace, Jackson Rathbone, Christopher Heyerdahl, Elizabeth Reaser, Booboo Stewart and Julia Jones. Mackenzie Foy appears as Reneesme, the daughter of Bella and Edward.<br/><br/>The plot of this second part (which is definitely NOT a money-making scheme by the way guys) is that The Volturi (vampire police) find out about the kid and think it is a vampire, so start walking as slowly as they can from Italy to North-West America over a couple of months, conveniently giving the Cullens plenty of time to build up forces and defences. Bella will then do anything to protect her child from them, causing the Ultimate Showdown of Destiny.<br/><br/>However, that is not true. They could have condensed all five films into an hour-long TV film featured occasionally on the Syfy channel, omitting as much as possible. As with previous films, nothing much happens, with plenty of staring, people holding hands, kids touching people's faces, pale, creepy men making weird noises, incomprehensible zooming-in on body parts and/or inanimate objects and a new addition, lots of faces being ripped off. Although there is no blood here, to allow as many people as possible to contribute to the obscene amounts of money being made by the 'films.' As per every Twilight film, I tried to give this one a chance. No such luck however. Within the first 5 minutes, there is everything that makes a Twilight ""film"" - sub-par, emotionless and frankly diabolical acting, inane, banal and boring dialogue and some horrible visual effects. When the vampires jump, they are clearly small, poor CGI models and the directing, green-screen shots and general camera-work is poor. Now, into <br/><br/>-----SPOILER ZONE-----about half an hour of the end of the film, the whole 'final battle' section, is simply a vision. Around 70% of the cast members have their faces/other body parts ripped off or die when a convenient river of lava opens at the bottom of a field of snow, with plenty of screams and gasps from the audience as their favourite character is quickly killed off. However, all of this just turns out to be a future vision. Which means, if you cut out any parts of the film not in the present, it is 90 minutes of vampires from various places showing off abilities-----END OF SPOILER ZONE-----<br/><br/>The only redeeming factors were one very funny Wilhelm scream, which no one else in the cinema seemed to appreciate, one or two slightly funny lines that may have non-Twihards curling the corner of their mouths a bit, and slightly improved acting."
"kali_marek","2","18","50","23 December 2012"," Are you kidding me!!!!??!!
","Just to be clear from the start - I'M A WOMAN! An I'd like to make that clear because I've read and heard lots of opinions of this movie and the general trend is that women are absolutely GAGA for it, while men slander it. I saw this movie yesterday - I had better things to do before :). It wasn't much different from the previous ones - nothing really happened in the first hour. The only attempt of a good scene was the one where Bella was kicking Jacob's ass for imprinting on her daughter. The reason I say ""attempt of a good scene"" is because the woman's lack of facial expression kills the entire effort she (obviously) puts in the scene. Her mouth moves and tries to make her look disgusted, but her eyebrows are frozen - Does she use botox? And if she does, does she need to or is it just something us mere mortals who don't live on planet Hollywood don't understand? The last half hour of the movie - the battle scene - is OK. It gives it a bit of a kick. The bit that actually disappointed me was the part where we find out the battle DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN within the story. No, I didn't read the book and wasn't expecting such a turnout. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!! THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THIS MOVE DIDN'T MATTER AT ALL in the story??? You mean I just wasted the last hour and a half of my life looking at ... nothing? I was just thinking there was a bit of character in this whole thing, bits of actual personalities were emerging and then ... nothing !!!???! This is what everybody was fussing about? Even the special effects were a bit too obvious for my taste. I was willing to get over that during the battle scene, but after that awful outcome, HEEEEEELLL NO!! It all makes me wonder: Why is Dakota Fanning in this movie? They didn't use her fabulous talent for anything. They should have at least made her one hell of a bad girl, but no. They just ignored her and decided to concentrate on miss ""Ice"" Stewart. So, sorry girls, as much as I'd love to say the guys are wrong about this one, they're not. This is one BAAAAD movie. The only movie I hated more was ""2012"", and that one at least had some killer special effects."

","I fully admit I was not a fan of the book series, but I actually enjoyed the movies. They weren't great, but they were good entertainment, and I usually appreciated the changes they made. Bella was a stronger character with actual development, most of Edward's abusive tendencies were dropped, Jacob struggled with being a wolf but he was still a good person at heart, and the side characters were fantastic with great personalities we didn't see enough of. I actually had a good hope for this movie, so I dragged my best friend to see it. I've never been so mad about paying for a film in my life.<br/><br/>I don't know how they used a real baby at all, because most of the time the kid looked like poorly rendered CGI which had me laughing like a lunatic every time she came on. Well, I guess the movie gets some points for making me laugh. Unintentional, but still.<br/><br/>The thing that really grated on me was the ending. It was a complete cop-out, and it was a cop-out in the book as well. I don't care if it was a planned ending, it was planned to be a cop-out. Does it bother fans when their favorite characters die? Yes! Is is a slap to the face with a chicken cutlet like this craptastic ending was? No! I LIKED that people were dying. True, the characters who kicked it were great characters that I did enjoy, but it makes the whole thing seem more real and interesting. Not everybody can have that happily ever after, and it would have given the characters growth. Besides, spending an entire movie discussing how terrible the Volturi are just to let them go is completely asinine and insulting to the fans.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie to my greatest enemy, so if you are like me, a fan of the movie but not the book, please do yourself a favor and skip this one. Just be grateful that it's now finally over."

And now I feel like why did I even pay to see that! To me it almost felt like they were just happy to be done with the movie so they slapped something together. :'( so depressing! They could have done so much more with that movie then they did... for 2 hours not worth it in my opinion. The Fight scenes were good and the passion between Edward and Bella is really sweet, but where is Renesmee and Jacob you do not get to see them in the future except for a brief second."

Perhaps the worst example of CGI (I simply cannot believe they thought that baby was OK) in the history of lala-land. One brief moment of bloodlust, sanitised by making it justifiable because the victim had the temerity to be an English musician plying his trade in America (way to go you yank twits). Then a 20 minute battle scene which looked promising as it looked to decimate whole populations of useless actors, quickly followed by a horrible retraction.

Ms. Meyers should have stood up for her work and insisted on quality.<br/><br/>Also, the time between the release date for the last book and the movie was excessive.

","I gave it 4 stars only because I'm rounding up from the 3.5 it probably deserves. The first hour and a quarter the movie was cheesy and with horrible lines (""you nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness monster?) but in my opinion the acting was at least better than the rest. The CGI of the baby and little girl was so horrible I was actually embarrassed for the actors in the scenes who couldn't have known during shooting how silly they would look interacting with it. It was simply awful.<br/><br/>Now, what saves the movie is the last 20 minutes. I thought it was an incredible twist only truly able to be appreciated by readers of the books. I bet it made Stephanie Meyer wish she wrote it that way. It was fun to experience the audiences astonishment as events unfolded... And to be honest, I wrestled with my own unexpected feelings as I watched it. In the end though, those last 20 minutes and the great performance (as usual) by Michael Sheen saved the movie from being a wasted night.

","Let's be honest; we all know how bad the movie adaptations of the book series up to BDpt2 were, and if you think they were good then no disrespect but don't reed reviews because almost anything will entertain you.To start things off this movie is an improvement but unfortunately it makes very similar mistakes to its predecessors.<br/><br/>Acting: Even though Pattinson has shown his acknowledgeable acting skills in some of his previous movies and the fact that this movie has some skilled acting veterans in its cast. Unfortunitly the acting is still par to the average soap opera. It voids emotion in the key aspects of the movie, and exaggerates in the miner scenes. <br/><br/>Plot: I know people always say ""It was very different from the book."" But let me tell you... This was nothing like the second half of the book... Although that doesn't make it a pure disappointment(if your a fan of the series.) It had its action and emotion when it needed it but in all, saying it was way better then New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn Pt1 all together, does not make it enjoyable to the average observer.<br/><br/>In closing, If you were a fan: then you will enjoy it like you have for all the Twilight films... <br/><br/>If you are not a fan: you will wonder why these movies can make profit in the high hundreds of millions!"
"TheLittleSongbird","4","36","114","16 November 2012"," An improvement over Part 1, but goes out on a whimper rather than on a bang
","As said in my review of Breaking Dawn: Part 1, I am neither a fan or detractor of the Twilight Saga, though in terms of the books I only lasted the first chapter of the first book. Of the movies, for me the best was Eclipse, and the worst New Moon. In terms of Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 I'd say that it is a marginal improvement over Breaking Dawn: Part 1 and ranking the whole saga I'd put it bang in the middle, but for a finale to a film series I found it very underwhelming.<br/><br/>Does it have good points? Yes actually. I did think the scenery was really lovely, very evergreen-looking, and the photography did have some nice shots(some of the zooming though does get too much). I also thought that Breaking Dawn: Part 2 did have the best music score, courtesy of Carter Burwell, of the saga, and that Renesmee was just adorable. There are a few performances that were quite good. Michael Sheen does ham things up but he is gleefully fun to watch, Billy Burke is once again amusing and Ashley Greene is good as Alice. Dakota Fanning is also not too bad, I think an improvement over the previous instalments, but I have seen her give better performances in better movies.<br/><br/>That said, I am still not convinced by the acting of the three leads. I will say though that Kristen Stewart does give her best performance of the series, she does finally crack a smile after looking bored previously, she doesn't mope around as much and she does show some genuine concern regarding Bella's situation. However, and it doesn't help that Bella(in my eyes) is such a dull and unlikeable character, I still didn't find her entirely convincing, her eyes show no signs of life, her face lacks expression and she has a lot of flat line delivery. Robert Pattinson does have some sweet chemistry with her, but he does look constipated a lot and his facial expressions have a tendency to be on the hammy side. They are not that bad though compared to Taylor Lautner, who is unbearably wooden here as Jacob and the constant taking off of his shirt got old quickly.<br/><br/>On top of that, Bill Condon's direction seems rather uninspired. I am familiar with Condon and do find him a promising director/writer who observes things well, Gods and Monsters is one of my favourites, Kinsey is very interesting and Dreamgirls is decent. But there is little of what these things as good as they were on display here, so as like the previous instalment there is the sense that Condon was not in his comfort zone. A lot of things don't help though, as the dialogue continues to be clunky and almost like watching an overly-melodramatic soap opera- especially in the first half where everything is lacking in any kind of intent- and the story is plodding- though the beginning also manages to feel very rushed- in its exposition with scenes dragging on too long and very little that is exciting or surprising. The ending has no real gusto or emotional punch(though actually it still manages to be the highlight of the entire film), the fight scenes are clumsily choreographed, the opening credits go on for far too long and you just don't care for any of the characters.<br/><br/>In regard to the special effects and make-up, they are pretty terrible here. The computer generated wolves manage to be both cheesy and stupid in design and manner and the red glaring contact lenses look dodgy and are more at home in a cartoon. While Renesmee as a baby looks so creepily fake that it is laughable, the be-headings are the equivalent of ripping the head of your favourite toy in a rage and the white greasepaint passing for make-up all looks blotchy and artificial. The closing moments are clichéd and reek of cheese as well, and the vampires are as far away from authentic as you could come. Overall, not the best or worst of the series, but for a saga finale it was underwhelming, where it had potential to go out on a bang it was more of a whimper.<br/><br/>4/10 Bethany Cox"
"DJRMewzique","4","29","89","17 November 2012"," Best of the series? Um, no.
","For most, the Twilight Saga has been something either you loved or had no interest in.... If you got past the first film, you were probably in it for the long haul. I was one of those...but unlike the TwiHards and such, it has not been an enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>""Twilight,"" the first film, was great. I thought everything about it was incredibly entertaining, albeit far from perfect. However, that is where it peaked for me. With every subsequent film, ""New Moon,"" ""Eclipse"" and the first part of ""Breaking Dawn,"" these films got worse and worse and worse.<br/><br/>And worse.<br/><br/>But as I started this pop culture phenomenal, goddamit, I was going to finish it. And what made the last installment the worst one of the bunch was that there wasn't even a decent consolation prize of gratuitous Lautner nakedness lasting more than eight seconds to make up for the two hours of soap-opera-like pseudo-silly-eye-rolling-drama that we had to endure.<br/><br/>Like, c'mon! And thus, that FINALLY brings us to the final chapter of the series, where everything comes to head and we say goodbye to these characters once and for all. And has anything gotten any better? Uh...no.<br/><br/>As Bella comes to terms with her new status as Trampire (and her transition was the easiest I've seen of any vampire story), the feared Volturi are gonna come aknocking as they believe a huge taboo has been committed...that the half-human/half-vamp baby of her and Edward was not born but rather created! Oh no! So, the whole last film and the first hour and a bit of this one has been a set up for the final conflict...a conflict that takes forever to get to, finally has some amazing appeal and violence, and then a plot twist just ruins it all in a millisecond.<br/><br/>And there you are. Disappointed again. But I will give it credit for having a touching final scene and an impressive final credit role.<br/><br/>So, many may claim this is the best of the series, but they would be dead wrong, so to speak. It is definitely the best out of the last four, no doubt, but after the first film, nothing has been able to rise above crap. The acting in this one is just as cardboard as ever, Stewart having not improved her ability to be one of the most popular horrible actresses in Hollywood. When Taylor Lautner is the best actor in your film, you know you may not be in the greatest production.<br/><br/>But on that note, there is an excellent scene where Lautner strips down. And for that, this film does go from 3 to 4 out of 10...and those of us who were most motivated to see these the last four films by Lautner's pecs, we thank you."

I just ended up watching the long awaited sequel of the immensely funny parody called 'Vampires Suck'. But this was Breaking Dawn Part II I had just watched. Or am I confused? Are they one and the same or not? You decide. <br/><br/>In any case, Bella apparently had a baby and we had seen in the previous edition that Edward had turned her into a vampire to save her from almost certain death while delivering the half human half vampire baby. That apparently is a threat to the Volturi and this leads to an all out war with the Cullens. A lot of ham acting, silly incidents, and CGI mayhem later, we finally got to leave, thankful that there aren't any more of this farce to wait for (stupidly, I might add),in the future. And to quote from 'FRIENDS' ""This is two hours of my life, I am never getting back"".<br/><br/>PS - This is not a finale like that of the Lord of the Rings: The return of the King (or I have an egg on my face for comparing the two)!

The plot was stop and start for the first hour. It would be going in one direction and then just stop awkwardly to cut to an arm wrestle scene or topless scene that added zero value; this must have happened 4 or 5 times.<br/><br/>Apart from the hilarious stop and start opening, it was incredibly bland. The one liners detracted from the fact that all of these people were facing certain death from an army of 30 vampires. When any action finally took place, it got slightly interesting before making the biggest plot faux pas imaginable - you'll see.<br/><br/>All that this had going for it was a small dose of action and some interestingly surreal videography.

"elie-fares16","5","15","41","15 November 2012"," The Twilight Saga ends with a bang... whatever that means.
","When it comes to the Twilight series, both the books and the movies have been, umm, less than stellar. The pages that I read way before the first movie was even released told a redundant story that has affected the genre it discussed negatively and the movies took it upon themselves to worsen it even further. The story is so concise that I managed to tell the few thousand pages to a friend in one paragraph. If that's not a concise summary, I don't know what is. When it comes to the final Twilight book, any reader of the series can attest that there's almost nothing that happens in it – or at least in its second half – so the decision to split it into two movies was purely for commercial reasons, which is very obvious.<br/><br/>One thing to say about Breaking Dawn Part 2 though is that, while it is still a weak movie as far as movies go, it's well above the average for a franchise that has become synonymous with cheap quick money and it's also much better than its corresponding half of the last book installment in the Twilight Saga. Much better actually, which goes to show exactly how good the book was.<br/><br/>Bella, now a vampire, is adapting to the changes that her condition imposes. But she has uncanny self-control, enabling her to run away from human blood even on her first hunting trip. The daughter she almost died giving birth to has grown immensely in the two days during which Bella underwent her transformation. And her daughter keeps growing before her until a vampire sees her and reports her to the Volturi, the council governing all vampires, as an immortal child: children turned vampires, which are also illegal and cause an automatic death sentence on their maker. So the Cullen clan starts preparing for a final showdown against the Volturi, asking for the help of anyone who could listen.<br/><br/>The script of Breaking Dawn Part 2 is mechanic. The acting is robotic. The direction is fill in by numbers. The actors give these looks that try to penetrate into your soul way too many times, eventually ending up becoming just awkward. Kristen Stewart is better as Bella in this movie than she has been in the previous ones. She actually smiles more than once. Rejoice, maybe? Robert Pattinson still looks and sounds constipated in every single scene he acts. Taylor Lautner is still here only to get the girls in the theater to scream at the sight of his abs. He shows them once, for the record. But you're not here for their acting, which is more often than not borderline comical.<br/><br/>The score by Carter Burwell, on the other hand, is pleasant to listen to. The departures the movie takes from the book are also quite shocking. That's probably the only reason why I left the movie feeling that it wasn't all too bad. So for readers of the books, prepare to be positively surprised as well as shocked towards the end.<br/><br/>For everyone else, here's how it breaks down into: if you've been able to tolerate the previous movies then you'll find this one much better. If you couldn't stand the previous movies but watched them begrudgingly, then this one will still be better. If you have absolutely no idea what Twilight is and wish it to remain this way then lucky you should steer clear.<br/><br/>As the movie opens worldwide tomorrow, almost everyone will draw a sigh of relief as this part of cinematic history comes to a close. And what a -insert any derogatory adjective you want- chapter it has been. However, for such an underwhelming and depressingly horrible movie series, Breaking Dawn part 2 ends it with a bang – or as good as a bang that could be for the standards that Twilight has set for itself. The series' die-hard fans (or twihards as they call themselves) will be happy with it.<br/><br/>5.5/10 - just for managing to shock me.<br/><br/>My review can also be found here: http://stateofmind13.com/2012/11/15/twilight-breaking- dawn-part-2-movie-review/"

","I've just seen last installment of The Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2. I've watched all the five films of the series at a midnight screening, with a lot of screaming and anxious fans like me. I love those screenings... but the films, not so much. <br/><br/>That last one is like a grocery list, at least at the beginning. Bella's wakening - check. Kissing Edward - check. Hunting - check. Renesmé - check. Imprinting - check. Sex - check. They are essentially facts in images, not a narrative, not a story. And that, for me, is the major fault of Ms. Rosenberg and the four different directors in translating the Stephenie Meyer's books to the screen - they are good in nail everything that is secondary, but what really matters is left behind. The fidelity of a adaptation resides not in the facts, but in telling the story that were told in words. Yes, it is always a matter of interpretation. Yes, some can always disagree... But it is not what happened with all the Twilight movie's. They have no soul, no sentiment, and it is frustrating seeing it film after film. Some can say that the books are not so well written. OK, but I loved the story that are told in the four of them. The films weren't able to tell that story, though. <br/><br/>There are some funny scenes in the wrong moments. The beginning is so fast that is confusing. The opening credits last forever, but Bella's perceptions of her new life are rushed without reason. Edward is not the same character as in the books, but is figured as a horny distracted husband... The confrontation with the Denalis is out of place - they would never confront each other that way. Bella taking out Jake of the house like a bad dog is insane. Those last are not only different from the books, but collide with the characters and the story - the focus is always in the action in detriment of an honest narrative. <br/><br/>Garret and Kate are great; Bella and Jacob's dialogue in the car is funny and spontaneous...but, like I've said, secondary. The last moments are sweet, but can't hide what is lacking in the rest of the movie, what is unreasonable lacking. The ""little twist"", as they call it, is great, and confirms what I said before about an adaptation from a book to the screen: it is about the story we read and how to tell it, not the facts. But, despite that one, the movie is really disappointing. I can't understand how competent filmmakers can be so careless and relapse with a story that reached so many people, and in a production of that magnitude.<br/><br/>For that, I'm really glad that I won't be through all of that next year. But that is not such a comfort right now."

","Oh, finally! After four highly-successful blockbuster movies (beginning with 2008's TWILIGHT and right up to 2011's THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1), the lucrative series has come to an end with the fifth and final chapter that sees director Bill Condon back for the second round. In BREAKING DAWN - PART 1, he had a difficult task to adapt what was widely regarded the most controversial book of the series which dramatically alternated from high-school romance to darker subject matters like intimacy issues and unexpected pregnancy. He succeeded some of those elements there, but mostly failed to deliver a compelling whole due to his lackluster direction. So now he returns with THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2, and I'm eager to see whether he saves the best for the last. For some reasons, there are slight improvements here and there. But overall, given the fact this is the final chapter of a highly-regarded series, it remains as a disappointment.<br/><br/>Continue where BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 has last left off, we already learn that Bella Swan has become a vampire after her new husband Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) save her during the near-death childbirth of their half-vampire/half-human hybrid daughter Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). Now Bella feels much more alive than ever, super-strong and also super-sensitive. She tries to cope with her newfound life as a bloodsucking vampire, who trains herself to drink animals rather than humans as well as her power. At the same time, Bella and Edward are worried about Renesmee's aging process which grows at an abnormally fast rate.<br/><br/>But none of that are more worse when Alice (Ashley Greene) receives a psychic vision that the Volturi, lead by Aro (Michael Sheen) will be coming to kill the entire Cullen for breaking the law. Apparently the Volturi finds out about Renesmee's existence and they are misinformed that the little girl is an immortal child that could put all of their vampire kind into jeopardy.<br/><br/>The first half is especially long-winded, while the pacing is as slacking as it goes. Likewise, some of the dialogues from Melissa Rosenberg's tepid screenplay is cringeworthy. All the acting parts here are mixed bag. However, a little credit should goes to the notoriously brooding Kristen Stewart for letting loose in her role as a vampire. The rest, including Robert Pattinson's Edward Cullen and Taylor Lautner's Jacob Black, are more or less the same stereotypical self. Meanwhile, it's nice to see Michael Sheen has a fun time playing an over-the-top, maniacal Aro.<br/><br/>Bill Condon's direction remains as pedestrian as ever, but not until he gives a jolt of life with the final 30 minutes. For a while there, Condon has finally redeems himself with the third-act epic showdown between the good vampires and werewolves and the evil Volturi in an open, snowy land. What follows next is a show-stopping moment of CG-heavy, violently exciting battle (with heads ripped off and such), which is frequently heightened by Carter Burwell's pulse-pounding score.<br/><br/>All seems to be a good turning point, until Condon and Rosenberg almost ruins everything by yanking off all the excitement with a twist revelation that had me in the WTF-moment (you just have to see it for yourself). If you can swallow that particular moment, there's a remaining closure that ends with a classy note reflecting all previous TWILIGHT series' moments -- all accompanied with Christina Perri's achingly beautiful song, A Thousand Years.<br/><br/>Technical credits are above average, while most of the special effects remains as spotty as ever. The F/X transformation of Renesmee's rapid aging process is especially cheap-looking.<br/><br/>http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"

","I am going to go ahead and confess that I have not seen any of the other Twilight films. I guess I am the person that buys the book, but only reads the last chapter (smile). I do have to say that in this case it really did not matter. There is so much publicity about these films that I pretty much know what happened in the other ones, so I really don't feel like I missed much. I don't even think that I needed to see part one of this 2-parter. This film could have stood on its own. I enjoyed all the special effects in the film, but I do have to say that when Renesmee was a new born the CGI kind of reminded me of an E-Trade baby. In this film Bella (Kristen Stewart) is getting used to the idea that she is now a vampire and is starting to flex her super natural powers. She also has to adjust her diet and Edward (Robert Pattinson) has the daunting task of helping her to control some of her now instinctual urges. I have to say that I thought that the vampires would be scarier than they actually were. Even the vampires of the Volturi were not that bad. I do want to say that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) was one big werewolf compared to the other ones. The whole story centers around a rumor gone wild and what can happen if you don't present all the facts. I think that I was a little disappointed because I thought that there would be more action than there was. Just to recap, you do not have to be a Twi-hard fan to see this film. I think that the ending was unexpected. I saw an interview that Kristen Stewart gave and she said that when the film was over, the whole cast did a dance number in the snow. I was hoping that they would put that at the end of the credits, but I am sure that it will pop up sooner or later. Will this film make me want to go back and see the rest of them., no, but I am glad that I saw this one. Some folks that have seen them all say that this is the best one. I can't agree or disagree, but I am going to take their word for it. I was not blown away so I am giving this film an amber light."
"kaylynne-collier","3","10","25","25 November 2012"," List of all the things that went wrong in this movie.
","1) Bella is STILL weak, even after transforming into a superhuman vampire. She still needs Edward for everything that she does, she's still emotionally all over the place (while still maintaining the same facial expression, coincidently) and can't control herself around a human the first time, but for some reason she is perfectly okay to be around humans after that encounter. She doesn't want to eat her baby, and doesn't want to eat her dad, which seems to be inaccurate from what the previous movies suggested... In New Moon, even though Jasper fed off of animals, he still had urges for human blood, so much so that when he saw a drop of Bella's blood, he went ballistic. But Bella's just fine, for some reason. These films only stay consistent with their ideas when they're convenient. <br/><br/>2) This movie deals a lot with the idea of pacifism, even though it's about blood-sucking vampires and werewolves. They try to collect witnesses to Renesmee, even though in the book that never happened...They just gathered people to fight with them. In they end, they end up fighting despite their best efforts to not have an awesome action scene. Main characters get killed off, which is a shocker to the audience. Some interesting fighting moves get displayed and the vampires get to unleash their special powers... And they finally defeat the Vultaire (or whatever it's called). Buuutttt....... ALAS, that does not happen. Instead, it's just Alice's vision that's been shown to the main vampire guy. Just when I was getting into the whole fighting and main characters dying, that happens. The biggest disappointment to ever happen to me while watching a film. It feels like as if Harry Potter woke up and all his adventures were a dream, and he still lives underneath his uncle's staircase... Well, maybe not that traumatic, but still. It was a terrible decision on the writer's part. So, they just all walk away, and everything's just dandy. JUST DANDY.<br/><br/>3) The pacing was extremely off. It would jump around from scene to scene, confusing the audience. It was just all over the place. It's like they took everything that they shot and couldn't find a cohesive order to put them in, and just kinda drew from a hat which scenes should go where.<br/><br/>4) There were way to many pointless scenes that lasted like 30 seconds. It felt like a 10th grader who doesn't know how to edit's film project. ""Oh? We weren't supposed to use this footage? WELL I SHOULD PUT IT IN THERE THEN! :D""<br/><br/>5) I expected this movie to be, you know, a little better than the other ones, since it was the last one. I found that with the Twlight Saga movies, I just kept on getting increasingly more disappointed with each movie I watched. No wonder each film has a different director. NO ONE WANTS TO HAVE THEIR NAME ON THESE FILMS!<br/><br/>And with that, the great journey of the worst movie franchise ever...<br/><br/>Ends.<br/><br/>You now have full permission to party."

","Honestly, I'm not a Twilight doomsayer. I found the first couple at least fair to decent, but the series did deteriorate.<br/><br/>When I watched and cackled during Breaking Dawn Part 1, I couldn't believe how bad the film was, but my wife, in her wisdom and accuracy said 'you shouldn't see part 2 then'. I responded with 'well part 1 was terrible - generally without dialogue or direction and the CG that has been awful through the other movies has continued the tradition in part 1.' Honestly, those wolves are so poorly modeled and animated, it's painful.<br/><br/>My wife looked at me and said, 'I really don't want to be in the room with you if you watch part 2'. She was right. She didn't want to be in the room.<br/><br/>OMG, that baby was complete freakshow. I think Sharktopus on the SciFi channel was built and rigged better. Baby needs bloom.<br/><br/>Part 2 sadly is without dialogue or direction. The special effects cause a migration in the film from just bad to humorous so that leaves me with this rating.<br/><br/>I might have rated it slightly higher if it hadn't cost so much. I know where the money went in this film, but it wasn't in production, creation, concept or detail.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film if you can"
"fuzzbll","3","14","38","23 November 2012"," Now.. kiss!
","Damn.<br/><br/>I was a fan of the first three books.. then came the fourth and I didn't like it. Well, actually I didn't like the ending: all blah, blah, blah, making you believe there's gonna be this huge terrible fight and then nothing. So I knew what I had to expect from the last movie. But damn. That movie was even worse than the book and I'm still amazed how that could be accomplished.<br/><br/>I liked the previous movies somehow.. with ""Eclipse"" being my 'favorite' one. And I couldn't really see why everyone was complaining about Kristen Stewart or the whole cast for that matter. I don't know why, maybe I didn't want to see it before or this movie was just so very bad. But the acting was terrible. I mean, really, really terrible.<br/><br/>For example this whole ""I'll fight with you"" - scene. I can't shake the feeling the director wanted to imitate the scene from Lord of the Rings at Erlond's council, where everyone stood by Frodo. I swear I almost saw Gimli in ""Breaking Dawn"" offering Bella his ax.. and a moment later chop her head off. Nah, seriously though they tried to create an intense scene and failed. Miserably.<br/><br/>And the romance was... I don't know. It is almost like the director is a 13-year old person who has the power to make people kiss; if they want to or not. Combine that with awkward CGI effects and you have an awkward movie.<br/><br/>But hey, at least Bella wasn't all that dependent on Edward - she was now the one protecting him. Which was a nice change, but the fact remains that the Twilight-Saga (movies and books alike) is a real bad example for girls and women everywhere. Frankly, if I were to have kids I wouldn't want them to become like Bella: no self-respect and her entire world depends on one man for whom she does everything without question.<br/><br/>Long story short, this movie sucked. And the only reason I'm not rating it with 1 star is that I had a few laughs, thanks to Emmett and Charlie."
"GSeditor","2","30","94","15 November 2012"," For Non-Fans: Only marginally less boring from the 1st Part
","This series obviously has a great number of fans and I guess anyone who had enjoyed even the previous entry in the series (Part 1 of Breakinng Dawn) will also enjoy this Part 2. For non-fans, on the other hand, there is not any reason to give Part 2 a chance. It is only marginally less boring than Part 1. For instance, the climactic confrontation is not handled with any gusto and appears pretty lame. I don't have any problem in principle with soap opera dynamics if they feature some genuine dramatic tension, as the first sequel had to some degree (with regards to Bella's ambivalent attachment to Jacob) and I had enjoyed that one on its own merits. But once Bella and her pale-face lover made up and settled, the series had ran out of dramatic fuel. Yes, Kristen Stewart is a very attractive young woman and there is some pleasure in viewing her pretty face on big screen, but that's all there is to it really."
"Blackbird8","4","9","22","23 December 2012"," The scene that saved the day
","It's hard for me to understand what it is that Twilight fans expect when they approach a new twilight movie release. More than once I've seen them displeased with the results, but what is there to be displeased about? The books have very poor character development, a plot with more holes than accuracies and a web of ""convenient happenings"" that always end up transforming the story into nothing more than a series of catastrophic events that always, yes always, end wonderfully well for everybody. Everything is always so convenient that the only characters to ever suffer any consequences are the ones made up in such a hurry that no one would ever get attached to them that quickly. So, what happens when the movie is just that? Nothing, because it's a faithful copy of the book<br/><br/>It there's one thing the twilight movies have always been consistent about is their poor plot development. The narrative is slow and often choppy. The characters are terribly alike, and almost all of them share a poker face that inhibits them from showing any emotion whatsoever. The only new fiasco the movies provide is poor visual effects. But, let's face it, that's a budget issue and a little lack of creativity that comes from the awful need to please the fans and show them everything exactly as the books narrate it. So, once again, it all comes down to being chained to the original story. <br/><br/>So, basically, after watching four movies that are practically the same thing you can't really expect much of an improvement during the fifth installment, can you? Well, Bill Condon, director of Breaking Dawn, begs to differ. I have no idea how he dared to suggest the last climatic sequence of the movie he recreated, but it feels like he basically said: we have to fix this, otherwise this movie will spend hours of build up that ultimately turns into: nothing. <br/><br/>So, what did he do? The movie constructed a, never before seen in the Twilight saga, fight scene where valuable lives are actually lost and for once the good guys are not almighty Greek gods that will survive anything, anytime of the day. The scene is actually pretty exciting, especially when you start to see the main characters reacting to the loss of their loved ones, fighting harder to revenge them and especially to protect everything they have left. Once the main characters start winning and kicking some bad vampire butts the sequence becomes even more exciting, especially for the viewers who all these years have been sadly trained to put up with two hours of pointless buildup. I'm talking here about boyfriends, parents and best friends who sit next to the fans and painfully roll their eyes every fifteen minutes. <br/><br/>Overall, and except for a few weird CGIs, the sequence is pretty good. Of course, it all ends up being a vision, but even that moment of disappointment serves well to add substance to the original story. The fake fight scene helps to save the day, convincing Aro (leader of the Vulturi) that it is not convenient for him to fight against the heroes of the story. Even that explanation had a better construction than the one provided in the book. The sense of danger, loss and excitement this last fight scene adds to the story provide something the rest of the movies lack of: closure. After it all happens (or almost happens) you can finally sit back and tolerate the last minutes of the story, the kissing, the romance, the happy ending, because even if the scene was nothing more than a vision, it helped to develop a little emotion towards the main characters. <br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is pretty much the same as always: Bella is lucky for everything she has, her happiness is suddenly in danger, and she whines a little to eventually get everything she wants. The scenes often feel awkward and never ending. Almost all the characters feel alike, but at least we are entertained from time to time with some interesting new additions, even if their contribution to the movie is very little. <br/><br/>Having all this said, I have to be fair. Us, non-twilight fans are not the ones to truly break the box office, are we? So, whom would the producers of an -all about the money- franchise rather please? Whinny fans or whinny critics? <br/><br/>You guessed right."
"flyn905","3","9","22","29 November 2012"," They had a chance to shine, but...
","unfortunately, Breaking Dawn II popped my balloon of hope. I am a fan of the books, and I faithfully saw all of the movies, hoping that the characters would be fleshed out on the big screen. For the record, Alice Cullen creeps me out, and Bella would be better off dumping Edward, moving back in with her mother, going to college, and getting a life.<br/><br/>As for the films: Twilight--well it was the first, so one has to allow for growing pains and a script full of teenage angst. New Moon--I was glad to see Taylor Lautner given more screen time, he actually may grow into a decent supporting actor. Eclipse--best part of this movie was Riley, Victoria, and the Wolves. Breaking Dawn part I--I was so hoping that KS and RP would have matured into their roles. I thought the post-coital makeup on KS was beautiful, but the birth scenes were downright gross. Some things need to be left to the imagination, I guess. Breaking Dawn part II--some funny bits in there, particularly when Carlisle explains about the Immortal Children and how beautiful they were, then a shot of Renesmee shows how utterly CGI weird-looking she is, but I don't think that was supposed to be funny. A much needed transfusion (pun intended) was added by the new vampires, but sadly, there is only so much one can do with this script. I feel guilty about dragging my husband to this movie, but he did say it was better than ""Marie Antoinette"". Go see the movie, get it out of your system, and forget about the Twilight Series. I already have."
"evan_harvey","4","9","22","23 November 2012"," Don't believe the hype - the ending sucks
","The short: It's another Twilight film. What else did you expect? More about the hyped ending soon.<br/><br/>The long: It's like all the other Twilight films: shallow plot, some humour, some lame sparkly vampires, some CGI wolves etc.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart looks hot. Robert Pattinson looks pale. The CGI baby looks fake.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is what it is. I still think the first Twilight film was the best. It had the right dark mood, colours/palette and an excellent score by Carter Burwell. The following installments went for the more commercial/mainstream feel, and I think the franchise suffered as a result.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** So, what about the ending that everyone is talking about? Yes, there is a ""twist"", and it ruins the film. Absolutely ruins it. It cheats the audience and diminishes the story.<br/><br/>But why? Well, to begin with, the fight scene is great. There's werewolves fighting, vampires getting their heads ripped off and so on. All in all, it's not a bad fight scene. Some main characters die, on both sides. That is quite shocking, and it ups the stakes all round.<br/><br/>But we find out afterwards that it's all just a vision that Alice shows the Volturi, and it never happens. And that robs the audience of the cathartic release of the tension that has been built throughout the whole film. True victory is only measured against the cost required to achieve it. A victory that is hard fought and incurs substantial loss becomes bittersweet and all the more important as a result. Those who died for the freedom of others did so because they thought it was worth it. Because this victory cost nothing, it is ultimately worthless, and robs the audience of that emotion.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's recent film ""The Grey"" screwed the audience in the same way. We were all psyched up to see him lay it on the line to fight the wolf (and most likely die horribly), but the stupid director stole that moment from us. That Liam Neeson was going to get torn apart isn't the point; he wouldn't have needed to actually win in order to win, if that makes sense. The mere act of going into the battle and being fully committed to it would have been enough. His courage would have won regardless of the outcome. By stealing that from the audience, the immature director has weakened and diminished the film's theme.<br/><br/>Likewise, Bill Condon (director) does the same thing. I'm sure they thought it would be a great ""twist"" that no one sees coming, but that's cheap. Dirt cheap. To be honest, the film is pretty crap. Enjoyable, but crap. It's redeeming feature would have been the price paid by the friends and family to ensure that Bella, Edward and Renesmee (and Jacob) survived. The victory, though tinged with the sadness of loss, would have been all the more important because of the sacrifices paid to achieve it.<br/><br/>That's my take on it."
"nagyistvanandor","3","9","22","20 November 2012"," terrible with few moment of shine.
","So yup, twilight as it always was, is non-sense, terrible story, dialog, spiced with terrible actors and acting. And some even more disturbing stuff like pedophilia. I honestly think the only reason twilight saga aren't qualified for a title ""worst movie ever"" since its to screwed up to even considered to be a movie. Its kinda like a vampire teenager cross over parody thing. The best way to describe it the dramatic/romantic/big moments of the movie simply just gonna make You laugh/head palm. Which would be cool if its meant to do that, but nope its meant to be serious. And beside this moments You just literary bored to dead. <br/><br/>However there's the battle scene at the end, which suddenly pulls You in to the story and generates some real emotional reaction and excitement. (Which I was not prepared for at all, and pretty much the reason I give this thing 3 instead 1 start.) The funny thing as I figure this is the scene which was put in by the director, and was not in the book. Its kinda like he trying to send a message: ""Hey I know this hole thing was horrible, but look I can actually make a good scene. Its just, You cant build a castle from crap."" But of course for most people it will be ruined when its spins back to the lame flow of the book, and turns out the best scene in the entire saga never happened. <br/><br/>Overall this wont save the movie, or the saga. Don't go waste Your money, just be glad its finally over."

I enjoy the first three to a certain extent, even gave Breaking Dawn-Part 1 a lot of credit for being as audacious as it was. I've just grown tired of all the hype, the fan girls, and everything else. This one was rather middling in all honesty. For a final film in this series, it was rather pedestrian. As much as I love Kristen Stewart as an actress, I had a lot of trouble with some of the things she does in this movie. She's a vampire now and it should have been more exciting than it was, especially with all the circumstances surrounding it. It does have one great scene with Billy Burke, aka Charlie Swan and Bella, which is quite emotional. Overall, I just didn't care for it. <br/><br/>5/10"
"jkay700","5","6","13","28 March 2013"," If it didn't have the end it would be a train wreck of a film
","Now, i'm going to level with you. I'm a 17 year old boy and i am not ashamed one bit that i enjoy the Twilight saga. When i went to see this at the cinema i had high hopes, i haven't read the books so i had no idea what to expect. It carried straight on from the previous 'Breaking Dawn Part 1', which pleased me as we hadn't missed out on anything. Yes, Bella is a vampire now, Jacob doesn't want her anymore and Edward is still the same person (but he does smile a lot more in this movie!). The film is very slow to begin with, in fact i got up to use the toilet and i didn't miss anything. When Bella is exploring her new vampire capabilities, we get our first glimpse of the CGI the millions of dollars went on. Honestly, it is awful. It made me feel so disconnected from the film. I like to be drawn into the story and to get lost in the world of whatever i'm watching, but the CGI just continually reminded me i was in a cinema watching a film i've overpaid for. The film then spirals out of control with the Cullens getting into trouble with the Volturi. Then comes the moment all the guys who had been dragged to watch it by their girlfriends had been waiting for. The epic fight scene! Now i said this review contains spoilers, but you need to watch this for yourself. The fight is amazing, however the big plot twist made me want to throw whatever was left of my popcorn at the screen. The ending moment between Bella and Edward really made the film for me. I love the chemistry Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart had through the whole saga, and we get to revisit that one last time, which i thought was a beautiful moment. Personally i thought the acting was quite good. Robert Pattinson plays the character how he sees it and to me, is the sign of an outstanding actor. Kristen Stewart, as moody as she may be, even managed to smile a bit in this! Taylor Lautner for me was the weakest, but he doesn't really have much of a part in this one, he always seems to be in 'Wolf Mode' or just starting people down. Overall a solid 5! Lot's could of been better, but the ending reminded me of the journey we have been on with these characters and i feel it wouldn't be right to give it anything less! Goodbye Twilight!"
"haosstoposto","3","6","13","11 January 2013"," Forgettable movie
","Having seen this movie I can't say that it is terrible, but it is not good either. It's rather dull. I never read the books but I have seen the entire saga in cinema, although I am not a fan. I wanted to make review for the entire movie series but to be honest, I don't remember what happened before. This movie suffers from lack of excitement. I don't know why, but there is not a single exciting scene in this movie. The actors have managed not to show any real emotion and everything they say sounds hollow, like ordinary script-reading. We have some bad guys in black who could have been frightening for what they represent but they are also boring. But for me, the main problem in this movie (and the rest of saga) is the image of vampires. There are many, many stories about vampires and, of course, there has been some alterations regarding their powers. Some turn into bats, some not. Some are sexy, some frightening, some both. Some have mind-control power. Some are killed with wooden stakes or holy water or whatever. But they are Always nocturnal creatures. They are afraid of the sun and die from it. In this version we have vampires who glitter in the sun without dying. But whatever. It is a young adults fantasy and the main goal has been achieved: the books and the movies earned money. And the movie itself has been nominated for Golden Raspberry Award 2012 in 11 categories, which also means something. So, watch this movie and the rest of the saga if you are a fan, a movie critic or a filmoholic (or film-addict)."

","About myself: I am a teenager. I enjoyed the twilight books, the movies--not so much. I went in expecting more. People kept telling me, ""oh this movie is so much better than the others."" I went in with my friends, excited and expecting a lot. I soon realized that it was not any different. Bella was still awkward and annoying, with her stutter and super loud breathing. Edward was still impeccably stoic and awkward. And Jacob still had an awkward high voice and broody looks. As you can see, this movie is in a word-- awkward. Well moviegoers, prepare yourself for awkward make out sessions, confusing plot (for anyone who hasn't read the book in a while), and too many vampires to keep track of. Call me cynical. Call me no fun. But I am just not a fan of characters I can't relate to. I had no time to attach to any of the characters. Half of them, I could not even keep track of names. Overall, the movie is scattered, poorly acted, confusing, and gave into a lot of gimmicks. There is one particular twist that was a bit much. As you can see, I gave the film four stars. I admit, I was generous. But the film's redeeming factor was the nostalgia. It is the end of a teen era. I read the books as a middle schooler. The end credits actually made me a little misty-eyed. That particular segment was particularly well-done. There were moments that made me laugh; others were suspenseful. The battle scene was particularly well done. I almost enjoyed the film. Almost. The actors and the rushed plot did nothing for me. Overall, don't listen to the hype. It is really not all that different from the others. See it if you're feeling nostalgic, but if you're looking for quality film, don't see it."

There are wonderful commentaries on Amazon about the books.<br/><br/>You all know the unlikeable and emotionless character of Bella seem more disgusting with Kristen right? NO. It is not. Kristen is an improvement actually. Because Bella in the book is more boring, more emotionless, more self-centered, more pathetic and ... I have no words left to describe what an awful girl she is. There is nothing on earth to make her pleased -at least- for a split second... except Edward of course. Well, the movie makes Bella a better person, believe me.

Jacob loves Bella but also wish to be a couple with a baby when she grows up. Ah yes Edward is dead, he has no heart beat but somehow non-existing blood works on his genitals and got Bella pregnant in the previous part 1 right? They torture Charlie because Bella has no emotion, dedication or love towards anybody else but Edward. They show off new super powers. Edward enjoys how Bella kicks people.. or wolfs. We realize that Bella has a huge Ego too. There is a Waterbender and and a phone charger. (Such Novelty) There is a constant representation of love between couples.

I cant believe im gonna say this but Kristen Stewart wasn't totally awful! The film trots along at a good pace and has a fantastic ending which you just don't see coming. The new vamps we meet are great and Michael Sheen, well, shines as Aro. I honestly thought my sister and I would have a good laugh poking fun at this film as we have the previous ones but i found it gripping. Bella is sooo much more likable as a vamp and Edward seems to have shifted that constipation that seemed to be bothering him in the other 4 films and is much more relaxed and normal. Billy Burke as usual puts in a great performance as Charlie and Taylor Lautner comes into his own as Jacob. The only eye roll moment for me was the obvious and very badly animated CGI baby, although luckily we don't see much of it. This film had me both chuckling and gasping in shock at all the right places. Im so glad they got the last film nailed as it goes some way to redeeming the others before it. Pleasantly surprised."

I don't know about other people but I think the True Blood or Vampire Diaries vampires are better depicted than Twilight. As for the so called werewolves they aren't actually werewolves to a Native American they are known as Skinwalkers. Since the wolf only appears to be stuck to Native Americans in the movie. We all know what werewolves are, had Jacob been a real werewolf keeping Bella alive would have been Edward's real problem. To those who haven't watched yet think of the X-Men turned vampire.

","Finally; let's put a stake in this terrible franchise by review the final chapter of the Twilight movies (no, I will not call it a ""Saga""). <br/><br/>You know, even though these movies aren't technically that great (actually, they're pretty awful) I will not deny that, much like movies like Dungeons and Dragons or Commando, these movies are a lot of fun to watch. In terms of comedy, I really enjoy the first four Twilight movies. They're stupid, nonsensical, and make very little sense, but they're a good time.<br/><br/>One major problem with this movie is, of course, the story, but for very different reasons. The first four movies are very paper-thin when it comes to the plot, so I can't help but think that the director of this film overcompensates with this final installment by throwing a lot of new ideas and characters at you. This makes the film really hard to follow a lot of the time.<br/><br/>The three main actors are just as bland as you remember them. They show hardly any emotions at all, which make it very hard to connect with them. But, for the weaknesses of our three main characters, the film makes up for it with the supporting cast. The Cullens family is very likable and the Volturi, lead by an astonishingly over-the-top Michael Sheen, ride that fine line of being very menacing and very goofy.<br/><br/>The cinematography is awful and the special effects, most notably in the final battle, look like they have the budget of a sci-fi special. I honestly do not understand how these movies have such poor effects when they rake in millions of dollars per movie.<br/><br/>Okay, this is where I'm going to get into spoilers a bit. The final battle confrontation with the Volturi is exactly what you'd come to expect from a Twilight movie: the effects are bad, the dialogue is lame, and the acting is sterile. But the film takes a very interesting turn when the actual fighting starts: people start dying left and right. Seriously, it's kind of awesome. And, if this is the ending the filmmakers had stuck with, I actually would have considered giving this movie a 5 or 6.<br/><br/>But no, the film pulls the ultimate cop out in any movie: it was all in someone's head. I won't divulge how since the reason makes very little sense, but that ending is really unsatisfying. They probably wanted to stick closer to the books this way (which I haven't read), but if that's the case, why even have a battle at all?<br/><br/>Final verdict: This is the best Twilight movie, but it is by no means a good movie. If you're a fan of the books or like to make fun of the movies (like me), then chances are you've already seen it. If not, you're money would be better off spent on Skyfall."

","So I got returned from taking my Younger Sister to see this movie. I saw all the trailers over the past few months, yet I had absolutely NO hope for this movie. But I had seen all of the previous ones... and out of those 4, only Eclipse was the good one- but even that had its flaws! But I ended up pre-booking film tickets for this one, In IMAX, at Wimbeldon in Odeon... and now, what can I say about this movie? This movie Completely SURPRISED ME! Never been a fan of the series, gave every film a run for their money- but as it turns out, I actually had a great time with this movie. My mates at College are probably going to get pissy with me... but screw them, I'll tell them every reason.<br/><br/>Now I don't hate Kristen Stewart, but her acting ability in the previous films (Including Eclipse) have been- appalling! However, as a vampire, while her skill still isn't great, I can definitely buy her emotionless moods this time.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner, the same acting at points, but not as much of an idiot this time, so I didn't roll my eyes this time- thankfully.<br/><br/>Also, for a Twilight film- there was quite a surprisingly large amount of action, I mean there is an entire section for about 10 - 15 minutes dedicated to this- surprisingly intense Battle Sequence, which was later a huge bummer, as it actually turned out to be a Vision- which actually annoyed the hell out of the entire theatre... But despite this, I still found the Battle enjoyable...<br/><br/>So where doe's that leave us? I walked out with my Sister, with a smile on my face, speechless actually... of course it will never be the best film of the year, but it's actually worth checking out- almost makes me want to go and watch it again.<br/><br/>In the end- Basic story, Good action, Mixed Acting from all of the cast, Mixed VFX (Baby Renesmee was a little creepy, But the Shield Bella cast was pretty cool- worth the IMAX tickets, actually!).<br/><br/>I will leave this movie at 7 out of 10... Giving the entire Twilight saga, a 4.5 out of 10..."

","I loved the Twilight books, and as I watched the credits roll in this film, it upset me because when they created these films, they got it all so wrong. They had the potential to do so much with the books, but with mediocre actors, average directors and bad visual effects, the films lost the spark that the novels had, and gained a following of young girls, obsessing over the choice between Vampire and Werewolf. As for this last installment, I do think it was slightly better than it's predecessors, and much better than Breaking Dawn part one. Many parts of the film did make me cringe, especially the bad acting and the laughable special effects. If you have been enjoying the Twilight Saga films so far, you won't be disappointed, but if the films have not been meeting your expectation, don't expect this one to."

","Four books and five films later, the Twilight Saga has now ended hopefully. The last of Stephanie Meyer's books was split in two for Hollywood's latest money-grabbing scheme.<br/><br/>Part 2 is where all the drama is supposed to really kick off but after the deflating experience of part 1 it's difficult to get in the Twilight spirit. Having read the book I know how much of a dud the ending is and clearly the writers have too – I won't disclose what they do to try and solve this problem but it doesn't work and goes against nearly every rule of story-telling. Otherwise, the script is as basic as ever; the quality of these films has decreased with every sequel despite a promising beginning. The dialogue is embarrassingly simple, with laughable conversations with predictable outcomes. Not all of this is down to the script-writers however; Meyer must take some of the blame too. Sometimes you can visibly see the actors – particularly Robert Pattinson – cringing at the dialogue. The make-up always seems to get worse as these films continue - this last film saw the worst from the make-up department with the vampires clearly sticking out like sore thumbs caked in white make-up with odd contact lenses...aren't they supposed to look spectacularly hot?<br/><br/>A lot of the actors have out-done themselves in terrible acting here. Kristen Stewart was hilarious and embarrassing. In particular, scenes where she is 'angry' she looks like she's having a bowel movement and scenes where she is supposed to be motherly and instead looks to be made of stone – I will note that the creepy CGI baby would have been difficult to work with. The CGI child was a bizarre choice and looked awful. Robert Pattinson did his best but still fell flat here; his future career looks promising though. Taylor Lautner does not have a major role here but is terrible all the same. Some of the new characters such as Lee Pace's Garrett were good additions to the cast and Michael Sheen was also great except from an odd scene where he laughs in such a bizarre way – if you've seen the film you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a disappointing end to a disappointing franchise – there are some sparks of talent here but it is mostly the same old dull dialogue and acting."

","The final film in the ""Twilight"" franchise, ""Breaking Dawn 2"" finds Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) doing exactly what she did in previous instalments: TRY TO DECIDE BETWEEN BEASTIALITY AND NECROPHILIA. The problem? Her hot werewolf love interest (Taylor Lautner, totally fine) is as hot as her hot vampire love interest (Robert Pattinson as a post lawsuit Michael Jackson).<br/><br/>What's a girl to do? Easy. Have a baby with the vampire and let your newborn daughter hook up with the werewolf. Seriously. By the franchise's end, metro-sexual vampires - quiet, emotional and totally hairless - have triumphed over animalistic wolf men who, apparently, have to make do with child erotica. Who writes this stuff? <br/><br/>Stephenie Meyer, apparently. A devout Mormon, Meyer's entire franchise plays out like a Mormon's guide to abstinence and 18th century domesticity. Women are frail, tend to traditional roles, family homes resemble isolated cult covens, sex before marriage (and vampire baby abortions) is really really bad and all men are kinky dudes who exist only to rip off their shirts and direct their barely controlled, lust-filled crotches at oh-so-innocent maids who want to get down and dirty, but only in the name of God, love, destiny and arranged marriage. <br/><br/>A giant girl's fantasy, Meyer's entire franchise is about chaste, pubescent gals fretting about losing their virginity. Such romanticised abstinence is typical of teen fiction, but ""Twilight"" then veers into new territory: it is men who become guardians of virginity and female ""purity"". Whilst both Meyer's boys and girls ""boil"" and ""spontaneously combust"" with roiling passion, it's ultimately guys who prevent sexual lust from turning into actual penetration. ""I don't want to hurt you,"" sexy vampire Edward Cullen murmurs, fearful of leaving bruises on the porcelain white Bella. For Meyer, sex is dangerous, hurts, is wild, a fact which the innocent Bella doesn't know. And so Meyer has her male characters make it their priority to ""make things safe"" before copulation can begin (and even then, sex promptly leads to Bella dying). In the world of Twilight, physical safety becomes a substitute for virginity which man, gallant, protects with zeal. It's the ultimate female fantasy: to be so smoking you bring all the hormonal boys to the yard, at which point you pick the one who most gallantly resists lurching at your bodice. For Bella, love and lust aren't enough. You must love her enough not to touch her...and then touch her so hard you kill her with manly prowess. Chastity and hedonism, all in one. Kinky.<br/><br/>5/10 - Worth one viewing."

","No I didn't check the spoiler, because I wrote the end in the summary line. I think most people are aware, that this is (finally) the last movie in the Twilight universe. What started out as a nice little teenage (girl) fantasy/wet dream, became one of the most annoying series out there. For different reasons people started to hate it. Some for its popularity with young (and older) girls. But some because it was just a bad soap, with some glitter (not only over Mr. Kristen Stewart, if they actually finally stay together, forever).<br/><br/>This final fest, was actually more than just decent, not only because it had the prospect of ending it all. But that right there is just it and that is why I put the spoiler tag up, the end is as bad as anything Dallas did. You know the old, it was all a dream thing, works for TV (mostly), but it just shouldn't be used in movies.<br/><br/>Apart from that bad move, you get the usual, sulking Kristen (we know she can do better than that), a vampire that is more irritating than making people yearn for him (and Robert can act too, just don't judge him on the merits of this movie alone). And a wolf that can't let go. Literally too, with a very creepy turn concerning Bellas child (we don't know yet, if he can act though).<br/><br/>All in all, if you have watched/endured the others, what is one final piece? Almost two hours of your life, but you want to see how it ends (twice). So here we go ... Goodbye"
"freemantle_uk","5","3","5","1 June 2013"," A glorfied Fan-fic
","After four novels and five films The Twilight Saga has ended. It is a series that has its fans but also people who hate it so much that they irrationally explode in rage. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the best received movie on IMDb with a 5.6 rating at the time of this review. But how does it fare from a person who is neutral towards the series?<br/><br/>Three days after the birth of her daughter, Renesmee, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is a powerful new born vampire with fantastic strength, speed and self-control over her thirst. Werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is also no longer an issue because he is now imprinted on Renesmee and will fight to the death to protect her. But with all these changes Bella's dad (Billy Burke) has to be made aware of her change and Renesmee being a half-vampire, half-human child she ends up growing at a rapid rate being a nine year old child in months. The Volturi see Renesmee as a threat to their way of life and as an opportunity to destroy the Cullens. The Cullens go around the world to get allies to convince the Volturi that Renesmee is not a threat. <br/><br/>Breaking Dawn is the novel that even Twilight fans are critical about and the first 30 minutes seems to very self-aware about the whole series involving Bella not needing to break Edward, their sex, the lunacy of a man being in love with a baby and when Jacob strips off and reveals he is really a werewolf to Bella's dad. Then we fall into the usual melodrama and like the previous films introduces to interesting ideas but are not fully explored: this time the idea of immortal children who are never grow up mentally and therefore can never control their thirst and the hint of an old conflict between the Volturi and an Eastern European Medieval order who were much more open about their vampirism.<br/><br/>When we get to see the order vampires we see that they have a wide range of powers that make they look like the mutants from X-Men. We are introduced to a number of vampires during this film and we only get to see know a few of them. I expect we get to know more about them in the books but we only really know the characters through stereotypes: the Russian vampires spoke with comically bad accents. But the CGI is still terrible and cheap looking, resulting with a very creepy looking baby.<br/><br/>The final action sequence is the best in the series; it nothing to write home about but it is serviceable and last longer then two or three minutes. But Breaking Dawn Part 2 ends with a big cop out and has a massive deus ex machina. The whole thing felt a bit fanfictty and lazy as the writers did not want to upset anyone.<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga already tackled necrophilia and bestiality, now it has paedophilia under its belt. But because of the ridiculous nature of how it accurses the film actually acknowledges this and makes fun of it and does not show it as an romantic relationship: that would have been too weird.<br/><br/>Twilight has never been a showcase for acting and Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the same. But Lautner is surprisingly decent and it is easily the best performance I seen him give. But Stewart was the weak link in the cast this time round, having a very stiff delivery.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part 1 was the weakest entry in the series but Bill Condon does a better with follow-up: it is much faster paced and he does have some visually interesting sequence, particular the flashback to the immortal children and the film does not flinch from showing a child's death and number of decapitations. But vampires do seem surprisingly easy to kill, especially in since the first film made it out that it is very difficult to destroy a vampire. Breaking Dawn Part 2 also has an improved music score and it is the best the series has to offer, using a bit of chorus music which I have a soft spot for.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part 2 ranks dead in the middle of the series: Twilight and Eclipse are better, but New Moon and Breaking Dawn Part 1. The series should go down as forgetting then anything that is truly awful. I would like to see what would happen if a good writer was able to develop the basic ideas that the series has introduced because they is more potential then what the series was offered."

The last hour was, due to the slightly more interesting (although predictable) script, enjoyable. The acting was still mediocre at its best and the scenery/cgi cheap and childish. <br/><br/>Compared to Breaking dawn, Part I, I consider this movie to be a masterpiece and it is close to landing a four.

","Having just watched the first part of the movie, which ended saying nothing after a whole bunch of feely scenes that also said nothing, it felt only natural to consider that at some time, after all was said and (hopefully) done, there will be a point to all of this. After all, this is a ""saga"" so it must have an ""epic"" ending. And it didn't, really!<br/><br/>The first half of the film was more like part 1, then a threat was revealed and allies were gathered. This part started to get my hopes up: vampires from all over the world, each one with a different ""gift"", came together to fight the dreadful Volturi. Even the wolves joined in. And then the epic battle!<br/><br/>Let me just say that after hours of suffering the egotism and mindlessness of all involved, doing nothing and feeling a whole lot of stuff that I didn't, the ending was far from ""epic"". Also, it wasn't really the ending, which was more akin to a Dallas episode. And then the entire franchise... ended. With nothing at all to show for it.

"DICK STEEL","2","18","53","24 November 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Breaking Dawn Part 2
","And so we finally bid farewell to one film franchise that managed to survive the odds at the box office, propped by die hard fans and the curious, or by those, like me, who are completist with high threshold of pain. Despite negative and scathing reviews, the Twilight films suffered no dent in its revenue stream, and having the audacity to split the final book, like what Harry Potter did, to bring more money for the studios. But unlike the boy wizard's final installment, Breaking Dawn actually didn't have much content to justify the split, other than to dangle in its trailer an all out slug-fest, turning it into an action film with what I thought was an extremely shrewd move to get detractors into seats, just to see their hated characters getting ripped to pieces.<br/><br/>Or not. There were a couple of inherently strange and twisted plots and subplots in the franchise that I wonder just what's brewing in writer Stephenie Meyer's mind, having to go against the established grain that vampires can survive under ultra-violet light, and sparkle at that, while also developing X-Men inspired mutant powers in addition to Superman like abilities. I suppose one has to buy into Twilight's logic in order to enjoy it, but if it keeps pushing the envelope of the ridiculous, one can only call it a day, with this movie churning out a finale that I'm not embarrassed to reveal would be something for comic book movie fans, if only it had the guts to stick to what it did, rather than to cop it out, exactly in the same way how Ong Bak 3 did it.<br/><br/>But what's more disturbing are, firstly, already revealed in Breaking Dawn Part 1, was that the already dead Edward (Robert Pattinson) can actually impregnate Bella (Kristen Stuart), which even the Volturi, headed by Aro (Michael Sheen) deem impossible to happen. But it did, which events from that film, culminating in the third party Jacob (Taylor Lautner) having to sexually groom a female infant, who will grow at breakneck speed in this installment. Let's not forget he's a wolf too, so you can do the math. Fantasy romance is one thing, and some lines of decency shouldn't be crossed, considering that the novels were targeted at a particular population demographic.<br/><br/>In many ways this followed the formula employed by the slew of many superhero origin movies, with Bella, now immortal and very powerful, showing off and discovering many other new found abilities. With every challenge thrown her way, be it trying to stave off her instinct for human blood, to dealing with slightly more mature issues in reconciliation with her dad, there's nothing to even make her break into a sweat, which kind of makes it very boring indeed. And that's not all, considering that the story had thrown a lot more cardboard X-Men characters on screen, from those who can deliver electric shocks to some who can control the elements, just to fill up some half hour worth of CG laden mano-a-mano, only for the rug to be fulled under one's feet. This overshadowed the main thread of having tell the Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) story, a human-vampire hybrid who is the great unknown, with powers unseen and an unbelievable growth rate, having a pet wolf sworn to be by her side in Jacob.<br/><br/>Director Bill Condon really had his work cut out for him in making the movie, having to put up with cringe-worthy lines that will induce one to roll one's eyeballs, many times over. The acting by all from Pattinson to Stewart to the many support acts all showed a certain eager tolerance to be over and done with this. Michael Sheen hams it up in really boring fashion as the all powerful judge, jury and executioner, while Dakota Fanning probably signed on the dotted line to pay the bills, having to utter absolutely nothing, but to turn up in the office, show her face and act nasty. In fact, everyone did just that, including the leads, <br/><br/>If looked at on the whole, it's suffice to say this film franchise started off quite brightly (heh), only to have stretched itself too thin based on really lightweight material by its author. One can only put lovelorn and infatuation on screen for so many films without the feeling of repetition and deja-vu, before finally reaching its goal of a certain idea that was realized in the final installment - the crave for power and immortality, as can be seen from Bella's smirk each time someone mentions she is powerful. I suspect the story's none other than a stroke of one's ego and fantasy.<br/><br/>For the target audience, perhaps this film franchise is gold. But to the rest, well, this is something destined for the books as one really strange film anomaly."
"billygoat1071","4","13","36","19 November 2012"," The Anti-Climatic Climax
","The Twilight Saga finally ends with a bigger and more blockbustery storyline. It steps away from its broody nonsense and stands with a much more appealing way of entertainment. Many would expect for an epic satisfying ending. Unfortunately, the whole anticipation was useless. When the viewers were already having fun, the joy twists at the very end and dispirits the experience. It's like finally finding a cure for a serious disease then you suddenly lost it. It's quite frustrating. In the end, it's all disappointments.<br/><br/>The opening credits strikes with a strong ambition and the very first scene brings a quicker momentum compared to the last films. To be honest, it's mildly entertaining. There is something intriguing about the plot, but it all ends up pretty underwhelming. There were new characters added but we only get to know them briefly and by their unique superpowers, though there isn't really much time to get to know them because if there were then it would be a waste because in the end the assembly will be useless. I have to admit, the climax is pretty awesome but the twist sadly ruins it. I know many would brag about me. I don't read the books and I don't know anything about it. I only take a movie as a movie because if I compare it, it would be another waste of time.<br/><br/>The performances are all the same. The only thing that's changed is Kristen Stewart's character who steps away from being boring and becomes a vampire, but her performance is still not excellent. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are just swagging around. Michael Sheen delights as the film's villain. Tearing heads is his cutest feat. The additions, there is something interesting about Lee Pace's character but then he didn't get a lot of scenes. He's there being a pretty war veteran boy. Rami Malek seems like he's having fun being an Avatar vampire. The rest, some are generic, some are campy, and some are just standing.<br/><br/>The filmmaking is solid enough though some of the visual effects can be noticeably shoddy but there's no one to blame since there isn't much time to improve it. The most suspect is Renesmee as a baby. It seems like they're trying to do the same with the last Harry Potter movie where they aged the actors. But it could've been better if they hired a real baby because the whole CGI turn looks so disturbing. The music score is somewhat like TV movie quality but who cares, this is Twilight.<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 is as shallow as the other Twilight films. Though, it's getting there but it's over. There won't be any other improvements because this is the last. Fans of the series might still enjoy it. For those who are not, they might like the ""awesome"" visual effects, Michael Sheen's menacing and adorable performance, and the final action scene that doesn't exist. Overall, the movie is not brilliant like this review. If you want me to spoil something then here it is: Nobody dies except Twilight. Because YOLO. Unless there will be a reboot but don't get to that idea. Twilight is awesome because it has vampires but it also sucks because they got senseless conflicts. Also, its universe is so retarded. The vampire here are so random. At least there's sex. Rest in Peace, Twilight. But not with Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter."
"mabruno-1","3","10","26","21 November 2012"," Probably the worst Twilight movie
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 is probably the worst of all 4 Twilight movies or, at least, the least enjoyable. I rate it that way mostly due to poor acting (even worse than in the previous 3 installments), low-budget B-movie special effects and Bill Condon's quick-paced, often abrupt editing that gives us a bad patchwork of scenes that are disconnected in time and space. Not even the soundtrack (usually the high point in any Twilight series) could save the movie this time ! Having said that, the now infamous plot twist at the end was actually clever. It gave a plausible explanation to why the movie ends as the book does (in the book itself, it made no reasonable sense at all). If the twist had actually turned out to be real, the finale would have been even better, but I guess it would have been too much for the die-hard fans who would have complained about how the movie diverged from the novel.<br/><br/>Of course, in the end, the chick flick dream comes true: Bella and Edward, Jacob and Nessie (plus Alice/Jasper, Rosalie/Emmett, Carlisle/Esme, etc.) happily together ""forever"", the last word before the final credits, which deservingly mention all actors involved in the 4-part series. And, as a commercial plus, the finale is open-ended enough to allow Ms. Meyer and/or Summit Entertainment to re-visit these characters any time they want to. After all, ""forever"" is a long time. They might just need to recast the lead actors !"

","Epic? Really? The only thing that's epic would have to be the hype surrounding this concluding installment.<br/><br/>BREAKING DAWN, PART 2 seems to have that lackluster quality about it. The first part of last year's BREAKING DAWN had me growing with intense anticipation of how the entire Twilight saga was going to end. So much so that I loved the second time I went to see it.<br/><br/>PART 2 seems to be lacking in so many areas that it almost looked like a whiny teenage soap opera. And I'm not kidding about it. Like those cheesy television dramas I was practically distracted by the good-looking model-like vampires that the movie felt like it's a montage of moving advertisements from Zara or Bershka or Mango. Even the Amazonian vampires looked more like models for Benetton or something. <br/><br/>As I saw the trailer I was intrigued by how the author Stephanie Meyer might include exotic vampires and from all walks of life at that. From Irish to even Japanese vampire? Come on! But in the end, the funny thing was that after all those search for vampires all over the world, only few appeared to face up to the army of Volturi's almost 10 times their number. It seems like Meyer might have dreamed this last book of hers right after watching (or reading) Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. And even the ""rock-star"" vampire, Garrett, appeared to be like Anne Rice's Lestat. But at least, he had more charms than those Pattinson-Lautner combo put together.<br/><br/>As for Mackenzie Foy's Renesmee, she looked more like some CGI-kid developed out of Lucas Studios or something. Even in her infant stage, the baby looked pretty odd. I know this is a make-believe movie but seriously, it's pretty ridiculous.<br/><br/>However, I'm particularly drawn to how hot one of the cast was. And it was not the overrated hunky Taylor Lautner. Believe me. With how superficial Hollywood made their actors to be, Lautner's time is so over already. But I'm actually referring Rami Malek who played the Egyptian vampire whose name, ""Benjamin"", was peculiarly English instead of a Middle-eastern one. I remembered seeing him once as an Egyptian mummy in Ben Stiller's NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM where he played ""Ahkmenrah"". And he's simply cute.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, what it lacked in the epic quality of it PART 2 compensated with the battle scenes between the Volturi's and the rest of vampire and werewolves clans. But even that was just some psychic vision of Alice. The audience were made to believe that it really did happened but only to find out that that was what going to happen should the Volturi's decided on waging the war against the rest of the vampires. Bummer!<br/><br/>I'd say that the redeeming part throughout the entire film there were but only two scenes that I found to be rather interestingly engaging.<br/><br/>One was when Jacob literally stripped down in front of Bella's father right down to his undies and yikes! HOTNESS! From the moment Lautner flashed out his six-packs from under his shirt I was gawking like a silly schoolgirl and wishing for the two men, Jacob and Bella's father, to get it going on. Yeah, I know I said Taylor Lautner is overrated earlier but, really. Who could resists man's flesh! Even though he's a decade younger than me. YUMMY!!!<br/><br/>And yeah, I know. I'm a perv with ""pedophiliac cougar"" written all over me. But hey, anyone who sees that scene would be affected one way or anotherunless you're some celibate Benedictine monks; of whom I greatly believe that even they commit sins behind closed doors.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, that scene keeps on playing in my mind like I'm wishing to have some alternative cross-generational ""thing"" to happen.<br/><br/>The second was not even a scene, per se. It's the closing credit that featured the cast from this film and all other earlier Twilight films like Anna Kendrick and the two girls who played Victoria in the earlier films. I must say that I was glad for Kendrick for not being in this one. Perhaps, she realized that she had outgrown this teenage flick as she went to more serious stuff and garnered herself an Oscar nomination for her work in George Clooney's UP IN THE AIR. Even Rachelle Lefevre who played the first Victoria was wise enough to pass on to Bryce Dallas Howard. Perhaps, she might think that these Twilight movies might be some sort of career jinx for her. I mean look at the typecasts given to the trio of Rob Pattinson, Kristen Steward and Taylor Lautner.<br/><br/>Anyway, juxtaposed with a sombre tune the closing credits felt as if the filmmakers were compelled to make the audience leaving the theater to have that ""separation anxiety"" as if we've grown together with the Twilight saga altogether. Yeah, right!<br/><br/>The thing is if it only not for hype and publicity around BREAKING DAWN, PART 2, I would rather spend my money on either PITCH PERFECT or ARGO."

","For the long suffering other halves dragged to the cinema there is some good news. Firstly and most importantly, this is the shortest twilight movie, with a total running time of only 155 minutes. One should be able to stay awake with out much difficulty. However films final climatict punch up between Dolce & Gabbana inspired vamps, CGI shaggy dogs and team Bella in fact is quite enjoyable. Much credit for this must be given to Michael Sheen performance as Aro. Michael is clearly having a ball here playing Adam on Ant on acid. This dramatic sequence is well staged on the whole with a excellent use of CGI minus the shaggy dogs, which have never worked for me. Also to be fare to the film makers, Bella hypersensitivity to stimulus when she is reborn as vampire is also very effectively shown. Unfortunately the film is plagued by the faults evident in the twilight franchise. Firstly, main central leads performances are not the best. Kristen Stewart tries here best but at times is let down Robert Pattinson wooden performance as Edward . Taylor Lautner acting as Jacob is overshadowed by his torso. Secondly producers determination to get 12 rating for series does not help either. A more adult approach would would have produce a more sensual and darker movie. Additionally Bill Condon laid lack approach to direction leads to many unintentional Carry on moments. In summary tried to like movie but alas still having problems.

"Leofwine_draca","2","7","17","4 April 2015"," Much ludicrousness and a cheat ending to boot
","The one good thing about BREAKING DAWN PART 2 is that after watching it I can finally say that I've seen all of the TWILIGHT movies and I never need to watch them again. Because this is poor stuff indeed, an ultra-cheesy and completely embarrassing film that I'm surprised that Bill Condon had the guts to direct. How can a man go from directing something like the acclaimed GODS AND MONSTERS to this nonsense?<br/><br/>BREAKING DAWN PART 2, being the final part of the TWILIGHT story, has a lot of work to do but most of it is wasted in a nonsensical story in which the bad Italian vampires are brought out for one final confrontation. The reason for this confrontation turns out to be entirely spurious, and scenes of Edward and Bella travelling the world and recruiting random vampires to their side are entirely unbelievable; why would anybody want to join forces with these no-hopers anyway?<br/><br/>There are plenty of bad things here, not least the wooden performances from a great deal of cast members, although at least Kristen Stewart isn't quite as hopeless as in previous instalments. Once again Taylor Lautner gets a gratuitous shirtless scene although the werewolf pack are entirely extraneous to the story. Scenes involving a CGI baby and vampires running through the woods at speed are completely ludicrous, and the less said about Michael Sheen's appalling villain the better.<br/><br/>Still, these things pale in comparison to the film's biggest deceit. The final movie demands a final, massed battle along the lines of HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 (a clear inspiration here), and we get one: a riotous, head-tearing bout of mayhem in a snowy clearing. Hell, it's the only time in the entire franchise where I actually found myself enjoying what was up on screen, and then, guess what? It was all a dream! That old cheat brought unwelcomely to the fore once again. Bah humbug indeed, and thanks to that TWILIGHT can go to hell forever."
"Rickting","3","7","17","14 February 2014"," More of the same
","Twilight is the worst film franchise ever committed to celluloid. As far as I'm concerned, these are the worst successful movies of all time. The movie camera was not invented so that this kind of rubbish could be forced upon so many people! Thankfully, after a weak but not as bad as you remember first one and then 3 horrifying cinematic car crashes (New Moon in particular is one of my 10 least favourite films of all time) it's over at last. The vampire government comes to confront the Cullens about Edward and Bella's child and they try to survive an epic final battle.... which never even happens. The dream battle is admittedly fun, but that's only 5 minutes. The whole film is 2 hours. Most have regarded this as the best of the franchise. Why? It's just as bad as before and can't really be distinguished from the others. The first 20 minutes have some unintentional hilarity as Kristen Stewart turns into an angry CGI vampire but then she went straight faced again. After that unexpected enjoyment ended, I got depressed.<br/><br/>Bill Condon does his best with the direction, but his noble efforts cannot save what is yet another dreary, soulless, mirthless and endlessly tedious vampire soap opera which is only for fans or people who have trouble sleeping. The acting is as bad as ever, the script seems to be drowning in its own sentimentality and it lacks any true emotion, settling instead for dreary montages, painful dialogue and a washed out col-our palette which doesn't add anything to the film. So, Breaking Dawn part II is just more of the same. It's the second best of the series but that's not saying anything at all. It's decently directed and does try to add more which could appeal to non fans but any scenes which could be fun are almost always ruined by the lifeless acting of almost everyone involved. Only Billy Burke and Michael Sheen actually do a good job and the film and its predecessors have basically ruined the image of vampires forever more. To conclude: This is a terrible film. Well of course it is. It's some good elements but it's just sleep inducing. At least it's the last one. For antidotes to Twilight, I recommend The Hunger Games, Nosferatu and both versions of Let The Right One In.<br/><br/>3/10"

","I finally got to see the last installment of this franchise and watched them all on cable; I certainly wouldn't spend money to see these films. The movie begins after the birth of Renesmee; Belle and Edward are hot for each other and Jacob creepily has the hots for the baby since he imprinted on her. The Volturi are coming after them because they fear the child is a danger to the life of vampires and can't be controlled, plus it's bad in the vampire world to turn a child. Now does that sound real exciting? So Bella, Edward and the family are going to disappear, then perhaps what is the most perverted scene in a pg13 film, when Jacob strips to turn into a wolf in front of Bella's dad. Jacob does this to keep the family from running away, real sensible, right? So, some vamp tattles on the Cullen family to the Volturi; meanwhile the Cullens gather vampire friends from around the worth to vouch on their behalf that the child isn't a threat. They are afraid the Volturi won't believe that the child is half human and half vamp, which would mean she wasn't a threat, makes perfect sense? Anyways there is a so called ""confortation"" which may or may not happen, the end.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Simply awful. The plots to these film are just not good."
"TheSeaLion","2","7","17","16 December 2013"," A lackluster finale
","I have never seen any of the other ""Twilight"" movies nor have I read any of the books and went into this without any experience towards the ""Twilight"" series. So, looking into it without any thought about the previous stories from this universe, I can say that not only is this a poorly made and written movie, it is a weak and lackluster climax that I can guess even the biggest, most die-hard fans of the ""Twilight"" series will agree with me on. The movie is riddled with ridiculous characters with even more ridiculous ideas and motivations, over-the-top and comical acting, poor visual effects, and story points that are sloppily fit together without much thought.<br/><br/>I will give the film credit in two areas. One is the unintentionally funny moments. While there are few of these moments, some of them have such over-the-top acting or ridiculous writing that it will almost make you glad you at least saw those scenes from the movie. Next, Bella's father (Billy Burke) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) are the only characters you can at the least say are decent people and not as stupid as the other characters. <br/><br/>When it comes to this movie, the biggest most fatal problem is that this is the final movie in a series. As the final chapter of a story, the events of the film are going to effect the final outcome for the world. In the epic finales of many great movie sagas like ""Star Wars"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""The Dark Knight trilogy"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", everything has led up to the final confrontation between the heroes and the villains and no matter what, things will change. The first problem is with the battle. After an epic battle where several characters, including the main antagonist are killed, it is all revealed to be a look into the future for the villain. To make matters worse, the film does not just use a dream sequence to make the audience think they just witnessed an epic final battle. Another problem that arises with this finale is that none of the characters have to fight or sacrifice anything and everything ends with the good vampires and werewolves going back to their lives.<br/><br/>This movie does not work as a finale, nor does it work as a movie. As a stand alone movie, it is sloppy and does tells a story that is torn apart by plot holes, uninteresting characters, and a lack of emotional connection with the audience. As a finale, it lacks the epic climax it was building up to, no sacrifices have to be made, and the final battle, even if it was a dream, was anticlimactic. Even with its funny- bad moments, the film is still not worth the 115 minutes of your life."
"kat_777","3","7","17","27 August 2013"," Seriously is that how they wanted the series to look like.
","It's been a while since I've bashing the twilight saga. Yes I'm a girl and I'm proud to say that I don't find anything too romantic about this so called worldwide phenomenon. I didn't go to see this in the theater because my god! The last one BDP 1 was sooooo horrible that I almost vomited in my seat. I got the movie just now so I just decided to give a try. It was after Bella became a vampire. She can now everything in close ups, hear Minor sounds and even smell fresh human blood. Her dad found a new person in his life. Things got better with Jacob and his old pal but now the volturi is coming after them because Edward's cousin witnessed Renesmee (not such a bad name to me though, I've heard worse) their half human- half vampire daughter and presumed that she is an immortal child. Rest of the plot deals with the Cullen trying their best to gather as many witnesses as possible and confront the volturi.<br/><br/>Yes this is the plot point. Most of you may even ask ""Is that it?"" It is a great improvement from new moon, eclipse and definitely BDP 1 because it contains less cheesy dialogs and better plot. I mean better and not great. I know what guys will look forward to, more fighting scenes and deaths. We will all look forward to a movie with better pacing, acting and effects. That is what making a movie all is about.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is a one horrible actress in this franchise as she acted and looked literally the same in the last four movies. She was blinking, mouth breathing, shaking her head, expressionless, and her kept mouth open the whole time (to show off her enormous buck teeth maybe). But she looked and acted different in this movie because by keeping her mouth closed most of the time (seriously) and with lack of abnormal shaking, blinking and mouth breathing. But she got the razzie for this movie and it is not fair (I would of course gladly comply when it comes to her winning for the previous ones) because she improved a lot since her previous performances and she didn't get nominated for new moon (the movie where she gave the worst performance).<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is the same, same and there is nothing much to talk about. That's how it is.<br/><br/>Taylor Launtner gave a bipolar like performance with either extreme underacting or overacting. And he also had the dumb look that we all remember him for. Ashley Greene was horrible. She was the only person I liked in new moon and she didn't do well in this.<br/><br/>Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, Peter Fascinelli and Elizabeth Reaser were all just standing around doing nothing. When it comes to performance the descent ones actually are Kristen of course then there is Billy Burke, Dakota fanning and Aro's high pitched laugh. The effects were okay but I totally despised the vampires shattering like glass idea (and sparkling not to mention). Make up was good though.<br/><br/>Then the one than shattered me and of course millions of other who expected the better outcome of this saga. The ending! (Spoiler)<br/><br/>The fight scene at the end was really cool and it was the best part of the saga. Not because I like action scenes, but because that was where finally something with pace and consequence finally happens. You see Jane die, with Aro, Caius, Carlisle and Jasper. But no it is nothing but Alice's vision and the cowardly leader Aro almost immediately calls off the attack ignoring his friends and colleagues. (I'm sorry I'm pretty sure that they were not his friends). Again, I hate the shattering like glass concept but both Jane and Aro's deaths were done well. And yes it is ruined!!! (spoiler)<br/><br/>The movie therefore is horrible but better compared to its preceding ones. They try to make it look interesting yet boring at the same time. It is definitely not the description the trailer ""An epic finale that will live forever"". To tell the truth it is dead long after the end credits of the movie. 3/10"

","The movie was good and with happy ending. Unlike other Vampire movies where there is gruesome deaths and evil, here, the movie predicts evil and understands there is discrimination and hatred but prevents it from happening.The value of foreseeing death and destruction and the ability to prevent such destruction has been portrayed very well. In our real life we are unable to do so. We wage wars in spite of knowing it cause severe damage and destruction and loss of economical strength.For a nation like ours this is a true moralistic movie as well. Also it teaches how to be flexible and be able to tolerate and get along with one another.I felt that vibrations and the unity among the audience that day while the movie was ending. The main theme is cohabitation of mixed race and in this case cohabitation of the dead and alive. This is a remarkable piece of peace in this society of anything less than peace these days. Why should the movie replicate the actual book? The book should only be used as a guide line. The movie is meant to be creative and that takes talent. Otherwise every book writer would end producing a movie of their books but fortunately they are not movie directors. This movie has quite a dramatic theme and indeed different, so the colors and the make up and all should match the imaginary colors and make up of Vampires, since all of it is nothing but make believe (just like Harry Potter). I give this movie a score of 9. Won't you do the same after reading my piece?"

I would even say the story of the book was followed quite faithfully. The pictures were nice and depicted Bella's changed senses beautifully, the music was artistic and really captivating. The fighting scene in the end was shocking though, and parents should warn their kids if or before they see this part. Although there is not too much blood , the deaths are graphic and unexpected, pretty heartbreaking. I can see why in my country the rating was for over 16's.However, everyone is relieved to find out that all of those horrible scenes were just Alice's vision of future events coming unless Aro prevents them- and so he does, luckily.

","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD). <br/><br/>This is the final instalment, the denouement of the story arc and should have been the screaming crescendo of a climax but was more or less a damp squib. Given the money that was clearly lavished on this film (and the others) it left a lot to be desired. The series' final book was split into two films which I think was a con as there just isn't enough happening in them to make four hours of viewing, they would have been TOTALLY better as one film with faster action. This film was relatively empty and jumped from point to point with little cohesion between. It got annoying. Then there's the acting, given the lack of intelligent script the actors have to act by numbers - jumping from facial expression to the next which makes the woodenness of the acting, which Pattinson and Stewart (both good actors) have been tarred with since the franchise began as if they are just reading lines rather than delivering them. Given, also, there's a lot of - invisible to the viewer - telepathy there are a lot of empty hand-on-face scenes. The CGI is prolific, and it's often hard to tell if there is anything real, which isn't necessarily a good thing as it makes the film less believable (despite being fantasy). The CGI of Renesme's face was so fake and ridiculous but the wolves are lovely again and one of the best parts of all the films, and the CGI on Kristen's face/make up is good. Regarding CGI, what was with the brief white sparkles in the love scene? Was that supposed to be an orgasm? WTH? The only other redeeming features of the film is the cinematography of the landscapes (real or CGI) and the sweeping panoramas which are legion and the fight scene at the end. It is an attractive film, the cottage in the woods very Thomas Kincaid, entertaining to a point but empty and rather dull and like the previous two-parter too montage ridden. The dialogue (what little there was) was banal and limited, and there needed to be more complexity, but that is the fault of the books as they were naively written (given the subject) but it must be remembered that this is a series for young adults not grown-ups and as such it is probably gripping and exciting. With that in mind, as a film, it's still disappointing."

","I watched this movie commercial free, for free, on my computer at home. Within just minutes of starting it, I was unsure if I even wanted to have this on during a workout. If only I was a 12 year old girl, I would have enjoyed this better. Thank everything forever, I did not pay money for this movie. <br/><br/>There has been some speculation of the budget to this movie. Regardless, it was above 50 million at least, possibly double that. This must have been the most wasteful movie in the history of film making if that is true. It felt like they might have plowed through filming this in one take for each scene. The actors are awkward and unbelievable. I'll give it to Kristen Stewart, I've never seen a one trick pony be ridden so hard, for so long. Her one facial expression never lets me down. It's passion, hurt, pain, anger, happiness, all rolled into one. I wish I could make just one expression with my face. It would save me time. And people wouldn't have to try to read my facial clues. The execution was odd, and I never even had the chance to understand why Myers chose to include so many powers, without any coordination between the vampire special power patrol. Its like she just decided to cram a bunch of power creativity with no explanation whatsoever that made me just say ""Wow, really! water power! That's awesome! but why, when, how, and where, oh I don't care anymore?"" And once again, the sets felt small, like a one room school house. Which brings me to my next point; I felt like I was a small child. I was embarrassed during the movie because, as all the twilight movies, I internalized the incredibly awkward tendencies of the movie. <br/><br/>Summary: If I wasn't working out during the movie, I would have skipped through parts of the movie that were cheesy, probably self editing the movie down to about 20 minutes. This movie was exactly as good as a random episode of Smallville, which is equally as embarrassing as this trash smoothie."
"ryansassy1","6","4","8","10 February 2013"," A good finish to a mediocre series.
","Wouldn't it be refreshing to read a review of a Twilight film that was written by neither fans nor ""haters""? You've come to the right place. I have read all 4 books to see what the hype was all about, and have seen all 5 films when they got to second-run theaters. In general, I thought they were watchable enough, improvements in fact over the source material -- but not worth owning or seeing again. This last film, however, took on a different tone which I found refreshing.<br/><br/>If you haven't kept up with the previous films, you should definitely see them first -- this one isn't a stand-alone. Story picks up with Bella just turned into a newborn vampire and learning how to deal with her new strengths and hungers. She has to hunt wildlife and keep from killing every non-vampire that wanders into her territory, and she rocks her new, pale look with smokey eyeliner and red lips. The half-vampire daughter she gave birth to is already out of the newborn phase and growing at an alarming rate; but no worries, the other Cullens and Jacob Black have taken over all those inconvenient childcare duties so that Bella and Edward can carry on being newlyweds without distraction in their new guest house at the Cullen mansion. Ah, if only everything had continued down this merry course, there could have been the perfect -- albeit boring -- fairytale ending to the Saga. But of course, a twist of fate puts Bella, the Cullens, and their new child all at risk: the Volturi (evil mafia-like vampire clan in Europe) get word of Bella's kid, and assume she is a threat to their existence.<br/><br/>Now, thank goodness, a more exciting story arc is set into motion for the rest of the film. The Cullens rally all their friends and ""relatives"" (non human-feeding vampires)from around the globe to stand as witness for the Cullen baby Renesmee. We get to see a little bit of the cultures of other vampires, new characters are introduced, interesting powers are revealed, and tension builds. The Cullens are rightly worried that the Volturi won't be reasoned with, and that they'll easily slaughter the Cullens and their allies. When the film's climax comes, it's all action, and IMO it should have earned BD part 2 an R rating for violence and gore (which is quite uncharacteristic of the previous Twilight installments).<br/><br/>Finally, the Twilight story is concluding on an exciting, Action/Horror turn of events, instead of the faintly nauseating romance that dominated up until now! Bella also seems to come into her own as a mature character and a grownup for the first time. She displays self-discipline, starts considering the world outside of her town of Forks, and shows concern for others apart from herself and the Cullen family: the annoying Emo Bella is gone. She also abandons the role of ""damsel in distress"" and takes on a bit of toughness. Some of these improvements are long overdue for her character, and it's interesting that they all coincide with her turning into a vampire. Don't the rest of us have to grow up without the help of supernatural powers and immortality? Oh well, better late than never I suppose.<br/><br/>Now if only the entire ""Saga"" could be rebooted with this director at the helm, I think the ratings would have jumped considerably. The previous Twilight movies were watchable but in my opinion, only merited 4 and 5 stars out of 10 at best: this last film is a six because it did away with angsty vampires and showed us a whole society of supernatural characters, and they weren't all just props to further a love triangle plot. Good pacing and better editing also helped BD part 2 along tremendously.<br/><br/>I just might see this one again on cable!"
"Hellmant","3","4","8","6 December 2012"," It's really sad that the series was ever so popular!
","'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of the 'TWILIGHT' series; I've seen every chapter, but only so I could review them (because of their immense popularity). I've always thought the series was really poorly made, but I can handle bad movies, the thing I really despised about each film is how tasteless and morally depraved they all are. They send horrible messages to their target audience, young girls, and are extremely sexist to both women and men. The heroine, Bella (played by Kristen Stewart throughout the series), is a terrible role model for young women; she's weak, obsessive and totally dependent on men (to the point where she's suicidal if one breaks up with her). The films also kind of sends the message that every girl wants two cute guys to fight over her and all women look for in a romantic love interest is a guy that looks good (and that no other redeemable qualities are necessary). While Bella at least has some character and admirable skills the leading men in the series are both emotionless, wooden and completely lacking of any wit or charm. With that said this film does finally give viewers a heroine worth rooting for; Bella in this film is finally strong and self dependent. It does kind of send the message that a woman has to become a vampire in order to become those things though. The film is a little more entertaining than the rest but it's so full of flaws (once again) and just extreme trash filmmaking (to put it simply). It's really sad that the series was ever so popular. <br/><br/>The film is the fifth and final installment in the franchise and is based on the second half of Stephenie Meyer's fourth book. It was directed by Bill Condon (who also directed the last film in the series) and written by Melissa Rosenberg once again (she wrote all five films and appears to be just as bad a writer as Meyers (having improved nothing on the awful books). It once again stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner as the three leads and has most of the key supporting players returning from the other films as well. In this film Bella (Stewart) has just awoken to discover her new powers as a vampire and meets her newborn daughter Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy), who is a gifted half vampire / half human creature (who ages extremely fast). She also learns that her werewolf buddy Jacob (Lautner), who used to be obsessed with her, has now dedicated his love to her baby (in order to save her from being killed by other werewolves). Bella, understandably, does not take kindly to the idea of her ex-stalker now agreeing to spend the rest of his life with her newborn baby. More problems arise when the kid is mistaken for an immortal child and the Volturi (the vampire ruling class) decides to execute her. Edward (Pattinson) and his family of vampires then raise an army of their own (from old vampire friends) to combat the Volturi.<br/><br/>The film is more of the same cheesy dialogue, acting and atrocious romance but it does have more action than the other films. This one has a gruesome climactic battle scene that proves the motion picture rating system is a joke. If a film with as many beheadings, body burnings and other violent mutilations as this can get away with a PG-13 rating obviously any studio (with enough money) can buy the rating they want for any film. While the movie does have a somewhat cool final fight scene and a newly improved kick ass heroine it still reeks of horrible flaws. One I especially didn't like is a major plot twist at the end that feels extremely overdone, cheep and a total rip-off (but that's to be expected from a series like this). Fans of the franchise will once again eat it up and anyone else (who has to see it) will be extremely sickened.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olADa6vEcMk"

","I have been a long time fan and defender of The Twilight franchise both the books and movies. I've fought a lot of battles of people unnecessarily attacking the material just because they didn't get it, or wasn't their thing. In all my 33 years I've never encountered the sheer hatred for any movie/book series that Twilight has managed to garner. But on the flip side I've never seen people as passionate or energetic about any property either. Anyone whose been to a midnight show knows just what I'm talking about. there is a fluid respectable energy and although about 80% female there are people of all ages regardless of what people may think. So finally after all this time I can tell everyone who hates the Saga to suck it because this movie kicks major ass. And not just in the way I and you have come to expect from the other films but it actually graduates the material to an intense level I've never experienced in any film before. I was literally on the edge of my seat having heart palpitations during the stunning, uber violent finale. It's not just what you've always wanted from these films it's the culmination you've always wanted from most films. The only comparable material I can think is how the Avengers played out. It's not just the ballsy clever maneuver to twist the material a bit but the execution overall. Everything ends on a high note. From the production design to the costumes to the much improved special effects, the now explosive special effects, the toned down/up screenplay and the performances. people who have complained about the acting in the other films will see what I mean. As these characters have grown so have the actors. Robert Pattinson is mesmerizing as always but Taylor Lautner finally stretches his whiny chops and explores a more adult, caring side to his character while Stewart steals the show gone is the clumsy, awkward, slightly annoying girl from the other films and replaced with a seductive, bad ass woman with a fierce mean streak. As a fan it's sad to see it all end but I've never felt so satisfied leaving something like this behind. All the questions are answered and the franchise goes out on a super high note. It's truly the most thrilling cinematic experience I've had in a decade. It's funny, romantic, edge of your seat, intense, clever and unique. And Kudos to Condon for t=giving the fans some love with that montage at the films end and the addition of the visualized pages from the book."
"jboothmillard","3","6","14","31 March 2013"," The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2
","I knew this film, the last in The Twilight Saga and continuing from where Part 1 left off, was a big winner at the Razzies, but the critics gave it a reasonable review, so I was certainly interested to see what opinion I would have for it, having gone through all the four other films, from Razzie winning director Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Dreamgirls). Basically Bella Swan (Razzie winning Kristen Stewart) is embracing her life having turned from human to a vampire with new husband and vampire Edward Cullen (Razzie nominated Robert Pattinson), she is exploring the possibilities of her newfound abilities, such as high speed and increased vision, and together they are enjoying life with new vampire-human hybrid baby Renesmee. Half-human half-werewolf Jacob Black (Razzie winning Taylor Lautner) wants to protect the new baby, and Bella's father Charlie (Billy Burke) wants updates as he was told Bella was sick, so Jacob explains that she had to be ""changed"" for her life to be saved, and he turns into a werewolf to help him realise what has happened but not have it told, as any humans who find out about vampires will be killed by the Volturi. Several months pass and Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) is growing at a rapid rate, and she is spotted by bitter Irina (Maggie Grace) on the outskirts of the woods sees the child from a distance and believes she may be an immortal being, so naturally the Volturi, led by Aro (Michael Sheen) will come after them. The Cullens prove to themselves that the rapid growth of the child will not go too much further and that she is not immortal, and summoning witnesses like the Denali family encounter one of Bella's other newfound abilities, to create a powerful mental shield to protect others from attacks in the mind. Some of these witnesses are attacked and unable to protect the Cullens, so they must fight the Volturi themselves and this cannot be avoided, and some of the unaffected witnesses do agree to stand in battle against them, it is all based on powerful abilities that want to be claimed. Aro arrives on what becomes the battle field, and he is allowed to touch Renesmee and be proved that she is not immortal, Irina accepts her mistake but is immediately killed, her sisters are restrained from taking action, but the leader still insists the child could pose future risk, and Alice Cullen (Razzie nominated Ashley Greene) and Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone) believe there may be other children like her. Alice shows Aro a vision of the future where he refuses to let the family and the child go free and the big battle ensues, where there are many casualties on both sides of the fight, most being the Volturi, with major characters Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli), Jasper, Seth (Booboo Stewart), Alec (Cameron Bright), Caius (Jamie Campbell Bower), Marcus (Christopher Heyerdahl), Demetri (Charlie Bewley) and Felix (Daniel Cudmore) dying. The vision ends and Aro is warned that these events will become reality if he continues to pursue Renesmee, and two witnesses, a fully-grown vampire-human hybrid and his aunt undetected for one hundred and fifty years, arrive to prove that she will not be a threat, so the leader orders his guards to retreat, only getting one more glance at Alice and Bella. The Cullens return home and Alice sees a future vision of Edward and Bella together with Jacob and fully matured Renesmee, Edward reads her mind and knows that his daughter will be happy with Jacob protecting her, in the end Bella allows Edward to read her thoughts, followed by the couple sharing a kiss. Also starring Dakota Fanning as Jane, Elizabeth Reaser as Esme Cullen, Kellan Lutz as Emmett Cullen and Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale. The cast is only slightly the alright standard to the other films, and some of the story works okay, but the problem is the length of the film, the execution and speed going up and down in pace, the special effects are less impressive, and to be honest I found this a boring end to the series, a disappointing and near terrible romantic horror fantasy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Lautner and Foy and Worst Screen Ensemble for the Entire Cast, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Couple for Pattinson and Stewart and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!"
"PadmeAgnes","8","6","14","19 November 2012"," Nice ending but not as good as the beginning
","This is a movie you have to see in a full movie-theater, I had so much fun just listening to the reactions!! <br/><br/>It was good entertainment with an unexpected twist (usually I spot them but this time I didn't). Some of the dialogs were well written (funny) and very well acted. Part II was absolutely better than part I, New Moon and Eclipse together but not better than Twilight. Too much time filling stuff (ok, in I it was terrible in II it was occasional). Some shots were badly done (e.g. entering the cottage) or missing the point completely (e.g. wide shot of the battlefield). The Russian characters were laughed at and some of the guests could use a bit more 'body' but Michael Sheen was fab as usual.<br/><br/>However, Breaking Dawn would have been a good movie if part I and II were to be edited in a 2 hour movie."
"lestatlove19","10","5","11","15 March 2013"," ""La Belle Fantastique!"" A beautiful and fitting ending to The Twilight Saga
","Okay, let me just say one thing: ENOUGH of the negative criticism already! Sheesh, give the die-hard fans a break . . . they have done NOTHING wrong except love the book and movie series.<br/><br/>The movie was AWESOME as all hell! Bella looked amazing as a vampire (if only all of us women could look that good after having a baby, considering how she looked at the end of Part 1). Definitely don't want to cross her now because she WILL beat you to the ground. So powerful! Plus Edward loves her even more now than he did when she was human. And their sweet precious baby Renesmee . . . I think the CGI effect with her aging looked flawless, though it did take some getting used to at first. Mackenzie Foy is such a cutie pie! Awww, you want to pinch her cheeks and squeeze her in a tight hug. I won't reveal spoilers, so I'll just say the top secret sequence they had in the movie was really intense. To top it all off, the ending was very, very fitting to the entire series. Overall,it was really awesome, beautifully done, and I can safely say that Bella & Edward's love story has come full circle.<br/><br/>Now a simple message from a fellow Twihard to their brethren: PLEASE DO NOT pay any attention whatsoever to the haters,they don't know what they are talking about. Go right ahead and shout it from the rooftops that you love the Twilight books and movies, don't let anyone get you down. All of you,myself included, have deserved to see the cinematic representation of The Twilight Saga come to an extremely satisfying conclusion."
"synystr-htfp","10","5","11","10 December 2012"," True Cinematic Perfection
","Before I begin, I would like to say that I would have given this movie 20 stars out of 10, but alas, the site does not allow for such an extension of gratitude.<br/><br/>There have been many great (in the eyes of others, at least) trilogies and sagas of movies that have come and gone throughout history. Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Godfather, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, and many more. This movie brings an epic closure to arguably the greatest saga of them all, the Twilight saga. No other set of cinematic pictures comes even a shred of a molecule close to rivaling the sheer emotion, drama, suspense, action and, dare I say it, perfection, that Twilight has brought to many fans worldwide. What began as an interesting and unique alternative interpretation of vampires and werewolves (the sparkling of the vampires is the most imaginative character trait I have EVER seen) has ended in a message of love, unity and closeness, no matter how thick the lines of division are between one another. It truly shows that no matter how different we are, we can coexist, and we should. The love shared between Edward and Bella knows no boundaries, and when you have something like that, nothing can break it. There is even a friendship blooming between Edward and Jacob, once bitter enemies. It shows that we don't always have to hold such disdain amongst one another.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was superb, and executed perfectly, better than anything I have ever witnessed in any other movie in history. The dialogue must have been fashioned by the hands of literary Gods, because it was that compelling. Robert Pattinson does an amazing job at portraying a soul who can't help but love, even if the stereotypes and traditions pushed unto his kind do not allow for it. Taylor Lautner has done an extraordinary job showing us all that no matter what hardships you face, such as when Bella chose to be with Edward instead of him, it is not the end of the world, and something better can come from it. And, of course, the MVP of the movie, Kristen Stewart. Screw Meryl Streep, forget Katharine Hepburn, Kristen Stewart puts all female actresses before her to utter shame! It's almost as if when I am watching her portray Bella, I can FEEL her. It's like I've known her all of my life! She was truly meant to play this role, and she does a simply impeccable job bringing the emotion of Bella's character to the big screen.<br/><br/>The CGI in this movie was top notch! I didn't even know until after the movie ended that the scenes with Renesmee as a baby were computer generated! She looked so REAL and believable! Not creepy in the slightest. I wanted to reach out and hug her! This is just a reminder of how truly developed our technology has become, and how photo-realistic and lifelike computer generated imagery is.<br/><br/>The story was Shakespearean, never a dull moment. The best scene was at the end. One of the best action/fight scenes I have ever seen in a movie, with an intriguing twist at the end which I feel is the best possible direction the directors could take it. It truly conveys a message of peace, and that fighting doesn't solve anything! All in all, this movie was a more-than-fitting end to the best movie saga of all time. I can only hope that they decide to extend it further in the future! Tales of the Twilight Saga will be passed down through generations, much like the works of ""art"" before them."
"cubsckc","8","5","11","28 November 2012"," Pretty Good
","I'm quite surprised at the reviews. A couple weeks ago, this movie was around 8.5. Now its ranked really low. I am not a fan of the Twilight Series, but I have seen all of them. I thought quite a few of them were a waste of time to be honest. However, in this one, I thought in some ways justice was made. The bad vampires finally make a scene which they pretty much haven't even though they really should have been a bigger focus. The bad vampires get what they deserve in a metaphoric sense. Especially since many of these vampire characters really annoyed me. <br/><br/>I am really surprised people graded it bad, and I don't understand why they rated it bad. Because it didn't represent the literature well? Seriously? I'm not defending this movie by any stretch of the word, because I think the series is joke. But the first movie was horrible! It did not give the book series justice at all. And every movie except for this one in my opinion progressively got worse. So I don't understand the logic behind the reviews at all. All the girl things that were used like the Edward and Jacob thing being lovers of the same girl (any American Girls Dream) were done with this movie a long time ago. So why critics feel like they should whine and moan about its disappearance is a mystery to me."

"gabriellalobue","7","5","11","23 November 2012"," The absolute best of the worst!
","I NEVER write reviews for movies unless there is a dire need for it, and for this particular film I feel one is required. Let me just say that I have been a strong Anti-Twilight believer since it started. The books were terrible as well as the films. But I continued to watch them just I would have something I could poke fun at. I saw this tonight and leaving the theater I was nearly speechless and it kills me to say I actually enjoyed it to an extent. <br/><br/>I'll start with the acting which seems to have improved since the first installment of the series. It is still a bit flaky but has definitely been worse. The makeup however is annoying in the sense that it seems to change dramatically in between each movie. There is no consistency whatsoever. The hair color is always changing as is the intensity of the ""pale-face"" look. The Cullens looked especially unusual looking than normal; Esme looked like a big toe in my opinion. Furthermore the special effects have not changed and were shameful considering the advancement of today's technology. <br/><br/>But despite all of the flaws here is why I gave it a 7 out of 10; the plot twist was absolutely, undoubtedly spectacular. It was brilliant and completely unexpected and the whole theater gasped in shock. This was a huge milestone for any production, especially for Twilight as the standards are not exactly sky high. I would also like to note the last scene with Bella and Edward left you with a satisfactory, tickled pink feeling. And lastly I would like to commend whoever is responsible for the credits because that was very thoughtful and shows their appreciation for the cast; even those who were not apart of this last installment. So overall, I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to give this film a chance, because even I who have been skeptical since the beginning, left the building pleasantly surprised."
"neil-476","Null","9","24","16 November 2012"," Part 2 part 1
","In view of the fact that the last Twiglet book has been split into two films, my review of the last Twiglet film is also going to be split in two. I was minded to do this after coming out of the cinema yesterday, and seeing all the little Twigleteers enduring the 4 movie retrospective marathon leading up to the midnight showing of Twiglet: Breaking Wind part 2. The first part of my review therefore chronicles my expectations before actually seeing it: I will add part 2 once I have seen it. I am hoping it will answer the many questions which are churning round, unanswered from the previous movie.<br/><br/>Will Edward Sullen's eyebrows revert to normal or will they remain Spocklike to the very end? <br/><br/>Will Kirsten Sulk smile at any point? <br/><br/>Will Taylor Lautner become less wooden than a storefront wooden Indian? <br/><br/>Will Renesmee grow to adulthood quickly enough to make her own decisions and decide to change that ridiculous name? <br/><br/>Will any sense of reason ever appear behind the Vampire High Command's arbitrary set of rules? <br/><br/>Will Michael Sheen continue to be the only watchable actor due to his glee at camping it up? <br/><br/>Will Dakota Fanning rescue the part of her reputation she lost by being so poor in the last one? <br/><br/>Will the ""vampires"" become proper vampires or remain glittery daylight bloodsuckers? <br/><br/>Will there ever be any substance at all to any of this, or will it remain drippy trivial wish fulfilment fantasy for impressionable teenage girls to the bitter end? <br/><br/>Will Stephenie Meyer continue laughing all the way to the bank? <br/><br/>Will these questions be answered in the second part of my review of: Twiglet: Breaking Wind part 2!!! <br/><br/>Part 2: <br/><br/>Being bitten and vampirised at the point of death brings sulky Bella some red contact lenses, eyeshadow and false eyelashes, and the ability to jump off waterfalls. It also brings half human/half vampire creepy CGI-face offspring Renesmee to the attention of the vampire high command, who plan to use her to exterminate the Cullens. While the boss vampires (who put them in charge anyway?) hurry along to this showdown (on foot, from Italy to Canada), the Cullens recruit allies from around the world. A showdown ensues. <br/><br/>Keen readers of my reviews of the Twiglet movies (such readers being almost as numerous, no doubt, as Twigleteers themselves) will probably have come to the conclusion that my opinion of these films is fairly low. To put it bluntly, I think they are boring, soppy, meretricious rubbish. So it is with considerable surprise that I find myself saying that Breaking Wind part 2 is really good. <br/><br/>The main reason for this is that it isn't really a Twiglet movie, it's actually a superhero movie with a terrific superhero battle at the end. The tiresome soppiness between the two main characters is more or less over, apart from a couple of tedious but mercifully brief montages: this film concentrates on Bella coming to terms with the powers which come with vampirism (vampire boot camp, if you will), plot development, and action. And the ""have your cake and eat it"" ending actually works well. <br/><br/>There are flaws, the worst of which is the tendency for important plot points to arrive just before they are needed. Like Jacob's imprinting with Renesmee in the previous film, the fact that each vampire has a different power really should have been introduced several films ago: the fact that you learn it just before those powers are needed for the final battle reeks of making it up as you go along, and is evidence of poor writing (whether in the original material or the adaptation, I cannot say). And the best line in the film, concerning Jacob's pet name for Renesmee, should have been played for laughs, but is played deadly serious. <br/><br/>Michael Sheen is, again, by far the most entertaining performer. <br/><br/>If they were to put the key plot events of the previous 4 movies into an opening ""story so far"" crawl, Star Wars-style, you could dump the other 4 movies and this would be a fine stand-alone experience."

","There are a lot of very expressive reviews in the negative to this film, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 2, and I can only wonder if there are many of those reviewers who are either immature teenagers with a grudge against such a successful franchise or other such smug individuals who want to distinguish themselves as so called 'hip' by bashing a successful franchise. Being a college film professor over the age of 50 I have followed the Twilight franchise with a critical eye for theme, cinematography, acting, story, and various other components.<br/><br/>I can see the allure that this franchise has for those who are seeking a cinematic escape from something other than a familiar blood and guts horror genre. I give solid acknowledgment to the performances by Kristen Stewart (Bella), Robert Pattinson (Edward), Taylor Lautner (Jacob), Michael Sheen (Aro), and the entire brilliant cast. This particular installment provided all the essentials for a well done movie experience; beautiful and engaging stars, a story line that never dragged at any instance, menacing protagonists, suspenseful plot and a surprise ending that had me shout out 'Wow' when revealed. The audience that sat with me were equally enthralled. There were cheers when moments called for it and at the end of the film almost EVERYONE in the theater applauded. <br/><br/>My suggestion- don't let the naysayers on this board give you pause to see this film. If as a viewer you liked any part of the franchise (and so far the box office on this film has reached over $340 M)then know that this is as satisfying, if not more, than the others in the series."

It had a lot more humor than the others and Edward and Bella seemed so much more equal. They both smile so much more in this. <br/><br/>The child who plays Renesme is perfectly cast. She looks so much like Kristen and Rob. <br/><br/>This movie does exactly what it should. It wraps up the end of a great series. It fills in the holes and ties up loose ends.

My hand went to my mouth in shock, and as I looked around the room everyone was the same. It is a real shocker, but I feel that this ending would have been good in the book also, but it was a great surprise to the film and did the much loved story justice! As much as I would like to tell you all the spoiler I feel that it would ruin the movie, so if you are planning on going to watch Breaking Dawn Part 2, DO NOT read any spoilers as you will not get the shock effect that had the whole room that I witnessed last night on the edge of there seats!"

I thought the acting was pretty good with the exception of Kristen Stewart, I've never been a fan of her acting and i can't see her improving any time soon, but I think the other main stars of the franchise have improved quite a bit.<br/><br/>Now about Part 2, i thought, as i wrote before, it was amazing, i was glued to the screen and i enjoyed the comedy added to a couple of scenes that again were true to the book, for example: when Bella tosses Jacob about after realizing he had imprinted on Renesmee and when she destroyed Emmett at arm wrestling, i thought the added fight scene was brilliant, to see the future and for those that haven't read the books to be stunned when the battle ends and its only Alice's vision, for those that have read the books, you'd obviously know straight away that it was just a vision, but it was still a nice touch which gave us an exciting battle scene in the movie which lets face it, keeps out interest peaked.<br/><br/>So overall i thought it was a fantastic finish and was very nicely made and i will say right now for those that haven't read the books, it was most likely won't be 9/10 for you as for me, i eagerly await the box set release on Blu-Ray so i can buy them and have a movie marathon so i can watch the story from start to finish."
"beyondwords","7","5","12","18 November 2012"," An interesting ending
","All devotees of ""Breaking Dawn"" know exactly how the story ends, and there are no surprises in the plot and characters. If you have not seen the previous movies or have read the books, this movie would be incomprehensible, especially at the beginning. I was really hoping for a bit more of Bella's ""awakening"" and Edward's frantic efforts to prevent her death. It got lost at the end of Part I, and Part II picks up with a Bella who is in perfect control, if perhaps a mite thirsty. Bella's discovery of Jacob's new role in her life is also disappointing. Let's face it, Miss Stewart simply cannot act. Sad, but true. She's lovely to look at, but has an extremely limited range -- her anger at Jacob was comical, not threatening, and I saw no evidence of ""motherliness"" in her interactions with Renesmee -- she was more of a big sister. Breaking the book up into two movies made for two movies that were overlong for the limited story that was actually presented.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film's management of Alice's visions was a nicely done twist. As her visions began to unfold, I looked at my companion in horror -- ""THIS wasn't in the book!"" we hissed at each other. To be fair, the visions may have been in the book -- there is a delightfully sparsely-described interaction that leaves room for a broad range of dramatic invention. <br/><br/>Kudos to the director/producer or whomever created the final credits. At the end of such a epic, it was good to see all the characters that had appeared in all the movies being recognized so beautifully for their part in creating the whole fabric of the tale. <br/><br/>Let's face it -- no review is going to deter a Twi-hard fan from seeing this movie. And if you aren't a Twi-hard fan, no review is going to tempt you into starting, now. Will it be an enduring classic? Probably not. But it was a fun ride while it lasted."

","I have to say that this one was the very best one and I liked the others but this one was the perfect ending to the Saga. All I will say about the ending is wow... I actually teared up as if I was saying goodbye to a very old friend. My husband got dragged along and even he said this was the best one of all. You will laugh, get mad, get your ""Taylor"" fix (if that is something your looking for) and finally....sad. If your a ""fan"" of the series then this one won't disappoint you. For me it was also like watching my kids grow up and move on with there lives. The ending will have you sitting up in your seats and eventually gasping. Someone in the theater actually yelled out, ""noooooo"". If your looking for a 007 movie than go to 007. This movie is for the Twilight fans but even if you do get dragged there, you will surely enjoy the battle scene at the end."

","First, for all those critics out there that feel they need to wax eloquent about BDP2, with horrible critiques, what is your problem? If you don't like the movie(s) why would you spend your hard earned, stolen, borrowed money to get a ticket? Do you have some lame wish to sit in a theater for 2 hours and watch something you know you won't like? If so, then you got exactly what you paid for and you should thank everyone in the film profusely.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it was great. It was a different twist on a couple of old myths (vampires and werewolves), with a love story angle thrown in. It sold to women and some men, those that like that kind of story, some that are in touch with their emotional or feminine side, gay, etc. Though the werewolves weren't actually werewolves according to the story they were shape-shifters. It had a pretty good fight scene at the end that really had some of us fans worried, but it all turned out okay. In the end it was satisfying to those of us that enjoyed the stories for what they are, nuff said."
"Tigerbai1","10","4","9","10 January 2013"," You will not be disappointed with this one - Awesome!
","It was better than the book and the book was great. This is rare I know, but you won't be disappointed if you liked the books. People who don't love Twilight series shouldn't be commenting. I laughed out loud I gasped in unbelief - with excitement I saw great acting - Bella especially blossomed I was surprised The flow was perfect with the book They could have expanded it in a few areas and it would have not bothered me because I'm a Twilight fanatic.<br/><br/>This series was clean, romantic, exciting, funny, suspenseful, dramatic, sci-fi magic. A 10 all the way!! I have always loved Sci-Fi and Romance - this series gives you that and so much more."
"sundar_ramnath","10","4","9","8 December 2012"," Best of the series
","Let me tell you this. This movie is ""only"" for Twilight Fans. The movie opens with Bella turning into a Vampire. The stunts she performs as a Vampire are awesome, particularly where she goes in hunt for blood. Rob and Kristen's love for each other is so natural that you will start envying them. Kristen scores well over the others. The girl who acted as Renesmee has done a good job. Though she doesn't have much dialogs, she delivers with her expression. Her eyes does most of the talking. Rob has done what is expected out of the character. Peter Facinelli is the surprise element here. He gets a meaty character and delivers it really well. The main disappointment is Taylor Lautner. There isn't much scope for him. The story travels at a steady pace and gets really fast at the end. The climax is outstanding, there is a real twist at the end that you should definitely not miss. Overall the movie is enjoyable and if you are a Twihard, watch is at least twice.."
"salvh","1","3","6","28 August 2018"," Cringe-inducing
","Every time I see parts of a Twilight movie on tv I am shocked about the CGI being so bad. How low is their budget? The story is about wolves and they can't even create a decent looking wolf. (In case you disagree or think technology can't handle it, please watch Game of Thrones. Or Jurassic Park even, although not about wolves, it's way older, but the CGI effects are better.) I am not from the US, but I thought these movies were (also) for adults. How can any adult take these movies seriously?<br/><br/>The acting is bad as well, I was watching a part with a big fight (at the end) and someone pushed a blonde woman towards a wolf and her eyes just widened a bit. Is that how people react when they are about to be eaten? Strange. I thought K. Stewart was the worst actress of those movies, but I have to take that back, the blonde vampire lady is worse.<br/><br/>Have I seen worse movies? Very very few, and they were all low budget and/or made by teenagers for a school project."
"khabc","9","3","6","26 February 2013"," Splendid effort!!!!!!!!!
","First of all, ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is the best twilight movie. In fact, if you consider its photography, performances, effects, action, music etc. its a hugely entertaining movie even for the ""non-twilight"" audience.<br/><br/>Secondly, for all those romantics out there, its an awesome ending to the series.<br/><br/>The lead pair have acted well. The supporting actors are also good. The new vampires are very interesting.<br/><br/>I won't give out too many details. Its better that everybody watches this blockbuster in the cinema.<br/><br/>Well worth every penny of the ticket price!!!"
"fuzzysquee","7","3","6","8 December 2012"," Surprisingly Enjoyable
","For the record: I am neither a ""Twihard"" nor a Twilight hater. I recognize that the books are far from high art but I enjoy them nonetheless.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is why I was disappointed with Breaking Dawn, the novel: even compared to its prequels, it was weakly plotted.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the book was how it botched the climax. All the tension, all the sense of danger...dissipated prematurely. Knowing this, I went into the theater with especially low expectations.<br/><br/>As it happened, the screenwriters used a simple, but very clever device to fix that flaw while remaining true to the source material. It worked so well that I didn't entirely realize what they'd done until after the sequence. Granted, if you've read the book recently you're likely to catch on quickly. I won't say any more than that.<br/><br/>Other good points: <br/><br/>~Opening Credits: these were honestly beautiful. Lots of soaring over the forests coupled with macro time-lapse photography involving ice and flowers. It was clearly symbolic of certain story elements, plus everything was shone through red and grey scale filters, echoing the books' covers. Perhaps the best part was the orchestral background music.<br/><br/>~A certain scene with Charlie and Jacob: It was every bit as hilarious as I imagined.<br/><br/>~Renesmee: I found her a little creepy in the book, but she seems much more natural in the movie...in as much as the word ""natural"" applies.<br/><br/>~A certain scene with Bella and Emmett: also nicely played out. Emmett's expressions were perfect.<br/><br/>~Vampire allies: there were some colorful characters here. I wish they'd been around sooner. Lee Pace's performance was especially good.<br/><br/>With all the story's faults, *somehow* this film worked. The person who invited me to see it was also pleasantly surprised. In our post-theater chat, we decided why: <br/><br/>1. The movie makers generally made good decisions. <br/><br/>2. The story is no longer about a girl choosing between her suitors---it's about people protecting their lives they've built from a common threat. For the Twilight series, it was a refreshing change of pace."

","This was so much better than I thought it was going to be. Go watch it you will so enjoy it. Thank you to everyone who was involved in this final instalment. It couldn't have been better. I laughed so much. Was shocked and impressed by the CGi. It was nice to see Edward back as the piano. The cottage is just perfect. Wow, its past 3am here but I'm still to wired to sleep which in my book makes this something special. I'm so trying to not give anything away here except to say I was so please with how this ended.

"Lady_Of_Magic","10","6","16","21 November 2012"," This was finale bliss for me!
","OK, I get it. <br/><br/>Like our presidential election, not everyone is going to agree. So it is with great books turned movies. Especially if it becomes a saga and or series of movies. The distinction must first be made and remain absolute. The books are the books and the movies are the movies. I seriously question the sanity of people who read the book/books and expect a movie to be exactly the same. This being my major beef with readers and moviegoers. Now....my take on this finale.<br/><br/>I LOVED IT! Let me tell you why. =)<br/><br/>It had serious key elements that I look for in any movie. It had a great storyline that deviated from the book but with some crazy and wild twists that worked. The beauty that was to be Bella after the transformation didn't disappoint. She was utterly beautiful and her hair was working! Oddly enough I liked her acting this time. I felt that she emoted better this time than any other of this saga. <br/><br/>I have seen people whine about the CGI. From special effects to the child and the mountain lion. Quite whining! There is no way that they could have gotten a human child to act in the manner needed to represent a human/vampire hybrid. I felt that she did look etherial and immortal. She wasn't supposed to look like a human child. As for the lion? What do you want? It was not great but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.Â <br/><br/>I felt the tenderness in the movie and the acceptance of Bella and the child. The love acted out between Robert and Kristen was perfect. Bella seeing a new world through her vampire eyes...impressively done. It allowed me to step into the movie and feel her transformation and not just view it on screen. Her powers came natural to her and developed through the movie perfectly. <br/><br/>I love funny dialogue. This had enough to make people chuckle with delight without making the lines seem slapstick and corny. Very nice!<br/><br/>I love romance. There were many times throughout the movie I wished if only for a moment to be Bella and in the arms of a man that loved eternally and unconditionally. I know most guys won't get it but ladies...come on. If you have a pulse then you know what I mean.<br/><br/>I love a good fight scene and this one played out well and upsetting for awhile =) But the twist that followed was so unexpected that the creative process behind it was genius. I loved watching the faces of the Vulturi, especially the look on Jane's face when she realizes she is finished. =) Also a honorable mention must be made about Aro. It was nice to see romanticizing about a certain vampire he will never have.<br/><br/>I could go on forever about the positives of this movie. Go see it and expect nothing. You will walk out feeling great about the entire movie. Go see it with expectations and ideas about what it should or shouldn't be or like or not like the book and you will be yet another whiner who will post here citing all of your complaints.<br/><br/>This is a love story that had a perfect ending. I loved the vision Alice has of the future for Bella and Edward =) <br/><br/>Yes, I loved it! It had everything I needed to walk away feeling satisfied and happy. Not all movies do that. This one delivers all components that I need in a movie. Especially a great ending. <br/><br/>Enjoy...!"
"buydscandles","10","8","24","16 November 2012"," I wasn't a true fan until now, loved it!
","I have to admit I kinda coasted through the books and the first 4 movies. I was curious and wanted to read and watch what everyone around me seemed to be experiencing. Right from the first movie I declared my loyalty to ""team Jake"". I think the storyline for all of the characters in BD 2 was just what I needed to make me a true fan. They did a really good job bringing it all together for those of us not really into the twilight movies. I think I can convince my hubby to see this one without seeing the others, and he'll know exactly why we love these characters. To add to my experience,I went to the midnight showing with a group of die hard fans! That made it so much better to see the reactions, tears, laughs and gasps around me. I even sobbed a few times.Overall if you take it for what it is, a movie based on novels geared towards late teens. I think you'll enjoy if you didn't already get hooked on the other movies."
"ms-banegas","10","9","28","16 November 2012"," Phenomenal!!!
","Without giving anything away, this movie is the following: epic, surprising, shocking, edge-of-your-seat kind of movie, intense, suspenseful, romantic, etc.! I will definitely be going to see it again. I was full of emotions while watching it: crying happy tears, sad tears, angry, shocked, thrilled, surprised, etc. There are honestly no words to describe this movie, but if I could describe it in one word? It would be: WOW.<br/><br/>Do not walk to your theater to see this movie; RUN!!! :)<br/><br/>And also for the non-Twilight fans? This is SO action-packed and awesome that it may just make you a fan because it is THAT good!! :)"
"jimenezwendy1","10","9","28","15 November 2012"," Best Twilight Movie!
","This movie is by far one of the best movies out yet. It's obvious all the actors grew into the characters. The scenes to this movie are breathtaking. I wish the CGI baby would have been more realistic- it did distract me from time to time but overall I loved how all of the vampires fit the part perfectly. Nothing was over done. I felt that Kristen Steward played a better vampire than Bella herself. Obviously Robert Pattinson played his character better than ever I assume so many years of playing the role of Edward Cullen, you almost become him. I can ensure you that Breaking Dawn Pt 2, will make you laugh, cry and it will definitely keep you at the edge of your seat because its so unexpected and well directed. Bill Condon did a magnificent job at directing this film. I cant wait for this to go on DVD to add it to my collection!!!!"
"chefjr84","10","5","13","28 November 2012"," Finally a full Cullen!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!
","I personally have to start by saying that this is the best in the series for me. I was waiting to see how Bill would put all the things from the book into this film, i believe that all in all he did a great job.<br/><br/>I was wondering how they would show Bella as a Vamp and personally i was impressed. The ""little"" issue between her and Jacob was done interesting to say the least. I did like how they changed the whole thing with Jay Janx in the book it is a really long a drawn out part that bores me. And the final 30 minutes or so of the movie was the most fun for me to watch in the theater. I had figured out he ending already (because i am an idiot and read 2 reviews), and man was it amazing to see the reactions, the girls freaked when Carlisle was ""dealt"" with lets just say, and when Jane got hers everyone clapped i was freaking laughing so hard and cheering and many other were as well. And when Seth died many girls freaked out i know my sister in-law did. and then when Jake and Nessy ""almost"" get caught everyone kinda cheered at what he did. and everyone cheered when Aro and the other leaders got what they deserved clapping a cheering erupted. and then when it cuts back out of her ""sight"" everyone freaked more ( i laughed cause i already figured it out). Finally laughing started when Aro shakes his head at his brother when he starts to try and get him to attack.<br/><br/>This was a great way to end it for me, because this saga for me has always been more about Bella coming into to her true calling in life versus the love triangle but i do understand the need for it and respect all the Mrs. Meyers did...."
"jo-lamley","7","5","13","28 November 2012"," Amazzing
","It is the best film in the Twilight saga, i loved the rest but this one tops all of the movies I have ever watched. Great effects and great plot bit different from the book but it makes it better than the book, all the best bits from the book are in it but also there are bits that you want to happen in it so it makes it even greater.<br/><br/>If you love Twilight you will love this film it has everything and I know I may sound cheesy saying its great but it really is. I advice everyone to see it even if you don't like twilight. It also has a good ending which is always good if it the last one and it ties all the films together so nothing is left out."
"preppy-3","8","5","13","23 November 2012"," A Twilight film I actually LIKE:)
","This picks right off where Part 1 took off. Bella (Kristen Stewart) gave birth to a baby right before she was changed (into a vampire) by husband Edward (Robert Pattinson). Everything is fine but then the Volturi hear about the baby being half vampire/half human and fear that it is an abomination that must be destroyed. They travel to the USA to deal with it while the Cullens get vampires from all over on their side to help them.<br/><br/>OK--this could have been easily done in one film. Like part 1 this film moves VERY slowly and, has subplots that lead to nowhere and has quite a few needless song montages. Also Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner give horrible performances, Michael Sheen overacts to an embarrassing degree and the dialogue is terrible and this doesn't make a lot of sense. Still I liked it a LOT! The cinematography is beautiful (especially on a wide screen), except for Lautner and Stewart the acting is great and there's a fantastic final battle that easily makes up for all the problems the film has. It's long, violent and brutal--my audience (composed of mostly teenage girls) LOVED it. So not a great movie but the beautiful cinematography and final battle made it worth seeing."

","First of all, if you are *not* a fan of the other movies then there's no reason to see this one.<br/><br/>Secondly, if you're expecting the movie to be just like the book, it's not but neither were the other ones.<br/><br/>And finally, if you *are* a fan of the other movies and/or the books, I think you'll enjoy this final installment of the series.<br/><br/>**Spoilers start here** <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this one. I liked the references to the other movies at the end and I liked that they basically ended the movie like the book ends. There are some missing parts from the book that I wish were included and some added parts that they could of done without. I wished they would of started the movie more like the book because I think that Bella's first few minutes as a vampire and her first hunt were quite entertaining. Those moments are in the movie but they are changed and missing a few funny scenes. The cottage looked great from the outside but didn't really look like a cottage on the inside. I did like the first scenes with Bella and Charlie but they should of shown her having some difficulty being around him. The scenes with everyone before the vision were well done although slightly rushed but they were in the book too. Alice's vision of the Volturri coming, her and Jasper leaving and bringing together all the vampires was nicely done. Each actor seemed to suit the roll quite well especially the creep factor of the Romanians. Bella's meeting with J. Jenks was quite different from the book but still served it purpose.<br/><br/>**Major spoilers below**<br/><br/>The final fight was very good although tough to watch at times. I knew as soon as it started that it wasn't real but it was very difficult to watch the death of some beloved characters. It was extremely nice to see Jane, Caius, and Aro get what they deserved. Marcus' death was very true to the character to the point that you almost feel sorry for him. Overall, the final fight is worth watching more than once. The end to the confrontation was well done and mostly followed the book. Again, I must say that I liked the ending. Alice seeing that the future was happy gives you closure to Bella, Edward, Jacob and Nessie. Edward being able to read Bella's thoughts is how the book ends but it was nice that they showed scenes from the previous movies. The ending credits showing almost all the characters from all of the movies was a nice way to credit those that were not in the this last movie.<br/><br/>**End Spoilers**<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Twilight Saga, you will enjoy this and I recommend that you see it. It's sad that it's over but know that through the books and DVDS, you can enjoy it all over again.. forever."
"orlandolover5","7","5","13","18 November 2012"," Best movie of the series...
","I will be the first person to admit that the movies were waaaay better than the books. This series could have been so much better, had it not been written by Stephenie Meyer. Granted, I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and not everybody can be JK Rowling, but the 2 dimensional characters that Stephenie Meyer thought up, make it impossible for this series to be great. Overall, given what the cast had to work with, this is a great series. The cast did an outstanding job with the characters they were given and really brought this particular movie to life. This movie is fast paced and well done. The characters mesh well together, all of them, including characters we haven't seen before. Acting is great. Overall a good conclusion to a decent series."

This is one forever that will last into the next life. It amazes me that 5 years ago in 2008 we were introduced to a whole new world that was created by a 35 year old writer who told a story of a mortal human being who was drawn into a world of vampires and were-wolves.<br/><br/>Nobody knew that it would end up with a sad-happy ending. We were mesmerized by the way that these movies and books that have melted (literally) into our hearts.

The Saga has been ingrained into our souls and left a chilling (so to speak) mark.<br/><br/>As I was sitting there watching the movie, I was shocked by the way each part of it was so breathtaking.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","10","21 December 2012"," Action-packed finale better than Harry Potter, if action is what you're looking for
","Similar to Harry Potter, adopted from a fantasy novel that is not exactly the pride of the literary world, the Twilight series does offer an interesting fantasy world. But ultimately, for the movies at least, the main attraction would have to be the action. It is therefore not hard to understand why both split the final book into two parts. The first part is the setup which incidentally (not intentionally, I'm sure) milks the cash cow to the last degree. The second part will hopefully redeem the movie makers from the curses of the segment of the audience less endowed with the virtue of patience (the majority, I venture to guess) with the action set piece of grand finale for which they have waited so long. In that department, Breaking Dawn Part 2 did well.<br/><br/>Perhaps a little recap would help, particularly to forgetful souls such as myself, on small details like to kill a vampire, you must tear out its head and toss it into a roaring fire.<br/><br/>""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"" are essentially very, very long establishing scenes focusing respectively on the two heroes, vampire and werewolf who, because they are not French, cannot resign themselves to a peacefully coexisting triangle with their shared love object Bella Swan like Jules and Jim. After these preliminaries, ""Eclipse"" becomes the most packed and entertaining, not only with the heightening of the tension in the love triangle, but also with intriguing side stories (flashbacks) providing more dimensions of some of the characters including the wolves (how there animosity with the vampires developed) and members of the Cullen vampire family Jasper and Rosaline. Throughout these three movies, we also see the growing menace of the dominating, powerful vampire empire of the Volturi family in Italy.<br/><br/>Developments - finally, in ""Breaking dawn part 1"", leading the audience through two key events, marriage and childbirth. The movie ended with Bella after giving birth and struggling on her sick bed at the brink of death, suddenly opened her eyes, with the iris turned red.<br/><br/>Not much needs to be said about the rest of the story, told in this ""Part 2"". A very thin, unconvincing plot surround the strangely fast-growing child Renesmee (something like 10 times faster than normal) led to a final confrontation between the Volturi on one side and the Cullen family (now with Bella as the strongest vampire of them all) assisted by a generous assortment of friendly vampires gathered globally plus, of course, the wolf pack. Soccer fans may think of this as a sort of World Cup that comes once every four years, with strong teams such as Russia, Ireland, Italy and Brazil.<br/><br/>To reiterate my summary line, if action is what you are looking for, you should be satisfied. The twist of sorts in the ending is also meets with general approval, it would seem, from audience and critics."
"FlashCallahan","8","4","10","6 December 2012"," You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?...
","Bella is enjoying her new life and new powers.<br/><br/>Soon however, family bliss is threatened again, by a new menace. Irina believes that the Cullens have created an immortal child and a threat to revealing the vampires existence to humans.<br/><br/>As Irina rallies the Volturi to destroy this child, Bella and the Cullens - together with any allies they can assemble - are preparing to fight a crucial, ultimate battle, to protect their family....<br/><br/>So after four years, it's finally come to the end, and after having seen all of the saga in less than one week, I have to say that this was the most forfilling for me.<br/><br/>The other movies were basically Bella, Edward, and Jacob pouting and gushing and generally looking miserable, and even though the threat is more severe this time, the three of them seem happy.<br/><br/>as always with this saga, the unintentional laughs are rife throughout. From my summary line, to the weird Jacob undressing in front of Bellas dad, it raises the eyebrows and smiles.<br/><br/>The last half hour is mental, and really well worth going through all the pouting the previous films offered. Sheen as always steals the show, his maniacal laugh is the best thing and strangest thing the whole film offers, and the cast seen surprised at the noise.<br/><br/>There is one scene that will divide audiences, and it really divided my audience. I'm referring to a scene near the end that made me literally go 'What?' at the screen, and made others groan, or laugh.<br/><br/>But to be fair, the original ending wouldn't have made good cinema, so it's a pretty genius idea.<br/><br/>It's a good end to a saga which I have more respect for now."

","If you didn't like or see the first movie, watching Breaking Dawn part anything is probably going to be a waste of time. This is where the bad reviews for the Twilight movies come from - non target audience being dragged to the cinema by a friend or partner with all the hype and success promising a great experience, only to find enjoying the sequels requires much more long term investment in the previous movies. It is also, understandably, not everyone's cup of tea. That is fine but I feel it has been overlooked as an epic coming of age story by, shall we say, older film critics.<br/><br/>These critics seem to focus on all the wrong aspects like - occasional plot inconsistencies, dodgy CGI and wooden acting. This franchise is definitely guilty of all these things but no more than any other franchise that is stooped in myth and fantasy.<br/><br/>Although I am a middle aged man I loved the first movie, Twilight, and saw past the fact that it was predominately made for a younger female audience. The potential for building on the characters and story that were introduced seemed huge. The main human character (Bella) meets the vampire family that don't eat humans but then comes up against vampires that do. She is in love with Edward Cullen vampire and he loves her more than anybody has ever loved anybody in a story since Romeo and Juliet. He defends her against these nasty vampires.<br/><br/>New Moon is the second movie which explores the issues with a human being with a vampire - issues like being eaten or turned into a vampire by accident which would be hard to explain to her dad (Charlie). Edward leaves Bella for two thirds of the movie but this is even more dangerous for her as they are so in love and she becomes self destructive. In this movie we are introduced to the existence of werewolves and a kind of Vampire council based in Italy called the Volturi. This is also where we are introduced to the possibility that Bella might become a vampire.<br/><br/>The third instalment, Eclipse, takes it all a step further as baddie vampires come to get Bella again with a huge ""new born"" army and goody vampires and werewolves (natural enemies) put there differences aside to fight this army off. The end of Eclipse is the same as the end of New Moon where Edward asks Bella to marry him and she pulls a face.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn part 1 - they get married and I nearly cried. The scenes in the Breaking Dawn movies are hugely satisfying after the build up from the previous three movies. The wedding, and the consummation of, is moving to those that care and the progression of the story towards Bella becoming a Vampire is handled really well. She becomes pregnant on the honeymoon but the baby is half vampire so it is a tough pregnancy to be honest. Anyway, Edward has to turn Bella into a vampire as she dies in childbirth - all while the rest of the vampire family fight werewolves outside. It is real edge of your seat stuff - the werewolves are not happy as they feel the peace treaty has been broken by the creation of a vampire child and the will Bella / won't Bella make it is almost too much to bare. One of the werewolves (Jacob) loves Bella though, and is by her side throughout the pregnancy. When the CGI baby vampire is born he then imprints on the baby. This is a werewolf thing that I don't understand but it means he is going to become the child's protector until she is an adult then I guess a bit more. Its well weird but I got passed it.<br/><br/>Part 2 - my expectations were that I was going to see Bella become accustomed to being a vampire and experience it through her eyes. I was hugely interested in how this would all be explained to her dad and also how Jacob's relationship with Edward and Bella's new born child, Renesmee, would evolve. I was not disappointed with how it was all dealt with and came away satisfied by a shocking ending. We have all heard about this twist towards the end and to say I was gripped throughout in anticipation for this is an understatement. The growing of the half human half vampire Renesmee also created a whole new brace of questions. These questions were of concern initially as gaping holes in the plot would have been left had they not been answered satisfactorily - thank god they were. I was worried about this movie slightly as I feared that they would just gloss over really important stuff and focus to much on the major fight scene towards the end. This was clearly going to happen against the Volturi having seen the trailer. Luckily there was far more to the action than the trailer let on.<br/><br/>In summary the whole cast, headed up by Kristen Stewart (Bella) and Robert Pattison (Edward), looked fantastic and fitted the roles perfectly. Kristen's nervous acting - particularly in the first movie - was part of the character and her style adapted as she progressed through to her finally becoming a vampire. Robert's reportedly ""wooden"" acting can be explained by the fact he is a 109 year old vampire and is essentially walking dead so is supposed to be a bit reserved and vacant - perhaps lacking the normal vibrancy you would expect from a normal human teenager. Only Michael Sheen, as the head Volturi, takes a different approach by being camp but in a very sinister way. The way he laughs in Breaking Dawn Pt 2 steals the show as far as acting is concerned but then you would expect nothing else from him would you?"

"carry-92","9","4","10","26 November 2012"," Beautiful ending to a Saga!
","I hear it all the time... people making fun of The Twilight Saga. ""You call that a great Vampire movie? The main guy sparkles... I can't take that serious... My girlfriend made me watch this with her..."". Let's not forget that this is also a lovestory, actually a very big part of it, and that Vampires are fictional beings. However the author creates or portrays them - that's the way they are. And they're not too far from original Vampire stories. They are cold, pale, drink blood - all features of a classical Vampire like the famous Dracula. Also the view of these fictional characters has changed. There are more modern stories, movies and series where they don't get burnt in sunlight or drink human blood (I know some in Twilight do but in the modern perspective they chose). It's as simple as the innovation of cars for example. They're still there to get you from one place to another but do they look like 100 years ago? Do they have the same features?<br/><br/>Now to the movie itself: <br/><br/>I thought that the final definitely did the Saga justice. I read the books, of course they're better, what do you expect? I'ts hard to top a book as a movie will never be as extensive and describing in some things. It would also be really sad if that happened. <br/><br/>I hated the fact that they split Breaking Dawn into two but after seeing the first part I was convinced. The way it ended was great, don't want to give away anything here though. You will be surprised even though you might already know they changed up the end a little bit before seeing it. They really had me there. I was sitting there, looking at my friend with this ""Woah, are they serious?"" expression. I liked the way they changed it, it didn't throw off balance of the concept.<br/><br/>One thing bugged me a little. Aro was being a little too silly at the ending part of the movie. A serious part where this didn't belong that much even though that's part of his character. It was still too much.<br/><br/>The musical choices where right on point by Carter Burwell, as known from the other parts. Really charming the visuals.<br/><br/>One last thing. I read the book about 2 years ago so I can't really tell how different it was from the film anymore. I did remember parts that I read while seeing them but not everything. I don't judge a movie by that anyway. I think about what I see not what I expect to see.<br/><br/>Open your mind a little when seeing this or any Twilight movie. It's not your average Vampire flick."
"socalgrl","8","4","10","19 November 2012"," A fine end to the saga.
","Okay, so aside from the bad CGI towards baby Renesmee, the ending towards is what makes your money's worth. Even friends who didn't appreciate the saga had admitted that the movie was pretty good. Romance throughout the saga proves very cheesy for some. Some might show major annoyance towards screaming girls who roar over Taylor Lautner's abs. Some might have considered the fact that this series is a ""chick"" thing, just like how Sucker Punch may be targeted more over to the guys. However, the series leaves room for the action-packed werewolves and the oddly sinister smiles and laughs provided by Michael Sheen. And if you are one of many that try to disregard's Kristen Stewart's acting as Bella Swan, I believe that she has showed major improvement in Breaking Dawn Part. 2 much more than Part. 1 - and way, way more than the previous three films. To you fans who have been loyal from the beginning and read the books, I believe you won't be disappointed. This plot twist you keep hearing about? It's well played. You will be angry, sad, relieved, and left with a bit of a bittersweet feeling. If you didn't get enough of almost everything that the other three movies failed to give you, give this one a chance. It is the best one yet by providing a solid finish and proves that the saga is more than just about a girl who fell in love with a vampire who sparkles. It is about a love that brought everything in place."
"Acousticsme-934-542230","10","8","26","14 November 2012"," Surprised me, even though I've seen all the others.
","Even though I didn't enjoy the books much (although I love the actual idea and storyline), I am a huge fan of the Twilight movies; I knew this movie was going to entertain me, and it didn't disappoint. Having read the book yonks ago, I had forgotten the ending. This final movie of the saga did a great job at wrapping up the storyline. Apart from one obvious scene (you'll know it when you see it), they did a great job with all the CGI effects. As usual, the scenery was stunning, and there were some great fight scenes, laugh-out-loud humorous moments and one scene even evoked a passionate applause from a three-quarters-full theatre (middle of the morning at school time, so there weren't many students or people with jobs there). There was the predictable (and nauseating) titter from the younger ones when Jacob goes shirtless. There wasn't a great deal of romance compared to the previous movie, which was nice, but the action scenes were plentiful and wonderfully choreographed.<br/><br/>For some reason, the Twilight movies really entertain me, even at 45! I enjoy the ethics portrayed by the Cullen family and there is a strong message in these movies for me personally that is not only charming, but so lacking in many movies today.<br/><br/>So, excellent movie, for me, and, if you're not one of those who decided they were going to hate the movies even before they came out, you won't be wasting your money if you choose to go see it. The only bad thing about it is that this is the last in the Saga :("

","I think this movie was awesome, a perfect ending to The Twilight Saga. The first 3 did not excite me after reading the books Pre-movies, surprisingly the small changes in the final movie differing from the book were a good addition to the movie. A must see for sure. Just to be clear I'm not a teen Just raving on the movie, I'm in my 30's. if you have not yet seen this movie you should go ASAP, don't wait for blu-ray if was too good on the big screen. It was nice for it to be just short of 2 hours long, some have been too short, if you read the books you'll know that a lot was left out, I truly believe that cutting this movie in half was a good idea though I'm sure the rest of you are with me on how hard it was to wait a year for part two. I hope this helped and know you will enjoy the movie, even the guys in the theater were having a good time watching it."

","All good things must come to an end and so does all average things. Yes, it is the end of the Twilight Saga and personally it will not be missed by me since I have never been a fan. The same cannot be said about a majority of viewers who are simply in love with the movie, its characters and also the actors and actresses in real life. The fame cruise mobile of Kirsten Stewart, Robert Pattison and Taylor Lautner is what TWILIGHT simply is to another. <br/><br/>TWILIGHT never has been rated in the higher digits and it simply stays the same with one characteristic which did disturb me. The entire concept of TWILIGHT swept through its fans back in 2008 simply on the vampire human romance. Apart from Charlie; there are no humans in TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2. Instead it is all about the vampires and the Bella Edward hybrid daughter Nessy and also TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2 shows you Bella fitting in as a vampire and how she progress and trains herself to be around her own daughter and the acceptance of Nessy by the Volturi.<br/><br/>Concentrated with more comic relief than all its predecessors TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2 is safe to be considered one of the most entertaining of the franchise. However it does tend to stray away at times focusing on certain Bella Edward moments which I think we have all had enough of from all 5 movies. However the Oscar winning writer who has turned director: Bill Condon seems to be convinced that the audience needs more of Bella and Edward seated in green pastures whispering sweet nothings! This side of TWILIGHT brings its rating down by half and completely destroys the velocity the plot is travelling in. However Bill Condon gets his fight sequences and his computer generated imagery right in the bulls' eye. Never is there is moment where the action aspect of the movie is compromised. <br/><br/>The Verdict <br/><br/>This isn't a must watch. This will satisfy only the most devout fans of the franchise. Since there are no humans involved it feels too monotonous. Excellent CGI and fight sequences whenever they pop up. The wolves finally have stopped talking and Stewart and Pattisons performances are as pale as they look on screen. Entertaining; Yet good riddance!<br/><br/>TITLE : TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2 DIRECTED BY: BILL CONDON STARRING: KIRSTEN STEWART, ROBERT PATTISON, TAYLOR LAUTNER, MICHAEL SHEEN & PETER FACINELLI RATED: PG RATING: 05/10 RUNTIME: 115 MINUTES"

Seeking neither critical applause or peer-review awards,  these movies, like those of Tyler Perry, seek only to provide unabashed  satisfaction to those who believe in their characters.. The big payoff  to the Twilight saga is a solidly mounted, carefully directed exercise  in franchise box-ticking... Even the decapitations are done tastefully.

He had a sweet and gentle, yet dramatic way of bringing the twilight saga to an end. This is definitely a MUST SEE, A LOT OF TIMES, MOVIE!!!!! <br/><br/>I am hoping for another book by Stephenie Meyer with the regular cast and blending in the relationship of Jacob and Renesmee (much older). The reason I mention regular cast is because we had to see 2 Victoria's, but Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was par-excellence! Thank you Stephenie for the classic works, ""The Twilight Saga."" <br/><br/>It was hard waiting a year for each movie to debut, but in the end, it was worth the wait all 4 times."

It really put me off and I had already concluded that the movie was going to be another profit driven sequel to reap in as much money possible to end of the franchise on the silver screen. Anyway, the movie unfolded very well, with in my opinion, very creatively inclining to the sci- fi/fantasy genre. I had low hopes for the movie but it turned out to be a blast.

The storyline is good, although not a considerable amount happens over the first four films .. and I can understand why .. it's all been saved til the end. Breaking Dawn Part Two is an unbelievable film; clever, full of action, emotional and all round excellent. I left the cinema at 2.20am and have never been so awake at that time in the morning, literally can't even explain how good the film is.

"Generalle_della_Rovere","4","7","23","14 November 2012"," Definite improvement from the previous films
","Frankly, I had the same notion as with most people that the film, rooted from a less than creative material would be pretty bad as well, but I went to see it anyway. Less than 2 hours later, I was surprised that it was actually quite entertaining, well, the last part specifically. True enough, the film builds incredibly slow, the narrative is as linear as with any of the previous installments but kudos to Bill Condon for getting the most out of Meyer's rather poorly written book series, and allowing people who aren't fans of it to appreciate it more.<br/><br/>The acting was just as bad but evidently getting better, Robert Pattinson especially.

","Never before has a series change my mind so well. Twilight did start off as a pretty good film for me, then as time went on it became a bit numb as the female fans around the world kept going on about looks instead of the story and acting. Although this annoyed me, I decided to watch Breaking Dawn 2 with my sister who had a spare ticket, and I must say the film was a triumph. There is a lot of emotional, a lot of twist and turns and amazing scenes. The film has scenes of comedy which are very good and the actors grow and are less boring, especially Kristen Stewart who shined throughout the movie. I must say definitely see this movie whether you are a twilight fan or not, the end will keep with you forever."

","Half the movie was credits. Half my heart is still not functioning. A short, drawn out end to the series that left the audience making inhumane guttural noises. Twilight fans will not be disappointed, but they will spend a major scene of the film and afterwards shaken like never before. The only thing I can say is that the screenwriter really will screw with you. You will enjoy this film and it will leave you oddly satisfied even though before the credits (which air beautifully twice) you yearned for more and you cursed and gasped along with the crowd. Go see it now. I still haven't recovered. Kristen Stewart's acting improved greatly. I fell for RPatts even though I despised him previously. In the end, the movie was all about Alice. Trying not to give anything way here. Just: amazing. And one major perfect screw. I am glad they broke it into two parts. The second was short and sweet and twisted and lovely.

So as my gift to her I took her to see it, She loved it! I loved it! Although 'm not much of a fan of vampires that glitter, I did like the amount of action hidden in there. As well as humor, and Jacob did take his shirt off. Which I was happy to see. (Not a big fan of Taylor, but he does have a very nice body) My sister and I both laughed through almost all of it and started to nearly cry when Jasper's head was removed towards the end. <br/><br/>After everything that had happened in that one scene, I began looking through the book in my mind and realized that yes it was mentioned, I just never imagined it quite the way the directors of the movie did. <br/><br/>The movie is an amazing ending to an OK saga.

Other than skipped the New Moon, forced for the Eclipse, and disappointed for the first part of Breaking Dawn, I was extremely thrilled for this one! Honestly, I never felt some much blood pumping into my heart watching movie, not that many I might say. Maybe the real deal is due to how boring the first part, for this exciting plot for the second. Might just be a better reason for both are supposed to be in a chapter, not separated. But of course, it would take more than just two hours of running. The best part of it, the part two really packed with actions and surprises that we were dying to see in the previous movies. Not after the first one I guess. Seriously (I keep saying this, am I?), I was like, ""Oh, my God!"", ""Wow!"", ""Oh, sh*t"", ""Serve you right!"", ""Take that!"", ""You go girl!"", ""That's like it"", ""Now we talking!"" all the way the storyline. Maybe after some times of addicted to Vampire's Diaries and Charmed, this Breaking Dawn Part 2 really entertained my thirst upon actions and fight, with some powers and abilities. There are humor too, to add, even though the scenes weren't that much. And truly, you gonna love how it satisfied our lust of actions and maintaining the happy ending for everyone. Seriously, again, I was dying to watch this kind of exciting, thrilling movie like this one. I can't give enough stars to five.

I still find the first one the best. But for what it seeks to achieve it does it well as anyone could hope for.<br/><br/>Kristen does a good job with the transformation to Vampire. Rob's role is a bit limited in nature so he has only a a few expressions that he can use a gentle smile and concern. Taylor has more to work with but he's about the same. Mackenzie Foy is suitably peculiar looking in her bizarre role.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments with Charlie etc.<br/><br/>The confrontation with the Volturi is well staged and scary because by now the characters mean something to the viewer. The twist took me by surprise as even though I am a fan of the movies, I had never read the books.<br/><br/>A couple of faults: A lot of new characters introduced in too quick a time. The logic of going after the child makes it's own sense even if it is silly.<br/><br/>Some dialog is cheesy especially the final scene but they have to be faithful to the books so I guess there was no choice.<br/><br/>The earlier part is a bit music video like.<br/><br/>The extended farewell to the characters is fitting and felt like that in memoriam segment in the Oscars and Globes.<br/><br/>Overall looking at all 5 movies as a whole, it's a good beautifully filmed movie with a grand climax."

Bella becomes the heroin in this movie in that she protects her family from harm and that she is now in fact a vampire, a must see! For the firs time in vampire history a child is born that is half human and half vampire, since Bella was not a vampire when she gave birth to her child. The Cullens clan is indeed growing and there are more of them, causing a closer bond between the Cullens and the wolf pack that Jacob is in, though I must admit in this movie Edward Cullens is obviously more enamored with Bella since he can no longer harm her, so there are some semi-nude moments in the movie, for women, Edward is a normal man, Jacob has a better chest, but Bella loves him...definitely the ending was something everyone should feel in life!"

Renesmee's CGI created face was kind of creepy for the start, but the special effects of these films have never been on point. Fans of the book will either find this film epically brilliant with the way its differed from the original story, or despise it for being meddled with. i feel that the twist ending gives justice to fans who want the saga to live on forever and shouldn't be disappointed. <br/><br/>If they were fans of the exquisite passion between Edward and Bella, seeing the werewolf Jacob bare all, and enjoy the dark humour the saga thrives on, then you wont be disappointed, however if you want the book to be the story and nothing else, then i'd tell you to close your eyes till the end. <br/><br/>brilliant way to end one of the best film collections of this century. <br/><br/>twihard."

There were a lot of things that this film got right: first of all the love triangle soap opera was put to an end finally, then you had Kristen Stewart finally playing a stronger character once she was turned into a vampire, Taylor Lautner wasn't annoying like in the other films, and the werewolves finally stopped talking amongst themselves. These were all good enough reasons for me to like this film better than all the other sequels. Another thing I enjoyed quite a bit was the addition of all the new vampire characters, but the best thing about Breaking Dawn was that epic battle scene which made the movie for me. It was a worthy ending to the franchise although I doubt it will convert any anti Twilight fans.<br/><br/>The film picks up right where the first part left us, with Bella (Kristen Stewart) being converted into a vampire after giving birth to Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) by Edward (Robert Pattinson). Bella begins to adapt quickly to her new life as a vampire and her newfound strength. Edward teaches her a few things about hunting and feeding before letting her see the baby. Once she is ready to see Renesmee she finds out that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has imprinted himself on her. At first she is furious as we see her strength unleash itself on his pack, but later comes to her senses. The rest of the Cullen family are all home welcoming and congratulating Bella, but peace doesn't last for very long when the Volturi hear rumors that Renesmee is an immortal child that could threaten their very existence with her powers. Alice (Ashley Greene) has a vision of the future and warns her family that the Volturi will come to kill Renesmee. The Cullen's decide to gather their vampire friends around the world so they can act as witnesses and stand up to the Volturi claiming that Renesmee is actually human. However they are ready to fight the Volturi alongside with their allies if they try to harm the girl. Everything seems set for the final epic battle between both sides.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is a lot better in this film considering she gets to play a much stronger character now and doesn't have to struggle about deciding between Jacob and Edward. Robert Pattinson isn't all that great here, but the truth of the matter is that no one came to these films for the performances. I'm really grateful that the werewolves weren't used as much here as in the other films. The twist at the end is also pretty fulfilling, and I really wasn't expecting something like that in a Twilight film. Bill Condon is a great director and he made this film much better by changing the final scene from the book. I still think he is way too good of a director for a franchise like this. The screenplay was once again adapted by Melissa Rosenberg from Stephenie Mayer's famous novel. As I said before, the material really isn't that great, but the film is really worth watching for that final half hour. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","Normally i'm not the big fan of Twilight, but my mom forced me to watch them, and so I did. Kristen Stewart was not my cup of tea, I found her very annoying and even though I properly knew that her character was suppose to be this way, it made me look at these movies and say, this is crap... But I saw the last Twilight movie yesterday and i must say that Kristen really surprised me very positively! Her character was totally different, and suddenly i realized something that changed my views on these films completely! The Bella role was meant to be sad, shy, and quiet.. But when she turns into a vampire herself, all the beauty and happiness gets out! So it all led to this, the was suppose to be a little different from normal girls in the other movies, so that she could really shine in this one! It worked so good, and I was blown away! But one thing that I don't get is the special effects... They are so bad... I don't understand why everything has to look like one big green screen shot, it's so awful to look at! But all in all, great movie, especially if you are a real Twilight fan, i'm not a fan, but it still blew me away, so if you haven't seen it yet, go do it! It will not disappoint you!"
"herbqedi","7","4","11","24 November 2012"," Not bad - Stewart's Best, Pattinson's weakest
","I thought this was a fitting enough end for the saga - particularly the last 30 - 40 minutes. I also enjoyed seeing the ""newborn"" vampire hunt and found that intriguing. Jacob and Kristen Stewart are given string characters and plenty to do and they do it very well. Stewart also exhibits an energy level and sexuality here far beyond anything we've seen before - and it's exciting to watch. On the other hand, Edward is SO weak in this one - he's far weaker than the baby or anything else. I'm not talking about Pattinson's performance - which I found adequate - but how weak his character was in this one and how much he more than anybody needed Her protection. Overall, it was an imaginative, if episodic, way to end the series."

","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is seriously boring. Nothing happens for the entire movie, but, don't worry, it's all building up for the much anticipated finale when. . .nothing happens. For most of the movie, characters stand around, stare at each other and occasionally recite lines. The only eventful part of the story is nothing but a cheap fake-out. Without Rifftrax, I wouldn't have made it through this terrible film. Good riddance, Twilight."

The reason I'm copy/pasting my review for part one onto part two is because I'm going to be treating them as one move. <br/><br/>This movie contains one of the dumbest scenes put to film - the one where a bunch of CG wolves yell at each other telepathically in English. The acting is bad, the sound design is bad, the CGI is bad the plot is inconsitant filler, there are too many flashbacks and dream sequences. Nothing in these movies is explained. The only entertainment there is to be had is if you're watching it to see just how bad it is. This movie is not worth the time or effort it takes to sit through it. Its terrible."
"achebre","3","2","4","9 March 2016"," A good example of how not to make a movie and a fun work out for critics
","First, I'd like to say that this is my second time watching this movie after the buzz it created when I was still a teenager. I decided to give it another shot out of nostalgia and a boring Sunday.<br/><br/>I have read enough reviews here to not repeat the overall sentiment that most people had watching this movie but I wanted to leave a couple of questions regarding the movie's general ability to think that its viewers are complete idiots:<br/><br/>1.Does turning into a vampire just involve getting a new sultry eyeshadow look and a sense of style or is there more to that?<br/><br/>2.If vampires are supposed to be pale and morbid looking then why on earth are the ones from the Amazon and Morrocco perfectly healthy looking? Also Sheen's foundation was definitely creasing and sooo obvious it was painful to watch.<br/><br/>3.Why doesn't Bella's dad even budge on the fact that his daughter got married at 18, disappeared and then came back with a baby? And why didn't he turn up to their house previously asking where she was since they live down the road?<br/><br/>4.Lastly, I don't understand how no one has mentioned this before: the vision of Alice (which I believe is not in the book) and essentially the most liked scene of the entire movie has no basis. Her power is about seeing the future and if the Volturi decided to not got through the whole killing thing then the vision that she has and shows shouldn't even exist in the first place right? This makes the whole scene even more irrelevant and a desperate move to finally put some action into a desperate movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't particularly like any of the actors but I must say that Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart looked a little bit more alive which made me think that they're really showing how happy they are to finish off the worst mistake of their career."
"jasonandjennawhitehead","6","2","4","3 March 2013"," Non-Twilight Reader Movie Review - Part 2
","I have never read any of the Twilight books, and after seeing all four movies (which I got hooked on one day when they all came on cable, on after another), I haven't really wanted to ever read them. But for some reason I was drawn to finding out how everything ended, so after seeing Part 1, I really was ready to see Part 2, especially when people kept telling me how good it was.<br/><br/>I had no idea how it ended or anything about the story before I saw it, on purpose, so this movie (the ending especially) was a real treat for me. Kristen Stewart drove me nuts in every other movie, but in this one, I actually liked her. I HATED that they used CGI for that little girl. HATED. I have no reason why that was even suggested, much less followed through on. And you would think that if they were planning on doing that, this is a franchise with almost unlimited funds, they would have found a graphics team that could have done better than this one did. And while we are on the subject of ridiculous things that shouldn't have happened, that stupid line about the loch ness monster (could have been in the book, who knows?) should never been in this movie and I don't know how any actress could have pulled that off without bursting into laughter and walking off the set.<br/><br/>I had a hard time following some of the things going on, probably because I hadn't read the book. And I thought it was completely pointless to make this into two movies, instead of making one kick-&^% movie (which they could have if they really wanted to, but you know, revenue got in the way!) The entire movie franchise was salvaged the second I saw Carlisle's head in Aro's hand. I then watched one of the best fight scenes I've seen, mainly because of all of the main characters who were killed. Then, I got to the end and realized it was all a vision. Great, great ending.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was the best of the five for me. They could have had better dialogue. At some point, there will be good film adaptations for books (I was so disappointed in the Hunger Games, as I have read that book) but I am guessing, this wasn't one of them. However, it certainly wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen!"
"nancy_hse","7","2","4","1 March 2013"," Don't let everyone else's opinions influence your own
","OK, I've never thought that I would defend a Twilight movie. I've watched all of them and - I have to admit it - they were ridiculous. The book series itself is not a masterpiece but is an easy and absorbing read. But the films have always been famous for bad acting (how do the good actors actually manage to act so badly?) and for making even the most (theoretically) touching scenes ridiculous. I didn't anticipate much before watching this last film. That's why I was positively surprised by it. The movie is fast-paced, entertaining, absorbing and enjoyable. There is not much sense or much good acting in it but it reaches its goal very well. I couldn't get away from the screen (even though I wasn't in the theater and could always leave) and I received my part of guilty pleasure. So don't think you're a misfit if you like it. Maybe you're just more honest with yourself."
"bryanbezter","5","0","0","20 May 2020"," I was eager for the final battle, because everything else was so so. But then, the final battle was not as expected.
","The music, score, tone, opening and end credit sequences, and casting are perfect for the movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects are okay, but Bella's first hunt scene does not look smooth. The action scenes are not as expected, the Volturi holds back. Most of the conflicts are unnecessary and underdeveloped, because they are only caused by misunderstanding or lack of self-control. The vampires gathering and Volturi's visit are just for the sake of the movie, because it could easily be solved through a fair trial or discussion. The final resolution was weak, because the Volturi just leaves, although they bring huge army. Since the final battle is only Alice's alternate vision, it undercuts the risk that the movie offers. The imprint is interesting but is not sufficient to solve the conflicts. The emotion of almost all characters in the movie is very unstable.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) Why did the Volturi have to wait for few days to come to the Cullens?
2) Baby Renesmee did not have vampire features, like eyes, fangs, skin and body temperature, or constant physical need for blood.
3) How could Bella hold herself when Charlie came to the Cullen's? Baby Renesmee also did nothing when she was on Jacob's arms or near humans.
4) For convenience, the Cullens easily have the wealth and easy access to airplane ticket and housing furniture.
5) If the Volturi was some kind of government for the vampires, why did they not have system for crime reporting, fair trial, discussion, proof gathering and validation, and trustworthy members? The members only acted based on their instinct and emotion.
6) How could Jacob know that the 'uninvited' vampires were uninvited? What about the Amazonian ones?
7) Bella ridiculously easily control her desire for human blood.
8) Edward could have easily read Alice's mind.
9) How could the vampires control themselves when Jacob was in the house? How could the 'food' be sustainable and enough for all?
10) How did all vampires know about Carlisle's intention to gather witnesses? Did he called them? Why did they need to travel, then?
11) How could Bella have the defensive power when she was in human form? Could humans have powers as well? How could the power be so random and extensively powerful, like controlling elements?
12) Why was Bella so special that her power was always active even when no one realized it and she did not know about it?
13) Alice's vision could change, but it never happened. It was too convenient for the Cullens.
14) How far could Alice see the future? What were the constraints? Did she always have to watch the one she was trying to sense? How many people could she sense at the same time? Did they have to be in certain range?
15) When Carlisle's vampire friends and family went back, the Volturi could just attack the Cullens easily.
16) What did the Volturi want exactly? What were their job and responsibilities as 'Volturi'?
17) In the battle, the Volturi could defeat the Cullens and friends very easily. Jane's pain ability could be very effective.
18) Sometimes, a vampire could easily break another vampire's head/limbs easily, but sometimes, it is not the case.
19) Why was immortal child so dangerous? Why could the vampires not able to restraint/train it? What made a regular vampire child and an immortal child different?
20) Why would Irina not tell her assumption about immortal child to her family first? Why did she not ask for explanation first?
21) Why did anyone think that Renesmee could pose a threat?
22) Why did Alice and Jasper have to go secretly?"

Those dudes were the highest rank I expected a lot...

","There are no words to describe this fantastic film. It was a perfect ending to the Twilight Saga. The cinematography was beautiful as were the credits in the beginning. I must admit that I felt I was fully prepared for what was to happen because, being a fan of the saga, I had read the books many times. But nothing could've prepared me for what happened in the Volturi scene. The director literally screws with your brain with a heart- wrenching and tragic twist that was never seen in the books. This saga may have been about a deep love between a human and a vampire but in the end you see there truly is no love like the love for your family. All I can say is prepared to be amazed, heart-broken, and on the edge of your seat. It has all come down to this."

If someone doesn't think so I am guessing they are not a fan, which is fine because the movie is a fan driven franchise and I thought it ended perfectly fine. The CGI wolves were good, however the baby scared me. Thankfully she was not a baby for very long. The battle scene was awesome and the twist was flipping great. Kristen surprised me as vamp Bella. Take away her nervous ticks and she does fine as an actress. Robert Pattinson was amazing and Edward had some balls in the movie (unlike the book). Taylor did well (better so than the other movies). Some parts will make you laugh and cry. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend to the fans or the curious."

","I've read the books and seen all the movies... and to me as a fan this was the perfect ending to the saga... to everyone who is seeing this movie without any prior knowledge of Twilight a lot of stuff will not make sense to you... and if you included in your review how there wasn't any blood in the decapitations and how it's silly that they sparkle... this is a film adapted from a book... and you guessed it.. the book specifically describes vampires like that... you have to stay true to the books... this a series! so you cannot give an honest review if you have not seen the previous films... I mean the title of it says part 2!! <br/><br/>Now to my review of the film... I think Bill Condon did a beautiful job portraying the characters that we love and that have lived with us for so many years now... I think they rushed the beginning a lot and we don't get to see much of vampire Bella as we wished... I have to agree that the CGI baby was a total joke! I'm sure at this point in the franchise they could've afford to have some better effects to make her look more human! it was terrible.. but once Mackenzie steps in it's much better... I wish they had shown more of what Reneesme shows people through her hand... and more scenes between Edward and Bella, this is a love story after all... I think the twist was genius! It was the perfect way to remind us (fans) how much we are attached to the characters and just to see them die was traumatic in a way! and it was also great to add some action to the film for those first timers that still managed to complain the lack of blood! The effects of the fight scene were so much better than the baby! I liked it a lot and the fact that they did not deviate from the book in a any way was just what we were expecting... By far this movie is the closest to the book from all the previous films and as a fan of the books, seeing the movie brought me back to exact lines I read from the book and it was great! The ending was the best... the meadow scene and the recap of Bella and Edward's story just brought the story full circle and the highlight of the actual page of the book was perfect! Overall this movie was made for the fans of the books and it was great and trust me people will be watching this movie multiple times! <br/><br/>So please refrain from reviewing if you have no knowledge of the books or the previous films!"

","I just watched it hour ago. It was opened 3 theaters and all sold out and the best part was i sat in the front of the screen. pretty annoying, try to think positive 'let see in different angle'. i don't really expect anything from this movie. as i loved the twilight, and i read all the books of those. but the second one was really disappointing, and more and more. so, i don't wanna get anymore disappointing and the reason i watched it because i follow it since the first one and read the book. I am not sure actually (as my position wasn't really the best one), i could see there were few scenes which very rough with the special effect, like renesmee when she was a baby, also when Edward played piano, i can see clearly his hand way too long to play piano. beside than that, the acting are still poor as always. i don't know why i hate so much when K Stew in it, the worst was in the beginning, when she was angry, she looked weird. so far for me, she ruined the movie. and what makes it great was the fight scene, first time knew that 'that guy' died was unbelievably surprising me a lot. it is the first time i watched movie and i felt so exited when i watched it, when this guy will die, who is next to die, why him, why her, i hope she/he save. those feeling were mixed in the fight scene. and more and more surprised are still coming... until everybody says 'AHHHHHHHH'. however it was the best scene from this movie. i was pretty surprised when i watched it, because when i read the book, as i remember, there was no war between them, but Bill Condon was pretty good to visualize it, i believe without war scene, this movie will be disappointing like always. so, no expectation and i got even better. just wonder who doesn't want to see cutie Dakota fanning died in this movie...? i think everybody does."

","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, 15-year-old Raven Devanney, admits that she's never been a huge Twilight fan but found herself with new respect for this series now, even to the point of contemplating reading the books. Her review follows. <br/><br/>Twilight, Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br/><br/>This dramatic ending concludes the tale of Bella and Edward on their journey, defying the odds of love.<br/><br/>I have never really been a fan of the Twilight series, never read any of the books or waited in line at the midnight premieres. I'm not a huge fan of dairy products, and this series contains an awful lot of cheese. But food jokes aside, I didn't completely dislike this film. Don't get me wrong there were definitely some parts that were way too dramatic, but overall I would say this is by far the best film in the Twilight Saga. The cinematography and special effects weren't anything different from the previous films, so I think they were pretty well done. However, I was very confused when I saw Renesmee. I couldn't tell if she was real or not because she looked so computer edited.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with Bella's makeup in the opening scene. This movie picked up right where it left off and in the last film, the final scene was Bella lying on the table after she gave birth. When this movie started, it was Bella waking up on the table two days after the birth of her daughter. But her makeup and hair was perfect. If she had been unconscious for two days how would she have on spotless makeup? Another detail that I noticed that didn't seem right was Edward and Bella's new home. Who made it? And who could design, build and furnish an entire home in only two days? I pretty sure vampires don't have super-human- carpenter powers. One last visual detail that was weird for me was Renesmee's room. When you first see it, it's a nursery, but then a day or two later it's completely different and completely refurbished. How on earth do the Collins afford to refurbish their homes every week?!<br/><br/>I can't say I have a favorite character because the acting done by each character is a little far fetched. I understand that the storyline itself is far from realistic, but I feel like all of the actors over- play their roles. I do have a favorite scene though. The final battle scene completely shocked me, and made me actually enjoy the movie. I haven't read the books so I had no idea what to expect, but I got completely sucked into it. I watched this film with my friend who isn't a Twilight fan either, but her and I were squealing in shock during the ending scene. After the movie I felt like such a nerd because I got so into the film, but in all honesty I actually enjoyed it. No, I will not become a Twi-hard fan now, but I do have a lot more respect for this series now. And I'm thinking about reading the books.<br/><br/>This film is the most violent and sexual out of the whole series so I recommend it for ages 13 and up. Obviously if you're a huge Twilight fanatic, you're going to see this movie no matter what anybody else tells you. And if you completely despise the movies (which I'm sure some of you probably do) you're not going to see the film no matter what you're told. But if you're in the neutral category of loving/hating Twilight like I am, give it a shot and you might actually be surprised. Overall I give Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 - 4 out of 5 stars because it definitely surpassed my expectations."

","I wasn't sure how they would've made the end, and honestly I thought that there, according to the books, were a lot of details and twist's missing in the films. But this finally ending; beautiful and truthful to the books surprised me. Bella as a newborn vampire was very convincing, she was strong and really funny to watch. There were also some other funny elements: For example some of Aro's bursting into cries were quite funny and Renessmee as a baby too. The special effects on the baby were not convincing but hilarious, sadly really. The camera ankles were fantastic and made a good try to catch the explanation of a vampires strong sight with clear and close-up pictures. All in all I loved it, I loved the music which matched the mood in the film. And I really loved the meadow scene at last, in which Bella showed Edward her love for him through her thoughts in the shield she can press upon others. I can definitely recommend every single twilight fan or former fan to go watch the last part of Breaking Dawn, the end of the best saga."

","wow, if there's any definition of surprise. its that a twilight movie was actually good. before i get into this movie i wanna point out that in one part of the movie, i was completely shocked at what had happened. i was wondering if my friends saw the same movie i did, because this part of the movie had screwed me over in a way that i loved! everyone had been tricked and went ""AWWWW."" i was pleasantly surprised that this scene saved the film. i hated every single movie except eclipse. but the weather was always breath taking, and made me feel at ease, I'm one for gloomy weather because thats when i think most. the movies color is captured so perfect i could practically feel the temperature. and we all know Bella is now a vampire, i don't know if she knew this herself but there has never been more expression in her face than in this film. i guess she played dead for a teenager, and looked alive and happy when she was a dead bloodsucker. because forget logic. besides that, every character gets enough screen time, the whole movie consists of gathering a group of vampires to witness a problem that the lead vampires wont believe. all the vampires that are recruited get enough detail to know they are there, so your not left wondering who the hell died. Jacob also made fun of himself in this film, he is SO sensitive and pouty, i don't see why girls like him. i went to see this with three of my twi-hard cousins, and 2 of my cousins that hated these films. I'm in the middle, i find something interesting in these films that people don't. all in all, for a twilight movie it was really good, starts cheesy, goes hardcore in the climax, and then goes cheesy for the last 3 minutes, and for the 40 year olds crying that its the end. calm down, because with the money they make i wouldn't be surprised if they made a prequel or had the author write another book. i give it a 7/10 for pulling a trick on the audience, and wowing us for a last film. if you think about it, the climax is the only true amazing thing in the film, they could have made the film with only 1 part, but expand it to 3 hours and cut out the crap Bella had to go through when she was pregnant. and for the last note, the baby is obviously CGI, but it is the cutest little thing i have ever seen in computer graphics. give it a shot if your thinking about giving these movies 1 more chance."

","As someone who read and very much enjoyed the books I thought this a rather good adaptation and an enjoyable movie. Others here have complained about things like introducing characters who have relatively small parts, but since all of the Twilight movies are relatively faithful book adaptations I think it would really have been a disservice to the fans to have excluded these characters. There were certainly some changes and omissions, but that is to be expected in any adaptation of a book. In my opinion they did a good job of covering what needed to be covered and making for a satisfying conclusion to the movie franchise.<br/><br/>I heard that the ending would be a surprise and it certainly was. I thought it worked very well and it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>In summary, if you're a Twilight book fan this is a must-see, just like the rest. If you're a Twilight hater I'm not sure why you'd bother."
"mrfish5000","7","4","12","18 November 2012"," The best attempt to tie everything together, except for Eclipse
","The film was great, had more varied characters, had more insight into the mythology, and showed more of a living reality of the series. It wasn't perfect, a few minor tweaks would have made the film a bit better - Nahuel's style choice etc. Lol. All in all this gave a stunning happy ever after to a series that rivalled the following of Harry Potter, but most importantly, showed that indie films that have small beginnings, can develop, and with enough care, can capture the attention of a generation. <br/><br/>A valid *attempt* to improve everything that the series had offered previously, and if you're willing to see it's value, you won't regret having been a fan of the series. The casting for me was one of the best aspects of the movie, really diversified the field, lowest point was that Mackenzie didn't have many lines, and that the cgi for Renesmee and a lot of the action was a bit lacking - like vampire speed etc.<br/><br/>PS I will even admit that I shed a tear at THAT omg moment :)<br/><br/>Go here for full criticism of details etc. <br/><br/>http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1673434/board/thread/207210078"

","I really enjoyed this movie. IF you love all of the other Twilight movies this one falls right in line, except this is the best one of them all - you get everything you have wanted since the beginning of the story. If you are one of those who just hate everything Twilight then DON'T GO see it because you people always find a reason to put it down (not sure why you bother going anyway), BUT if you are a die hard fan like me - this movie is really good and has a great ending! I saw it last night for the sneak preview (worth being super tired today at work)and am going tonight to see it again and maybe again on Saturday!The theater I was in was totally packed out and being shown on 3 screens, so I know I'm not the only one who loves these movies!"

I've seen a lot of movies .... again, I really enjoyed this one, best twilight movie I guess :D The ending is the best really, at first I was hesitant to watch this movie because of the negative reviews. <br/><br/>So for those who haven't seen the movie yet, give it a try, It's worth watching. Don't listen to the negative/bad reviews. It's either they're old or they don't have good taste.

","I , for one ,was very happy with the movie, feeling it provided a fitting conclusion to the Saga. Bella really transforms as a vampire and I feel that the ending was exciting and surprising. In the book the whole confrontation with the Volutri was just talked out. The battle made it much more interesting and plausible. I've read the books, so I followed it with no problem, but my son, who has seen all the films, found all the visiting vampires confusing.In the book, it's all laid out better, but I realize that there are time constraints to filming.<br/><br/>I felt that the main characters were excellent, as usual, Bella being very strong, Edward being supportive, ,and Jacob, for a change, being happy and not in the middle of a love triangle, and being very annoying to boot. The CGI Renesmees were odd, but the final one (Mackezie Foy) did a fine job. I liked the movie ( and series) a lot, and would say to those who badmouth it, don't waste your time and money. I have no time for the Batman series, but there are many who love it, so try and respect another's opinion"
"amyluna","8","3","8","27 December 2012"," Women Gave This Film a 7.0 Rating
","I just want to point out to readers trying to decide whether to see this movie or not that there is a serious gender gap with regard to the votes for this film. As of this writing, the film's overall average rating on IMDb is a 5.8 but 18,200 males gave it an average of 4.7 and 14,700 women gave it an average score of 7.0. So men are dragging down the numbers here, lol. I think one reason for this might be that the male viewing audience is still getting adjusted to films where men are eroticized for women's visual pleasure. Of course, women have had to watch hot young women eroticized in films for decades so we're used to it, but I suspect it still makes a lot of men nervous in our homophobic society. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, not because of the acting (hey, after 5 films, we know Kristen Stewart can't act!) but because it is very sensual. I enjoyed all the uber close ups that took us into her vampire reality in a very visceral way. And that cabin in the woods! What a dream! That's paradise wish fulfillment on film if ever I saw it. <br/><br/>Was this film great art? Heck, no. But for this red-blooded heterosexual female it was great ENTERTAINMENT. Thanks, Hollywood, and keep up the good work of making films that pander to people's capacity for fantasy stories rooted in LOVE, with an adventurous female protagonist who rejects gender stereotypes, eroticized supporting male characters who are also gender conscious, sensuality, passion, eternal romance and epic battles fought for love. How refreshing to go through an entire film without having to cringe at some neanderthal unconscious objectification of our strong heroine! Goodness knows, we are STARVING for THAT type of movie! I'm not surprised these film's are making BANK at the box office, lol. :)"
"dcobbimdb","8","3","8","2 December 2012"," Very good conclusion!
","Honestly I hesitate to vote as ""love stories"" are really not my gig, although I love the whole vampire ensemble and most everything that goes along with it which I guess includes this too. The fact that this movie had a good final battle made all the difference at least for me, be it a vision or not. That and the fact that it truly wrapped up the entire thing with no lame cliff hanger ending.<br/><br/>I took my now 11 year old daughter to this, keep in mind I took her reluctantly to the original Twilight back when she was 7 when everyone in her class was raving about it. I had a hard time in the 3rd movie when well you know what happens... In any case I have to say this 4th movie was very good and probably 2nd to only the first movie as it's next to impossible to top the first movie of anything. It really brought everything together, tied together everything story line wise and really gave everyone what they wanted, which really was to see Bella finally become a vampire and embrace that lifestyle.<br/><br/>The whole Volturi ""bad guy"" thing played out well in the end and left a satisfying ending at least to me. typically I hate that whole ""It was all a dream"" kind of ending, but in this movie it seem to fit and yet not rob you of the experience. I have to say Kristen Stewart is really a beautiful girl and it was nice to see her made up so beautiful in this movie and see her smile and actually look happy as she's been so subdued and withdrawn beauty wise in the previous movies. It's no doubt she was born to stardom and we'll be seeing more of her."

Just wait till you see it bill condon is an amazing director and should be awarded thousands of trophies for it. <br/><br/>The only thing I was not happy with was Renesme as a baby it was so fake that all you could do is laugh every time you saw her.

Rob was a little less convincible as Edward in some scenes which was the only thing that bothered me trough out the whole movie...<br/><br/>And that twist gave me a headache!!! When they cut off Carlisle's head i literally trow my popcorn:) Anyways it was a nice touch - to see what would've happened if there really was a battle..<br/><br/>Loved the credits at the end...nice to see all the characters for the last time...touching...<br/><br/>Oh, just one remark - i hated the soundtrack - i mean no MISE?!?!?!

But I would be careful as if you have not read the book certain things are not that obvious such as Alec's power, Bella's daughter power, Jacob and Bella's daughter relationship! <br/><br/>Even though it does not follow the book that much the script contained humour and can be serious at the same time, but if you miss it you will regret it as everyone will be watching and talking about it!!! A must see!!<br/><br/>many people don't like twilight but they always seem to watch it first! It does contain nudity and scenes of violence! Great for fans of fantasy and science fiction!

","First, I would like to thank K-Stew for giving the best performance so far! Of course, she can improve her acting skills, but I am very glad that she did not disappoint me with her acting in the most anticipated scenes (such as punching Jacob!). Robert did a great job as always - always keeps his distance, but has so much energy and love. There is a lot of new faces in this movie and I think that they are well chosen and they also did a memorable performance. I must add, Renesmee was adorable! The movie has fulfilled all of my expectations and more. Just when you think the film couldn't have gotten better, there is this beautiful ending, filled with emotions - joy and happiness but also melancholy. The ending makes you want another sequel.<br/><br/>P.S. For completely understanding the movie it is necessary to read the books. Only then you can watch the movie without prejudices."
"neelofarmalik25","10","4","13","23 November 2012"," I give it a 10
","""Twilight: The Breaking Dawn"" was 10/10. It can not be done better, it was the best ending. I could have imagined of, well filmed with a very good flow, separately the movie was fine. But when you club all the parts together the movie is an awesome peace of work. <br/><br/>Those who did not find it interesting, might have not seen the earlier parts of twilight, or might have lost interest because of long gaps. So i suggest to revise the earlier movie parts, As you can enjoy ""The Breaking Dawn -2"" in a better way.<br/><br/>The Breaking Dawn part-1 is little slow but is beautiful. And it also created a curiosity for the part-2. As expectation is well served, and the movie is worth the wait."
"zterrell","7","4","13","21 November 2012"," Better than expected
","First, this is the Twilight saga, so the criticism I've seen seems to generate mostly from guys who wouldn't like chic flicks anyway.<br/><br/>As a husband, I dutifully took my wife to this last installment, not exactly thrilled at the idea, but figuring it would have to be better than the part 1, which left out many of the key ingredients that my wife enjoyed in the book.<br/><br/>I found this a much faster paced movie and the ending seemed to have been engineered mostly for the male audience. The characters were a little more animated and easier to watch.<br/><br/>On the negative side, if I hadn't had my wife to fill me in on a few details I wouldn't have understood some of the motives ... such as most of the battle at the end was over Alice, and not the newborn half-ling.<br/><br/>In all, I thought, from a guy's perspective, this was equal to Eclipse."
"WebKinect","9","4","13","18 November 2012"," Best of The Series!
","Firstly i must stress that i am NOT a fan of the series. I found the first movie as dull as dish water and didn't start watching it until the third one, despite my hubby doing his best to make me go to the cinema with him lol. I found the third one 'enjoyable', the fourth pretty good and this one AMAZING!<br/><br/>The story starts off right at the end of the last (which makes a nice change compared to others). Bella has just come back to life and is stood in front of a mirror looking at her 'new self'. She explores her new found strength and speed for a little before wanting to meet her daughter. Here is why i gave the movie a 9 instead a 10 because the baby is so obviously cgi and reminded me of the baby ape in the latest Planet of the Apes. I understand why they had to use a cgi baby over a real one, because of how she communicates with others which they probably wouldn't have got a real baby to do but i personally feel it let the movie down.<br/><br/>As Renesmee grows Bella takes her out to play in the snow where Edward's cousin see's Renesmee jump 10ft in the air to catch a snowflake and assumes she is an 'imortal', a child that has been turned into a vampire which is apparently the most evil of evil and then tells the Volturi who decides to kill Renesmee and the entire Cullen family. And so the action starts.<br/><br/>I won't give away what happens but there is a massive shock in store for you all when the battle ensues. I will just say, don't believe everything you see! At this point everyone within my screening gasped in shock and actually applauded which was kind of funny lol.<br/><br/>As usual, with the exception of baby Renesmee the SFX was impeccable and the love which is clearly very real between Bella and Edward and something we all dream of happening to us.<br/><br/>I personally thought that not only is this film the best of the series but also the best movie i've seen this year...and i go to the cinema 2 or 3 times a month! You don't need to be a fan to enjoy this but if you are a fan then i have no doubt you'll love it. For those posting negative reviews i would say that they take things far too seriously. You should NEVER go to see a movie with expectations but instead if you go with the intent of just 'going to see a movie' then you'll enjoy it much more!"
"lcsnow8","Null","4","13","17 November 2012"," Great Movie but Could Have Been Better
","I think the people behind this movie knew what they were doing. As the guy who gets dragged to all to all the movies to hold the popcorn and pay for drinks, I've seen the entire saga. By far, this movie was the best, however, Kristen Stewart continues to suck the life out of her lines, the actors around her obviously trying to support her, but she ruins the entire scene. I did however, love the Romanian vampires and the ending. The film had beautiful cinematography, directing and editing, good pacing, and with the exception of Kristen Stewart; wonderful acting. There was well timed comic relief and tension that continued throughout the entire movie, which kept the viewers interested. With a bit of casting changes, few script re-writes and no sparkles, this movie would have gone beyond its current state. I think most people hated this movie because it was already stained by the devastation that was new moon and twilight."
"kfb-1","10","6","23","15 November 2012"," Can't say enough!!
","OMG!! No spoilers here, just saying I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I screamed, I nearly hyperventilated. Breaking Dawn 2 was awesome!!!Can't say enough!! They definitely saved the best for last. So sad to see the series go, even more than Harry Potter. I don't want to say too much and ruin it for anyone. All I have to say it GO SEE IT!! I wanted to see it again as soon as I left the theater. The only thing I wish was that it was longer. I think being the last one they should have made it at least 2.5hrs instead of just under 2hrs. I wish they could have had more detail with the other vampires and with Charlie (Bella's Dad). Still it was fantastic..a heart stopper. No pun intended."
"brchthethird","6","3","9","13 November 2014"," The best of the series, which isn't saying too much
","This, by far, is the best of the series although it's unfortunate that it waited this long to get ""good"" (using that term loosely). However, it is nice that it went out on a high note. Bill Condon really did a nice job with these last two installments, and it shows in everything from the camera-work to the set design. It really is a pretty film to look at. However, the biggest problem outside of the obvious ones is the pacing, particularly that the slower portions of the film move so slowly. It's like they're teasing the audience to the point where you just want the climactic battle to happen and end it all. Thankfully, that moment comes. And then it's taken back in a flash. Had to be one of most frustrating moments I've ever experienced in a movie, although what preceded it was cool. After that forced happy resolution, the movie moves into sentimental territory, and it least this time it felt a little more genuine. Bella was better as a vampire than she ever was as a human, and there are some really funny moments early on where she gets angry. There weren't as many unintentionally hilarious moments this time around, but it's nice that they were still there. I also liked the soundtrack, which was good as usual. In particular, I like the closing song by Christina Perri. Overall, despite the frustrating imaginary battle, it was the perfect conclusion to this so-so franchise. Everyone lives happily ever after. The End."
"eline-hoskens","8","3","9","11 August 2013"," Actually, the end is surprisingly good!
","If you read my former Twilight reviews, you'll see I rated them 6-3-3-2. I rated this one 8! Yeah, I realise it's surprising!<br/><br/>Actually, I thought there was a lot of good action in this movie. I had no idea what the last part would be about as I didn't read the books (thank God!) and I was getting quite bored with the sick romantic triangle in these series. <br/><br/>BUT, this final part is actually interesting. I think the ending is really original in fact! I'm starting to think this could have been a really good trilogy! Improve the first movie (take another leading actress for one); make one good movie out of New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn Part I and add the final epic conclusion and this would really be a decent fantasy trilogy. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and this proves that you don't have to LOVE OR HATE an entire series. It's very well possible you like some of the movies and dislike others. The most important part is that you're true to yourself and not 'ruminating' other people's opinion. And I honestly have to admit I really enjoyed this movie, despite the really disappointing previous clutter about plucking daisy leaves: ""He loves me. He loves me not. I love him. I love the other too. I don't love him. Oh, crap, I love them both. Whatever, I just love myself.""<br/><br/>It may sound corny but I actually thought it a great and interesting solution to have the great epic battle, loose all the characters you care about (that are obviously not the main character) and then have that twist where everything still ends satisfactory. <br/><br/>So my advice is: Watch the first movie with friends, then ask people what happens in the next three ones and then watch the last part. :-)"
"steel_indigo","10","3","9","4 March 2013"," Family, romance, paranormal and action
","I came here expecting to see people criticize this movie but I couldn't find anything wrong with it personally. It was a nice blending of a love story, paranormal creatures and an awesome ending to the series. It was funny and touching. The baby's name dealt with a blending of Bella's Mother's name and Esmee who is Carlisle's mate. It doesn't matter if others find the name odd or not. It doesn't make the movie bad because of a name someone might find odd. I think they wanted to make the baby have an otherworldly affect and the CGI did just that. She wasn't just a baby.<br/><br/>There were so many things about this movie I loved especially how Edward and Bella explored her new found senses and his reaction to her. I thought it breathtaking when she climbed up the side of a cliff ala Dracula style to go after a human. She stops when Edward arrives and his reaction when he offers to help her caused me to laugh when she ignored him and jumped to the bottom of the cliff. Some of their interactions were priceless. I especially liked the Eastern European vampires that came into be involved in what they thought would be a big brawl and was and wasn't. They had a very big grudge against the Volturi. Another part that made me laugh was when Jacob was characterizing them by Dracula 1 and Dracula 2. They were a little over the top but I believe they were meant to be. Alice was always a focal point of all the movies because of her gift. Many of the gifts of the various vampire clans were shown and were very creative and sometimes quite amusing. There is no real ending in this movie, only of this particular struggle over Renesmee. It was the ending, for the time being of a major struggle with an out of control group, the Volturi, that held fear over the head of every vampire clan. Michael Sheen's character was played almost to the point of a psychotic. He was very creepy and very effective in his portrayal of Aro.<br/><br/>If you want the old fashioned Dracula type of movie this will not be your cup of tea. It is modern and innovative and gives some ""humanity"" to the vampires in the story. As a writer, I appreciate the fact that the author took a risk. These movies made a lot of money at the box office so those who hated these movies and even this one in particular, which I think is the best of them all, are in a minority. Categorizing this movie as the worst movie every made or even a bad movie is moronic and ludicrous in my opinion. With the fan base of this movie, this is why the author has a different ending for the movie than in the book, how different I don't know. Just like Harry Potter it would have disappointed avid fans to do anything else. It satisfies those who want high action and those who are enthralled by the love story and personal interactions of the vampires and shape shifters."
"jose_andres200853","10","3","9","17 January 2013"," Unbelievably, the series closes with an intensely climatic, conclusive 40 minutes that made me run out of my breath for a couple of minutes.
","Does the Twilight Saga have a seriously, painfully annoying conclusion? Believe it or not, it's actually pretty decent! So The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn- Part 2 starts off where the almost- to-be-awful Part 1 ended: Bella wakes up her inner vampire, is trained, she meets Renesmee and is able to touch her for the first time, beating the crap out of Jacob, due to past events that happened in Part 1 (imprint), Edward teaches Renesmee to play the piano, the Volturi beat the hell out of a Japanese vampire and Irina allegates they did some crime for bringing in an immortal child. I have to admit, Condon starts the conclusion to the Twilight mania kind of slow but builds up to a great momentum, presenting really interesting characters like Tanya, Garrett, Kebi and now, Nahuel. So what made me say like my second WOW! in the entire franchise (first being the bloody birth scene in Part 1) was the last battle. Really, almost everybody died and I was like ""What in the freaking world am I watching?!"" because it was so sadistic and epic, I was forced to look into the ticket to see if I was watching an actual TWILIGHT movie....but apparently, that extraordinarily intense moment was all a vision, which relieved me a lot (Watching Carlisle get his head ripped off, Jasper have his head chopped off and Seth and Leah die is not easy to overcome). IN SHORT WORDS, BREAKING DAWN- PART 2 sends off what TWILIGHT would've been since the beginning: bad-ass vampires chopping off heads and fighting for their lives, wolves allying in epic proportions, earth cracks breaking and shattering with the profundity to the Earth's core sending vamps to hell, quality romantic scenes and fire everywhere, all forced into a single, chaotic battle scene."
"kdnor2011","6","3","9","29 November 2012"," It's at least the most entertaining in the series.
","Well, it's finally over, or at least it's supposed to be over since I hear they're thinking about spin offs. The last Twilight, and just as a refresher, here's what I thought of the other four. Twilight: Didn't like it. New Moon: Not really good, but had enough moments to be watchable. Eclipse: I would say was OK. Breaking Dawn Part 1: Didn't like it. And now we have hit the final film, and it's certainly the most entertaining in the series, at least for half of it maybe.<br/><br/>Because when this movie slows down, it REALLY slows down. It can get so boring at points that I wanted to just stop watching. Bella's exposition narration was, well, as pointless as it was in ""The Last Airbender."" But that film at least was cut down and tried to fit a season of a TV show into one movie. This is fitting one half a book into a movie that's the end of a franchise, I don't think anyone will find it weird if it's longer. The actress who played Renesmee wasn't very good, I'm sure she tried her hardest, but would it kill her to have any other expression other than just blank staring. And I thought the main villain was supposed to be Dakota Fanning, but she doesn't do anything, literally, I don't even remember her talking.<br/><br/>Now for the positives: Bella actually does stuff other than mope and complain. She did start to get better in the last movie, but now she's actually fighting and doing stuff. And it's a good thing too, if Bella turned into a Vampire than didn't do anything, I would have been so angry. The movie seems to have a sense of humor in the beginning that pokes fun at the series, allowing for some actual entertainment. The villains are actually a threat, the leader being so over the top at times that I found myself laughing. And the final battle was actually really fun. It's just vampires and werewolves beating the crap out of each other, and it was actually quite entertaining. Thank God, since the movie was being very slow up to this point.<br/><br/>Now let's talk the twist, I won't spoil it, but it's the only twist ending I've ever seen that both infuriated me, and was also awesome at the same time. So...good job Twilight, you ended your series with you best, or at least most entertaining movie, even if it was still only just OK, so don't mess it up."

I have read all of the books, and of course movies are never better than books, but this is the first Twilight movie that I didn't over analyze how much it compared to the book.<br/><br/>Kirsten Stewart actually showed some emotion in this one, I liked the new vampires coming to join the clan. I was interested in how they were going to show their abilities and talents, and I thought that they did a good job.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was awkward, but that's what you kind of expect if you have see the first 4.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was definitely at the end. The only thing running through my head was ""THIS WASN'T IN THE BOOK!"" It was such a surprise and I ended up loving the end and wished that it was that way in the book.<br/><br/>The very ending of the movie actually made me tear up a little as Edward and Bella share a moment.<br/><br/>So all in all the movie has sex, violence, and drugs if you count blood (Edward did say it was like a drug) And special tender moments."

It's better than Breaking Dawn Part 1. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie was done better than any of the Twilight films. I really almost had my heart stopped at the moment of the ending. I really liked it. It was a fun action-excitement at the end.<br/><br/>What I literally don't like in the New Moon was bringing the franchise into a Saga... This franchise is not a SAGA?! I don't call it a Saga because Saga means it's amusing, appealing, and has a central idea into it. But after seeing Breaking Dawn Part 2 into theaters I really understand why they call it THE TWILIGHT SAGA! That is how fun this movie is!"

Seriously it's very interesting movie for me and for some people at least Twilight still has big fans around the world. The movies were very unique. It's not just an usual love story like others love story movies but they mixed it up with more fictions, fantasy, mystery and horror story that made the movies were just incredible and brilliant. With that fantasy about a beautiful vampire with all their specializes it made some people especially the women *in my case* scream like Oh my God and Wow while watching the movies. Of course I've been trapped in an imagination about how handsome Robert Pattinson Is. That's the additional interesting thing about Twilight. The cast were just awesome especially Rob and Kris they had perfect chemistry in the movies. And I just don't't understand why most of the people hate it.

To skip a lot of things the final battle against the loser cousin of count Dracula in the end it did not (spoilers!!!!!!!) happened ,I mean even the movie of the Ninja Turtules of 2014 although the first third is stupid ,the final battle is cool and close the story in a at least satisfied manner (for real the last 30 minutes are awesome). I remember went I try to watch the first Twillight and after I was close to kill myself , likely I passed the shock with a nice shower and really to see the water on the floor was a more fun experience form these movies all together. Now to the final part is this ""saga"" the worst thing ever, in my point of view the man of the Channel of Awesomeness said it better is the worst thing of the past decade and for the persons over 30 this is the worst product of entertainment of their life ,but do not fear we homo sapiens are quit good at making bad thing ( genocides, economic crashes, these movies, colonization, world wars and 50 shades) every generation will have this one product of out culture which will be bad in every way possible. And if you are someone who like it, dude what in the name of Lucifer is wrong with you! In the end this is the worst box office franchise of the first two decades of the new millennial and its awfulness will live in infamy. Let us all remember it in order to prepare ourselves for the next strike ,went a person decides to capitalize to something which teenagers will fall in love ,but afterwords will find out what silly they were."

","TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN PART II<br/><br/>OK, now I have some issues with these movies. I have seen them all now with my girlfriend, who is a massive fan. She has read all the books and seen all the movies and loves every bit of it. I on the other hand, am not impressed too much.<br/><br/>I did enjoy them, they are very entertaining movies and I can see why they are popular. But I won't be reading the books.<br/><br/>In case you don't know, Twilight is a love story between a mortal girl, a vampire and a guy who changes into a werewolf.<br/><br/>I love vampire movies out of all the mythical creatures, vampires are my favourite by far. But this story killed 2 of the most important things about vampires. 1. Vampires have fangs to help them drink the blood of their victims... not in this movie! They have normal teeth. 2. Vampires can't go in the sunlight because they burn Nope, not here... they glisten and shine in the sunlight. I was not happy about that at all... when I saw the first movie I was really disappointed with those facts because it goes against what vampires are.<br/><br/>Anywho, back to the final chapter in the series... This one was OK in places. The story is good, the action was good, even the acting was alright. There are some really good actors in this film. I don't rate Robert Pattinson much. He is OK, but I don't think he is as good as everyone else seems to think he is. Kristen Stewart did well in this one... I prefer her character the way she is in this movie compared to her previous ones. Then you have Dakota Fanning who has always been an amazing actress, and then Michael Sheen... this guy is awesome and has made some brilliant films in the past.<br/><br/>But, the effects in the film were terrible, Bellas baby was clearly a computer generated baby, you could see how unrealistic it was. Also, when the vampires were running in the forest and jumping around, you could see they were on wires... you could not see the wires, but it all looked a bit too much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br/><br/>But, finally the ending was painful! I felt like I had been robbed. I hated the ending to this movie. I watched it in the cinema and when the ending happened there were a lot of groans in the cinema. I don't think there were many people happy with what happened but my girlfriend loved it. Maybe it's a girl thing. J<br/><br/>Anyway, I will give Breaking Dawn Part 2 a 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>The whole series was entertaining, but it definitely had its weak moments and the less said about the end the better!<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","So, I'll keep this review short and sweet--you probably don't have time to be reading through paragraph upon paragraph. <br/><br/>So, I'm a guy, and was dragged to this movie by several female friends. I saw the first book IV movie, too, and didn't really like it. However, I actually quite enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>The first half of Breaking Dawn Part 2 was pretty bad--that is, very laughable acting, laughable special effects, and laughable plot. But, it was SO BAD, that it was actually really, really funny. Kristen Stewart--God bless her--is not exactly what I'd call a ""talent...."" The second half of this movie was much better, and quite entertaining. After an excruciating first half, the second half really took off and ended with a bang. It seems as though they poured all their money into the final scenes, and skimped on the beginning scenes--this is ""Big Budget,"" and let me tell you, some of those scenes at the beginning look like they were shot with an iPhone camera. Again, the end made up for it.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books, so I really didn't know the names of most of the minor characters, but this really didn't detract from the movie experience. <br/><br/>Bottom line: You won't be too bored if your girlfriend/wife drags you to this movie. On the whole, I was entertained."
"buggiexd","10","4","15","22 November 2012"," Just Saying...
","You know it's really unfair because the movie's really good and I'm not just saying that because I'm a 'Twihard'. This is actually the best one out of the whole saga. Yet people would still waste their time trashing the movie, I mean if you despise the whole 'Twilight' thing, why even bother watching it and even put an effort to review it. Like why spend time on things you don't like? Just admit it, this whole franchise totally left a mark on everyone's heart. TWILIGHT SAGA IS A CLASSIC. Bella and Edward's Lovestory equals to Romeo + Juliet, Catherine + Heathcliff, Mr Darcy + Elizabeth Bennett and so on. So yeah. I wouldn't go on convincing people to watch this movie, it's already #1 in the box office anyway! Haters to the left!"
"a-mcmillan2008","8","4","15","17 November 2012"," my thoughts of the movies and actors(a note to rob)
","it was good.but i felt like their past relationship made the movies more passionate.with them out of their relationship well,he doesn't seem to love her as much as he did before in his demeanor.its OK rob you will find someone worthy of your love.but you have to stop,picking up naked chicks lol and get someone closer to your age.my husband said he was excited during the fight scenes,until it stopped lol. so i guess this movie has something for men and women in it.so i hope i didn't spoil it for anyone.i gave this movie 8 stars because of their break up.the tension could be felt through the screen.but all in all i would go see it again,when theirs not so many people at the theater.there was a lot of people."
"diana-gomeshp","8","3","10","3 December 2012"," Its ends with a Bang n will live forever!!
","Watched Breaking dawn part 2 last night.It was absolutely amazing.I had so much expectations with this part.I was highly disappointed with the previous part Breaking dawn 1,but this one exceeded my expectations.It was good to see Bella in action as a Vampire as in most of the part she was just the spectator in battles while others fought for her.This time she fought for her daughter Renesme who is equally interesting...as a half blood :D...High points-Bella's first hunt,arm wrestle with Emmette,recruiting the other covens,family scenes,Ed-Bella as parents,Jacob as Nessie's protector,the atrocious Volturi and their powers n the final climax is so unexpected u will just be spell bounded by it...Many people are of the view that the movie should have strictly followed the book.Honestly the climax wouldn't have been so exciting n amazing if they did so.For a series like this addition twists and turns are plausible.The entire cast did full justice to their respective roles and couldn't have been better.A superb ending to the Twilight phenomenon!!!!Its not a glorified review of a twihard,its an honest experience of a fantasy lover.Will Miss you..Forever..."
"mm-39","7","3","10","1 December 2012"," My wife likes the movie!
","Same story, but my wife likes the movie! Breaking Dawn has the same storyline and themes. Movie watchers experience the same sub stories of: the Cullens vs the evil vampires, alliances, the half human daughter, and what it is like to be a vampire! The themes of good vs evil, and the rules on how to be a good vampire continues. I found the movie redundant, but the final twenty five minutes has a plot twist. The plot twist saves the movie. B D part 2 has some good C G I and a few surprises I did not see coming. My wife said this and that was not in the book! Maybe part of the book did not translate well to film and the crew at B D 2 had to revamp the story. first part of B D 2 I give a 3 or 4 and the second half a 7. My wife would give B D 2 a 10. In the end, I guess B D 2 should be a 7 out of 10. On a side not I find all the Vampires look like they should be in a 1980's new wave music video."
"TheMrCoolCat2010","9","3","10","24 November 2012"," My Review on the Final Twilight Saga Film
","I will admit. I wasn't too sure about going to see the end of a much- loved series. I hate endings, and have in fact broken down at the end of this series and also Harry Potter. Today I reached my decision; everything has to end at some point. Collecting my courage, I walked bravely into the cinema armed with Kleenex and Nacho's.<br/><br/>After waiting through, about fifteen minutes of boring adverts I had a realisation. That music, it sounds familiar. Hmm, then it hit me. Twilight's first composer had been brought back. I smiled happily as the music haunted one of my favourite twilight compositions. The music though, had not taking my mind of the fact that the titles were dragging on a bit. This had started my list of errors. The first scene was all in all, pretty good. The zoom-ins that occurred during first half-an-hour was brilliant. Hunting was a bit tame to me. I understand the process, as I have read the books. But something was burning in my mind. The runs didn't look at all realistic, mind you it's meant to be supernatural so I probably wouldn't think that it was. After the first few scenes I thought that the relationship between Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart's characters was a bit off.<br/><br/>I continued to mull over my thoughts until a surprise came to me. The battle, after reading the books I was wondering how on earth they were going to make it more interesting, and then in came Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) and Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone). After witnessing a scene that never happened I was panicking like mad. So when I realised that my favourite characters weren't in any danger, I sighed in ease. After seeing such a dramatic scene, I was pleased to have a slightly nicer ending. Joy was filled through me as I saw Alice's Vision of The future. But I was in for one more shock, the final meadow scene. As Edward and Bella sat in the meadow for the last time, my heart was thumping. Then, music started. It was so beautiful; I was enchanted by the music. My tears only increased as I watched the flashbacks. I found myself looking at a screen with a book being flipped through until it reached the last sentence for the book series. With forever being highlighted, signifying the end to this magnificent series<br/><br/>After living through much of the series History, I have come to the conclusion that this film has lived up to its caption. ""The Epic Finale That Will Love Forever"" I used to thoroughly hate this series, but after watching the film, this has changed. Although, it has not lived up to my love of Harry Potter, it is till up there. I will miss this series, and will fondly look back at the message of love, just before I close my eyes, and take my last breath."
"efc_528491","6","3","10","22 November 2012"," I am surprised
","This was the first movie I really liked in this series since the first one. The 2nd one i didn't like at all, the 3rd one was eh, and the fourth part 1 was okay. Breaking Dawn Part 2 was an improvement from the 2nd,3rd,and 4th Part1 films. The first 30 minutes of BD 2 had some cheesy moments but they sharpened it up for the middle and end portion. I loved the pacing in this film and I like that they got scores from all previous movies as well as the most current ones to kind of go full circle. I think Melissa Rosenberg (sciptwriter) wasn't a good choice for this movie series because some of her writing is cheesy, but she made an improvement as well when all the cheesy moments were only in the beginning portion. I'm disappointed that the movies got better at the last one and that should have started at Eclipse."
"bubbyyay","9","4","16","16 November 2012"," Very Entertaining
","I thought this film would be the best of the lot; my expectations were correct. The film's well maintained pace and the quality of acting by every actor, particularly MacKenzie Foy(Renesmee Cullen), Kristen Stewart(Bella Cullen) and Taylor Lautner(Jacob Black), was incredible. My vote is 9/10, reason as to why not 10/10? The ending disappointed me as(sorry about to be a spoiler) the entire war, and how they had advertised it in the movie's campaigns, posters, trailers etc. was all a vision from Alice Cullen to Aro(Volturi leader). This was not how I would have liked it to end, the war vision was amazing though but could have been left as it was, not a vision. Very Entertaining though. A strong 9/10."
"jaxbubba","7","3","11","22 November 2012"," Pleasantly Surprising!!
","After enduring the 117 agonizing minutes of ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn – Part 1"", I can honestly tell you that seeing ""Breaking Dawn – Part 2"" was the furthest thing from my mind. My only reward for going to see this film, was knowing that this film (good, bad, or indifferent) was the absolute last of the series. It was this, and only this little piece of knowledge, that gave me the determination, strength, and fortitude, to muster the will power to sit through the closing chapter of this highly profitable franchise. With all that said, I have to admit that this film was actually not that bad, and in fact quite entertaining to boot.<br/><br/>The film commences right from the end of ""Breaking Dawn –Part 1"" with the birth of Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella's (Kristen Stewart) baby girl, Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). I have to say up front, that the camera just loves actress Mackenzie Foy, she is so beautiful on screen. I definitely see a bright future in this up and coming ""rising star""!!!! But perhaps, the biggest surprise in this film has to be the role of Jacob (played by Taylor Lautner). In the pass three film, all we ever got to see from him was pouty, poor-little-ol'-me, Bella loves a vampire, Jacob dude, grow a pair already however, in this film we get to see Jacob the protector, Jacob the brave, Jacob the guardian. It seems Jacob was drawn to Bella's unborn fetus, and upon birth he imprinted on Renesmee. This bond is unbreakable, and with it comes his undying dedication for Renesmee's survival. It's a side of Jacob that we the audience has not seen; one that I much enjoyed throughout this film.<br/><br/>This final chapter of the Twilight series centers around Renemee, and her possible threat to the Volturi (the largest and most powerful coven of vampires, who also enforce the laws of the vampire world). The Volturi believe the Cullens have broken Vampire Law with the birth of Renemee. In order to save their coven and Renemee, the Cullens must comb the four corners of the globe for vampire brethren who will champion their cause, and bear witness that Renemee is no threat to the vampire community. An interesting collection of vampire support is assembled, each possessing a special skill / power to accompany their vampirism. All this leads up to the film's climax, the ultimate battle of good vs evil or evil vs worse evil or  nevermind, you get the point.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning of this review, this was actually entertaining this go around. Gone was all the love triangle bull malarkey, an actual plot was developed, action scenes with were really entertaining, and a film which finally took the focus off pasty-faced Edward, sulky Jacob, and just plain miserably sad Bella. So I definitely recommend seeing this film. If you are already a fan, then this film will not disappoint; however, if you are like me and could care less whether Jacob or Edward finally nailed Bella then I say take a chance on this film, you may be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""
"yash3487","6","2","6","25 July 2013"," Relatively tolerable as compared to all previous installments.
","Well, I have just finished watching the entire saga in a row, and I come to a conclusion that, first and last installments are comparatively tolerable among all. Though this series had a good box office collection throughout (much owe to the Twihards, hype, on/off-screen chemistry of Kstew N Pattison, and publicity), it wasn't critically acclaimed and overall it wasn't a good experience watching it.<br/><br/>This series could have been a lot better and romantic than how it is presented. The acting had been awful by entire cast, especially Kstew and Robert Pattison...you suck a big time. I have not gone through the novels, but by this time I will not dare it. There are numerous outstanding romance-genre films in Hollywood, from which the saga-director could have learned something, but they didn't. Overall this particular saga series is totally disappointing. I will give 4/10 to entire saga."
"oliviah2000","10","2","6","13 July 2013"," Loved It!!
","Honestly I am starting to believe that no one actually likes Twilight. Where are all the Twihards and the fan girls that I hear of. Every site I see (concerning Twilight) most people say they hated it! Rarely I see anyone who says whoo loved it.<br/><br/>Okay yes I loved the movie. It had drama, passion (not from Stewart) and violence! Patterson was as sexy as ever and the rest of the gang were as normal really good. But then comes Stewart who whatever is happening will always have the one facial expression. I mean she is supposed to love Edward for crying out load, but she shows as much emotion as a dead slug (harsh I know). Also the CGI baby ummm big NO NO! It creeped me out and the way it moved looked kinda like E.T. Even when they brought the real actress on she looked photoshopped and unnatural. Apart from that it was great, loved it. Kate and Garrets flirting was quite cute and their passion for their sister was very fiery and realistic. Jane's eye-makeup was a little over the top though. This movie is great and would definitely see it again!"
"rmoore125","3","2","6","4 March 2013"," Not so bad as people think
","**Possible spoiler for those who haven't seen the movie or read the book!!*I have followed the Twilight series from start to finish, including the books. The movies followed the books more closely as they went along, so this was an improvement. People keep commenting on how the filmmakers ruined the end by not being bold and sticking with the plot twist. Anyone who has read the book series knows this did not happen in the book. It was a great imagining of what would have happened had they continued on their current course of action. Even Stephanie Meyer explained if she had taken the end to a major battle, there would have been losses on both sides. I thought the filmmakers did a great job incorporating this into the movie in such a clever way, that my daughter, her friend and I were astonished by what was unfolding before our eyes. This series was not for everybody, but I thought the end was fitting. I was disappointed in the CGI depictions of the baby and early close ups of Renesmee. It looked rather odd and took away from the movie a bit. I was happier when the actress was shown as she actually looked. Then they did it again with the actress as a grown up. I have seen some amazing CGI over the years, but this was a little strange and did not appear as believable. I cannot imagine how difficult a task this special effect would be, but I was disappointed. That all said, I am feeling bittersweet about the end of the franchise, as this kept my daughter and I close over the last several years. We are already on to other movies and books, so we will continue to have many things in common, but this was a great common bond for as long as it lasted. I think most people who have enjoyed the series so far will find this to be a fitting conclusion!"
"priyanka13511","8","2","6","7 December 2012"," Love-What extent can you go to get it?
","Forever took a total different connotation when human Bella married a 104 yrs old vampire Edward. What made this movie a wonderful experience for me was the values it imbibed. Forget the supernatural part, here is a movie about friendship, about family, about refusing to let go your loved ones at the time of peril, stand up against the orthodox. ""When you are immortal who do you live for""- when you have power and can have the world at your feet do you stand up for people who first took you in when you were vulnerable? As a core romanticist, my affair with the novel reached its salvation with this movie. Stephanie Meyer's vampires are not the usual larger than life and power hungry loners.And the characters do justice to their roles. They are not over-the-board with their skills but are much livelier compared to the other parts. Though I hated the baby. Was it a real baby? I don't know. But they could have skipped the visual effects their and used a real one. Frankly, Kristen Stewart looked better in this movie. As if immortality really ""became"" her. Her acting was more vibrant compared to the previous ones where she barely opened her eyes! Pattinson and Lautner looked as if they were asked to act on a gun point. Both equally morose and boring. The real treat was Michael Sheen as Aro, who can read all the thoughts and memories a person has ever had with a single touch. The book reads him as a curious vampire with a child like forbearance towards possibilities. In the movie, Sheen corroborates the theory with a single chuckle and blurts out"" the strange heart!"" about Reneesmee's half immortal incredibly fast beating heart. He is unscrupulous and deliciously evil in his make-up and a treat to watch."
"Stampsfightclub","Null","2","6","3 December 2012"," Breaking the trend
","And here it is. The finale. The climax. The end.<br/><br/>For those of you who did not manage to stay awake till the end of the first bore fest that was Breaking Dawn I, Bella and Edward get married, and consummate their marriage, Bella almost dying (Edward still getting cheered by teenage girls shouting ""Hero"") and so Bella fell pregnant and Edward had to turn her into a vampire to keep her alive to make more money for this film.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn II sees Bella try to adjust to her life as a vampire with her new powers and her new responsibility being a mother.<br/><br/>Based on Stephanie Meyer's popular series, Breaking Dawn sees Bella and Edward try to recruit vampires from around the world to assist in their defence against the Volturi. The reasoning behind the concern comes about stupidly and there are a lot of terms and conditions which are discussed at length, which seem to replicate the novel in many ways.<br/><br/>Many reviewers and critics have said this is your conventional Twilight film, with a paper thin plot and faceless acting. Whilst this is true, this is still an entertaining film.<br/><br/>As with previous releases the great quality of these films is its ability to bring in new faces. Anna Kendrick blossomed whilst Ashley Greene and Nikki Reed have grown in praise.<br/><br/>Focus inevitably surrounds Pattinson and Stewart. Edward has evolved through the films becoming stronger and overcoming his emotionally over exaggerated issues and he even smiles a few times in this film. Stewart's Bella finally comfortable in her own skin is given new challenges as she adjusts to life as a vampire. Her character development is interesting to see as she tackles learning her powers and becoming emotionally hardened by her new life.<br/><br/>Jacob Black was very present in the novel as we gained an insight into his change of heart towards the vampire clan and his imprinting. Here however there isn't much character involvement as would have been desired (don't worry girls there is still the always present removal of clothes) but the special effects for the wolves are the best since they were introduced.<br/><br/>The effects for this film are, interesting. The sequence in the snow is amazing in terms of scenery and the bluntness of the fights isn't always skewered to accommodate the 12A rating, meaning there's blood and broken bones to enjoy. But in one of the most ridiculous things in all of human history, I have never seen someone's power be to project blurry lines out of their body to protect someone they love. And since when do vampires have powers anyway? I can read your mind, I can see the future, I can run at a million miles an hour through a forest and coincidentally always miss the trees even though I'm looking sideways.<br/><br/>But that's the thing about this film, it is ridiculous. But for the first time since Twilight and arguably Eclipse, this is more entertaining. There is some good action, not too much dramatic romantic implication scenarios, some great one liners from Billy Burke and a sense of anticipation, even though it's slight, that the film is going somewhere.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn II then is a ridiculous piece of cinema that is quite different from the novel but by being more outlandish with its ideas, at least will entertain you right until its ending."
"jguillarte","9","4","17","16 November 2012"," Overall Amazing and Unforgettable. Best movie in the series!
","Being a huge twi-hard fan from the start, I just HAD to see Breaking Dawn Part 2. Although the first two movies disappointed me, Breaking Dawn Part 2 made everything better. Words cannot explain the expression on my face once the ending credits were finished. In my honest opinion, Breaking Dawn Part 2 has been the best installment in the whole series and is definitely worth watching again. Filled with suspense and drama, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat and gripping my friend next to me. The ending was definitely a shocker. Sure, there were a few disappointments like the fake-ness of Renesmee's baby face and face as she grew older and the corny, cliché beach scene at the very end, but this is still one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It left me absolutely breathless. Each scene made me inch closer to the screen wanting more. Some scenes even made me tear up and take in a loud gasp! Overall, I am completely satisfied with this movie and I'm sad to see it is over."

","Watched this again when I stumbled across it on my TV and couldn't turn it off. The Twilight saga is just such a guilty pleasure for me. Whatever don't judge.<br/><br/>This last part of the ""saga"" picks up exactly where Breaking Dawn part 1 left us, with the newly turned Bella opening her red eyes after the birth of Renesmee. We then see her training her new abilities, conquering her thirst and realizing her CGI baby is growing at an alarming rate. Oh and thens there's Jacob who has ""bonded"" with the child, the whole ""imprinting issue is handled about as well and non creepily as possible with flashes of the future couple.<br/><br/>We then see the Cullen's gathering vampire clans from around the globe in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts her and the entire the family in front of the Volturi under a sentence of death for creating a vampire child, they must prove she was born not made.<br/><br/>If I'm honest this last half of the Breaking Dawn book is much of an anticlimax and I'd wondered how they were going to liven things up for the movie version. All I can say there is I Loved ""the twist"" well done, very exciting, sorry about your head Carlise! much better than what Stephanie Meyer wrote.<br/><br/>The closing credits are excellent, a real tribute to the fans showing the cast from all 5 movies along with passages from the book.

"nogodnomasters","8","1","2","20 March 2018"," I have to report a crime
","The ultimate chick flick series has come to an end. The moody Bella, smells good to both vampires and werewolves. She gets to live forever with the man she loves, hunt puma in a slit dress, and have a special child that she only has to raise for seven years. The child is both Edward's and Jacob's (My cat has litters that way.) and maybe the producer's kid too. Bella has her ultimate chick moment when she arm wrestles a guy and wins, then uses her special power and becomes a real head turner.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was when the Cullens sat Kristen Stewart down and gave her acting lessons. Yes I was howling at that point, yelling ""facial expressions!"" at the screen. What we found out is that Italian vampires are the bad guys. Eastern European vampires still have bad accents and Irish vampires eat British tourist. I didn't recognize Dakota Fanning (Jane) in this until after the credit roll. I need to get out more.<br/><br/>Similar to the Harry Potter series, people who don't read the books sense there are plot points missing or glossed over. I know I did. I had to have my niece once again rescue me with the details. Let me say again, this is a chick flick with a fight scene thrown in at the end for the guys. Not as emotional or ""gushy"" as first and fourth films. Better than the second film, but then what wasn't.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. One vampire sex scene."

","What can I say that hasn't been said already? A plot synopsis or any background information is practically redundant because I imagine that if you're reading this (not very good) review, you already know the setup.<br/><br/>'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part Two '(that title's not clumsy at all) is my first Twilight-related experience since the Chris Weitz- directed 'New Moon', I must say however, I'm not one of these people who passionately despises the series, nor am I someone who lives for it, i.e. a 'twi-hard'; honestly, I'm somewhat passive about the series. I kind of enjoyed the first two installments, finding the shoddy visual effects, cheesy dialogue, often flat performances and ludicrousness to be consistently entertaining.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that (in a manner somewhat similar to the Harry Potter films) the cast have eased into their roles and appear more comfortable in them than ever before. At the same time though, the trademarks of the series are still present - the lingering and forlorn frowns, the lip- biting and Taylor Lautner's way of saying ""Bella"" when he gets 'emotional'. Also worth a mention is Michael Sheen's performance as Aro; exactly what the franchise needs, he's ridiculously camp and OTT, which is displayed delightfully in a moment of maniacal laughter that wouldn't have been out of place in an episode of Adam West's Batman. It was similarly nice to see Lee Pace, a personal favourite of mine, get some screen time.<br/><br/>Out of all the Twilight films I've seen thus far, I found this to be the most solidly enjoyable, offering a number of scenes where it embraced its inherent absurdity. These included (but was not limited to) Bella wrestling a mountain lion, the creepy relationship between Jacob and borderline MacGuffin child Renesmee, and Bella beating the crap out of Jacob. There were also moments where I wondered if it was consciously laughing at itself - Jacob's ""should I start calling you Dad?"" remark to Edward and dad Charlie's confusion at his granddaughter's name. Interestingly though, the CGI incarnation of baby Renesmee resembled some sort of demon-child that you'd find in a 70s horror film. A final act showdown showcases the best action and effects displayed throughout the series, unfortunately and frustratingly, it is robbed of its entertainment factor following a cheap twist. In the end, all it really amounts to is ""creepy soapy claptrap"", as Danny Leigh remarked, but let's not forget that there is indeed a place for ""creepy soapy claptrap""."

","i love the movie i went and saw it at midnight it was great. the perfect way to finish off the series.the way that you get to see Bella FINAL be a vampire it feels like it has been year of this push and pull going on between Bella and Edward. OH!! wait it has. to get to see the real vampire world to see how they work what they do. it was kind of cool to get to see other vampires besides the Cullen's. i was kind of sad that Alice my favorite vampire was not in it as much as i would have liked but that was like the book. their was a lot of funny scenes like Emmett and Bella arm wrestle,when Bella was trying to act human and a few others. the fight scene at the end at first i was like what is going on when Aro pulled off Carlisle head then everyone starts dieing. then i put together that it was one of Alice's visions. it was great but it was still very sad cause now it is over."

","Bella (Kristen Stewart) is now a full-fledged Vampire with baby. Someone sees Bella's daughter, Renesmme, -that's a real name? - act in such a manner that the person believes the child was turned. Aro (Michael Sheen) the head Vampire of the Volturri (Vampire royalty) is so informed. Turning a child is against Vampire Law and the penalty, if the charge is true, is death for both mother and daughter. <br/><br/>Well, here we are. At the end. Thankfully. About time. Hopefully. Please let this be the end of it. I can't do it anymore. Please<br/><br/>Let's recap: The first one was good. We saw Edward (Robert Pattinson), the Vampire, woo Bella and Bella wanted him to turn her. Edward wouldn't do it. Then, Breaking Dawn Part I: was really about nothing but getting all of us into the theaters again, but Bella got her wish and was turned.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Pt II. Bella likes being a Vampire and does all the acrobatics that she saw Edward do in earlier parts. She is loving life. Ooops, can I say that?<br/><br/>Most of the movie is Bella and Edward convincing their Vampire friends that Renesmme (Mackenzie Foy) was not bitten, hence not turned. Will the Volturri believe this? Will war break out? Inquiring minds, you see.<br/><br/>Let's get to it: here is my problem with this movie. Seemed like ALL - with one exception: Aro - acting performances were of the wooden ilk. All behaved like they were in a trance. The dialogues appeared to be dubbed in. Watch their mouths closely and you will see there is a space between the spoken word and movement of lips. I couldn't help but noticing this as it was blatantly obvious. And, lastly, I kind of got the impression that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) will wait for Renesmee – really, a real name? – to become an adult. See where this is going? <br/><br/>I thought Vampire reflections could not be seen in a mirror, but we see Bella and Edward's looking at their reflections in a mirror. (What are you doing? You know there are no such things as Vampires)<br/><br/>Michael Sheen's character Aro was THE breath of fresh air in here and we wished he had a bigger part. The CGI was okay. Let's face it, this movie definitely needed CGI. <br/><br/>In case you missed past Twilight movies, we are given a short recap of them at the end. This kind of takes your attention off this Breaking Dawn Pt II, which is truly lame. <br/><br/>Anyway, take a breath, it's all over.it is, isn't it? I don't think I can do it again. (3/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Not really, chalk it up to a make-out session. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","This movie was at the top of my list! When I was watching the movie I couldn't wait to see what fun and exciting things they were going to be doing! I was also very paranoid because I wanted to get to the ending to see what exactly happens once the Volturi arrive! And now when I think about It I am glad that I waited to watch the full movie and relieved when everything had gone as planned! I was really scared when I saw Carlisle's death, Japser's, and even young Seth Clearwater. I love the scene where Benjamin is looking around, first at Edward, then Garrett, and lastly at newborn Bella who is fighting about 5 or less vampires, and Benjamin in shock creates a black hole to save her from them!"
"k-christine72","7","2","8","23 January 2013"," An epic finish to the Twilight franchise
","After the birth of Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy)in Breaking Dawn Part 1, Bella (Kristen Stewart) wakes up to find herself in the world of the Cullens as a newborn vampire. But all the happiness turns into danger when the Volturi led by Aro (Michael Sheen) discover that the Cullens have created an immortal child. So the Volturi proclaim them guilty and they declare war on the Cullens. But the Cullens take matter into their own hands by gathering their army of vampire witnesses in an effort to defeat them .<br/><br/>Now overall the film was great. The acting was effective, the special effects were a bit obnoxious. But the only things that got to me were Dakota Fanning as Volturi member Jane and the final battle sequence at the end. I loved the effects with how the Volturi and the Cullens collided within the mountain battlefield.<br/><br/>The film is a good time with good acting, an epic fight sequence, new faces including well-known from previous Twilight films and a good story that wraps up the four-book series by Stephenie Meyer that took five films and a great story that combines action and romance with the werewolf and the vampire"

","Does anyone else have a problem with this situation? Regardless of whether I wanted Bella to choose Edward or Jacob, the fact that she and Jacob do have feelings for each other and do share a kiss is obvious. So, the fact that he then imprints on her daughter seems so wrong to me. Her daughter!! I don't understand how Meyer thought we would all be OK with this. And even though Jacob imprints on Renesmee, we have no evidence that Bella's feelings for Jacob are completely gone. And can you imagine having to explain to your daughter that you were in love with her future husband and that you know what it feels like to kiss him?"
"stormieb","7","2","8","23 November 2012"," Movie OK - but not exceptional
","CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! For the most part, since I have read the books and seen all the movies, I understood what was being placed on the screen, but this movies flow is quite disjointed. It seemed as if the primary concern of the editors was to keep the two parts of Breaking Dawn under 2 hrs, so they cut back very considerably on developing a story and the tons of additional characters that had about 30sec of screen time, and seemed to be in a mad rush for the finish line. I found it to be entertaining, but as a ""purist"" I had one really big issue with this movie when placed in context of all the other films. Alice is not supposed to be able to see werewolves in her visions to the point that their presence acts like a radar jammer even when she is not trying to see THEM. In this movie they threw that ""fact"" completely out the window. The result was fun to watch but created what I consider a very large logical disconnect with the overall storyline of the series."
"t-filipkova","7","2","8","23 November 2012"," It really surprised me.
","First of all, I'm not a Twilight fan, and I'm not a Twilight hater. I'm just someone, who really likes movies, and enjoys the fantasy.<br/><br/>This movie is not perfect, and it's not even original by its story, but I have to tell you - it is damn good shot, it has nice visuals, beautiful music, quite amazing screenplay's ideas, great actors in the minor roles and some surprise moments. <br/><br/>Also, it is not so flat as the other Twilight movies, it's not even unintentionally funny, it has some kind of great action and amazing performance of some actors (espesially demonic, mad Michael Sheen as Aro, likable, sweet Lee Pace as Garett, evil Dakota Fanning as Jane, nice Raimi Malek as Benjamin and lovely Mackenzie Foy as young Renesmee). <br/><br/>Now, let's talk about major trio of actors. At first, Kristen Stewart did a great job, while she is not human anymore, but fast, strong, self-confident vampire. She does not stutter, gasp etc. (I hated her Bella because of it), she looks really sexy and is very likable in the role of a mother. Robert Pattinson's Edward is like usual, but the role of a protective dad really fits him, too. (Especially I remember that moment, when SPOILER Aro snapped Carlisle's head and Edward started to run with mix of total anger and fear in his face. SPOILER) Taylor Lautner and the other werewolves (in their's human appearance) are irritating as usual, act so bad as always. But, all the average acting overshadows Michael Sheen's Aro. Long time ago I didn't see such a villain in the movie. <br/><br/>OK, let's move to the story. It's actually very simple. Movie starts with Bella as a newborn vampire, seeing Edward. They go to hunt, Bella overcome her thirst for a human blood and drinks from a puma instead. Then she meets Jacob, all the family and finally her daughter, Renesmee. After that she is experiencing her new vampire life, have sex with Edward (I would say that this sexual scene is more bold than in the BD part 1), meets her dad Charlie, beats Emett in arm-wrestling, worries about Renesmee's fast growth, enjoys nice family moments. But, her happiness is not everlasting, when vampire Irina sees her and Renesmee, thinks that Renesmee is immortal child (small child turned into a vampire, needs to be destroyed by Volruti because of lack of self-control) and goes to tell about it to Volturi. After that the more interesting part of film begins. Cullen's try to gather vampire friends all over the world to witness, that Renesmee is not dangerous, we meet lots of new vampires, as they are preparing to fight, because it is more than clear, that Aro wants more, than a justice. So the ""good vampires"" and ""bad vampires"" meets on the ice field, ready to fight... And I have to tell you, that the final battle is really intense and it's nice to see that kind of action in Twilight movie. <br/><br/>This part of Twilight saga is less romantic than the others. We have there some romantic scene with major couple, but the story is more oriented on the other things. Finally, it really says something about love, friendship, family and loyalty. Also, it has humor and fun, as intense fighting scenes and action, too.<br/><br/>Music is another big positive, as is the costumes and BEAUTIFUL nature, in which is movie shot. And, I really mean it, the titles at the beginning of the movie are MAGNIFICENT and literally perfect. But, I have to say it - the tricks are in some scenes really poor, for example small Renesmee. The baby looks really creepy. I would also be more happy with longer fight scenes, but I'm not going to be that bad. It's Twilight. It is fantasy romance, and in this one is pretty nice action and FINALLY story about SOMETHING, with understandable, logical acts of characters. <br/><br/>If you are Twilight fan, you would be pleased. If you are Twilight hater, you would dislike it, as usual. And if you are neutral as I'm, maybe, you would like it and enjoy this journey to the unrealistic vampire fantasy world about romantic love, strength of family, loyalty of friendship and power of old evil. Btw, I say it once again, Michael Sheen was PERFECT."
"champjohnson29","6","2","8","22 November 2012"," It Was Everything It Was Supposed To Be.
","First of all, I must say that this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. I do enjoy good, quality cinema but sometimes you kind of need that Cheese Factor for entertainment purposes. I'm a big lover of Science Fiction and I think the reason why I gave this saga a chance, time and time again, is because I kept believing that each director would adapt in a very interesting way. Unfortunately, I realized after the second movie that this entire series is for teenage girls who are love lorn. It's a market that never fails to do it's job, just ask Justin Bieber, One Direction and Taylor Swift. I stopped going to this movie expecting to see an in depth screenplay, Oscar worthy acting or a complex storyline. I only went for the action. So I overlooked the Emo-atmosphere and the laughable reality of it and just took it for what it was. <br/><br/>The Good - The cinematography in every movie has definitely been on point and this movie is no different. It's a visually amazing movie. I enjoyed Kristen Stewart actually show emotion. You can tell she had fun with this part which was necessary since her character, Bella, is finally happen so to see her smile more than once was great. Michael Sheen as Aro is great, his eyes are very convincing. The locations, production design, and costuming are are very well thought out and put together. There were some funny, enjoyable parts in the script. Most of it was extremely cheesy but I did find myself laughing out loud at certain subtle moments. The ending fight scene had me on the edge of my seat. A little underwhelming but still done very well. <br/><br/>The Bad - The script could have been rewritten a few more times to get rid of a lot of the cheesy dialog and to evolve the story even more. I think most of the actors in this franchise are all very talented but the mistake with each director is that they think Vampires are all mundane, emotionless, straight faced people. Interview With A Vampire is probably the best vampire movie ever made so far, mainly because they all had different personalities. The method in the Twilight Saga for vampires is to let your eyes bulge while showing emotion and to talk without opening your mouth that wide. That's how immortal vampires should talk and act. Wrong completely. It's almost uncomfortable to watch most of the actors because you want to stop acting so uninhibited but they don't. It's like they're all holding themselves back. I know that Reneesme is a different type of child and she had to do things, even as a baby, that would have have been very difficult to do on film so I understand the use of using a CGI baby, but do CGI Mackenzie Foy's face was a little confusing. I wanted their to be a deeper interaction between Edward, Bella and the Reneesme but there wasn't. Just cheesy things like catching snowflakes and the typical ""father plays piano while small child hits two keys scene"". I work with kids so I just wanted them to interact with her on a more personal level. There were also a lot of characters in this movie that were kind of overlooked. There were a lot of conversation that needed to written down and filmed simply because in the conclusion, it turned from a story about Bella to a story about everyone. Each character had something to lose but they were all pretty much overlooked and just used to have lots of bodies in the final scene. The filmmaker should have taken advantage of those opportunities. Instead of stretching thirty minutes of story into two hours.<br/><br/>Overall, I left the theater wanting more. I think the conclusion would leave a lot of Twilight fans and book readers satisfied but it hit every part of the book it needed to but overall the entire movie was rushed. I can't imagine how hard it is to adapt an already popular and book series you can't assume that everyone going to see it already knows the story. You have to approach as if no one has seen any of the movies. I think most of the people who went to see this movie, mainly went for the final battle which was rushed. There should have been at least an extra ten to fifteen minutes. There were about eight characters introduced as witnesses for the Cullens but were never shown fighting at all. All the wolves just showed up and I wanted to see Jacob and Sam talking about the upcoming danger in a Wolf meeting by themselves so they can talk about their stakes. I am also hot and cold about the special ""twist"" at the end. It was a little predictable though because I did think that would happen. The book didn't have a battle but in any more, you know that people are going to have to die but to see Key characters die would have upset a lot of fans so the twist was necessary. <br/><br/>Stephanie Meyer should study more science fiction before she writes another novel. She obviously is a romance novel writer and just uses a science fiction type of twist on her stories to make them stand out. But she still doesn't understand the genre completely. The Twilight Saga has a lot of potential and could have been more than what it was but when you have the creator as a producer, I guess you have to make her happy before you attempt to make a solid movie. This movie was bound to make a lot of money because of the market it targets but I'm sure we will look back on this series ten year from now and say, ""Damn, we missed the mark."""

","I like The Twilight Sage: Breaking Dawn part 2 because I like the actors (Mackenzie Foy is great!) and I like the way the film is made. I've seen this film now over 6 times and I don't get bored of watching it. I got a shock when Carlisle and Jasper died, but when the relief came that it was just one of Alice's vision I was almost crying because I was so happy that they still were alive. At the end the ""Forever? Forever"" part is so emotional. I think it is a great movie and I always watch it when I am sad to make me happy again. I also like it that there are different groups of vampires because I always wanted to see what other vampires looked like. It's also great that there's peace between the Cullen clan and the Quillette werewolves. I am team Bellward forever. I think the book and film are as equal as great.

"willcundallreview","5","2","9","3 April 2015"," Ending to a topsy turvy franchise
","Rating-5/10<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 2 is the final instalment in the five film franchise about vampires and werewolves. Now this one truly is the end of a series that isn't all that good and really not consistent either, going from average at the top to very poor at the bottom. Will this be remembered in years to come, of course, but still badly reviewed, well of course.<br/><br/>There are way too many new characters In this and not only are certain characters not allowed to finish what they started, they also are never explored as the running time dips under 2 hours, but to be fair any longer and even more dullness would set in. The main cast seem to be getting poorer, Pattinson, Stewart and Lautner all do not improve with only Lautner managing to not be worse than before. The new cast are also not that great and with the addition of Michael SheenÂ… well still he doesn't show up to the show.<br/><br/>It really isn't directed all that well, it gets better toward the end of the movie but starts off horrible and really drags the lifeless plot from Breaking Dawn-Part 1 in. Now Bill Condon the director may not be all at fault here, it may just be the source material and could be the reason it feels awkward and sometimes as if there actually isn't a director involved. Overall Condon does it poorly anyway, he just couldn't change the series enough.<br/><br/>The script is also a poor thing, but yet again it seems to improve upon the ending of the film, but still poor and really needed a lot of changes from the book, Mellissa Rosenberg does not adapt well at all. Also I will add that yet again the book may be the fault of the script completely, it feels like the words are straight from the page, and having someone else imagine the scenes just makes it awkward for all.<br/><br/>This film had too much usage of special effects and when characters literally are just an effect, you know it is out of hand. All credit to the effects at the end as for the third time the ending saves any shatter of respect this movie can try to cling to. I think although the budget does get well used on the effects, it just feels too much and in some scenes with large landscapes or vampires using special powers, it just look ridiculous.<br/><br/>I felt with part 2 the romance that really is one of the driving forces behind the movies has gone and very little is actually displayed that brings warmth. I think it just feels again there is that word, awkward, and it never gets to the point where people can envy Edward and Bella's relationship. On that note a lot of the warmth is missing here, the niceness of the panorama and settings are not fully explored and you also don't truly get to say bye to characters in it from film one.<br/><br/>Overall I felt it was maybe safely below average but really not too far from going down to poor, with the ending as I have mentioned just letting it slide into 5. The movie won't convert ardent haters of Twilight and certainly won't entertain those less in tuned to it, but for the many many fans it should please and cap off a film series that although vastly flawed, can still be enjoyed."

"Marduke_036","2","1","3","14 December 2019"," Simple, so much potential wasted.
","I dont mind this type of idea of vampires, werewolf or wolf, but the movies in general is potentially wasted on bad story line and some acting because the scripts is horrible, even the decisions that the characters make and the things they do you question, who in earth would do such a thing as if this is some sort of weird freaky fantasy that someone wants to experience and goes in to the category of ""oatmeal on the pants"" character, ....hey there is even a zombie movie that was released in between this movies that was also a some sort of love story in some way, cant remember the name but it does have a better plot and script line, not perfect but what helped that movie is that it didn't took it seriously, there were some humor in it. Also the movies needed a better director, scripts writer and book author. The cast. i would let them go for another round to remake the whole series since there were various actors that i have seen before and they do good acting and better if they have better direction, even the guy from Good Omens, he is fun to watch.<br/><br/>The good out of this move? Made millions and brought tourism to a small town in rural America.<br/><br/>The bad.... We got the British and United States war to deal with, while the British giggle and drink tea by throwing us Harry Potter books and movies....

"latinaloopy","6","1","3","19 July 2019"," So drawn out
","I don't know why they made two movies from the final book, but I felt that the movie was too far drawn out. Emphasis on scenes that are of minor importance to the arch of the story.

"preben_hassel","5","1","3","29 August 2016"," Better than I thought but not great.
","I remember the hype around The Twilight saga back in the days when I went to school and everything the girls talked about were these movies. After a short summary from one of my friends I soon made up my mind that this wasn't something for me, and I left it alone.<br/><br/>it's 2016 now, and I stumbled upon the 4 movies on a streaming service I subscribe to, thinking; ""It's the middle of the night and I'm bored"" so I gave it a chance, and it var OK. Nothing more nothing less. I figured that since I didn't have anything better to do I could see what all the hype had been about.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward. Girl moves away, girl meets boy, boy is a vampire. That's it. At least in the first movie. The story escalates allot throughout the movies and several conflicts appear.<br/><br/>As for the actors; It all pretty much starts out as a typical late-teen movie, with mostly young protagonists. Robert Pattison and Kristen Steward (Taylor Lautner as well) has gotten allot of mocking for doing these movies and somehow I kinda agree but disagree at the same time. They did alright, but nothing worth an Oscar either. It seems to me that the actors grew allot while filming the movies and I look forward to seeing some of them in other, more mature movies. Steward especially.<br/><br/>All in all the movies were OK, I won't likely watch them again, but I wouldn't kill myself either If I was to watch them in the company of others.<br/><br/>I'd give the saga as a whole a 5.5."

","Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 follows Bella as word gets out about her new child. When the authorities begin to believe that the child is a threat, the Cullens set out to help prove otherwise and to avoid a confrontation with said authorities. <br/><br/>Surprisingly I actually kind of liked this movie. I thought it had some really cool ideas. While they weren't always presented super well, like the twist ending, they were interesting. If the movies beforehand had been better then I might have actually liked this movie more. But alas, it wasn't meant to be. <br/><br/>On top of that the soundtrack was actually pretty good. I was surprised to hear songs that both fit the scene they were placed in and just sounded nice anyway. If only the movie had put as much effort into the soundtrack as everything else. <br/><br/>However, this movie still isn't very well-made. To start, the special effects still suck. It's actually really noticeable by this point. The baby was made from CGI for some stupid reason, and it looked awful. It looked like someone had taken a cutout of Mackenzie Foy's face and just glued it over another kid's face. Even when she grows up it looks fake. There's this obvious change when the CGI child was replaced by an actual child actor, and after that it was much better. It was kind of hilarious that the CGI child thing went on so long though. And the wolves, wow, those looked terrible. Maybe on their own they're okay, but when put side-by-side with actual people it was just awful. <br/><br/>There were a lot of other parts of the movie that were just kind of really stupid. Little nitpicks here and there. Eventually they do add up and I have to stop ignoring them. <br/><br/>A lot of new characters were introduced into this movie, and a lot of them weren't given any more screen time than their introductions. This is fine and all, but some of them were given slightly more screen time than the others, and then somehow we were expected to care about them. There's this weird romance that starts between two of these expendables, yet we only see the two character together once before they promise to be together forever. Kind of like Edward and Bella's relationship I guess. Regardless, it's a rushed relationship that we as an audience are expected to care about despite being given no reason to do so. <br/><br/>At this point I can't even tell if the actors are bad or if I've lowered my expectations so low that at this point they seem passable. Regardless of which one it is, Kristen Stewart still isn't that great. It's easier to watch Taylor Lautner now than it is her. While her performance isn't unbearable, it's still one of the worst in the movie. <br/><br/>Overall Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is, while the best of the Twilight saga, still an incapably made movie. Most aspects don't exceed a level beyond average, and many fall far below it. However, there were a couple moments of blind luck when this movie dared to step, or maybe stumbled, over the average line and surprised us all, only to fall flat on it's face yet again. This movie is sort of like vanilla ice cream with bits of poop here and there. It's a bland flavor, sure, but it's still tasty. Sure there's poop every few licks, but for the most part it's just a decent ice cream cone. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you liked the previous ones or are contemplating whether or not it's worth it to finish the series. This is the shortest of the saga, and it's the best, so you might as well."
"rickbobby_94","Null","1","3","11 March 2014"," Wrong director.
","There is no doubt in my mind that the person who directed New Moon should have been the one to direct this and the rest of the films. Chris Weitz I believe his name was, and he managed very well to capture a wonderful look to the world of Twlight. He also stayed true to the books, and whenever there was emotional moments in the movie, they were never awkward or cheesy like they were in BD Part 1 & 2. Not too mention the end battle scene looked atrocious. It was a terrifc idea to Showcase what Alice had seen in her vision, and I know I wasn't their fault. But because they were forced to shoot the scene inside and use special effects to add into background just gave the whole thing a fake and horrible look. I believe all would have been a lot better if they had of kept Weitz on to direct all the films. He was the only who captured the core fundamentals of the franchise. It's a love story, and it should be that above all. If you want an action then go see one. Weitz managed to seamlessly blend action into a love story. He also should have directed the first film, as I think every single person can agree fan or not, was utter rubbish. It was made terribly."

","The Twilight Saga came to an end with Breaking Dawn Part II as Robert Pattinson and Kristine Stewart try to settle down as best they can with the ever present threat of the Volturi clan looming over them. They've even made some kind of arrangement with Taylor Lautner and the Indian clan of werewolves to serve as protectors of their daughter.<br/><br/>Two things about the daughter that are relevant. One the Volturis think she's a threat as the offspring of a mortal which Stewart was then and a vampire. Second thing this crowd is perpetually spoiling for a fight and the Cullen vampire clan better get some allies even if just to serve as guarantors of their good intentions that they mean no harm to anyone.<br/><br/>Fans of the books and the previous films will not be disappointed with the film and the ending. If you want an idea of the ending if you've seen the Kirk Douglas/Johnny Cash film A Ginfight you will have some idea of how this will end albeit with a supernatural slant."

","I must say I am really disappointed about this last twilight movie, not the content itself or story. BUT the lack of attention to details, in all the other movies I felt like they have handpicked music and songs to make it perfect audio vise. But in the last one you're sort of surprised by this weird arcade game music (thats the closest I could compare it to on short notice) in beautiful and important scenes. (it ruins the whole feel of it) <br/><br/>And the clothes, seriously !! Edward is dressed up like a schoolboy, and that does not go well with him being a father in this movie. And this computer made baby, really !! couldn't they find a real baby, I'm sure their budget could take it. And about the ending, finding out that the whole fighting scene wasn't real, was really disappointing since it was nearly the best thing in it.

","Now, I conclude my franchise review of THE TWILIGHT SAGA with the second part and the fifth and final installment of the film series, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2.<br/><br/>I will not explain this movie, but this is a quick summary: The birth of Bella and Edward's child brings conflict between Bella and her lifelong friend Jacob, and an all-out war between the Cullens and the Volturi, but it is not a real fight. It is only a vision.<br/><br/>This film picks up nicely after the last film and is based on the second half of the final book of the same name written by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>The story is really, really cool. From my point of view, this is the best TWILIGHT film ever made and there will never be another film like BREAKING DAWN - PART 2, well, except for THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, THE AVENGERS, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, MAN OF STEEL and CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER. Out of all of the film's stories, the plot is so easy to follow.<br/><br/>I will not explain a whole lot, but I will say that the CGI was great and really fantastic, especially in the last fight scene at the end of the film. The music was really good, in fact, the music during the fight scene was really amazing with the orchestra and choir going full blast.<br/><br/>The dialogue is not bad and this was really amazing because this was a difficult challenge to pull off, but it was really cool.<br/><br/>The acting was really cool especially with Kristen Stewart, MacKenzie Foy, Taylor Lautner, Dakota Fanning, Michael Sheen, Robert Pattinson, Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed and the original cast and newcomers that they put into this movie and they do their absolute best.<br/><br/>The editing is a little confusing, but it pays off wonderfully with Ian Slater and Virginia Katz, both editors who worked on this film, put together a really good, entertaining and amazing film that caps of the TWILIGHT SAGA nicely.<br/><br/>Now, I get to the ending. The ending was a little confusing, and the reason why is because it shows a vision that Alice has when she sees Renesmee, as an adult with Jacob, also Bella & Edward meeting with each other. I thought that would set up another TWILIGHT movie if possible, but it's just in this movie because it's in the book.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 is a great and satisfying conclusion to the five-film franchise. From the music to the CGI to the acting to the ending, you will not be able to take your eyes of that screen once you see the fight.<br/><br/>It is sad to say that this is the last film in the TWILIGHT SAGA. But I really do hope that they find a way to continue it because my sister LeeAnn really like this feature film. She likes the entire franchise in total and I would love to hear what Stephanie Meyer says about writing another TWILIGHT book or two for Summit Entertainment to make into another film or two.<br/><br/>I give THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 a perfect score of 8 out of 10. It may not win fans over, but it definitely gives you exactly what you want: a stunning conclusion to a great film series."

","After reading the reviews on this film i felt i had to add my own.. I have seen all of the twilight saga films and Breaking bad part 2 is easily my favorite, off course like many other people the ending being the best part, when the Cullen's finally come head to head with the voltoree. But the journey to the final battle is also very good, you get to see other vampires and their unique talents. Kristen Stewart plays her vampire role brilliantly, as we see in the first 2 movies shes not the best of actresses but if you have read the book you will know that she is meant to play that awkward, timid girl.. which she does beautifully but also badly. So her transformation into this beautiful brilliant vampire is just perfect, she plays the part brilliant. One downer to this film is the sex scene, its very lovey dovey when in the build up to the vampire on vampire sex i was expecting Edward to throw Bella about.. just me?? lol. Robert Patterson plays his part brilliantly, just like he did in all the other film. Overall i was very pleased with his installment of the twilight saga and very gutted its now come to a end."

","Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the perfect ending to the Twilight Saga franchise! The plot is easy to follow, but slick and speedy at the same time so it never feels like it's dragging on! The characters are likable and amusing in their own ways, making each one of them unique. The action is breath-taking with some heartfelt moments that may cause tears to fall from the sensitive viewers. I was blown away into space from it all, every moment of the film is a moment I will remember and treasure for definite! For Twilight lovers, this movie will be a real treat they'll never forget! For viewers who've never seen a Twilight movie before, this may encourage them to watch the others. When I watched this movie, I hadn't seen the first part to it yet, but it didn't take me long to understand what was happening because of the easily understandable atmosphere the movie creates which makes it such a must-see blockbuster!"

They believe that the chimpanzee version of the immunodeficiency virus (called simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV) most likely was transmitted to humans and mutated into HIV when humans hunted these chimpanzees for meat and came into contact with their infected blood. Over decades, the virus slowly spread across Africa and later into other parts of the world.<br/><br/>The earliest known case of infection with HIV-1 in a human was detected in a blood sample collected in 1959 from a man in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

","I have a different view of these Twilight movies. First, I had tons of fun watching them in a marathon week with my 23 year old and 13 year old daughters. We would make popcorn, light candles, turn on the huge lava lamp and settle in for enjoyment. The movies were made based on YA fiction so what do the other reviewers expect? For what they were intended, they were a blast to watch. As a parent, I was highly impressed with the values and morals promoted in the films. Yes, the special effects, acting, and dialogue was not profound, but it did what it was intended to do: entertain the adolescents and those with a fun loving attitude, and make money These films were never set to be serious or portray anything other than fictional teen/ young adult drama. Lighten up, people! Oh, and the actors look better in character as vampires than in real life."

So many of romantic scenes were kinda dull may be but that is just personal opinion only for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>But still Kristen Stewart was at her best ! She was kinda more open and flexible character this time. Robert and other casts were okay with their performances.<br/><br/>Twilight 'fans' would enjoy it for sure.

"g-bodyl","8","2","12","16 April 2014"," A Good Finale to a Ho-Hum Series!
","Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is a good finish as one could expect for a series like this. Looking back, these films weren't bad but as a fantasy series, they could have been much better. Unlike Part 1, most of the icky romance scenes are gone and is replaced with tension and action. Many of the scenes just feature build-up moments as we meet people from each vampire clan but all of this successfully adds up to an incredible end sequence which is worth alone the price of admission.<br/><br/>Bill Condon's film takes place right after Bella gave birth to Renessemee. Bella is trying to get under control over her new vampire skills and trying to keep away from Charlie. But things begin to slide when the Volturi, led by Aro believes her child is an Immortal, one that can spell doom for them.<br/><br/>As for acting, it's not magnificent, but not terrible either. I believe Kristen Stewart is better here even though she still needs to be happier. Robert Pattinson is also decent. Taylor Lautner is meh and should stay away from acting. However, Michael Sheen delivers a heck of a performance as Aro and his screen presence is amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, the finale of the Twilight series is a good one and one that neatly brings the franchise to a close, perhaps mercifully. As always, this film features great cinematography and a good score with some easy-listening songs attached. The final forty minutes of the film is excellent and on the whole, not a bad film. I don't think this will sway any non-believers though. I rate this film 8/10."

","well i actually am a fan of the twilight saga and i was always interested in how the saga ends. If Bela was transformed in the breaking dawn part 1, the movie would have been better. things wouldn't have been in a rush and put everything together in one movie just to finish the saga. the ending of the movie shocked me. when the battle was just a vision from Alice and nobody had died. actually the battle should have continued because that's what logic says. although in the vision Carlyle and jasper were killed but it shouldn't have been a vision....some sacrifices had to be made to put an end to the cruel and powerful volturi who ruled for a long time. the director maybe chose to end things in a peaceful to somehow comedy when Ari tells the rest of the volturi that there is no danger here after seeing he will die in the vision of Alice. I expected a better ending from the twilight saga...."

","The love story between Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) is the draw for the ladies and the supernatural creatures battling it out is the draw for the guys so with Breaking Dawn Part 2 everybody gets something out of the story. But I did not imagine that fans were so emotionally involved until I witnessed a woman seated to my left in the theatre audibly began to cry during the climactic battle that is shown in the trailer, when a beloved character falls. I have shed a tear or two over scenes in movies, but never a lingering 'nooooooooo!' will I utter. Seriously, I really like the stories, I read the first book and part of the second, but it is still just a movie, the characters are not real. Besides rather than enhance my movie going experience by having read the book first it tarnishes it, but that's just me. This final film was actually very interesting, creative and cleverly crafted. The story provided for answers to questions that I didn't know that I had, like the whole immortal child story. This did provide for some insight into the Volturi zero tolerance policy, but never a reason for their extreme cruelty. I did find that baby Renesmee was a bit too animated for my taste so it was hard to appreciate what was supposed to be extracted from her ability to communicate. Bella's story was worth experiencing on the big screen and held my attention through all the films. I was never team Edward or team Jacob (Taylor Lautner) but I always felt that Jacob was more endearing, maybe because out of the two he brooded less. The whole imprinting on the new born was a little freaky if I give it too much thought, so I stopped over thinking it. Aside from the appearance of baby Renesmee, the special effects in this film would have you convinced that people could transform into over-sized wolves, the Bella rock climbing and that massive crack in the ground looked truly realistic. It's no secret that I really appreciate cool FX, which made this film a gem in my mind. I'm not broken up about this series ending any more than I was about Harry Potter ending, it just makes way for the next epic story that makes people wonder 'what if?'. I liked the shock and awe moments and I thoroughly enjoyed the mitigated collateral damage. Part 2 gets a green light."

I loved the movies from the very first minute and still like them. But yesterday I started Twilight marathon and realized that movies aren't that perfect. But still,they are good. Before I didn't understand all the hate,but now I see some things that are wrong. It doesn't change the fact that Bella was meant to be a vampire. Kristen Stewart did an amazing job playing Bella as a vampire,she was so deadly awesome,she had this aura and I'm just sad that it took this long for her to become one. Although,every tiny detail made her stronger and happier and nothing was just for plot's sake. The cast was so diverse and all the actors were so great all along the movies.

","Out of all the Twilight films, this film is the best in terma of cinematography and CGI. The acting is a soight improvemt by 3% from the previous films. But, it was just frustrating. I have to admit, but I kinda like the premise of Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2. Vampire has a child with human who turns into a vampire. I found the premise the most interesting out of all the films. But, it is directed sooooo poorly and the acti g is just AWFUL. The thing that completely ruines the film for me is that it was building up to this epic showdown. I really wanted to see that and we do, but not in the way you expect ir to. What they do in the final battle is tragically unbelievable. I just felt so frustrated. So this is the final film in the series and there are still plot arcs and storylines still unresolved in the ens. Yea, kinda of a let down, but it's Twilighr for goodness sake.

I LOVED twilight and that movie wasn't even on my radar when it first came out. I had never heard of it. All of the rest of the twilight movies up until this last movie had their ups and downs and I never really loved them the way I loved the first movie. What I discovered though is that once they came out to DVD and I watched them again, any issues I had previously had about all of the previous movies were dissolved.<br/><br/>I have NEVER read any of the books, so I knew absolutely nothing about what was going to happen in this movie, just like I never knew what was happening in any of the previous movies.<br/><br/>I just got done watching this movie, as it just came out at midnight on DVD. I wasn't expecting much, as I didn't really care for it when it came out in the theaters and I saw it opening night at midnight, along with all the other teeny boppers. All I can say is WOW, this movie is REALLY great!! If you watched this in the theaters and hated it, but kinda liked the other twilight movies, give this movie another chance and try seeing it again. I alternated between cheesy grins and crying the entire movie and I felt like it really moved me. This movie ISN'T for a lot of people and I will be the first to kinda agree that if you pick apart the movie or the actors acting abilities, it's kinda low quality. You have to go beyond all of that and see this movie for what it truly is....an eternal love story that defies all odds, shows a mothers unwavering love, and can touch your soul if you let it. I know everyone goes on and on about the bad acting in all of the twilight movies, but the one thing I have always thought was FANTASTIC about these movies is the non-verbal acting. I think it is a lot harder to portray anguish, heartache, love, and burning desire with just a look or two then it is to read some lines. I have always felt that Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson especially were great at doing that and all three of the main actors had a chemistry on screen that I thought was very believable.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone is going to pick this review apart and I will be the first to admit that I am a 30 something who is kind of embarrassed to like these movies. I don't gush about Edward or Jacob and I am not in love with the movies because I get to see these guys half naked on the screen. I DON""t have Edward posters on my wall, I don't post on the forums or talk incessantly about this movie or the actors in it. I don't pick apart the actors personal lives and judge them. I just really appreciate the depth of love that can be shown in these movies and I thought this was a VERY unexpected and beautiful way to end this series.

","Time to leap to action, gather up your stake and crucifix, stock up on holy water, fortify your immortal soul, and prepare to brave all the unholy terrors of blackest midnight that lurk in the grim depths of Dracula's castle!!! Ah, wouldn't it be cool if the world of Twilight was actually like that? Nah, none of that with these movies! Oh whoa, yeah, so um, Bella was a vampire now, and there was no real change to her character at all except now she was a bitch, and she and Edwardian had conceived a nightmarish CGI-faced baby together that stared right at me, and the Volturi considered the mysterious creepy offspring of human and vampire a threat and attack. And then Bella and her new Cullen kindred stand around for a good hearty 90+ minutes while ""witnesses"" are gathered, which was just a fancy word for getting more fighters on their side with which to hopefully match the oncoming might of the sinister coven, and they have this genuinely great battle that does serve as a good finale for the series as a whole, but then... Well let us just say that they pull the rug out from under you in an extremely aggravating and undermining way! I do agree though that this is the most enjoyable one based on how it was the only one in the series did not by the end leave me feeling flat and disappointed, and I also didn't find it as mind-numbingly tedious, the plot felt less meandering and more focused, which I put down to the main driving force of the plot being the Volturi, who finally made their big move as the villains of this final movie. I always very much enjoyed all of their appearances, to me they always seemed to make every scene to feature them actually pretty great, I like 'em because they're a little closer to what vampires should be like - cruel, wrathful, intimidating. I especially get a kick out of Michael Sheen as the lovably effete and ruthless Aro. He was so fun the way he crazy- hammed it up like he was the arch-villain of an 80s Saturday morning cartoon show! And that bit when he unexpectedly gave out the girlish titter, what the f**k was that!? I thoroughly enjoyed the ending, it was the best action sequence they did yet. It wasn't bloody, but still very violent, there was like a dozen decapitations that were fairly graphic. But then it was all but ruined by the ridiculous twist, and the only real thing to happen in the whole damn movie, never happened at all.. Oh, you get on outta here with that bull-crap, what a colossal cop-out for the ages!!! Perhaps I jumped on the bandwagon at some point, but I also can't stand Stewart. I've said it before and I'll say it again, she was wrong for the part and it's her 'presence' that hurts these troublesome movies more than anything else, with most common grievances in regards to them coming down to her in one way or another. She has no presence and no style, such a role called for a certain strong soulfulness in a person that she clearly lacked. It is a performance that's really quite magnificent in its ineptitude. With the skill of an acrobat she ceaselessly contrived to skirt and weave around every opportunity to move the audience, to avoid all emotionally significant nuances that came her way, and reduce all possible characteristics down into one single note whine. She was less human than the rocks, and about as grey. My lord, they tried out just about everything with her, they had her regular, helpless, heartbroken, dying, and of course vampire - but no matter what they never managed to make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that was Kristin Stewart as Bella Swan! These films definitely aren't for me, but I was very fair in my reviews and I gave them all a fighting chance. They are at least entertaining and slightly fun in a cheesy sort of way and aren't as god-awful as popular opinion would have you believe. But it's always basically the same thing, love-love-love, vampires vs werewolves, and a lot of ugly woodland. They just never evolve or change significantly at all. And as cinematically slick and dazzling as they are, there's no escaping the ever-present soulless lack of meaning in the things, they're palpably hollow, with absolutely nothing going on beneath the surface. The only challenge in them is trying not to laugh. In my view they're ultimately nothing but a bunch of immaculately empty, and intermittently thrilling failures. Twilight, I'll see you in hell!! I've made my peace."

As the last film of the sequel I wasn't all impressed and I think they could of done something better to improve it. The twist is amazing but before then it just drags.

One day, when Bella, her daughter and Jacob went to play outside but suddenly they met Irina who is one of Cullen family cousin. Irina was misunderstanding about Renesmee and it seemed like she didn't like her that much. She thought that Renesmee was ""immortal child"" because in the past vampire believe that immortal child was like a monster they will kill everyone. This new reported to the Volturi by Irina; this leads up to climax of the movie. There is going to be a fight between Cullen family and the largest powerful vampire group named the Volturi.<br/><br/>Twilight saga; Breaking Down-Part2 is worthy and surprisingly; it is going to be my favorite movie ever. It is not just about thrilling climax as the fighting battle but it also shows true love between Bella and Edward. Personally, I like the Volturi because all the actors dressed and played as real vampire; especially their faces this is so amazing. The twilight is Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence including disturbing images, some sensuality and partial nudity. it is worthy to watch it. Finally, Breaking Down-Part2 is the final epic saga of Twilight concludes."

","Although this movie did contain more violence and gore than any of the other parts, I can say with 100% assurance that it was way the best of them all. The actors played better than ever, there were much more jokes and funny elements as well as more excitement too. If you like this very romantic, epic vampire story, you will love the end. However, there is a twist towards the very end, which was quite a bit of a shock for both me and my kids. Unfortunately, I hadn't known about it at the time because in my country the premiere was earlier than in the USA and no-one had written a review about it before we went.:(. And here comes the spoiler or the warning for other sensitive people: before the great battle between the Volturi and the good vampires (the Cullens and the rest, their witnesses) Alice shows the future to Aro. However, when you watch this part in the cinema, you believe that it is reality and actually happening. So when Carlisle decides to fight Aro in close combat, it comes as a shock when Aro wins and shows up Carlisle's torn- off head to the others. After this scene comes the fiercest and most spectacular battle ever and several of our beloved heroes seem to die: Jasper, some of the wolves along with Jane from the Volturi and in the very end: Aro. This is the point when the director lets us realise all those horrible events were to come only if Aro lets them, or rather, unless he prevents them. Of course he doesn't want to die so he makes the right decision,just like in the book. At this moment there was a great uproar in the cinema, the whole audience shouted with relief. Many viewers would welcome this twist, I didn't. The book was much more peaceful. In this movie Bella and Edward's love is depicted beautifully, and there is no actual sex scene to worry about. The end is cathartic and I truly believe this movie is well worth watching it. Congrats to all the actors and makers for doing so great. Those people who found it boring or disappointing, I have no idea why. To me it is a great story about true love, friendship, faithfulness, courage as well as great entertainment."

Irina, believing that Renesmee is an immortal child, reports The Cullens to The Volturi. Alice Cullen has a vision of The Volturi making their way to Forks in order to confront The Cullens over the allegations.The rest is how cullens gather the witnesses all over the world and protects the child from the volturi.The climax battle was amazing along with the the twist which brought great response and cheers in theater.The last scene where Bella makes Edward to feel their love journey brings nostalgia not only for them but also for all twilight series fans.The sound track haunts you even after the movie and the end credits were amazing showing all the characters involved in the twilight saga."

","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2012)<br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The fifth and final film in the series has Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her husband Edward (Robert Pattinson) bringing a daughter into this world but soon this birth gets the attention of the Volturi and a war is about to break out.<br/><br/>BREAKING DOWN PART 2 will undoubtedly be loved by the majority of the teenage girls who watch it but everyone else is probably going to be bored out of their minds. Having gone through the entire series now, this one here would probably rank as the third in the series after parts one and four but thankfully this isn't nearly as bad as the second and third entries. There's quite a few problems with this film from some bad performances to the awful CGI and the drawn out story but, again, I doubt fans of the series are going to mind this stuff too much.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the film is that it's simply way too boring for its own good. I guess breaking it into two parts was mainly done to get more money out of people's pockets but there really isn't any reason as to why this entire film couldn't have been played at the end of the previous one. I say that because everything here is just building up to the final fifteen-minutes so everything earlier than that is just drawn out dialogue. There are countless scenes where people discuss things and it's the same stuff over and over to the point where you're wishing everyone would just drop dead. The dialogue isn't the greatest anyways so having to listen to it wasn't all that fun.<br/><br/>I will say that both Stewart and Pattinson are good in their roles as they should have been by this point. The supporting cast has many questionable performances but I'm sure most were hired because of looks and not talent. The CGI is as horrid as the previous four films and I must admit that it's downright hilarious how the wolves are constantly changing sizes and sometimes within one scene. The CGI fires are just as laughable as are the bloodless decapitations. THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN PART 2 is a pretty bad movie that thankfully put an end to the series."

","I had decided to watch this movie today just for the hell of it. I had been into twilight in the 6th grade, read every single book, had the team Jacob shirts and everything...and then I got over it. But hey, let's write this review really quick.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the movie was OK, but it seemed like most scenes were just there take up time. The only part that actually had me wide-eyed and awestruck was the battle scene with the Volturi. I hadn't thought that the producers would've taken it THAT far when they had shown Carlisle's head decapitated from his body. I can truly say I was so relieved when it didn't actually happen and that everyone was going to live. <br/><br/>The scene that really got to me... was the last one, when they showed every cast member from the whole saga. It really made me think ""This is it, they are truly wrapping this up."" especially when they used the book pages to introduce the main characters for the final time. So here I am 5 years later from reading twilight when it first came out, about to start my senior year in high school watching the this scene. This ending literally made me remember how much I loved this series when I was younger and brought me back to the time me and my best friend were 13 years old and snuck in the movie theater to watch New Moon (We smuggled ribs in and everything) I guess you could say it made me realize how fast I had grown up.<br/><br/>Alright I'm done with the sentimental nonsense. All in all, the movie was okay. It wasn't bad, it was just okay."
"davispittman","6","1","9","1 August 2015"," Not the best, but definitely not the worst.
","This twilight installment is at times entertaining, and at other times somewhat boring and you just wish it would move along a little faster. All the characters are just the same as they have always been throughout the entire franchise, no surprise there. Some of the scenes were rather cheesy as far the dialogue, but that was sort of expected. I didn't really like how Renesme looked strangely animated, it wasn't natural looking at all, so that was weird looking. The action scenes were well done, and exciting to watch, that's the main thing the film had going for it. Overall, I can only give this movie a 6/10, not horrible, not great. Eclipse was much better (my personal favorite)."

","If you are not a Twilight fan or have not seen or read any of the previous books then please leave and don't bother writing your pointless review because you have no right to moan. This movie, I thought, was a great finale. I thought the end, crediting everyone in all of the twilight saga was a really lovely touch and it did make me quite upset as it makes you come to realisation that twilight has finished. For fans this is hard the books and films are very good it makes you sad to know that there's no more, so people need to stop being so insensitive in their reviews. At the end of the book (Breaking Dawn) it is special how it comes to a final end. It is amazing that they included it in the film. It is right at the end when Bella pushes her shield out of her body and allows Edward to read her mind, which if you're a fan should know that this has drove Edward crazy from the second he laid eyes on her. Despite what people say I believe it is very special and a lovely ending. If I were to criticise the film, Renesmee does grow fast but she grows 10x faster in the film, missing out small details. Also in the film Edward and Bella seem almost distant in the film but in the book, Edward's always there. Overall I believe Stephanie Meyer is one of the best writers, the Twilight books are amazing and I won't ever stop reading them, they always will mean a lot to me. The films are equally good, not as good as the books, granted, however it isn't possible to fir so much into one film."

","We live in a world full of fantasy – fantasy that we can't explain sometimes. Everything has a purpose, everything has its place, everything has a forever. This is one forever that will last into the next life. It amazes me that 5 years ago in 2008 we were introduced to a whole new world that was created by a 35 year old writer who told a story of a mortal human being who was drawn into a world of vampires and were-wolves.<br/><br/>Nobody knew that it would end up with a sad-happy ending. We were mesmerized by the way that these movies and books that have melted (literally) into our hearts. It's like we live in this world that I described a second ago full of make-believe, but for The Twilight Saga – it was so real. The Saga has been ingrained into our souls and left a chilling (so to speak) mark.<br/><br/>As I was sitting there watching the movie, I was shocked by the way each part of it was so breathtaking. Each scene was so impactful. The books and the movies have made a mark in us that no other franchise has left in us – The Twilight Saga, will and always be a part of our lives for many years, decades and centuries to come no matter how old we are.<br/><br/>Stephanie, thank you so much for your hard work and for sharing with us the story of our lives. To the many directors – Catherine Hardwicke, Chris Weitz, David Slade and Bill Condon – thank you for giving the vision to see Stephanie's work come alive. To Melissa Rosenberg – girl, you rock – your words are Stephanie's words, thank you for the craft that you have. To the composers – Carter Burwell, Alexandre Desplat, Howard Shore – you guys are the epitome of the Saga – thank for the music and for bringing artists like Linkin Park, Muse, Metric, Bruno Mars and Green Day on board.<br/><br/>The last thing I do want to say before I close this great Saga Review – to the 3 people who gave us an enchanting vampire – Robert Pattinson – to the mortal who loved a vampire who he is and becoming the immortal that we loved – Kristen Stewart – and to the brown-nosed werewolf who gives his heart and soul – Taylor Lautner – you guys are what The Twilight Saga is about.

In the first Twilight it was good and there is a lot of actions in these movies. In new moon I thought Edward would never come back to Bella. In eclipse I thought Edward would die and then no more sagas but it turns out bell saved Edward twice in new moon from Aro and in eclipse from Riley and Victoria. She also saved him from Jane in part 2 of breaking dawn when Jane said pain. Jacob is my favorite to but Edward is my most favorite of all. They should film midnight sun. By there is no more sagas. Sad. In part 1 I don't see how when Bella dies ts sad but she comes to life in the end when her eyes open it scares the daylights out of me but not anymore because I watched them a million times I know when her eyes will open now.

","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the fifth and last installment in the Twilight franchise. Bella's become a vampire, she has a daughter that for some reason everyone thinks is immortal without getting proof, so Bella, Edward, Jacob and the entire vampire family gather all their relatives for a big, epic ... formal confrontation...? Yeah, I'm serious! Sure, without spoiling anything, the trailer shows that it ends up as a final battle, but they originally intend it to be a formal confrontation... Ummm... I digress.<br/><br/>This movie was good. And I'm not saying it's more intelligent than any of the previous movies. This is a dumb movie, and it's one of the dumbest in the series. But that's part of what makes it so entertaining at times.<br/><br/>Whether intentional or unintentional, I enjoyed the humor in the movie. I laughed so many times at the terrible lines that were so easy to put in a sexual context, and there is even a small sub-plot about Jacob being ... IN LOVE WITH BELLA'S DAUGHTER!<br/><br/>The action scene at the end was actually really cool, but the weird thing was that every characters that died were killed by having their head ripped off.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance with this movie are the special effects. They're terrible for a big budget movie. And the worst part is that Bella's daughter is CGI even a while AFTER growing up from being a baby! That's just disturbing! She just looks so artificial, and there's NO true character development on her!<br/><br/>Overall, you'll probably love this movie if you're a serious fan. But if you're a fan of the movies because they're so stupid, you'll like this too. This is the dumbest and funniest movie in the franchise. And I thought Snow White & the Huntsman was hilarious."
"educallejero","1","0","1","7 June 2020"," Why so boooooring?
","Now having seen all the story, I believe everything died in the third movie, when the love triangle was solved. For better or worst, that was the heart of the franchise (the fantasy world building was always done poorly).
Again the writers elude the real and natural conflicts: Bella's moral dilemma of needing human blood for a while; How is Bella going to disappear from his community now that she can't appear in daylight? Those things are resolved in two short scenes. Basically, ""it doesn't matter"".<br/><br/>Ok, then more time for the final conflict between the Cullen and the ""orthodox vampire clan"", with two different views of what to do to preserve the entire race survival.<br/><br/>But the road to the resolution of that conflict was filled of incredibly boring scenes, with characters without any weight, personality or motivation to participate (even the movie makes fun of how easily they are convinced to do so). About that ending, I can understand some may like it. I just didn't.<br/><br/>To end this. It's embarrasing how bad the CGI is (except when the wolfs do not interact with anything), considering how much money these mfs made. The score is also non-existant or lame. The acting, is hard to know with this script, but still: I think Pattinson was at his worst; Stewart confirmed simply lack of talent (at that point, at least); and Taylor Latuner was giving an inexplicable character, and he didn't do anything to make it better. Proper ending for a bad franchise with exactly one decent movie of five."

","To tell a tale out of school, out of all the horrible Worst Picture Razzie winners, Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2 was the main reason I retained from doing this marathon in the first place. On top of not getting into the teenage vampire and werewolf trend in early 2010's, I didn't want to expose myself to the cinematic bubonic plague known as the Twilight franchise. Unfortunately, the 8-year record is broken as I have now seen one of their movies, the final one. Previously, Bella Swan-Cullen (Kristen Stewart) gave birth to Edward Cullen's (Robert Pattinson) half-vampire baby Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). In Part 2, Bella and Edward's love-child brings a conflict between the Cullen family, the pack of werewolves lead by Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and the Volturi cult led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Having not seen the other films or read the Stephanie Meyer books, I could never follow why being immortal would be a threat to the Volturi vampires or how the vampires inexplicably gain powers like chopping logs like a cheese cracker, superspeed, or super-jump. It also didn't help that the visual effects are far below the standards of a Sci-Fi channel movie, demonstrated by the werewolves, motion blurs, the backdrops, and the baby. Another list of stupidity: Bella learning to act human, the elemental powers that contribute nothing to vampirism, the ethnic stereotypes, and the climactic battle near the end which was all a vision. The only redeeming and entertaining value in the whole series so far is Michael Sheen, who bites the scenery gloriously and even has that silly hammy laugh as an act of threat. While nicely shot and not with some crazy and funny moments, Breaking Dawn Part 2 is still a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed mess. (1 ½ Ugly CGI Renesmee Cullens out of 5)"

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","2","26 March 2020"," The long-awaited end, for the worst reasons.
","This film is the latest in a saga of five based on a series of ""best seller"" books. I never read the books (nor do I intend to), but if Edward and Bella's story should be epic it won't be thanks to these films.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is summarized as follows: after a difficult delivery in which she truly dies, Bella ends up being a vampire, as she longed for. Now, you need to learn to control your bloodlust and your newly acquired powers and abilities, as well as to disguise your new condition when necessary. At the same time, and just when everything seems to be going well, the Cullens will have to defend themselves against a false accusation in the face of the relentless Volturi, who are on their way to probably kill them all.<br/><br/>Bill Condon continues to provide direction and gives the film a good sense of direct connection to its predecessor, as well as a good, closed and well-done conclusion. In clear contrast to the film that precedes it, this is the least romantic, with the novel giving way to a more interesting plot where adaptation to a new life, followed by the threat of war, are the strong points. It was also the most interesting and appealing film in the saga, the most cinematic and the most epic, in my opinion. The rhythm was more worked, but it still drags a lot in moments that seem unnecessary. The climax is, of course, the confrontation between the Cullens and the Volturi, and the ending is quite good and puts a clear and definitive end to the saga.<br/><br/>Despite everything, the film still has problems, parallel and endemic to the whole saga. Looking at the big picture, now that I have seen all the films, I really think that the fault lies more with the incompetence of the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, and not so much with the successive directors, although the lack of firm hands and the inconstancy in this field (with each film to be made by a different director, in practice) did not help the quality of the whole. Parallel to the whole saga, a warm and boring story that can only be saved thanks to sub-plots of action, suspense or danger, with bad dialogues and bad material given to the actors. Never as in this saga of five films has it been so clear to see the damage that a bad screenwriter can do to a film or, in this case, an entire film cycle!<br/><br/>Another problem that this film presents, and which is also parallel to the whole saga, is the poor performance of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, two actors who, in my view, should never have been placed here. There were casting errors. Stewart is much better in this film than in all the others, but she remains an actress without expression, and that will be something she will have to change and improve in future works if she wants to succeed. Pattinson has achieved minimal chemistry with her, but he is still far short of what he should have achieved, even individually. Taylor Lautner, who started the saga well and grew, ended badly. From a serious actor playing a nice character, he has become a bunch of muscles that, when he takes off his shirt, turns into a furball. The secondary cast maintains the positive level of previous films. Billy Burke and Ashley Greene are very good, as are Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Maggie Grace and Booboo Stewart. On the Volturi side, Dakota Fanning was fine but had little to do and I didn't like Michael Sheen. I think he put too much pressure on the stereotypes of the European noble vampire when thinking about his character. Rami Malek makes a brief appearance, but shows ability and talent.<br/><br/>Technically, the film has ups and downs. The CGI wolves don't look as good and realistic as in the first films, the fight scenes look like contemporary dance due to excessive choreography and the bloodless deaths are not credible. I am not an apologist for a bath of liters of false blood, but as the people say, ""neither eight nor eighty"". Another problem is Renesmee ... the baby looks so unreal and fake that they could have used it on a children's toy instead. Carter Burwell's soundtrack has space to stand out and is very good, standing out in the initial credits (longer than usual in the franchise) and in the finals, where Christina Perri's excellent song ""A Thousand Years"" stands out. Good scenarios, props, costumes (especially Volturi uniforms) and very good images of large-scale landscapes complete the technical work.<br/><br/>This film ends the less successful and less epic saga of the epic sagas. Dragging for five films what could have been easily done in four, it lacks everything, starting with a duo of central characters capable of moving and moving us. The introduction of elements of tension and danger to temper excessive sweetness and mask the flaws of the actors, but they did not make this film (or its predecessors) good films. They just helped them make it bearable."

","This review is for the entire saga.<br/><br/>From first glance, I fell in love with Twilight.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's eyes are so expressive, it was like she was mesmerized, in a trance, and lost to Edward...forever. I am amazed at the quality of her acting though, at times, I thought the dialogue was laughable. In the beginning she does come across as a whiny, selfish brat, but because I know the ending, the whole triangle thing was explained in a mind blowing way. Her lip sucking and soft snorting could be annoying, but, like anything I fall in love with, I am easily able to get past it. For her age, she comes across as brave, intuitive, and able to handle whatever comes her way, never wavering.<br/><br/>The music is amazing and emotional.I laughed and I cried. I would get lost in it and it invoked so many emotions I would be overcome with...a warmth that is all encompassing, a sit up and pay attention moment when the danger rises to a fever pitch, or a clash between Edward and Jake is on the horizon. Like Calgon, I just wanted to close my eyes and let it take me away...deeper into the fantasy.<br/><br/>They did an amazing job with the special effects. The more I watch it, the more I marvel at them. We do have the cheesy moments and I do cringe, but they are few and brief.<br/><br/>Twilight has made everything vampire so much better for me. It allows me to visualize the action, such as fighting, death, turning...<br/><br/>Three outstanding peripheral characters stand out and I feel deserve a special mention. Blondie, for being there, Bella's savior til the end. Seth, what a sweet boy, that believes in doing the right thing, loyal and trustworthy. AND a very special shout out to Leah. When she makes that move in front of the Cullin's house...doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>To vamp or not to vamp, that is the question. I first got into vamps with Angel reruns, then Charmed and Supernatural reruns. I caught a few Buffy episodes, but missed out on most of it.<br/><br/>I do love my vamps mean and ugly, but, now, I also love them soft and vegetarian. Cheesy and hot. It's so bad I can't look away. I watch whatever pops up on cable over and over. binging on Hulu. Poor constipated Edward and lip sucking, soft snorting Bella. a whiny selfish brat...and a hottie, Jacob. Sometimes Edward's facial expressions are so very creepy. To pick my favorite character is really hard, because as I learn more about each one, they all have their special touch added to the whole.<br/><br/>Two other cringe worthy moments are when Riley is standing over Charlie...I can feel his breath on my face, and when Bella's knees hit the floor. I cringe every single time!<br/><br/>My favorite quote:<br/><br/>""So the lion fell in love with the lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a stupid lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a sick masochistic lion.""<br/><br/>Everything about Twilight has made my enjoyment of the supernatural world of werewolves and vampires so much more enjoyable. I am able to visualize the action and know more of the history of the fabulous fictional characters.<br/><br/>BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rarely buy books or DVDs, but this was a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..and I bought the set of books too, so be on the lookout for those reviews."

","Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is indeed the best entry to the Twilight Saga series, though admittedly this is not saying much. I guess the correct term for this one is that this one is 'The least terrible' of them all.<br/><br/>Atleast after five movies the writers have finally given us a reason as to why Jacob Black is attracted to Bella, even though it doesn't make a lot of sense since the person Black imprinted on was not even close to being born for most of the Saga, but apparently werewolves can also predict the future without them knowing it. There still is no reason as to why Edward is attracted to her though, and as usual in a Twilight film there are a couple of terrible romantic scenes between them once again, although thankfully this was a lot less frequent when compared to Part 1. <br/><br/>The opening title sequence was very good, partly due to the impressive score by Carter Burwell, but straight afterwards this is basically thrown overboard with a terrible vampire running scene with Bella and Edward which feature absolutely terrible CGI and abysmal looking greenscreens in the background like we were watching some kind of terrible videogame. The 'tough girl' Bella character just doesn't impress me. The scene when she raises her voice against Jacob is just laughable at best, since it is as is usual with Stewart such a forced expression that is visibly literally taken straight out of distant cue cards and spoken without any natural kind of conviction. The mother-daughter relationship that could have made this movie into something doesn't have any chemistry which is ofcourse the result of Kristen Stewart not being able to develop chemistry with whatever other human being on the planet anywhere.<br/><br/>The entire narrative of the movie is basically one idiot vampire claiming false claims against the Cullen's & Bella for no apparent reason so a confrontation can be had with the Volturi ( Yeah, it is terrible writing, as is the whole series ), followed by the Cullen's gathering allies to convince them that it wasn't true, or otherwise make a stand against them if they do not listen. While all of this seems to be an irrelevant bunch of nonsense only there to fill up the running time, the final confrontation is definitely the best scene in the series. One of the biggest problems with the action sequences in the series is that it is lacking in any kind of tension since you know none of the good guys will die, but in the final battle this is changed drastically and a lot of the protagonists meet their demise in the battle against the Volturi's, resulting in possibly the only tense encounter in the entire series, because finally anything could happen. All the while this is accompanied by Carter Burwell's fantastic score and some gorgeous snowy cinematography, i admit i was quite starting to like it at this point. However, in the end it all turns out to be a vision created by Alice after which the supposed 'mighty Volturi' leave with their tail between their legs, and nothing ever happens. In the end you realize Twilight is still Twilight, and nothing holds any significance as nothing tragic can ever happen in this childish fairytale. There is never any real danger, or any real threat, and for a moment you thought this was gone in the battle sequence, after which the audience will be left severely disappointed. <br/><br/>While it features an amazing score by Carter Burwell & a lot of gorgeous cinematograpy which is admittedly the best in the series ( Although also quite a lot of ugly greenscreening ), this movie's strength comes solely from it's battle sequence near the end, which ends up being an illusion, which in turn leaves you wondering: 'What the hell was the point of all this?'"
"joshkej-84077","6","0","1","11 February 2018"," Bad as a movie, not bad for a Twilight movie
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 continues the Twilight Saga tradition of taking itself too seriously without a hint of self-awareness. It's bad. It's really bad, but like the other movies, that's what makes it hilarious, and the only reason I bother watching these terrible movies is for the LOLs. <br/><br/>Bella still looks like she's constantly on the verge of vomiting, although she is slightly more lively than she previously was, Edward is still boring, Jacob is still pathetic and the rest of the cast is as lifeless as the vampires they're playing.<br/><br/>The plot is, as usual, dumb and filled with gaping holes (they build a house for Bella, Edward and their child, but then the next day they plan on leaving Forks. WTF?) <br/><br/>The special effects are awful awful awful, especially that damn baby. The vampire running sequences are embarrassing (seriously why couldn't all the chase scenes be more like the one with Victoria in New Moon, That was awesome and it didn't need all these terrible effects and green screens)<br/><br/>After so much boring, the one thing that made all of the boredom worth it was the final fight sequence. It really was spectacular. The devastated gasps from the audience when Carlisle's decapitated head was revealed and the cheering when Jane was finally killed said it all. And the twist was even more amazing.<br/><br/>The ending sequence was actually rather touching, despite me not caring for any of the main characters.<br/><br/>Overall it's as bad as any of the other twilight movies, but it manages to be one of the better ones."

It has a lot of energy and I believe that the actors wanted to end the series on a high note as well. Throughout the movies I really enjoyed Bella and Edward's love story and I know that the movie doesn't really portray a theme to a lot of people.

","I like most people am not a fan of ""Twilight"" and there was never a movie in the series that I thought was genuinely good, although they did try a few times. This movie mostly suffers from really bad CGI. I mean, the wolves in this just look so terrible. I'm also pretty terrified by the baby who has this horrible looking CGI at first. At least it gets better when she's older. I can at least acknowledge that this were some people who liked this series and it does seem like it served its purpose with those people well. This was made into possibly the longest movie review in history with Spoony talking about this for over two and a half hours! <br/><br/>I actually do like what they do at the very end. It looks like there's this big fight scene. This is probably the main criticism of the series in that Bella causes all these bad things to happen. They actually did do something unique and it ended up being better than I thought. The fight scene was actually an illusion or a vision of what would happen. Everyone ends up leaving in peace. Of course, it's still not a good movie. It's a shame how the actual actors hate it more than even most people. I think this was the only ""Twilight"" movie that didn't win Best Picture at the MTV Movie Awards. I guess people learned their lesson by this. It was at least interesting to see how a series ended.<br/><br/>I still enjoy it when people make fun of these movies, even if I don't find them awful. Granted, I still think they're mostly bad. They actually did get some interesting shots in and they even had some interesting powers that the various vampires showed off. It did entertain me with how cheesy it was at times, so I'll give it that. These actors need to show more emotion. Hopefully, they'll move on to better roles. I don't find most of these movies that harmful, but now that they're done, we can just ignore them like we should with most movies we don't like. There will be worse and much better movie series out there. **1/2"
"dayanaortez-28566","6","0","1","30 September 2016"," This movie was a decent movie
","I have been waiting to watch Breaking Dawn Part 2, and now that I have watched it I'm surprised at somethings throughout the whole movie. This film is a drama/fantasy typed story.Bella being the main female character has to male figures after her. Jacob and Edward, as seen in the Breaking Dawn Part 1 she stay with Edward. Part one seems more realistic than this movie because of the way they use computer programs(as so portrayed) to build up characters. As we all know Bella and Edward have get married and end up having a baby, then Bella ""dies"". Throughout this whole movie, as a viewer you could tell that the baby, Renesmee is a computer fantasy per say. She does not look realist at all well at some times she will but throughout the movie she mostly looks fake. The main point of this movie is that they are trying to protect the baby from the Volturi because they have declared her as an immortal child, that has to be put to death. There were many interesting points. There were a lot of angles, camera movement, lighting,and sound that you could totally pin point. When Bella is waking up they have a close range shot, they start very zoomed in the eye and then they zoom out slowly and to show the rest of her body.They do a long shot view of when they(Bella and Edward) go chasing after her meal. In this shot they show them take a long jump/leap to get onto the other side of the hill. They used a Pan movement to introduce the scene of when they enter the woods hunting. When out running they use tracking shots, which is when the camera is moved to follow the movement of the character. This movie had natural lighting throughout the whole thing. I rated this film a 6/10 because I was very bleak toward the fact that the daughter was based on a computer program and it bothered me at full length because I couldn't really focus on certain scenes when the girl showed up because of how fake she had looked. So if you don't like seeing movies like that, that have computerized characters than i would not recommend this film. Other than that issue it is a very pleasant movie to watch because they continue the story board as expected and don't have surprises. I would recommend you to watch it and see how the story continues."

","I'm a huge fan of the series written by Stephenie Meyer, and I really think the first four films are really good. But in this movies many mistakes were made. serious mistakes that greatly compromised the quality of the film. First, all the visual effects of Renesmee, the half-vampire daughter, half-human Bella. I believe they were the worst visual effects I ever seen in my life. Another issue: many new characters appear in this film, and the director could not carry it to the screen in order to make them interesting. Not to mention that the South American vampire dress up as Indians, and not in a good way. They were quite ridiculous. And finally the final scene with the meeting of all vampires. I saw the documentary of the production. These scenes were shot over several weeks in a gigantic studio set. The fact is that all vampires were in serious trouble in the makeup during this sequence, I don't know if because there was a change in the light, for coloring of the scenes or what it was. But the appearance of vampires was plastic and very ugly. I could go on citing defects in this film, it is difficult to find many qualities indeed. The film fails to capture the magic of the other films. But I still think the final action scene saved the movie a little."

","Now, I conclude my franchise review of THE TWILIGHT SAGA with the second part and the fifth and final installment of the film series, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2.<br/><br/>I will not explain this movie, but this is a quick summary: The birth of Bella and Edward's child brings conflict between Bella and her lifelong friend Jacob, and an all-out war between the Cullens and the Volturi, but it is not a real fight. It is only a vision.<br/><br/>This film picks up nicely after the last film and is based on the second half of the final book of the same name written by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>The story is really, really cool. From my point of view, this is the best TWILIGHT film ever made and there will never be another film like BREAKING DAWN - PART 2, well, except for THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, THE AVENGERS, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, MAN OF STEEL and CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER. Out of all of the film's stories, the plot is so easy to follow.<br/><br/>I will not explain a whole lot, but I will say that the CGI was great and really fantastic, especially in the last fight scene at the end of the film. The music was really good, in fact, the music during the fight scene was really amazing with the orchestra and choir going full blast.<br/><br/>The dialogue is not bad and this was really amazing because this was a difficult challenge to pull off, but it was really cool.<br/><br/>The acting was really cool especially with Kristen Stewart, MacKenzie Foy, Taylor Lautner, Dakota Fanning, Michael Sheen, Robert Pattinson, Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed and the original cast and newcomers that they put into this movie and they do their absolute best.<br/><br/>The editing is a little confusing, but it pays off wonderfully with Ian Slater and Virginia Katz, both editors who worked on this film, put together a really good, entertaining and amazing film that caps of the TWILIGHT SAGA nicely.<br/><br/>Now, I get to the ending. The ending was a little confusing, and the reason why is because it shows a vision that Alice has when she sees Renesmee, as an adult with Jacob, also Bella & Edward meeting with each other. I thought that would set up another TWILIGHT movie if possible, but it's just in this movie because it's in the book.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 is a great and satisfying conclusion to the five-film franchise. From the music to the CGI to the acting to the ending, you will not be able to take your eyes of that screen once you see the fight.<br/><br/>It is sad to say that this is the last film in the TWILIGHT SAGA. But I really do hope that they find a way to continue it because my sister LeeAnn really like this feature film. She likes the entire franchise in total and I would love to hear what Stephanie Meyer says about writing another TWILIGHT book or two for Summit Entertainment to make into another film or two.<br/><br/>I give THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 a perfect score of 8 out of 10. It may not win fans over, but it definitely gives you exactly what you want: a stunning conclusion to a great film series."

We see how difficult it is for him to shut his mouth and close his eyes in front of so many strangeness. Ditto for the scene with J. Jenks, much better than in the book. And the great, great idea of the battle scene. I was elated : it's good, it's really good! I was so bored of all the speeches in the book, and there, at last, fight for good ! I loved the graphic style, the music, Kristen Stewart, obviously happy to leave the fragile character for a feral vampire !

"Aldalati-osama","8","0","7","22 March 2014"," My review to the movie Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 ( contain spoilers)
","I've watched a lot of vampire's movies, some of them were ridiculous, some of them were tedious, but the last movie of the twilight series was superb. It was a mixture of Action and Romance. What we all expected to happen in the first twilight movie eventually happened, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) finally got married and gave birth to a baby girl named Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy).<br/><br/>The Whole conflict happens because of the girl. The Cullen baby was accused by her cousin Irina (Maggie Grace), as a mortal, which is considered a crime, and informs the Volturi, a high ranked vampires who got control among all of the other vampires. The whole journey begins as the Cullens try to collect evidence from all the vampires they know to prove that Renesmee was immortal because she was gifted with an ability of showing people visions as she touch his/her cheek.<br/><br/>As the Cullens gathered 18 vampires to evidence during the arrival of the Volturi's to kill the Cullens for the crime, two members of the Cullen family Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) and Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone) went alone to get their own evidence, where they eventually appear a man who appears to be half mortal half immortal. Alice has an ability of seeing the future; she was the one who visioned that the Volturi were coming to for them.<br/><br/>With the Arrival of the Volturi, Alice and Jackson arrives too, but with the Volturi's head master Aro's (Michael Sheen) ability to see anything in the brain by touching the hand of the vampire. Aro touches Alice's hand and see's what she saw and the both sides get into a fight against each other's. What shocked me was that few of the main characters were dying, at the beginning I imagined how could this movie end with the loss of half of the main characters, but with the ones who survived they were winning the battle. The Cullens along with the werewolves were winning against the Volturi, but that all turned out to be just one of Alice's visions.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the retreat of the Volturi, and like every other movie the Cullen family lived happy forever. This movie was a huge succeed, the reproduction in a village called Forks in Washington with the theme of a forest for the vampires to show their abilities. The songs used were suitable to every situation the song was played at.<br/><br/>There were some negative parts of the movie, there were some weird moments in the movie where Aro unleashes his weird laugh that sounds pointless, and the first time Bella saw Renesmee , the baby girl looked so unreal, you can easily see that the baby was created.Other than those the movie was really great and I really hoped for another twilight movie, but sadly that was the last one."

","Over Thanksgiving, I'm sure everybody had something to be thankful for. ""For what"" you may ask? The final chapter of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2, that's what.<br/><br/>Fans of the series - the films, and the books by Stephanie Meyer that they were based on - will be thankful that it ends in a way that will satisfy them, although they'll also be saddened that the series is now over. Those who hate the franchise will be thankful that it's all finally over. Bottom line: If you love the franchise, you're not going to be disappointed. If you can't stand it, this will not change your mind.<br/><br/>Taking place immediately after Breaking Dawn Part 1 concluded, Bella Swan, after giving birth to her daughter Reneesme, has completed her transformation from human to vampire. She adjusts to her new life with her husband Edward and his family fairly quickly, but has trouble with the fact that her friend Jacob (a werewolf) has imprinted on Reneesme... it's creepy. Soap opera struggles have to wait, though. The Volturi, the high council of vampire law, is planning an attack against the child, fearing that it may pose a threat to their kind, and their secrecy. To protect Reneesme, the Cullens assemble allies to serve as witnesses in their defense.<br/><br/>Like each of the other Twilight movies, the movie is ridiculous. The acting, action, and even the dialogue have tendencies to go over the top, and produce unintentional laughs. If you enjoy that sort of thing, this will suit you just fine. Still, this is the best looking film thus far. The photography is great, and considering Guillermo Navarro shot it, how could it not be?<br/><br/>In addition to all of this, the acting is inconsistent between the stars, many of which seem to gradually accept just how ridiculous these movies really are. The fact still remains that there are so many characters to keep track of, that they can't, and it goes without saying that the supporting actors, three in particular, are more interesting than the three leads.<br/><br/>Ashley Greene hits all the right notes as Alice, my absolute favorite character from the books. Billy Burke earns his place as series MVP, as Charlie Swan is the one character that every movie got exactly right. Still, Michael Sheen is the clear standout as Volturi leader Aro. You can see, plain on his face, he does not take this at all seriously, and he camps it up to levels of Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. What a delight he is.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, I want to talk about one thing in this movie that rubbed me the wrong way. And here's where we get into major spoiler territory. If you don't care that the movie will be spoiled for you, feel free to read. If you haven't seen it, but you want to, I suggest you stop reading now. I would rarely go into such detail, but this one thing made me furious.<br/><br/>So, before the climax of this movie begins, Alice (who has the power to see visions of the future) brings evidence that Reneesme will not be harmful to their species to Aro (who has the ability to read an individual's memories). It turns out that no evidence will sway Aro, so an epic battle of the Cullen vampires and the wolves against the Volturi begins. This is easily the best sequence the Twilight saga has ever given us. Epic, beautifully staged, and honestly very intense, this ten minute sequence alone was making this the best movie yet.<br/><br/>And so, just as Aro is about to be killed, we cut back to him and Alice, with the two sides still standing off. It turns out that the whole battle was just a vision that Alice had, one that will happen should Aro attack. In short, this resolution is the most ridiculous, most frustrating, and most insulting cop out that you can imagine. How did these people think that could possibly work? Did they think no one would question it? That we'd just accept it? Well, newsflash! There is no way to accept it. There is no way to defend it, either.<br/><br/>With all of that in mind, if you're just in the mood for a simple guilty pleasure, this one's not too bad. At least, for the most part it's not that bad. For me, everything was going good until that foolish twist.<br/><br/>*** / *****"

","This is one book to movie adaptation (Although a cash grab as this story could've been easily told within one movie) that i would love to say what i usually say and that is the book was better but you know what? I can't as the ending gives you more or less the Meyer version that is the book and you get director Bill Condon's version as well that entwine quite well actually. So a two for one type ending is not a bad thing in a movie world that provides so little these days. The film starts pretty much where 'Breaking Dawn Prt 1' left off.. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is dealing with two major life changing things in her life..1..Becoming a newborn vampire and two...becoming a mommy to a baby girl named Renesme (The worst storybook name i have ever seen) who seems to, due to the fact that she is half vampire/half human, have powers of her own such as mind reading and levitation, she also has starting ageing rapidly. So all these things considered she has to still come up with an idea on what to tell her dad Charlie (Billy Burke) who only thinks she is still ill from her and new beau Edward's (Robert Pattinson) 's honeymoon trip. Needless to say a lot has gone on in short time in her life.<br/><br/>The Cullen family thanks to Alice (Ashley Greene) are soon to find out that one of their cousins has seen Bella walking Renesmee, and her powers as she flies up to touch a falling snowflake, the cousin informs the powerful sect The Volturi of this new edition to the Cullen family with inquisitions and questions they all come looking for the Cullens. This sets off Alice and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) to find who they believe is the only other hybrid like Renessmee to hopefully avoid war with the Volturi.<br/><br/>A good ending to a series of films that in my mind were more off then on. Hey at least they ended it properly in my mind. Maybe Condon should've directed the lot?? Who knows?"

","I went to watch Breaking Dawn last weekend with my friend and my sister. We've all enjoyed the Saga since the first installment which was and still continues to be our favorite. Now coming to Breaking part 2, as a fan, I have to say that I was impressed and disappointed. Impressed because:The movie began very well with Bella's transformation to a vampire. Kristen's performance did not disappoint me at all. She did exactly as the book described Bella, an unusually tamed, controlled Newborn. of course she lost her temper on Jacob a little, and almost haunted a human. Equally impressive was the scene when she yells at Jacob which deserves 7 stars on it's own. I don't understand how they can still call her face expressionless.I laughed so hard with all the audience in the theater.Billy Bruke did add up to the humor as usual. His acting is natural and effortless and full of expressions!Jacob, the wolves, and the Cullens were like a huge cozy background, not forgetting Renesme. THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING IN THIS MOVIE HOWEVER WAS THE LITTLE TWIST IN THE END. The scene got us gasping and yelling and cheering when Aro's head got kicked of by Bella. Too bad it was only Alice's unaccomplished vision. Finally for all those who still want to see Bella's/Edward's love story this movie doesn't fail in representing it again as fresh as the beginning.The two did also well in their young parents roles. <br/><br/>coming to the disappointment: first of all the little fake renesme was so disturbing. I kept praying for her fake role to end fast to see Mackenzie Foy. Bella as a super tamed Newborn felt like she's still human if it weren't for the red eyes and pale skin. Here it is Stephenie Meyer's fault in developing Bella this way. The transitions between the scenes were almost non-existent so that for a person who hasn't read the books he will totally get lost and confused. The plot kept moving from scene to scene as if they were pictures in a book without any clear explanation. The vampire covens whom I was waiting for with great anticipation did not satisfy me at all. Every vampire just presented his gift and remained in the background. There was no harmony, no coordination among those covens like the book.The great disappointment was in the peaceful turn the war has taken, which some critics described as anti-climactic. All this big change we've been waiting turned out to be a little vision of ALICE! I was at least expecting a Cullen member to die, but no, they had to stick to the stinking conclusion of the book. My comment is far from being subjective even though I'm a Twilight fan. I expected an ""epic ending"" on the whole, but too bad it was partially epic. I'll still continue to love the Saga and overlook the disappointments. A final remark: from all the cast, I only look forward to see Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Billy Bruke and Micheal Sheen in new roles."
