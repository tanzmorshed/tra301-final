","This movie is a must see for any music and movie lover
Queen fan or no Queen fan,anyone who sees this movie will be going through a rollercoaster of Emotions
Beeing it Queens music or the story behind the music
Rami Malek puts down an excellent version of Freddie Mercury, but all the actors play great in this movie
In my opinion best thing to do is ignore the criticism and go see it for yourself."
"nanci-55759","10","1490","1761","12 November 2018"," One of my favorites in 75 years
","I'm a 75 yr old Gramma that saw this movie with her son and grandson. We all Loved it!
I ""heard"" Queen music as I worked and raised my 4 children, but never really knew the band it came from.
My children Lived with Queen music, and totally identified with them, especially in their band performances.
My grandson heard Queen because his father played it all the time.
We saw this movie as a family and the movie was about family, friends, and loyalty. The typical band movie is about rising-to-fame, falling-from-fame. This movie is about hanging together as family, as loyal friends ..something we Really need more of today!! The 2 :15 time frame flies by and you're left wanting more...more... more...
Rami Malek is awesome as Freddie! He, his 3 co-stars, last director, music director, and entire crew deserve nominations! See this in a theatre that has great sound where you can appreciate the depth of the music!
One of my most favorite movies in 75 years!"

","Wow! I feel mind-blown after watching the world premiere yesterday evening. I am whether a megahuge Queen fan (although I really like many of their songs), nor do I know how accurate the storytelling is (, but I suppose pretty accurate since both Brian May and Roger Taylor are co-producers of the film), but I found the movie both intoxicating and moving. I have read some of the professional reviews, and I cannot comprehend their search of documentary wisdom in this movie; this is not a documentary, but an entertaining story of one of the world's most iconic bands. And the film delivers on all aspects. (And the critics were so wrong about the song Bohemian Rhapsody upon its release).<br/><br/>As Brian May pinpointed in the interview on the red carpet, he found that the casting was excellent (I don't remember the exact word he used). But he is so right. Every major role is perfectly casted, and all the band members are brilliant. But I must emphasize Rami Malek's role as Freddie. It has Oscar written all over it. What he does, is almost beyond comparison. Chapeau for even taking on this role, and then delivering what he does. Even better, although marginally, than Michael Douglas in Behind the Candelabra. And Gwilym Lee as Brian May is also a bull's eye, but Malek really carries the production on his tiny shoulders. It was like watching our beloved Freddie all over again.<br/><br/>Many, many memorable moments, but the Live Aid performance recreated: it is one of the best scenes I have ever seen - and I have seen lots and lots of films. Chapeau for director(s) and producers and the whole team for to me delivering the best film YTD in 2018!!"

","My wife and I both enjoyed this immensely. We are Queen fans and attended the tribute concert a after Freddie died.<br/><br/>This film is extraordinary, first and foremost, for Rami Malek's performance. The physical resemblance is only a small part of that. He had Freddie's body language down to a tee.<br/><br/>But the crowning glory is the vocals. They are absolutely mind blowing. I don't know how they did it, I'm assuming it's Freddie's voice. The lip sync is flawless. If it's Malek singing, the Oscar is in the bag.<br/><br/>I've heard there are some negative reviews floating around. I find that astonishing. I hope Malek gets at least a few nominations for this. He should get multiple awards."

","I just saw the world premiere and oh boy let me tell you about it:<br/><br/>This movie might not be a masterpiece but my heart is filled with such happiness and joy after watching it that I think it's going to burst (sorry for the cheesiness), Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are so exquisitely portrayed I sometimes forgot it wasn't them, the performances were so on point and so powerful you could feel the energy burst through the screen. Â¿Have you seen the famous car scene in Wayne's world? well, now imagine a full room doing the same, people couldn't help but sing along (lets be honest, it's impossible not too).<br/><br/>I laughed, cried, sang and wished I could have seen Queen live, this band will live forever."
"alanfield-73765","9","770","945","24 October 2018"," Makes you realise what a loss Freddie was
","This movie was a brilliant portrayal of the mixed up life, and massive talent that was Mercury ... and that is in no way meant to diminish the other fabulous musicians who made up this wonderful band. Whilst Freddie's life and death are quite well documented, his inner turmoil is not - this movie opens this up for all to see, and highlights actions and individuals who had a large influence on his fragile life, both good and horrendously bad. If only he could have been happy with the knowledge that he had one of the best singing voices, if not THE best, that ever fronted a rock band. Rami Malek does a wonderful job of portraying him, and in so many ways has captured his mannerisms to a tee. Loved it, and listening to the music in an IMAX auditorium was brilliant."
"Aaron_Kyle","5","420","511","9 December 2018"," Watered down
","For a film portraying a band as wild as Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody plays itself to safe for its own good.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a roller-coaster of a film, at times being a painfully low key and factually incorrect drama and at others redeeming itself with its recreations of classical Queen concerts (especially Live Aid). Another play it safe issue is the films focus on Queens biggest songs and the lack of focus on less popular songs. In terms of Queen as a band the film focuses itself mostly on Freddie Mercury but still manages to make his private life and personal issues seem glossed over and rushed thanks to horrible pacing and unfavourable writing. Speaking of Freddie Mercury or Rami Malek in this case, he was phenomenal. Other than that there was nothing particularly breath-taking, nor was there anything arousingly pitiful.<br/><br/>On the contrary Bohemian Rhapsody isn't a bad film. It does just enough to entertain general audiences and fans of Queen although it doesn't properly function as a drama.<br/><br/>Final Grade: 5/10"
"pulliptears-805-317973","10","899","1124","25 October 2018"," Truly brilliant.
","For those of us of a certain age Queen, and especially Freddie, defined us. Sitting through this movie I had goosebumps. The casting just works and watching the actors playing May and Deacon you'd be forgiven in thinking someone had access to a time machine. Even Kenny Everett was instantly recognisable.
I left this movie a strange combination of elated and terribly sad. Elated to hear the music, watch the story and yet sad that Freddie was so desperately lonely.
Ultimately, I think Freddie would have approved of the whole thing. His genius and flamboyance shone through.
Truly brilliant."
"raudafitriani","10","547","709","2 November 2018"," Extraordinary & Mind-blowing.
","Rami Malek will be forever one of my favorite actors since the day I've watched Mr Robot, I knew he will be one of the biggest star someday. Freddie Mercury is legend, everyone loves him but not everyone knows his story. Freddy Mercury is fearless, but not everyone knows about his desperately lonely. I dont't know how accurate the storytelling is but this movie is absolutely mind blowing and brilliant, such a perfect tribute to the legend!<br/><br/>I'm not saying this movie is perfect or masterpiece, infact this movie has some issues with the director and delayed. But after I walk out of the theater, my heart is filled with joy, tears of happiness, brought so many emotions. That's how you know the movie is fantastic, darling. The casting was brilliant, bravo! I can't get enough with Rami Malek, he obviously worked so hard, Rami Malek pulls off an amazing performance, he just brings Freddie back to life and I don't think you will see any better film about Freddie Mercury again. It's an oppurtunity of a lifetime, every aspects of this movie was executed beautifully. Also the whole cast was so close to perfection! Gwilym as Brian May, Ben as Roger, and Joseph as John are amazing as Rami. Truly magnificent. I recommend to go and see this movie, whether you are fans of Queen or not."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","6","16","18","13 February 2020"," It's light and mostly okay, but could have been great
","It's not surprising to me that Bohemian Rhapsody was a hit. Queen have always been a popular and well-loved band, and even if some consider it overplayed, the song this film is named after is undoubtedly iconic and quite the musical achievement. What does surprise me is just how much of a hit this was, raking in something close to a billion US dollars worldwide and earning several Academy Awards. If I'd watched it before the hype, I'm sure I would have found it a solid yet potentially unmemorable music biopic and then moved on, only to be surprised when it got the kind of acclaim, box office results, and awards attention it did.<br/><br/>It also puts me in a position where much of what can be said about Bohemian Rhapsody has already been said. The criticism when it comes to some aspects of this film have been extensive, so I will briefly say that I agree with many of them. A harder edged look at Freddie Mercury would have been much better, because the film can only scratch the surface when it comes to his lifestyle, partying, and the various partners he had throughout his career. The pacing is a little too frantic, and some scenes are put together in a rather gimmicky, blunt manner (the biggest offender for me was the press meeting scene, where Mercury becomes overwhelmed at all the repetitive questions being thrown at him; it was filmed and edited in a way that I thought would look tacky in a student film, let alone a large scale Hollywood production). Then there's the whole matter of the surviving band members' involvement, including speculation that they wanted to tone down any edgy aspects and also make themselves look good in the process (oh! And give the actors that depict them more screen time. I think a lot of the clunky filmmaking and editing choices come down to those surviving band members wanting to increase the amount of time their personas were in the movie. This creates an awkward sensation where Bohemian Rhapsody is something in-between a Freddie Mercury biopic and a Queen biopic, but failing to truly excel in either regard). And then there's the matter of historical accuracy, which is ignored in some areas, but is far from an unforgivable sin for the most part, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Rami Malek was highly praised for his depiction of Mercury and to be honest, he was good? But not fantastic. I think the fake teeth did a lot of the acting for him, and giving a good impression of a well-known historical figure certainly takes skill, but I'm not as blown away by what he did as many seem to be. Everyone else in the cast ranged from just okay to decent- there weren't really many standouts.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fun but it's Queen, so what else would you expect? Additionally, Bohemian Rhapsody is thankfully not boring; I guess a positive aspect of the frenetic, exhausting pace is that the film is never given the opportunity to drag. It's really the Live Aid concert recreation that saves this movie, and in the end, I almost wished I was watching that for two hours instead of the rest of this movie... which I still can't say is terrible. That concert recreation is a decent pay-off, and the movie is somewhat engaging and with a good (still not great, in my opinion) lead performance at its centre. It just failed to move or entertain or shock or make me think much beyond that. It's a perfect lazy Sunday afternoon movie, but beyond that, include me among the people who otherwise don't really understand what all the fuss was about."

"stacyhislop","10","288","421","27 October 2018"," What movie did the critics see? Certainly not this one !
","I don't think I've ever been so excited to see a movie, EVER! As I'm sure many of you my age will say, I was brought up listening to Queen by my dad who was a huge fan. One of the only times I ever remember my dad crying was when Freddie died. That love for Queen has been passed on to my little boy, so off we went (a little disheartened, I might add, following the critic reviews) to watch the movie. Ten minutes in, my little boy turned to me and said , 'mum, I love this already' The film has you right from the get go! I honestly don't know what movie those critics saw, but it can't have been the same movie. At times I forgot I wasn't watching the real Queen. I laughed. I cried. I got goosebumps. I cried some more. I absolutely loved every minute of it. The cinema was packed out and as the credits drew, the audience clapped and cheered; something I have never experienced at a movie before. Do not be put off. Just go! If you have kids, take them too!"
"za_ne","7","282","413","23 October 2018"," A biopic or more like bio-epic. And a fantastic one.
","What a night this was! I went to the world premiere in my local theatre with the purple carpet event on the big screen and all that jazz.<br/><br/>When I saw the first trailer I didn't think much about Rami Malek as Freddie or the whole movie at all since the majority of biopics are generic and pretty much formulaic. Back then, I even considered dropping Sacha Baron Cohen a huge mistake. But boy was I wrong. Malek shined like he's never shone before. I think Susie Figgis outdid herself as a casting director here.<br/><br/>Ever since I joined the casting industry, I really started seeing what it means to work here, how important this part of showbiz that is, and how just a single miscast can ruin a project. Susie Figgis is a veteran casting director, known for many big and widely loved projects and she did well here. She did extremely well. Up until the moment I joined this business, I paid little to no attention to the actor ensemble, with the exception of clear miscasts that just stood out and you couldn't unsee it. But yesterday I just sat there, mesmerized. Gwilym Lee did an outstanding job portraying Brian May, in fact, I forgot he wasn't him. Lucy Boynton was one of my absolute favorites, portraying Mary Austin and her love and devotion towards Freddie. And Rami Malek. Oh, boy, Rami *was* Freddie Mercury. While I was sitting there in the theatre and staring at the screen I didn't have a feeling I was watching actors play their parts. I felt like I was watching Queen.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say about the plot, or the costumes, the setting, the cast. Everything was close to perfection. A perfect balance of drama and comedy. Exactly how life is.<br/><br/>I was five when my dad came to me, kneeled, put his large and on my tiny shoulder and delivered the tragic news about Freddie passing. Queen was basically the soundtrack of my upbringing, so I didn't take the news too well. I wept like I've just lost a dear friend. Dad and I spent the remainder of that afternoon blasting the tracks we oh so loved.<br/><br/>Queen has been the soundtrack of my life, therefore it's impossible to have an unbiased opinion about 'Rhapsody', but I must admit I had my reservations at first. But in the end, I loved it. The last twenty minutes of the film I spend sobbing and wiping the tears and mascara tracks from my cheeks. I can't remember the last time I cried this much in a movie. And I don't know if it was the music, Freddie's tragic fate or the relationships he had, both with lovers and his family, or maybe it was an amalgam of everything, but from the first minutes the movie started building up, it rose block by block until the huge skyscraper that the story was, finally concluded and all the lights turned on and it shined like a marvelous gem.<br/><br/>Until this day, Live Aid remains the biggest, most epic music event in the history of civilization and it is remembered by millions. And _Bohemian Rhapsody_ did it justice. Malek did justice to Freddie. And I left my seat long after the credits had stopped rolling. The show must go on, and it does."
"kirstenhines","4","378","563","3 November 2018"," Fell short
","I am clearly in the minority, and do not understand the love for this movie. The story jumped around entirely too much. It didn't build up the relationships or people. What could have been an amazing biopic fell short. It scratched the surface and never went deep in the storyline."
"gabriel-ridout","1","10","11","26 January 2019"," Sometimes Entertaining, Most Times a Trainwreck
","I wanted to love this film. A lot of respectable people love this film, and I don't want to take that away from them. If you're a casual Queen fan, or if you lived through these performances, you'll enjoy reliving it. However, if you know the band's story, this isn't it. I cannot stress enough how fake the plot of this film is. It's almost totally fictional, like the children's book version of real life. Freddie Mercury is basically Nanny McPhee in this movie, waltzing into peoples lives and being perfect and enchanting. The band is always friendly, and they're always right and everyone else is always wrong. There are some cartoony, mustache-twirling villains, who were not like that in real life. So know that this film is INCREDIBLY misleading. Don't take it too seriously as a biography.<br/><br/>On a craft level, there are also issues. The script is predictable, touching on all the greatest hits, but never doing anything really interesting. I hate to say it, but I think Rami Malek has trouble overcoming the wig and teeth. He does't look anything like Freddie Mercury (even with the makeup), and he's not even doing his own singing, so I wish they had just cast someone else. Malek really tries, but it never comes together. He's nothing like Freddie. Lucy Boynton is wonderful as Mary Austen, though. Warm and charming as she needs to be. Most of the actors playing Queen are serviceable too. And there are some fun cameos I won't spoil.<br/><br/>The concert sequences are okay for the most part. I was never bored watching these, but the truth is, you can go on YouTube and get the same experience. Watch the music videos, watch Live Aid. This movie's recreations are watchable, they're just not special. The green screen is kind of obvious, the choreography is awkward, and it doesn't feel very real. The songs do the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>Overall, Freddie Mercury deserves a much better movie. The story here is not true. Worse, it's predictable. Freddie deserves better than inauthentic and boring. But that's what this film is. There are some fun moments and some decent performances. But I can't recommend this one. Some people are going to enjoy it, and I'm glad for them. As wonderful as the songs are, and as much as I love this story, the movie just doesn't do any of it justice. It's a bad film, if I'm being honest. It's bad."
"NatKaminska","4","412","640","9 November 2018"," Solid entertainment in the second half of the movie, but not much more. Overall bland and flat, Mercury and all the Queen deserve much better.
","I'm fan of Queen& Freddie himself, but the same time I graduated film school and I love cinema, that's why I also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies. Here I will try to make my criticism honest.<br/><br/>Yes, sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious, and their opinions are detached from reality, but sometimes they are also right, and in the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', it's the latest.<br/><br/>First of all, the film distorts a lot of facts from Freddie and Queen's life, and if it were not significant events - I would not care at all, because I understand copywrite and legal issues, but these are important things and all of this should be done better. Fred's life was dramatic enough, if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie, they would go even deeper into Mercury's childhood and the fact he&his family, escaped their own homeland, because of brutal revolution. This could have been the starting point / foundation for a deeper, better portrait of the Queen singer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no depth here, the worst part is that this film is schematic, completely flat, only glides over important topics, does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating, complicated character that Freddie was.<br/><br/>I don't accept excuses of many Queen fanatics , that ""this is the story of the band and not Mercury himself"". Because first, one does not exclude the other: it was possible to include deeper analysis / truth about Freddie and the band, and second: the band's history is not shown in some great way either. The best moment of a rather boring, long-lasting first half of the movie is the recording of '' Bohemian Rhapsody ''. The rest is a fast, also quite chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting, carelessly, Queen tours and writing of individual hits, and while I understand, that in a 2-hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail, it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters - band members, thus also build better and deeper characters in this film.<br/><br/>The second half is better, I admit, both in terms of pace and in terms of writing/story, and the icing on the cake is the Live Aid concert. The performance, photography, camera work, acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene, unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failure.<br/><br/>Malek's acting, imo, certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. He tries his best with an empty and schematic screenplay, writers / director's mistakes are not his fault, true, but Oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances, which are not limited to robotic mannerism, it must be accompanied by the psychological, emotional depth of the portrayed character, and there is no such depth in this film, in this main character. The only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into Mercury's soul is the scene of conversation in the rain. It is here, that Malek's creation is the truest and the best.<br/><br/>But again : when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film, majority of Malek's work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism - perfectly recreated- but it is not enough to rate this role positively, let alone reward it with an Oscar nomination. Imitative mannerism, gestures, faces alone - it is only a skeleton, an acting sketch and not a full, beautiful, complex image, which should be any biography. There is simply no soul in this act, and it's just a shame, if you play a figure as extraordinary, colorful and complicated as Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>In addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director, Malek himself (for me), didn't rise to the task. Sometimes he is just Mercury caricature and large, artificial teeth don't help to erase this impression, in fact, the opposite. The make-up department didn't do good job here, famous teeth of Queen frontman could have been done better, much more subtly, it would look less ridiculous. Returning to Rami Malek - he is still a young talent who - like any actor - needs more workshop and acting experience, plus really good material, to really shine. That is why I predict Rami Malek will not win an Oscar.<br/><br/>I still think that the great mistake of the Bohemian Rhapsody creators, was to part ways with Sacha Baron Cohen. When I found out that he had left Mercury's biography project, I felt it was a big mistake from film producers, because I was sure Cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising, interesting story, not forcedly smoothed and it seems, my intuition did not disappoint me then. Cohen, a remarkable & colorful character himself, would have fit in perfectly in this role. In addition, after watching the interview, in which Cohen explained why he finally left the movie and what vision of Mercury he had - I regret even more that it was not him, who played the Queen main singer. He wanted to portray Freddie as a complicated, controversial figure with a great appetite for life, but also a great artist, who mixed his big ego with great sensitivity and shyness - I have no doubt that it would be a great role. Now it's just a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>As a result, we got schematic, ""polite"" movie, oh, what an irony - because Freddie Mercury, as well as the entire Queen, were as original, unapologetic and creative as you could be and they deserve much better. Sorry, but real Queen fan, who wanted raw, real, complex, deep, uncompromising truth and story - just cannot like this movie. Mercury and all the Queen story has so much potential (wasted in this movie). I guess I'll just wait for another film, bold and great this time, I hope."
"Jared_Andrews","5","246","376","27 November 2018"," Some good, but too much bad
","It's not Rami Malek's fault. Let's make that clear. He comes through with a fittingly outrageous performance and should be commended, especially considering all the mistakes taking place around him. His prosthetic teeth are cartoonish, but he pulls them off just fine. He also pulls off the voice, the posture and the curious wandering eyes that that make manifest his burgeoning sexuality that slowly becomes clear to him.<br/><br/>'Bohemian Rhapsody' the movie's greatest problem is that there is no clear message or meaning. It's intentionally eclectic and mixed, but this concept works much better for the song than it does for the feature film. It never quite reveals what it's meant to say. If it only meant to pay cutesy fan service to the adoring Freddie Mercury and Queen fans of the world, then it's a job well done. If it meant to offer any other sort of statement about sexual expression or friendship or the creation of music, then it's mostly a miss.<br/><br/>The movie's greatest failure is its insistence on submitting constant winking in-jokes about Queen. When Mike Myers' music executive character says that no one will ever sing along to Bohemian Rhapsody while riding in a car, we all chuckle. Or, at least, we're supposed to. The crowd around me certainly did, but I just rolled my eyes. Moments like are not as clever as the filmmakers believe them to be.<br/><br/>The other greatest failures come from an inability to make moments believable. The lip syncing could be overlooked (even though it's awful) because no actor can reasonably be expected to make that perfect, but it's the director's issue for not choosing alternate angles to hide the mouths. Worse than the lip syncing is Freddie's relationship with his father. Dad is a classic conservative who disapproves of Freddie's lifestyle (the singing more so than the homosexuality, we're led to believe), and that's the entirety of their relationship until the cringeworthy resolution near the end. It's not even worthy of being considered manipulative because it's so weakly executed.<br/><br/>Another thing: did Freddie really not know he was gay until Queen had been a smashing success for years? Everyone else seemed to know and accept it. That seemed to be a bizarre choice of the writers.<br/><br/>If you love the music and absolutely adore Queen, you'll probably like this movie. But if you look to poke any holes at all in film itself, you'll spring a few dozen leaks. Freddie deserved better than this."

","Wow. What a brilliantly made film. Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) has walked a sublime tightrope of a wonderful engaging, funny and emotional film without turning it into a turgid Hollywood smarm fest. Rami Malek is of course the star and his performance as Freddie is uncanny. Most of the vocals were Freddies originals but he does attempt some of his own,with commendable success, and you quickly forget it's not actually Mr Mercury himself.
Unlike some biopics the music itself does by no means fall by the wayside and there is a multitude of Queen classics crammed into the just over 2 hours running time. And with Roger Taylor and Brian May as the executive music producers for the film expect nothing less. I was pleasantly surprised as to how much of the movie was dedicated to the music and if I wasn't in a cinema I would have spent half the time air guitaring and singing at the top of my voice. Of course we have a lot of the film dedicated to Freddie and his declining social life, behavior and ultimately health, and this is handled with so much respect and emotion that at no point does it seem forced or uncomfortable.
The film follows a classic rise, fall and rise again formula culminating in a final fist pumping, rousing half hour which sees the band bust out (what some say is) the greatest live performance of all time as they re-emerge for Wembleys Live-aid concert.
Realistically the film won't go down as an all time classic and may not be up for any Oscars (except for Maleks performance maybe) but what we do get is a barnstorming, foot-tapping, heart pumping movie which for me is without a doubt one of the greatest Music biopics ever made. Go see it."

","After listening to the reviews calling Bohemian Rhapsody a bog standard bio I think it's time for me to put my two cents in to the ring.<br/><br/>Personally I must have been watching another movie. Or is that I just understood what the makers of Bohemian Rhapsody were trying to achieve.<br/><br/>Actually let's start with just that.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a tribute to the legacy of Freddie Mercury and also the band Queen. It was primarily made for the fans of the the band and to showcase the band and its history to a new audience.<br/><br/>To do this the film primarily uses a straight forward story telling style. This also means that events and time lines have to be condensed and fictionalised to tell that story in just over 2 hours. This also means that many real characters have to amalgamate in to a couple of fictional personas. I personally had no problem with this. I also liked the fact that the film poked fun at future events using also comic casting. Those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about.
It seems to me that the critics wanted something that real Queen Fans have no real time for, namely a movie that explores Freddie's wild private life. We know what he did. We know a lot about his wild side. But Queen Fans want a film about the most important elements of Freddie's life. Namely the band and its music.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody does something better.<br/><br/>Instead of showing a debauched indulgent life, Bohemian Rhapsody instead shows us a man trying to come to terms with his extraordinary life. It shows how with the help of the truly talented other members of Queen he was able to do that. It also shows his Joy, his loneliness, plus some of his mistakes and missteps along the way, and of course his complex relationship with Mary Astor possibly the one person he truly loved.<br/><br/>It tackles his sexuality and some of the aftermath of his partying. It also shows the beginning of his illness. This is all achieved with sensitivity and respect.<br/><br/>Now for the music.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is possibly at its greatest when recreating queen on stage. Using a mixture of real singing from the actors, Queen and Freddie's over dubbing and sound alike artists to create a totally unique feel to Queens songs. Recreations of the bands greatest hits are mixed, to sound fresher than ever. Some even help the movie to move along showing headlines and critic's reviews as the songs play out. Then there's The Live Aid performance. Much like the real concert it almost dwarfs everything that has gone before on film. We the audience really get to experience what it was like to be at that event. Not just from the crowd but from the bands point of view. Almost every highlight from that performance is featured.<br/><br/>The performances.<br/><br/>Everyone agrees Rami Malek is a revelation as Freddie after about 20 minutes you totally forget that this is an actor. He is Freddie. This can also be said for Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello playing The rest of the band in fact in the case of Lee the transformation into Brian May is astounding. As the film primary focuses on Freddie you can feel a sorry that aspects of the other members of the band aren't fully explored. Rogers womanising is hinted at but Brian's private life and his relationship with his father are not. John Deacon remains the enigma of the band.
Lucy Boynton gives a carefully measured and sensitive performance as Mary Astor coming to terms with the changes in Freddie's life.
Unfortunately Allen Leech has the unenviable task of playing a composites of some of Freddie's lovers and can be seen as a bit of a cliche villain. But he gives a good account of himself.
As for the rest of the cast. Everyone else is solid.<br/><br/>The film begins with Live Ad and ends on that same day.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Queen I defy you to leave your seat as the credits role..
To Sum up. Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration, not an expose and it should be treated that way by those pay their money to see it..
The Critics obviously didn't get it."

","This has got to be the most overrated film in recent history. Overrated by the audience. Critics got it right this time, even though they rarely do.<br/><br/>Rami Malek offered a great impression of Freddie Mercury. But impression it was. He failed to capture the essence, the exoticness of the real Freddie, and his manliness. Rami's acting made Freddie looked like a generic gay man, which Freddie wasn't. Freddie's might have been a weirdo, but never acted like a sissy. At times, his acting simply looked ugly, such as his exaggerated emphasis on Freddie's incisors. You can easily verify what I am saying by searching for videos of the real Freddie Mercury, and you can see the real Freddie never acted the way as portrayed by Rami. Sacha Baron Cohen, the original actor slated to play Freddie, might have been a better choice.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie was the script. Far too much ""creative liberty"" was taken to alter historical events. Omitting details for clarity, adding details to fill in the blanks, compressing events to fit his career in a 2-hour movie, that's normal. But Queen never broke up! Freddie making a solo was never a betrayal! What the heck? As if the life of Freddie bloody Mercury wasn't legendary enough, the writers had to throw in fictional events to fill up the runtime. This is disrespectful to Freddie's legacy and his fans, and at the same time misleading to the youth, into thinking he's a self-centered a-hole (well, more of a self-centered a-hole).<br/><br/>So much of the movie was revolved around Freddie's relationship with Mary Austin. Then all of a sudden, in one short scene Jim Hutton was introduced (with yet another unnecessary historical inaccuracy). And that was it. When Jim reappeared at the end of the movie, I almost forgot who he was. Jim was supposed to be the other love of Freddie's life, and the screenwriters made them fell in love in one short conversation, never to meet again until the end?<br/><br/>Then finally it comes to the music. There are times the editors cram in the songs for the sake of playing Queen's songs, without adding to the narrative of the movie. Heck, they re-enacted 70% of the whole Wembley concert, and yet you can easily find the original performance even on YouTube. If they had to invest that much runtime in one event, they'd better not skim over other important events... oh, wait. For a proper music biographical film, try ""Ray"" (2004).<br/><br/>The movie wasn't bad. Just not worth all the praise it's been getting."
"alvesmarceloalves-73751","3","208","342","3 November 2018"," Disappointing from start to finish
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" had everything to be a great biopic. The story of singer Freddie Mercury is rich and different from many who lived in show business and at the time of the emergence of stadium mega-bands in the twentieth century. By itself is exotic a guy who was born in Zanzibar, Africa, spent his childhood in India and then was forced to immigrate to England because of a revolution in his country, began to study design and suddenly joins with a quasi dentist, a quasi-physicist and an almost mechanical engineer to set up a band that would be a hit-maker in the '70s and' 80s.<br/><br/>But ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a lazy film that does not deliver even the basics, which would be a facetious, linear biopic based on historical moments of the band and its vocalist. It is a superficial, erratic work that adds nothing new or relevant to the biography of Queen or Freddie himself, one of the great voices in rock history.<br/><br/>The film, for example, touches on important issues that deserved to be further explored. Ready a few: why is Freddie's relationship with the family so cold and filled gaps? How was your childhood in Zanzibar and India, where, by the way, did he start playing piano? What kind of influence could he have suffered from this life in these two places? In what family, immigration influenced him or not to be what he became? Why deny the name and origins? These are questions that could have been asked and were not answered. In the film, his family is almost a tip in history.<br/><br/>Freddie's own relationship with his homosexuality, as well as his internal conflicts, lack and solitude are not properly treated / harnessed to try to understand who Freddie was. In short, it's a very little-delivered movie.<br/><br/>Of course, the production suffered several problems. Initially, Freddie would be played by Sacha Baron Cohen, but divergences with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, ended up dynamiting their participation. The place ended up being occupied by Rami Malek, known for his participation in the TV series ""Mr Robot"", but delivering a Freddie just acceptable and nothing remarkable.<br/><br/>After that, Bryan Singer himself was fired from production with two weeks to go. Direction this one that fell in the lap of Dexter Fletcher. But the film ended up having the same face of Singer's later work, with little depth in approaching characters and work short of expectations. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016) is an example.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" only lends itself to Queen's good songs, especially those that represented turning points in the band's career - Bohemian Rhapsody, Love of My Life, We Will Rock You, I Want to break free "","" We are the Champions "","" Another one bites the dust ""- to bring comfort to the heart of the viewer. It would have been more fruitful and cheaper, though, to listen to Queen's greatest hits on Spotify.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Anthony McCarten and Peter Morgan, who is responsible for such good films as ""The Last King of Scotland"" (2005), ""The Queen"" (2006), Frost / Nixon (2008) and ""Rush"" (2013) also sins by not providing basic information, putting Rock in Rio in a random time and space between 1975 and 1985 and creating bad dialogues. Nor does it seem that there was a band there creating great hits. And even these moments of creation of the musicians sound fake and soulless.<br/><br/>If Malek is far from striking, but does not compromise a gear that is flawed from beginning to end, the actors who make the other members of the band - always seen through the narrative with extreme generosity - are weak. Gwilym Lee (Brian May), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) is there to not compromise and be the sober pieces of Freddie Mercury's egotrip. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Paul Prenter (Allen Leech) is depicted as the villain in the film, responsible for the friction between Freddie and the rest of the band and even for his temporary separation.<br/><br/>So, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" goes through its 2h15min owing a lot. His most memorable moments turn out to be Malek's scene in the rain, when Freddie decides to leave the bottom of the pit to resume his career with Queen and the historical presentation in 1985 Live Aid, a key point for the band and Freddie, in a context where the singer had just learned that he had AIDS, a disease that would eventually contribute to his death six years later. But unfortunately all of Queen's timeline in the movie does not even hit 70% of what actually happened. Just as the viewer leaves the cinema without even knowing the name of a disc of the band.<br/><br/>Singer, by the way, chose to put a fake Queen's pocket show inside the film to portray the performance at Live Aid. I do not know if that was the best option. It seemed like a lazy option to me. For it was not a movie or a real Queen show, bringing noises everywhere.<br/><br/>So ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ends with the false feeling of coming out on top, when in fact it left more holes and a bit of entertainment in an absolutely expendable movie."

If you liked this film as a film, that's one thing. But, it is in no way, shape, nor form, the story of Queen.

","Bohemian Rhapsody was one of my most anticipated movies of 2018. It'd be quite strenuous to oblige to you'll quite how crucial the band, Queen, means to me and how much they've inveigled myself as the person I am today.<br/><br/>As a youngster, I had been raised upon the newest, hottest, artificially publicized pop and rap tracks that were continuously featured on the most vouged radio stations at the time, but in the corner of every auto-tuned, computerized feature I listened to, I would often get to occasionally tango to a Queen hit.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury and his band of bohemians are the quadruple-handed culprits who peeked my interest in soulfull, rock and roll music genres which conincidently, have shaped me into the ""Classic Rock-Head"" I am presently. Not only that, but the obscurities and lunacy of their lyrics-especially from hits like Bohemian Rhapsody-drove me into studying the arts of profoundly galvanized poetry/lyricism/literature.<br/><br/>Their music additionally, has helped me power through numerous of my most emotionally conflicting encounters I had brawled with during my time here on planet Earth. This iconic band has been persisting alongside my life ever since I was born, and that's something I can't declare about towards any other musician/musical group.<br/><br/>Now Here's My Consensus:<br/><br/>I am very, very tied on this film. On one hand, I thought Bohemian Rhapsody tributed the story of Freddie Mercury-for the most part-judiciously, mainly due to Rami Malek's immersive performance. Trust me, if Malek wasn't in this movie, Bohemian Rhapsody would've crumbled to ashes apace with some of the biggest catastrophes of 2018. As a depiction and honory of a musical legend, I was earnestly contented to witness the results.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I found this movie to be a pretty incoherent, potboiler mess of a product. The harshest way to submit this is, well, simply put, to say that Bohemian Rhapsody is fundamentally your average company manufactured, cop-out, strand of merchandise that was only fabricated for mainstream audiences who will unknowingly be able to eat up the same old ""Fast and the Furious: Family is Important"" blueprint that they've unconsciously seen billions of times.<br/><br/>However, this movie is dang LUCKY that they got Malek on the project and that they AT LEAST managed to make a glaringly enthralling, two-hour, sound-explosion of a music video.<br/><br/>The Main Core Killing This Movie: So, not gonna lie, Bohemian Rhapsody's script is somewhat atrocious in my humble opinion. This penmanship nearly lineaments everything I don't want in a ""based-on-a true-story"" feature. Whose bright idea was it to make a Marvel movie confided within a Queen movie, an arrangement which wasn't necessarily a construct that one should really consider for a freakin' Queen movie. Writers of the world, you don't have to throw in a satirical one-liner every twenty seconds in order to conquer your audiences attention!<br/><br/>And MY MY. Like, if you didn't think a movie could get more ""by-the-books"" clichÃ©-especially when diving in with all the family is valuable and family acceptance mortalities-than you sir or madam, were wrong. Screenwriters-I've been sounding so demanding recently, I apologize. I guess I'm just admittedly aggravated today-stop making your dilagoue feel as if it's sprouting out of the pages of a life coaching pamphlet! It's amateurish, honestly.<br/><br/>They just had to bend the story into little bits and pieces because they just had to insert their little chestnut morals and preaches, and their superfluous, forced humor. Why Hollywood? Why? (Probably because of production issues and what not. Oh. And Bryan Singer. Supposedly. And marketing. And money. Definitely money.)<br/><br/>The editing is a bit of a mess too. The sequence of events are muddled like crazy. You'll needa do some final cuts on this DARLING! And about 30% of the movie is just witnessing the band drag on from how they crafted one hit to how their next hit was created and so on so forth.<br/><br/>Did I just rant? Woah, I totally did. Hmm...let's lighten matters up, I suppose. I don't want to give off too many negative vibes about this mediocre biopic feature. There is virtue to be found.<br/><br/>But Rami Malek. This man carries this ENTIRE movie. Without him, Bohemian would like an ATOM BOMB. Or...not, like an Atom Bomb. Cause the song. Okay, I'll shut-up.<br/><br/>Malek's performance is honestly Oscar-nominee worthy. He embodies head to toe, Freddie Mercury's EVERYTHING. Even in the sentimental, dramatic moments, he kills (sorry), DESTROYS it-despite the poor script and dialogue he's often given. Additionally, his chemistry and the story behind his love life was intriguing enough to keep me locked on. The positive outcome of the film originates from this portrayal and this plotpoint that majorily has to do with who Freddie was and what he had to accord with during his times of fame.<br/><br/>I mildly relished Bohemian Rhapsody, and I was enthralled whenever we got to relive Mercury's tale, but...a Queen movie deserves light-years better than this. I'm possibly being a tad-bit generous offering Bohemian Rhapsody with this grade, but, I can't deny that I enjoyed and was cheery that I got to venture this film of messy yet, dapper flair...so: (Verdict: D+)"

"sessedup","4","87","140","7 November 2018"," Shallow portrayal of an epic rock band
","""What about the other band members?"" was a question I must have asked myself fifteen times throughout the film. The narrative follows Freddie Mercury, who is an irresistible badass, but completely flattened all the characters around him, including (but not limited to) all three band members, Mary, and all of the record label guys. Side note: RIP Mike Myers' career. He has fallen so far, playing a (fictional) douchey record exec with a questionable accent who passes on Bohemian Rhapsody because it's too ""out there"". That abysmal performance is emblematic of the entire film, which disappoints in almost every way.
Rami Malek portrays an emaciated, pitiable Mercury with a checkered past and some alluded-to sexual exploits. His primary qualm in life is that he's lonely and doesn't feel loved. Idk if this is actually true... The whole emotional scope of the film seems faked, and it upsets me that it's so hard to tell when this biopic is making facts up. What a waste of opportunity.<br/><br/>Not having grown up in the eighties, but still quite a big Queen fan, I did NOT get a sense of the impact of Queen's meteoric rise to fame, their overall influence on rock music, nor Freddie Mercury's absolute genius. Instead, the lead singer came off as a flamboyant diva who whipped out hits at convenient times; and the rest of the band mates were so 1-D that, literally, any fights between the friends were solved by... Wait for it... The power of rock n roll. Wtf?<br/><br/>The picture was, in reality, so much more complicated, with drug addiction, philandering and gobs of money influencing these musicians. Instead, people acted like a bunch of children reading an inflated do-gooder script. Why, Hollywood, WHY must you make a mockery of life as we know it? It seemed to try to avoid the trope of most musician biopics that play up the common problems for artists on the road, but in excluding those conflicts, the film became superficial and boring. It tried too hard, sadly.
Tbh this movie could have used more explicit drug use, gay sex, and WAY MORE LIVE QUEEN!! But I do have to give four stars for the delightful anesthetic, the wardrobe, andddd the ample use of Freddie Mercury's actual voice instead of Rami Malek's.

"vukaroo","5","51","79","8 November 2018"," Brought tears to my eyes, but not because it was good...
","Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody is easily, one of, if not, thee most anticipated films of 2018. I'm sure that even the most skeptic Queen fan was curious to see how this was going to be pulled off. Well, let's talk about that...<br/><br/>First of all, any and all praise should essentially go to Rami Malek. He's an excellent actor who obviously took the role of Freddie quite seriously. I won't lie, the casting director did a great job finding the rest of the band too, but it was more for their physical appearance rather than anything else; they were really just a static supporting cast. I mention the rest of the cast because this film was essentially supposed to be about Queen, and not exclusively about Freddie. Well, they missed the mark on that one, and it's an upsetting notion.<br/><br/>I had basically been following this project ever since the idea stage. I remember when Ben Whishaw was tied to the lead, but better yet, when Sacha Cohen was going to give it a go as our ill-fated frontman. Initially, Cohen was quite serious about the role, and proposed that the film be an R-rated, hardcore rendering of the singer's life. Knowing Cohen's outlandish approach to cinema, it may have been brilliant. Sadly, the members of Queen were not on the same page, and demanded a change in direction. I remember reading, that the band wanted it to be about their collective journey, up to the point of Live Aid. At the end, the only thing that was true to this ambition, was the classic 1985, Live Aid performance which was recreated quite well.<br/><br/>We all know how Freddie's journey ends, so there's no spoiler there, but for such a poignant figure in popular music of the 20th century, I expected so much more. Honestly, a breathtaking film about Freddie would take a hell of a lot, and very little of that ""lot"" was in this film. To loosely quote a review, Bohemian Rhapsody is like a Wikipedia bio of the band. The film references a collection of important moments in the band's career, but it feels all so superficial. Freddie is basically in every scene, and it becomes apparent that the film is about him, which again, was not supposed to be the original intent. The outcome is a basic overview, that just upsets the viewer, because you're left wanting more. It was the power of Queen's music and the notion of the tragedy that was bestowed upon Freddie Mercury, that brought tears to my eyes; however, if there's one reason alone to see this film, it's for Malek's professional dedication to the role, and for that reason alone I give it a 5. I will say, putting Malek aside, the missed opportunity of not green lighting the Cohen project was another major part of the tragedy.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is sadly superficial, and I can only hope that a respectful, yet honest depiction of Freddie's life hits the screen in some way, shape, or form in the future. If not, we always have their wonderful music, and that's truly the only thing that counts."
"thedemex","4","22","31","19 November 2019"," An insult to Queen
","It seems like if the people who spammed this page with 10's gave it a 10 because they enjoyed the music. I enjoyed the music also, but the end result was a poorly made film.<br/><br/>Before I get into the negatives, I want to talk about the positives of the film. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury was superb, and I was not disappointed about him winning best actor. The music was great, but that's because it's all by Queen.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it for the positives. Everything else in this film wasn't that great. Throughout the film, the editing choices were horrible, Every scene has so many cuts. There's some meme videos about Bohemian Rhapsody's editing on YouTube that I suggest you check out to see what I mean. A lot of Bohemian Rhapsody's editing was unnecessary, and I am still confused as to why the academy chose this film for best editing, when I believe it shouldn't even have been nominated at all.<br/><br/>There are also so many inconsistencies in this film with what actually happened in the life of Queen. While a fantasy biopic may not be a negative in some cases, such as the Elton John biopic ""Rocketman"", a lot of parts in the story just didn't feel real. It just seems too convenient at many times.<br/><br/>The movie also has a PG-13 rating, which was kind of frustrating since the true story of Freddie Mercury was not told. The film ""Rocketman"" is very similar to this film, except Rocketman is R-rated since it recognizes that Elton John's life is indeed R-rated. So is Freddie Mercury's rating, but instead a lot of the movie was just trying to tell the story while pandering to a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was very disappointing. It is not the worst movie ever made, but it is overrated and not good either. It just felt like an insult to the music Freddie Mercury and Queen made. The film was slightly entertaining, but I'm most likely not going to watch it ever again."
"Victorhgm643","1","69","111","11 November 2018"," Poorly written, Bohemian Rhapsody is a disappointment
","Sometimes there's a movie that really divides critics and audience. Sure a movie about one of the most iconic person of Rock (and music in general) should make Bohemian Rhapsody one of them, and it does. Honestly, the movie it's not bad -not totally- but it is messy. The structure is messy, the timeline is wrong and the characters are more selfaware than they need to be, but more on that later. It felt like they wanted to make a love letter to Queen, but the structure wasn't even nearly satisfactory as it should be, resulting in a Russian Roulette of cheap emotions and an unclear message by the end.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is good as Freddie Mercury, reproducing several peculiarities of the original artist, but for me his acting was more of a series of impressions (a caricature) then a true representation. Don't get me wrong, it's still very good and very unique, but I've seen another Biopic this year (First Man) and by comparing the protagonists, I feel that Gosling's Armstrong is more of a ""character"" then Malek's Freddie and I don't know whose fault it is. Anyway, great casting too, I honestly want to know how they rejuvenated Brian May and taught him to act so fast. But even with a cast almost identical to the original band, the movie restricted everyone so they could make Freddie the absolute main character.<br/><br/>This and other things are totally the screenplay's (and the people who wrote it) fault. And there's some Bryan Singer there too. The movie paints Freddie as a legend, a god from the first to the last frame, never letting us empathize with his character, his struggles or his wins. We're humans, the movie needs to humanize its protagonist so we can sympathize with him. The film even has a ""bad influence"" character so we could put all of Freddie's faults on him, what a shame. It seems like every single person involved with the band (except that one producer) was aware of what Queen means today. They're always convicted
that they would be successful, talking and acting this way, at least it's how the story shows us. The screenplay also manipulates time and events to fit the narrative created to the movie. Rock in Rio was in 1985 with a very well know Queen, not in '79. Freddie discovered he had AIDS in 1987 and definetely did not use it as ""plot point"" to empower the Live Aid performance, and he didn't was the first to go solo too, making an entire scene insincere. Propably one of the most poorly written scripts of the year.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know where it's totally Bryan Singer's fault or some kind of Studio's censorship, but this movie is flat in emotions. Everytime the band argues about something there is a miraculous riff that saves the scene and in the next one everything is alright, they have a new song to perform. Unfortunately, not even an inspired Rami Malek and the Live Aid performance reproduction (which was cool) could save the picture. Makes me wonder how Sacha Baron Cohen wanted to make it. Probably he wanted to make a true Biopic of Freddie's life, not just a stack of exposition scenes.Probably he wanted to make it right."
"mailaura3","10","102","169","7 November 2018"," Wow wow wow

"travishouze","5","38","58","4 November 2018"," ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" Doesn't Capture the Epicness Queen Deserves
","There are a few bands I look back and wished I had the opportunity to see perform live, and Queen is one of them. While I haven't yet journeyed into the deep cuts of their music, I did find myself impressed with what I head from Another One Bites the Dust and Under Pressure. So I was pretty excited to see a Queen biopic, but I found myself complaining about the same things I did about All Eyez on Me. It gets the performances and highlights, but severely lacks connective tissue.<br/><br/>Where the film excels is Rami Malek giving a very solid performance is Freddie Mercury and giving an extremely thrilling finale at their iconic Live Aid performance (which is worth the price of admission alone). The problem the film doesn't develop the other band members at all or even the creative process. And while the film addresses Freddie Mercury's private relationships with men, I feel the movie plays it almost entirely sexually driven and hedonistic with no real thread of intimacy.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody has some thrills, but ends up being a major disappointment for me as a whole. While it's great to hear Queen's songs on display, it gives little to no context and is quick to move on from the song before the chorus. I just wished the movie rocked as much as the movie did."

","For a movie that's supposed to be a biopic, there was far too much embellishments and alterations to the truth.

The movie was less about facts and more about creating a more dramatic fiction. In this hot mess, some people's names have been dragged through the mud when they actually did no wrong.<br/><br/>Greats sets and accurate costume designs are a small compensation for a corny movie that irrevelantly rewrites history under the guise of poor scripting and mediocre acting.<br/><br/>Hopefully the positive reviews are merely hype at its peak, and that people will look back on this movie in the future and realise it was all hot air.

","The film is probably OK from a music point of view, but is simply a disaster in filmmaking aspects. The editing is a mess. There are some scenes connected quite awkwardly, and the transition of the central figure Freddie is quite rigid. The character development is highly problematic as well. The supporting roles are flat and one-dimensional. The storytelling is too direct and takes a lot of shortcuts.

"raylynne-perez","9","101","170","24 October 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody brings it big time!
","Well, the moment we have all been waiting for has finally arrived with the release of the highly anticipated Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. So now just one question remains, was it worth the wait? Well, in my honest opinion, abso-freakin-lutely! This incredible story takes us on the journey of one of the most iconic rock bands of all time and gives us a look at not only the birth and life of the band but a peek behind the curtain into the life of one of music's biggest legends and Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury. From their humble beginnings playing college shows to their historic performance at 1985's Live Aid concert, Bohemian Rhapsody will take you on one hell of a rock n' roll ride.<br/><br/>Rami Malek takes on the role of Freddie Mercury with all the charm and swagger that the real man gave off. Never one to be ignored or denied Malek's Mercury is cocky and charming and just captivating to watch. Even through Freddie's highest highs and lowest lows he gives a fantastic performance. Many were worried that with the departure of Sacha Baron Cohen who was originally slated to play a much wilder and dark Mercury, that the film would gloss over Freddie's personal life, but honestly what we get from Malek's version of the film just feels tasteful and right. You don't need to see the binge drinking, drug use, and copious amounts of random sex to know that Freddie used all those things to fill a void in his own soul and it is heavily implied throughout the film without the audience having to attend every party. Instead, we get much more substance and story which just feels way more important. He is the happy-go-lucky frontman, one second and the tortured artist the next and Bohemian Rhapsody does a great job of making you really feel for this man and not just him, but the people around him whom his actions effect. You get a bit of an inside look at his relationship with Mary Austin played by Lucy Boyton (Sing Street). Their romance/friendship is both sweet and heartbreaking to see. I know many were worried this film would downplay his sexuality and instead focus on his relationship with Mary, and while the film does focus on this relationship with her, it definitely does not leave out his sexual exploits with men and his eventual relationship with Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker).<br/><br/>While many would like the sole focus of this film to be Freddie Mercury you can't leave out the rest of the band because, let's face it, with them there is no Queen. Freddie's bandmates bring a lot to this picture from the sarcastic and at times confrontational Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) to the band's voice of reason Brian May ( Gwilym Lee) to the quiet talent of John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello). These guys bring a lot to the table as Freddie's family, friends, and biggest support system. Despite all the over the top requests and ideas of their lead singer, these guys jump in with both feet to fuel the fire and bring us some of the greatest music rock has ever seen. It is pretty awesome to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I scored Bohemian Rhapsody with a solid A. This is an entertaining, fun, funny, and at times the heartbreaking film that definitely deserves your attention. Fans of Queen should breathe a sigh of relief because this is a solid movie. So head to the box office and buckle up for one hell of a ride with this rock royalty and allow yourself to be taken away and inspired with Bohemian Rhapsody.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody hits theaters everywhere November 2nd."

"betsy_wilkinson","10","93","156","5 November 2018"," A reminder --- Don't always rely on the critics when selecting a movie to see
","My friends and I had unexpected free time and decided to see a movie. We had seen previews for Bohemian Rhapsody several times at the theatres, and when debating what movie to see, I suggested BR. My friends were so/so but went along with the recommendation. They came away - blown away. No one expected to be so captivated by this movie. We all like Queen music, but not one of us had ever seen them live. We realized right away that the music of Queen is timeless. There is not a winning Sports Team that at some point doesn't play or have a slide show prepared to ""We Are The Champions."" People ask if this is a documentary. It is more than a documentary. It is a brilliantly entertainimng story about the creation and rise to fame of one of the greatest bands of all time. I thought I knew the story, but I had so many missing parts that this story brilliantly unfolds. The reason why Freddie Mercury had such a big range was finally made clear to me. His coming out story is both tough, hard and poignant at the same time.
The final scene is a magnificent walk down memory lane for many of us about a time when the world was united in the cause of charity and helping the downtrodden, a subtle reminder of how far we have strayed from being a Global, caring village. That scene is epic and should go down as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.
The sign of a truly great movie is the one that you were so/so about seeing, and came away wanting to get right back into line and see it again."

The amount of studying and research these young actors must have did is clearly testament to their performance in this phenomenal story of the greatest band ever to grace the earth.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film, all I can say is that a certain record producer must be gutted or certainly would have been.

"ccorral419","9","97","167","23 October 2018"," Relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!
","Director Bryan Singer (""X-Men"" series) brings the life of Queen's frontman Freddy Mercury (Rami Malek ""Mr. Robot"" TV) and the band to the big screen with a vengeance. With screenplay by Anthony McCarten (""The Theory of Everything"") and story by McCarten and Peter Morgan (Writer, Producer, Actor), the film chronicles the mates climb to music notoriety, highlighting Freddy's frontman antics, the now notorious 1985 ""Live Aide"" concert performance, and of course the death of Freddy to Aids in 1991. Malek, who is unpleasantly overly made up to mimic Freddy's unique jaw line, teeth and hair, is plausible as the driven young British Zanzibar vocalist Farrokh (his given name). As the mature Freddy, he's given all the outrageous costumes (by Julian Day) and Freddy's dances moves, and pulls them off with ease, even though his lip-syncing is over the top at times. What Director Singer does well here, is provide backstory to the raise and demise of Mercury, including a look into his personal family dynamics, his little know love affair to Mary (Lucy Boynton ""Murder on the Orient Express""), who graciously sticks by him through his ups and downs, and a look at the effect Freddy's significant lovers Paul Prenter (Allen Leech ""Downton Abbey"" TV) and Jim Hutton (Aaron Mccosker ""The Astronaut Wives Club"" TV) had on his life, both who give moving subtle glimpses into Freddy's behind the glamour world. To McCarten and Morgan's credit, they provide an in-depth look at Queen's band members bassist John Deacan (Joseph Mazzello ""The Cure""), drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy ""X-Men: Apocalypse"") and guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee ""Jamestown"" TV), demonstrating that the band was truly comprised of all four guys. As with most music oriented bio-pics, the film is packed with all the music and excitement one expects from Queen, and it's loud and powerful. Mike Meyers (""SNL"") has a nice cameo as Queen's EMI chief Ray Forster - although I think I saw and heard ""Austin Powers"" in his performance. And, Aidan Gillen (""Game of Thrones"") does a nice job as the guys music manager John Reid. Only a fool would pan this film, so check it out for yourself, and relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!"

"vaughanbex","7","34","54","12 November 2018"," Enjoyable but thin on substance
","The music is great, Remi's performance was amazing, and the recreation of the Live Aid show was exhilarating to watch, but I have two issues with the movie. One, it was not really a biopic on the band, because we dont get any background on the other band members besides Freddie Mercury. They mention wives and kids, but we never see them or find out anything about them. We don't get any info on the other band member's lives when the band started, like we did with Freddie, other than the mention of ""dentist"" and ""neurophysicist"".<br/><br/>The second problem is that Freddie's issues seem to happen and then resolve so quickly they are glossed over. Freddie's father is clearly not ok with his lifestyle but suddenly seems proud of him and hugs him as he's headed out the door to perform at Live Aid, as if everything is ok now. His drug and alcohol problem doesn't seem to be such a problem other than he shows up late for rehearsal and the other guys are annoyed. There are a lot of things that should have been covered that likely just couldn't have fit in a typical movie length production, but there are so many good stories that weren't included.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's completely worth seeing, the music is great, and Remi WAS Freddie Mercury. The performance and concert scenes were creatively well-shot and fun to watch. Just wish that more of the rock and roll lifestyle and history of the band could have been built into the story."
"letande","1","183","334","3 November 2018"," A crime against Freddie and his memory.
","First of all, I didn't really want to go. After all that happened with this movie and after everything that Queen members said, I expected it to be bad. Very, very bad. But then I saw all those positive reviews and thought ""Hey! Maybe it's actually good? I mean, miracles happen from time to time and I don't want to miss something good based on something as epic as Queen"". So, I paid for a ticket. I was a fool...<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is exactly as I expected it to be. Even worse, actually. And the biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the band didn't want it to be a movie about Freddie. I mean, sure, they're all very talented musicians and it's probably painful to live their lives in Freddie's shadow, even while pretending that the band still exists without him. No matter what they do, the people think ""Freddie"". So, sure, I can see WHY they didn't want this movie to be all about him. The problem is... there was no other way. The story of Queen is the story of Freddie Mercury. Who, aside from many other things, was a very complicated person. And the only way to make a movie about Queen and Freddie is to focus on Freddie's inner world. The same way that the First Man focused on Neil Armstrong. Remember how people said a lot of bad things about that movie just because it didn't focus on the American flag? But that was exactly why the First Man was so good. It wasn't yet another movie about American heroes in space. It was a movie... about... Neil... Armstrong. Bohemian Rhapsody does exactly the opposite. It turns Freddie into another character of the show. One of the many. And it's one of the things that pretty much ruin the movie.<br/><br/>Like I said, Freddie was a complicated person. A true artist with the unique soul. And without even trying to look deeper into his soul, this movie makes him... well... a freak. Personally, I consider it a crime. Not because I'm one of those crazy fans, but because he deserved more... WAY more than what they did to him in this movie. And it's not about Rami Malek, no. The man is quite good and I hope that this movie will be good for his career. The problem is - writing sucks. Hard. We see Freddie saying and doing things, but we don't have a slightest idea about why. WHY does he do all that? How does he feel? Remember Sully? The movie about Capt. Chesley Sullenberger? Remember what Tom Hanks did there? Sully didn't have any action scenes, the landing sequence was quite short too. The whole movie was about Tom Hanks showing Capt. Sullenberger's feelings in his eyes. Clint Eastwood directed it in a way that we didn't even need words there. Tom Hanks' eyes and the right directing were enough. Bohemian Rhapsody? Nothing like that.<br/><br/>Thanks to an awful writing and the pressure from the actual band, it turned out to be a movie about a group of cool and friendly guys and a freak with a superiority complex who were unable to do the things in a normal way. Meaning, feelings, thoughts, emotions... this movie doesn't have anything of that. It aims for a single thing - a bright and exciting picture. Something that is FUN to watch. A bright picture that shows us funny scenes of how famous songs were made, Freddie saying funny and shocking things to people, etc. Even the gay part is surprisingly dull and shallow. One kiss here, one hug there... No feelings involved.<br/><br/>To make things worse, even though the movie is pretty straightforward, it's full of lies. Very convincing lies that make the band look even more cool. There are characters that weren't even based on actual people, there are scenes that weren't even based on actual events, etc, etc, etc. As the result, the movie feels like a convincing something that was ordered by Brian May and Co to make them look better. And that's exactly why the one should never ever involve the actual people in biopics about them. They'll want things done in their way. And it'll destroy any attempt to make something real. Brian and Co wanted a colorful yet shallow movie full of fiction, in which the cool British guys make a fool out of the EMI executive, who never ever existed in real life, they've got it. Bohemian Rhapsody is sure bright, colorful, it looks amazing, actors are quite good, even though many of them are TV actors, the concerts look shockingly close to the real deal, and yet, it's an awful movie. And the final scene (which is Live Aid, by the way, don't expect any Innuendo depression in this movie) is a nice example why. They've literally re-created Queen's Live Aid performance. They had a lot of time for a long and very expensive Live Aid cosplay. And yet... they didn't have enough time to show us Freddie's complicated soul. I call it a failure. But again, I hope it makes Brian and Co feel better about their lives. Clearly, it's the true goal here."

","Cool movie for sure, I enjoyed it a lot. However, I don't think it should be given 10/10s because it wasnt THAT good. I'll explain why, going through the main different things that made the film:<br/><br/>Music (11/10)
Queen rocks. Every song was great.<br/><br/>Story/characters (7/10)
At the beginning it was very clunky, not having a main goal or motivation. Also it hopped forwards in time a lot, which can sometimes work in movies, but not to the extent they did it in this one. It just felt rushed. Also a lot of the scenes werent really anything more than just showing us how some of the songs were made, which is interesting, just not relevant to the story. However, later the story gained a driving force as it settled into the time period just before Live Aid. Before, I would say the story was a 5/10 stars, but by the end it probably reached around 9/10, a really solid film by the end. Conflict, important character motivations, and interesting drama were only introduced about halfway into the film. I wish they just started the film then and cut out the beginning.<br/><br/>Acting (9/10)
Top notch, of course. The only thing I would say was negative for this was that Malek's acting at the start was a bit shaky, but improved greatly by the halfway point in the film. Perhaps this factor also led to me disliking the start of the movie. All the supporting characters were great as well as Malek. I especially liked the actor who played Brian May, I thought he was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>Cinematography (6/10)
Nothing special. Just your average cinematography.<br/><br/>Editing (5/10)
This really was the worst element of the film in my opinion. The editing at the beginning of the film was a bit clunky, distracting from the story. My least favorite part was the artificial blurring, especially in the interviewing scene. I assume this was done in editing, not in cinematography, because it looked so unnatural. It was extremely distracting. I think it was meant to make the scene disorienting, but all it did was make me less invested in the movie, because the effect was so annoying.<br/><br/>Overall:
38/50 = 7.6/10"

EVERYONE KNOWS the kind of life Freddy Mercury lived and the things he did, this is a fanciful attempt by the other members of Queen, all of whom are largely inconsequential in comparison to Freddy, to save face and present a pleasant PG13 fiction about them.

"TheMovieDiorama","6","60","103","29 October 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody isn't the kingly biopic of Queen that it thinks it is.
","Possibly the most frustrating cinema experience I've had all year. Why? Squandered potential. It's Queen. Quite possibly the biggest rock band to ever exist. Influential to millions. Idolised by thousands. The risks they took with their musicality and stage appearances were aspirational. And yet here we have a biopic that, whilst undoubtedly entertaining, just doesn't know what it wants to be. Chronicling the formation of Queen, Freddie Mercury rises to fame as their lead singer and soon starts clashing with the other band members. Malek singlehandedly saved this film. His performance was both transformative and engrossing, occasionally fully embodying Mercury's eccentric personality. The exaggerated false teeth did initially distract me, but these are diminished once the story starts to unfold. The other members were also well acted and certainly looked the part, particularly with the 70s hair styles. The whole plot intelligently culminates to the infamous Live Aid performance that shot Queen's reputation to stratospheric heights, which evidently is the greatest segment of this biopic. It allowed the music to come through and force Mercury's emotions to be conveyed through auditory senses. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is deservedly one of the greatest songs of all time, and just the Live Aid performance alone showed its importance to Mercury and the band. It wants you to sing along, it wants you to tap your feet to the beat. It's infectious. It will leave you wanting to listen to their other fantastic songs. The development beforehand was well paced, nuanced and enjoyable to watch. However, there are two huge detriments to this biopic that lead to an underwhelming result. Bryan Singer's direction and McCarten's screenplay.<br/><br/>Singer is unsure what angle to use to portray Mercury. He had a big career, with personal failures equalling his musical successes. Yet Singer attempts to balance the narrative with Mercury's life and what is essentially Queen's greatest hits. The two do not marinate seamlessly. Is it a Queen tribute? Or a Freddie Mercury biopic? Can it be both? Yes it can. But this is not substantial enough. The band has so much history and acute details that were glossed over in this film, ultimately feeling rushed. The time shifts range from a month to five years. Singer attempts to tackle too much, and it shows. In the first twenty minutes, they've already conceived their first album! That's ludicrous. Then we come to the screenplay. I'm sure Brian May and Roger Taylor's inclusion in this production somewhat hindered the telling of the band's history. It's completely sanitised. The often comedic dialogue juxtaposes the tonal shift of Mercury's eventual loneliness and battle with AIDS. There is literally a scene of Mercury contemplating the idea of conceptualising a solo career, only for the proceeding scene to joyfully create 'Another One Bites The Dust'. The script tries too hard at being a crowd pleaser, that the more important issues are diluted and consequently forms a tonal shift. Sure it allows Malek to show off his acting ability, but at what cost? There's no emotional resonance. Nothing feels memorable. It's a shame, as this could've been an excellent biopic. However the mediocre directing and script really hindered the emotional investment required to make this a successful trip down memory lane. It's a biopic that general audiences will enjoy, it's just not the biopic I wanted."

","I wanted to love this movie I really did. I was blown away by the first scene of the film and Malik's likeness to Mercury. Sadly, after this I grew even more disappointed. The way they have written this is so formulaic and boring unlike Queen's ethos. The whole thing just seemed like a Hollywood adaptation to the story and a money making opportunity.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury was a fascinating character and to try to understand him we had to have an insight into the way he lived his life. Unfortunately with the age rating of the film there's no way they could do that. They've exchanged reality for a Family-friendly movie and it really misses the mark."
"ajmiff","10","66","115","27 October 2018"," Malek is brilliant!
","I've been excited to see this for months. Finally got to see it and I was not disappointed. Malek was outstanding as Freddie. I sang along to all of the songs and cried at a few of the sad bits. I'm rating this 10/10 I don't think you will see a better film about Freddie Mercury any time soon."

","As a queen can I went in with high expectations of this movie and it is beautifuly shot. Rami is superb as Freddie and catches those little Freddie nuances. I thought the chap who played Brian had it down to a tee also. The guy playing deacy though not given lots of lines had him just right too.
I was hoping for a bit more of the Freddie 80s NY gay clubs that he used to frequent regularly. But as I spotted Freddie's sister at the premiere then it's obviously got the family blessing and so I can see why that's not a major part of the film. It's very difficult to span the 15 years in a couple of hours and there where a few fast forwards. I would have liked to have seen some of the years up to Freddie's death as I know the band became very close indeed. But maybe that's something the band didn't want to explore. I did come out if the cinema with a lump in my throat. One of the clear things to take from the film and real life is Freddie's life long love for Mary Austin. He must have been a very conflicted soul."

","Loved the movie, but then looked up what was factual and what wasn't, and learned much of what was depicted in the movie never happened. I found this really surprising because two members of Queen were involved in making the movie, so I'm surmising perhaps they needed to agree to altering/making up events in order to get this movie made. I realize movies need to move along and there are also time constraints in telling a story, but (although not billed as a documentary) I'd have much preferred a more accurate (rather than made up) version of many events of Freddie's life.<br/><br/>Love Rami's performance! Big, big fan. So enjoy him on Mr. Robot. He absolutely knocked it out of the park with this performance. Other cast members were all excellent as well. It really felt like one was actually watching Queen on the screen, rather than actors. That's how believable they were! Immensely entertaining script although, again, I just wish they had told true, factually accurate stories rather than making several up.<br/><br/>Can't believe how they recreated both the Live Aid venue, as well as the performance to a T. That was really mind blowing, but really wish they had included all the songs Queen performed at Live Aid. Believe me, no one in the theatre would have complained about the length of the movie if they had.<br/><br/>Audience clapped at the end to show their appreciation. It was pretty awesome, but then disappointing to then learn so many events depicted in the movie either never happened or happened in a completely different way...<br/><br/>STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPENED OR HAPPENED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY.<br/><br/>Freddie was already living with the guys in the band before he became a member. He didn't meet them for the first time after a performance in a club.<br/><br/>Freddie didn't meet Mary the night he met the band.<br/><br/>The character of Mike Meyers never existed. Thus, the entire very amusing scene depicted in his office with the band never happened.<br/><br/>Freddie never quit the band. The band mutually decided to take a break and then mutually decided shortly thereafter to resume recording and touring.<br/><br/>Freddie did not reveal to the band his AIDS status shortly after getting back together, just prior to the LIVE AID concert. He disclosed it later on.<br/><br/>The band actually toured for a few months prior to LIVE AID, while in the movie it was depicted as LIVE AID was to be their very first performance together again as a group and they were concerned about how their performance would be since they had supposedly JUST gotten back together and felt they might be rusty.<br/><br/>Freddie didn't meet his eventual male companion the way it was depicted in the movie.<br/><br/>Freddie was bi-sexual and had encounters with other women besides Mary, though the film dipicted Mary as the only female he had ever had a sexual relationship with.<br/><br/>The film chose not to give a realistic portrayal as to the extent of drug/alcohol/sex fueled life Freddie led - though that part didn't really bother me at all.<br/><br/>These are just a few instances of made up scenarios that never happened as dipicted in the movie as having occurred. It seems it would have been very easy to more accurately tell Freddie's story and still retain the entertainment element."
"casagrandicooper","5","15","22","8 November 2018"," Historical inaccuracies spoilt an ok movie
","I like the music of Queen. I was hoping to see a biopic and learn something about them; especially seeing that Taylor and May are behind this. Unfortunately, like in art, truth has been sacrificed for image. What we have is the sanitised version I guess they would have us believe. Problem is, we were there. It did not happen they way they were telling us. This film, then, screws with your mind, and leaves you wondering if what you know is true actually was how you remember things. (And thanks to proper research, history vastly outweighs this version of truth.) But what is truth? Queen are awesome. Mercury is a legend. The music will live on. Perhaps for musical entertainment and experience, they should have made ""We Will Rock You"", and stuck in a rockumentary as an extra on the Blu-Ray. I guess ""management"" are happy with the truth they are trying to sell us; but as an audience member who lived through those times, it's leaves you slightly dazed, slightly confused, and slightly unsatisfied. Get acting, costumes and production values though; cast and crew certainly gave 100%."

Unbelievable how true to life looking the rest of the band was.

"Slobberman","5","24","38","7 November 2018"," Disappointing
","Disappointment. That's the word floating through my head after watching this movie. As a casual Queen listener I wasn't very familiar with the band members or with Freddie in particular, except for the obvious - that Freddie was a flamboyant performer, was gay and died of Aids. And after watching this movie I can't say I now know a lot more about Freddie than just that. Yes, I do know now that Freddie actually had a girlfriend before coming out of the closet and that he was a very lonely man - something portrayed very good in this movie. But there is just not a lot of depth in the character. And don't even get me started on any of the other band members. I feel like I only got to know their names.<br/><br/>This movie just jumps from one significant moment to the other. Oh, now Queen is recording this popular song. Oh now Queen is recording that popular song. Oh, now Freddie is suddenly gay because he looked a trucker straight in the eyes. There's just not a lot of story going on. It all feels like fan-service. And that's the conflicting thing about this movie. I did enjoy watching it, but looking back I realized that that's mainly because of the killer soundtrack. And to me, that's just not enough to make a good film. I also felt like the editing was a bit over the top at times. When showing just regular conversations there were cuts every second, which is just annoying.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the soundtrack isn't the only good thing about this movie though. There's some cool camera movements, it has some humor and Rami Malek is great as Freddie. His costumes were as crazy as you would expect. My favorite part of the movie however is the final Live Aid performance. It's acted great, the music is fantastic and at times it's even emotional. The fake crowd was a bit distracting though. But even though it was my favorite part, I can't stop thinking about how it was also kind of unnecessary, which may sound strange. I mean, if I wanted to see the Live Aid performance I would just look it up on the internet and watch the real thing. The filmmakers could have used those extra 15 or so minutes to actually create characters and an engaging story. It's a shame, because now were left with an empty shell of a movie. A movie with potential, but a bad execution. Queen deserves better."

"lyascheshyn","10","40","68","5 November 2018"," This Is Not A Documentary!
","The critics were wrong about Bohemian Rhapsody the song and once again they're flat out wrong about the movie.<br/><br/>You want an in-depth look at Freddie Mercury's life you can go on YouTube and find tons of them. If you want a movie that will make you feel good and remind you why Queen is one of the greatest bands in the 21st century then go see this movie.<br/><br/>Are there facts that have been presented out of context and embellished for dramatic purpose? Yes absolutely.
For example: 1) Freddie Mercury wasn't diagnosed with HIV until 1987. It is widely believed that Mercury acquired the HIV virus in 1981 or 1982 but was not physically tested and subsequently diagnosed with the virus until early 1987. 2) Freddie Mercury met his partner Jim Hutton at a club, not while Hutton was working at one of Mercury's lavish house parties. 3) We Will Rock You was not written in the early 80's but rather in 1977. 4) Freddie Mercury did not come out to his parents on the day of Live Aid. 5) Live Aid was not the first time the band had performed together on stage in years. In fact Queen had been on tour for a large part of '84 and early '85. 6) Freddie Mercury was not the first member of Queen to break off and do his own solo project, that distinction belongs to Roger Taylor.<br/><br/>There are many additional inaccuracies to be found but it feels like they're made to service the film's overall run-time which is already over 2hrs. The movie doesn't pretend to be a note for note recreation of the band member's lives but rather a celebration of Queen (Freddie Mercury in particular), their humble beginnings and their meteoric rise to success. Most of all, the movie is a celebration of their brilliant music.<br/><br/>You want to be entertained and come out of the theatre feeling happy and humming Queen songs? Go see this movie. If you want deeper insight into the personal life of Freddie Mercury or an accurate time line of Queen's many accomplishments, watch a documentary.<br/><br/>I can promise you this though, I've seen just about every available documentary that's been released on Queen, some of them several times and none of them will make you smile, laugh, cry and sing the way this movie does. It truly is an amazing film."

I Went to see them at Wembley Stadium for their 'Its a Kind Of Magic' tour and that blew me away and this movie did the same to me.<br/><br/>I wont go over the entire synopsis like others seem to do but just give the review... The film is a Biopic of the Band Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury and it gets it right. The story looks after itself and the humour and drama lead on from that. I had tears several times as it reminded me of an era in my life where Aids was in the headlines a lot. The laughs are good and this is seen throughout. The people starring as the band are incredibly similar in looks and by the end of the film i had forgot that they were not the real band.<br/><br/>overall the music was great, the acting was very good and the story well acted out to facts. i gave this title a 10 but it would deserve higher. if you can go see this film it has made a wowie of an impact for me."

Don't go into this thinking that you're going to come away with an accurate biographical story of a musician whose life was cut far too short. The timelines don't mesh with what really happened or in the proper chronological order but that doesn't take away from what is a good if toned down storyline. The music is the central theme as much as Freddie and they do a great job with it.

It can be a bit maudlin, and some of the characters are one dimensional but it matters not. Malek's performance is a tour de force of acting, and if you let yourself you simply get carried along with the energy.

","The former Twilight Breaking Dawn actor did an okay job of performing as Freddie. I imagine in was difficult to find someone who resembled him in person as well as characteristics. However, the actor did a PHENOMENAL job lip-synching the original recordings, which the producers chose to use-good call on that! I wish the researchers would have spent more time coming up with widely UNKNOWN information about Freddie Mercury instead of basing the movie on widely known information about his life. I did not see any credits for information going to Freddie's parents, sister, or Mary Austin. Maybe interviews with those critical people from Freddie's life would have added information that was not already widely known. Unless I missed something, the movie seem to have been based on Freddie's relatiofnship with Mary Austin with just a little bit of information about his career during the years of his relationship with her. I would've liked to have seen more content based on his musical genius as opposed to his personal relationships. To top it all off the end of the movie ended with the 1985 LiveAid concert, which was six years before his death. Why did they not continue the movie through to the end of his life? The original videos of live concert cuts during the ending credits for me was the most moving part of the film-I'm glad the producers chose to use flattering footage in the end.

The critics and purists might want to compare every little detail and find flaws, but I think this movie captured the life and heart of Freddie Mercury and Queen, celebrating their music, determination, perseverance and innovation and will certainly give you goose bumps.

Everything about the film is carefully and beautifully done - 'issues' are touched on but not politicised or exploited which makes the appeal of this film broad - be prepared to fall in love with Queen and this era of rock music all over again."

","I went with slightly mixed feelings because of the critics' reviews but they were WRONG! This is a brilliant film and the 2+ hours just flew by. Superb acting from all. To find people who look like Queen and can also act was a stroke of good luck. Of course, it goes without saying that the music was spinetinglingly amazing and I think Marc Martel should get greater recognition for his Freddie vocals. I know his voice well and it mirrors Freddie's so accurately. Some have pointed out that the time line isn't strictly accurate but I can easily forgive that. Best entertainment for a long time."

There is the mind-blowing turn of Malek's performance, followed by the rest of the band who resemble so closely the original Queen it is downright spooky. Then the music. The music. The music.

","As a Queen fan and someone who had been looking forward to this movie since it was first announced, Bohemian Rhapsody blew my expectations away!<br/><br/>I will say right of the bat that the movie is not 100% historically accurate, but most biopic movies aren't so this really didn't bother me all that much. Rami Malek was amazing and easily deserves the Oscar for Best Actor this year! I honestly forgot that I was watching an actor play Freddie. The concert and music scenes were fantastically directed and I honestly felt like I was there at a real concert, particulary during the Live Aid scene at the end. Although the movie was a lot of fun, I really liked how it also wasn't afraid to cover the darker and more unpleasant parts of Freddie's life as well in the second half which made it a much more intriguing and emotional film than I could have been.<br/><br/>This is easily my favorite movie of the year (although as a Queen fan I'm probably a bit biased). Everything from the acting, directing, and music is fantastic and Malek easily deserves an Oscar for his performance as Freddie!"
"nanoulis7","10","3","3","8 January 2019"," I'm laughing out loud while reading the critic reviews
","This movie is outstanding, in Greece we call these movies musicals not biopics, the reason why we do that is to express the joy that you get when you listen to so many wonderful songs in a movie.
Another great musical that I saw is A Star is Born and of course the comparison between them is unavoidable, the movies aired at the cinemas almost together.
I really loved both films but what Rami Malek did with Freddy Mercury's act is worth even more than an Oscar price.
I sensed the Fabulous life of Freddy, I almost smelled the air in the room where Freddy wrote his songs. I can't describe it with words.
I am a die hard fan of the Queen band and I really couldn't care less about the differences on Freddy's real life and what is shown in the film. I just wanted that show, that brilliant show!!!"

"Paul-Corio","8","3","3","7 January 2019"," Entertaining and Nostalgic
","If like me you are of a certain age and remember Queen in their heyday and Live Aid, BoRhap is a nostalgic and sentimental film.<br/><br/>Visually, it captures the very essence of the 70s and 80s. Also the soundtrack marking the various time points keeps the pace steady and interesting. Remi Malik is brilliant as Freddie Mercury, although his performance is more of an impression rather than an in-depth character portrayal, however he nails it with aplomb.<br/><br/>Technically there are some faults. With the emphasis very much on Malik as Mercury, the rest of the cast doesn't really have a great deal to do. Likewise, the glossy nature of the story skims over the darker parts of Freddie Mercury's lifestyle, excesses and later battle with Aids and so lacks a real dramatic punch. Plus there is a clumsy and tenuous cameo from Mike Meyers which gladly is over quiet quickly.<br/><br/>The finale is quiet simply nothing short of spectacular and really brought back some very vivid memories and of course highlights what a sad loss Freddie Mercury was when he was taken so young.<br/><br/>Over all though BoRhap's flaws are far outweighed by its entertainment factor and makes for a good watch!"

","Well firstly, I must say the last time I cried this hard during a movie was probably during Titanic. However in my opinion not only this movies conveys such string emotions but tells a story, I might add a great and beautiful one. I didn't go in hoping to learn some obsure detail about Freddie Mercury, I came to have a good time and this movie did a great job doing just that. Secondly it had been years since I had seen this many people at my local movie theatre, not only for the first or second screening but as of now (two months later) every screening only has an average of 50 seats empty out of 260 which never fails to amaze me."

","I had been wanting to see the movie for a while and I heard a lot of different opinions, both positive and negative. I eventually went to see the movie with a friend who is a big Queen fan.
I was very enthusiastic about the movie. Not because I love Queen so much, I do love them, but I did not know that much about them. Maybe that was also a reason I was easier entertained than my friend who couldn't help but notice some small inconsistencies in the movie. Of course, it is very difficult to put Freddie's whole life plus Queen's career in only a 2-hour movie but I think they did a great job. What I find most important in a movie is that I have to be able to become almost part of the story. I love to really get into a movie so much, that I almost forget it's a movie. In this movie, they did an amazing job in bringing Freddie's fears and struggles to live. Freddie's loneliness in the movie was portrayed really strongly. It also helps that Rami's acting was incredibly good. To me, it would be scary to play such a legend because you know you will never be able to completely imitate him and I would be afraid that I would not do justice to Freddie's legacy. So I think it is brave that he did it and although his motoristics are not perfect, I thought it was really good. Sometimes I forgot I was looking at an actor and not Freddie himself. He definitely put a lot of passion in his role."

I'd also heard something about Byan Singer being sacked last year meaning they had to get someone in to the rescue the movie. However everyone I met and trusted said nothing but positive things. Having now seen the movie I have to say that I really enjoyed it. The acting by Rami was fantastic and I knew little about this chap. I thought he was a Brit. This is a star turn by a Californian actor... well done. Although I love the music I can't say that I knew too much about Queen so I enjoyed watching their journey to stardom unfold.

"mikayakatnt","5","5","6","10 March 2020"," *Spoilers & Plotholes
","What's with music biopic movies that never makes them good?<br/><br/>Too many years to squeeze in, I guess.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody. Rami Malek gives us a convincing Freddie Mercury performance. Music is good and humor is there. Timeline of some events was changed for theatrical effect.<br/><br/>Good.<br/><br/>But the movie never feels that any of the characters have the struggle to overcome. Freddie Mercury joins the band 15 minutes in and he's an instant celebrity. The rest of the movie is about his celebrity status with his band in the background.<br/><br/>Where is the conflict?<br/><br/>I'm sure that the longest argument in the movie lasts only 2 minutes before they give in to Freddie Mercury. He resolves a long issue with his parents with a quick introduction of his boyfriend. His antagonist gives him up with ease. Everyone, in the end, agrees with Freddie.<br/><br/>The band never faces a real crisis and everyone gets back together without fighting. Exciting.<br/><br/>Even the antagonist doesn't give a convincing performance. His evolution is not understood or shown in the movie.<br/><br/>The ending is ok but doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>2.5/5. I know these music biopics are never good but I keep watching them. Am I a sucker for pain?"
"trisha-j","10","5","6","1 July 2019"," There's something the haters haven't considered...
","For those of you who were Queen fans and didn't like Bo Rhap because of the factual inaccuracies, you have to realize that this movie wasn't made just for you. This movie was made to bring the story of Freddie, but mostly Queen's outstanding music, to every single generation in the world, simultaneously. For some, it brought on nostalgia, while for others it was completely new territory or even brought on a new appreciation for the band. Other than We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions playing at sports games, the younger generations have likely never heard of Queen/their music, so they wouldn't even be aware of any factual inaccuracies, and I doubt they would care much if they found out. (This is the case for me. I'd heard and loved about 6 Queen songs throughout my childhood but didn't know anything about the band, let alone that all those songs came from the same band. I was born a month before Freddie died in 1991, and for my entire life I'd never even heard of his name...until I saw this movie.)<br/><br/>Yes, some of Bo Rhap's content could've been handled differently, especially regarding Freddie's sexuality, but 1) this isn't a documentary, it is a Hollywood movie that was intended to be appropriate & enjoyable for all audiences and 2) at the end of the day, the thing that will always keep legendary bands like Queen alive is the timeless, universal MUSIC. Music has a beautiful way of uniting people and bridging the gap between people from all walks of life, and this movie managed to do that perfectly. When Queen is banging out We Will Rock You at Madison Square Garden or We Are the Champions at Live Aid and you have chills and you feel like you're in the audience, it reinforces the feeling that we can all feel a part of something bigger than ourselves, and reminds you exactly why those men were geniuses.<br/><br/>I understand why this movie was made to focus on Freddie more as a musician rather than a promiscuous guy who liked partying and cocaine. What good would that stuff have really done other than glorify that kind of lifestyle? Take Rocketman as a good comparison... that movie is saturated with an overzealous amount of both glam and pain/addiction, and it ultimately fails to figure out its tone. The darker side of it just feels so incredibly overdone and I came out of it knowing nothing more about Elton John other than him having a tough childhood and becoming an addict, which we've already come to the conclusion is a very ""tired biopic cliche"", as many have said. It didn't move me or turn me into a fan of him. Bo Rhap gave us enough information about Freddie's struggles in order to sympathize with him, but it wasn't aggressively thrown in our faces in a way that distracted us from the fact that the reason we even know about all these famous people is because of their music. That is the thing that made us fans and will keep us fans. Also, let's not forget that Freddie was an extremely private person, and his bandmates even said that after 20 years with him, he was still such a mystery to them. Therefore, diving deep into his sleazy lifestyle without much background info on why he did the things he did (i.e wounds from childhood) would've been useless and gratuitous.<br/><br/>As for Rami, he was incredible as Freddie and 100% deserving of his Oscar! Man..he REALLY did his homework! I really can't understand why the Rocketman lovers who enjoyed Taron Egerton's ""version of Elton John"" feel compelled to tear Rami down for what they say was ""Rami impersonating Freddie"". Freddie was a very unique man with a very unique look, speaking style, mannerisms, and idiosyncrasies, especially regarding his teeth and lips, and one simply cannot play Freddie in a half-assed way. It just wouldn't have worked, especially because Rami already had a strike against him by not looking very similar to Freddie (until the mustache and short hair in the second half of the movie). Taron was able to pull off doing a version of Elton because of the fact that he already kind of looks like Elton, he had a good enough voice to sing, and because Rocketman is a musical fantasy with a very different approach to storytelling than Bo Rhap.<br/><br/>It's about time that people calm down with the hate toward this movie. It's getting really old at this point. Rocketman is in no way perfect but people are letting the fact that its very gay (and proud of it) distract them from seeing its very obvious flaws.<br/><br/>My final words here are that Bohemian Rhapsody was a absolute delight to watch! Besides the top notch acting and music, the costumes, production design, and editing were all so great! While watching it I felt like I was living in the 70s and 80s for those 2 hours and got to experience the excitement and joy that all the fans would've felt back in the day when they first heard the records or attended the concerts. I am now a very big fan of Queen and Rami Malek, and for that, I thank the filmmakers!"

","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is an attractive film about the story of Freddie Mercury and the Queen. In 1970, the British Indian Parsi Farrokh ""Freddie"" Bulsara meets the members of the band Smile in a pub and soon they become Freddie Mercury and the Queen.

Technically, it might have some flaws, but I can wholeheartedly say I fully enjoyed the movie from the very beginning to the end. And that's quite a compliment for a movie this long!
The acting is stunning and the casting is impressively done. Rami Malek is one of the best actors out there, in my opinion, and did Freddie Mercury justice. He did an excellent job at embodying the legend, and he's deserving of winning the Oscar that he is nominated for. There were plenty of moments during the film that I was in awe of him. All of the actors were great!<br/><br/>What they wanted to do with this movie was to honour Freddie and Queen, not making a full-on documentary about Freddie's life, as the critics ""complained"" about. I'm actually glad they didn't go down a dark path and instead focus on the highlights. But I'm also confused by how some critics think they shied away from the darker aspects of Mercury's life? I didn't feel like they did that at all. In fact, I think they handled it appropriately.<br/><br/>I'm happy with the soundtrack as well. I honestly wouldn't mind if it had been three hours long. Plus, the recreation of Live Aid is spot-on.<br/><br/>All in all, wonderful movie that made me happy and emotional, and gave me a bigger love for Queen. Ever since I saw the movie I've been listening to Queen songs on repeat.<br/><br/>Well-deserving of the awards and recognition it is getting, including Rami Malek who delivered a high-quality performance."

","I couldn't have imagined a more perfect way to highlight the successes of one of the greatest bands in the world. There is not a single boring moment in this movie!!! Every scene, every shot, every bit of dialogue has been executed magnificently. I'm not sure about the accuracy of the biopic and I don't care. Some complained about the lack of Mercury's sexuality being discussed. Not everything has to be about LGBT just because the man was a gay icon. He was more than his personal life and I think that was also a side point of the film being made the way it was. This serves as a medley and snapshot into Freddie's progress into stardom and what Queen became from hardly anything. Best movie of 2018, it maintains a special place in my heart so much that I went twice to the cinema to watch it and it still didn't feel like enough viewings. This was also the first movie I've seen where I've seen men crying watching this. Cinematic experience I wish I could score 11/10 for."

","My parents were both heavy rock fans growing up in the 80's, they were 11 when MTV premiered on cable and raised me and my siblings on everything from Pat Benatar, AC-DC, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, Heart, Queen, Def Leppard, and a boat-load more rock groups from the 70's and 80's Hair Metal Era. My Mom couldn't wait for this movie to be released in the theaters when she heard they were making the movie on Freddie Mercury. We all LOVED the movie and my mom cried thru half of it. She remembers the day when MTV announced Freddy Mercury interviewed on his admittance he was sick with Aids then the next day his passing away. The movie was moving and (if the movie was true to facts) very sad on what Freddie went thru with his love for Mary and his homosexuality, his music and the relationship with his family and Band-Mates. Freddie was definitely a musical genius! Bohemian Rhapsody is still an extraordinary masterpiece as it was back in the 70's. Its ageless! RIP Freddie! You were a Treasure!"

Congratulations to the whole cast of the film!
The only thing I could say is that there could have been some more scenes focused on Freddy Mercury and his personal life but in a way it is better this way.

","While this is a simple straight forward story, it is the performances,sheer energy and music which assault the senses. The casting is quite unbelievable. Everyone is great. The movie portrays the debauched lifestyle of Mercury without being sordid and shows his loneliness and torment which ultimately proved so devastating. Having been lucky enough to have been at Queens last live performance at Knebworth Castle, the finale gave me both goose bumps and a tear. A fitting tribute to a brilliant band and the greatest front man ever. Go and see it. The Mike Myers joke was genius."

A few times during the film I found myself going ""I don't remember it like that"" or ""what about that?"" and when I checked later found they were either historical inaccuracies or omissions. They didn't in anyway diminish from the film, in fact I can't remember the last film I watched where I had so many goosebumps."

After all, it.s an enormous task to encompass 20 years of legend in a bit more than 2 hours long film, but they did it beautifully.
I was born too late to see them playing live together, but I left the cinema crying with joy, feeling as if I attended their performance in Live Aid before my time. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and I hope they win all the Oscars they can :)"

"" Did you see and hear that song Bohemiam Rhapsody"" and it is by far one of the best songs written. Tonight we went with to see the movie with our 4 kids and we enjoyed it to the max.

","This film was amazing. I have seen it twice now and enjoyed it just as much the second time round. Brilliant casting and evenly paced action made for an entertaining peek into the life of a fantastic showman. Equal parts funny and heartbreaking."
"MOscarbradley","8","5","6","11 December 2018"," Almost a great biopic
","Let me say straight off that I was never a fan of Queen or of Freddie Mercury, (too anthemic for my tastes), and I have always thought 'Bohemian Rhapsody' the most overrated song of all time, (though apparently the music press didn't think too highly of it when it came out and it was left to the public to make it a hit), so I approached Bryan Singer's Mercury/Queen biopic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" with a certain amount of trepidation. You might say I went to scoff and stayed to cheer.<br/><br/>As biopics go, it's reasonably conventional. We begin with Freddie about to go on stage at Live Aid then we flash back to the beginnings, circa 1970. It makes his talent clear from the start and it ticks all the right boxes as it chronicles Queen's rise and as a dip into the business known as showbusiness it's almost perfect. It's at its best when it dissects the songs, and in particular the title song, to show their genesis and, speaking as someone who never really liked them in the first place, all of this came as something of a revelation. I am now hearing Queen's songs in an entirely new light.<br/><br/>Of course, Mercury is the central figure throughout and is virtually never off the screen. At first Rami Malek looks strangely bizarre, more like a young Mick Jagger, and those extra teeth don't help but as the film progresses he grows into the part. His foibles are basically overlooked while his minder and his manager become the villains of the piece. Freddie is positively Christ-like when set beside Allen Leech's Paul Prenter. Leech, best known from ""Downton Abbey"", is superb here, a truly hissable villain if ever there was one while other members of the band are convincingly played by Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello. As the real love of Freddie's (early) life Lucy Boynton is excellent in an underwritten role.<br/><br/>The film ends as it began with Queen's appearance at Live Aid and director Singer gives us the entire set, a rock-and-roll tour-de-force lasting a good twenty minutes or so. When it was over there wasn't a dry eye in the house, (mine included), while the elderly couple beside me stood and lead the cheers."

"Andrew_HOTSHOT100","8","5","6","5 December 2018"," The King lives on
","This was one of the best, emotional, thrilling bio movies that has been made of this lifetime. The reason why I say this, is that this movie is not just based on one-person Freddie Mercury, but this movie is about Queen, meaning all four members, how they came together, showed their talents and how each contributed to their group success. While I was watching this film, it felt like a rollercoaster as I was full of emotions from the start of the movie to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This film focuses on the group Queen and not just about the main star of the movie. So, you get to see how good Brian May is when he writes some of the songs and John Deacon and Roger Taylor. I went to watch this film again for the second time as it was a dream come true for me. I have been waiting for years for a Queen movie to come out and this movie was top. This film focused on how the group came together and showed some of the best moments of their life and some of the sad, bad moments of Freddie life.<br/><br/>The film did not focus that much on the drama that was in Freddie life but it focused more on Queen. Watching this film made me thinking about how much I love Queen songs and I have once again started to listen to their songs and watching their tours again. The beginning of the film really sets the tone of the ending of the movie. Rami Malek who actors in Mr. Robot does a brilliant job of bring Freddie Mercury alive and throughout the film I really was thinking, wait is that really Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>Personal, I don't understand why some people give this film a bad rating or review, this film was the best tribute to Queen the music group and Freddie Mercury. This film once again did not focus too much on the bad things in his life but only the important things that happened in his life. You also get to see the experience of how they came together and how each of them came up with some of their and our most favourite big hit songs such as Bohemian Rhapsody, we will rock you, another one bites the dust, love of my life and we are the champions.<br/><br/>You also get to see the birth of one of the greatest performers of all time in music history who to me is up there with Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>So, to my fellow music fans, movie fans, queen fans, rock fans, please do not listen to the movie reviewers as I do not understand the little criticism of this movie.<br/><br/>We need to now see a Beatles, Michael Jackson movie, like this movie which focus more on the music artist instead of focusing on the bad parts of their life.<br/><br/>This movie is about Queen, all four members not just about Freddie Mercury and how he lived his life. Go and watch this movie. 10/10 rating. 5/5 starts."

","I've never known a time when there was such a disconnect between critics and the audience. How is this average but the last Jedi a masterpiece in their eyes?<br/><br/>The film is great as it tells a story but without being too in your face. You get enough of a feel for what Freddie's life was like without being too graphic. It's great to see a film maker be subtle.<br/><br/>Remi himself is phenomenal as Freddie. The voice and mannerisms are on point and I hope an Oscar nod is coming his way. He portrays the loneliness that many geniuses feel. And the need to belong even though you have millions of fans.<br/><br/>It also shows how far we've come with society's views of homsexuality and how far we have to go still. Again though a lot is the press. Luck at how they rounded on Elton john, George Michael etc. Freddie may not of wanted to be a poster boy for aids but his dignity showed you can be a sufferer without being a victim.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were great. From the tragic relationship with Mary to the equally tragic one with Paul prenter. Queen themselves are solid performers without stealing the lime light.<br/><br/>The music scenes as well are great. The only reason I dropped a mark as I felt they could've shown the end of Freddie's life, but you don't feel cheated for it's omission."

","I actually witnessed the rock group Queen perform live with Freddy Mercury as front man not once but twice.<br/><br/>The new biopic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" portrays the legendary lead singer as a caricature much of the time. Because HE portrayed himself as a caricature. To us. However, the film allows the human being behind the faÃ§ade to reveal his soul, as well. It just chooses not to belabor the point.<br/><br/>Mercury had reckless unprotected sex with countless men. We get it by way of several scenes in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". And he was a vain, albeit massively insecure, prima donna. These points are established without beating us about the noggin about it.<br/><br/>Much of the film's rousing soundtrack presented music I surprisingly wasn't familiar with. It was a most pleasant revelation. I've already downloaded these and several other songs from the iconic band for repeated listening enjoyment.<br/><br/>And the music of the group is the point.<br/><br/>Point, forevermore, well taken."

Bohemian Rhapsody is trying, like some of us, to bring closer those 3 different Mercury-s. And they do a helluva job!
The story is, as much as the outsider fans knew, pretty accurate. I was even (gladly) surprised to see so much gay stuff in a PG13! The debauchery of emotions and artistry which was Freddie's trademark is dealt with great elegance. The balance between ""this is a film about a Bohemian musical (his)tory, about Freddie and about Queen"" is very touching.
The acting is brilliant, if Mr Malek doesn't get an Oscar or Globe for it, I don't know who else would!
Filming, direction, camera, editing, all that in spades! Of course, the sound is Queen perfect
Kudos for the Queen members who worked hard to pay such a tribute to Mercury's musical genius (yes) and to the band itself, an amazing symbiosis from which many people took inspiration and pleasure."

The casting is amazing and the sheer spectacle of the 1985 Live Aid performance is truly brought to life by every actor involved."
"kjproulx","9","5","6","15 November 2018"," A Memorable Movie-Going Experience
","It's inevitable. Multiple biopics are now created on a yearly basis, and will continue to be made until the end of time. In my opinion, if not a single writer can come up with an original concept, then exploring the true story of someone or something is far more interesting than remaking a classic film. Bohemian Rhapsody is the latest in a long line of already released and upcoming biopics-and it's one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've had all year. Already thinking I knew a lot about this story before going in, I was pleasantly surprised by quite a few aspects of this story. Whether or not you're a fan of the band Queen or not, this movie has the makings of a film that can please many viewers. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and here's why.<br/><br/>I knew Bohemian Rhapsody was a movie that was going to heavily focus on Freddie Mercury over the rest of the band, which I thought was going to feel imbalanced, but the way his story is presented here makes it seem like his life had the most story to tell. From working at an airport to performing one of the most memorable concerts in history, this film takes you on a decade-long journey that's well worth your time. I was never bored, because it either wows you with spectacle, engages you with its drama, or has you guessing about where the film is going to take you next. It's not a perfect movie, but I think I can go as far as to say it's a perfectly made film in terms of its presentation.<br/><br/>I'm always looking for a movie to break out of the cliched way of telling a biopic, but I will admit this film slightly suffers from that at times. It does feel like it jumps from year to year, simply hitting the most important aspects of Mercury's life, which is fine, but we've seen that structure throughout numerous films in the past. With that said, that's truly the only complaint I can come up with here. If you don't like listening to the music of Queen, then I feel that will also be a detriment to the movie for you, but that would just be personal taste anyway. For the movie that it is, it works extremely well.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most about Bohemian Rhapsody was the performance by Rami Malek as the leading man. I've seen him countless times in the past, appearing as comedic relief in films like Need for Speed or the Night at the Museum franchise, but I've never seen him shine in a leading dramatic role before. If this performance doesn't put him on the map, I'm not sure what will, because I was blown away by his portrayal here. Even if this movie suffered from lazy writing or a lack of energy, Malek's performance would've still held my attention, and that says a lot, especially for someone who I never expected to perform like this.<br/><br/>In the end, Bohemian Rhapsody benefits from great editing (which hardly jumps out at me very often), some very solid direction (controversy aside), concert sequences that will impress many viewers, and an overall brisk pacing, even with the lengthy run time. I had a blast watching this movie and even with all of the depressing elements of this story, it's always well-balanced with happier or energetic moments. Aside from the lead performance, I can't see this movie receiving many nominations, but I will say that I can see it becoming a fan favourite movie of 2018. This is the definition of a crowd-pleaser. Bohemian Rhapsody is a great theatre experience from start to finish."

"Fields201","10","5","6","12 November 2018"," My Family and I Loved This Movie And That's Very Rare
","The only one missing in my family to see this was the true Queen fan but she had to work. Instead my other sister, nephew and my mom went to go see this and for the first time in what I think is ever we are unanimously loved this movie. I thought it was outstanding.<br/><br/>The film starts out with Rami Malek (brilliant performance) as Freddie Mercury going from his mansion to the Live Aid concert until we go back to see just how the band got there. This was what I had been wanting to see from the film and how closely it recreates it because it was an amazing event and I never seen so many people until I saw that video.<br/><br/>There is not a dull moment in this film. I can't say it accurately portrays the band, but I remembered a lot of stuff like Freddie playing the piano from his bed, the fact that he was gay. and that the band didn't always get along. The climax of the film, by the way, doesn't disappoint and it's amazing how accurate it was with the real event.<br/><br/>Before I close this review, I must talk about the performances. Everyone did a wonderful job in the film but I think everyone will remember Rami Malek's portrayal as Freddie Mercury the most. I swear every single time he was on screen it was like seeing Freddie Mercury come to life. The way he is on stage is exactly how Freddie Mercury was. I'm not sure if he was really singing or not, but either way, he deserves to be nominated and I would lose faith in the Academy completely if he isn't.<br/><br/>Queen fan or not, everyone should check out this movie. It is very inspirational, and a good representation of what it's like in the business. Mike Myers also does a cameo (an obvious thank you note for having his film Wayne's World putting them back on the map) and I didn't even recognize him until later in the film. I really need to see this film again now."

It's a joy to watch and huge credit goes to Rami Malek for doing almost impossible job - representing one of the best (if not the best, sorry, Mick) frontmans in rock music who ever lived. Other actors played really well too. The movie is sensitive, touching, but not too sweet or comical - it is made with respect and love and I see why filmmakers decided to get rid of Sasha.

","When the movie came out, I immediately sprang to the critic reviews to see what the verdict was, and it didn't look good. I then find myself, perhaps a week later, stuck at the theatre with Bohemian Rhapsody as the only non-Grinch movie playing for the time I was there. So I walk in, and I'm like ""I bet I won't be able to take this seriously"". Boy was I wrong. This movie had me up and down, surrounded by the utter glory I had never before recognised as Queen. It was a masterpiece. I mean perhaps it wasn't the intellectually stimulating sort of movie I so snobbishly only watch, but it was amazing. If my boyfriend weren't there, I definitely would have cried. This movie had immersed me in a perspective I never knew, and a band so magnificent and deserving of its glory that I could barely understand how I hadn't recognised them as the revolutionaries they were. Amen. It was good as hell. WATCH IT"

","We are not that fond of rock music, and chose to attend this movie largely because the competing films did not appeal very much. We were prepared to be disappointed.

The production values were good; the Direction was excellent; the acting was superb, and the music was presented from concept to performance in a compelling way. We came away thoroughly entertained. Without passing judgment on the accuracy of the facts or sequencing, we came away feeling that we were viewers of Queen in its formation, development and achiements. A memorable film."

","So here's the deal... I heard about this movie being made over a year ago with Sacha Baron Cohen as Freddie Mercury. It was going to be R-Rated and focus on Freddie's sordid personal life. But thankfully Brian May, who served as a creative consultant on the film said ""no way, this movie needs to be about the music"" And that it was!!<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a movie for true fans of Queen; it's the celebration of some of the greatest songs of all time! And the recreation of the Live Aid Show at the end is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen on the big screen. This movie is powerful and an absolutely incredible experience!

That was acting on every level and emotion. Also, the actor who played Brian was a pure reflection in looks and sound.<br/><br/>I get emotional reading all the great reviews because it's us Queen fans whose thoughts mean the most - not critics.<br/><br/>A massive thank you to Brian and Roger (and John) for this beautiful gift.

"six2561","9","5","6","6 November 2018"," I was blown away
","This is a great movie, in spite of what the professional critics say. I either had the goose bumps or tears in my eyes throughout most of the film. Movie portrays the exciting and extremely SAD life of Freddie Mercury. He was a genius who birthed the vision for QUEEN. Those reviewers who state the movie is Fake because it doesn't represent his true life.... Look, we all know his life and how he lived it. They respectfully show enough tidbits of his inner demons and pain to make one remember-AH, yes, he was out of control, but kept the emphasis on the music, the band, the relationships, the feeling. You don't need to see more, you get it.
The LiveAid ending of this film will be remembered as one of the greatest movie endings of all time. No kidding, we were clapping, arms in the air, gasping in disbelief, crying. It was truly a moment.
Of course it MAY help if you were of age back then in '85 and actually saw it happen. But even if not, by this point in the film, if you have a soul or a penchant for nostalgia, you will gain much from this ending and leave with nothing but a feeling of melancholy & Love in your heart.
Long Live QUEEN!"
"Sleepin_Dragon","10","21","35","25 November 2018"," Perfection. I was glued.
","Queen, arguably the best group of all time, get a movie which does that great band justice. Anyone that loves the band, Freddie, or just movie making at its finest, then this film is definitely for you. I'll admit I was sceptical, and am late going to see it, foolishly, because this was one of the best films I have seen in years, it's moving, it's funny, interesting, and as it showcases their best music, it's a musical feast also. People will be talking about this movie for years to come, and in particular the performance of Rami Malek, who is nothing short of sensational as the fabulous frontman, the supporting cast are sensational too, Gwilym Lee, who I know from Midsomer Murders was a revelation as Brian May. I loved how it told the story, but it never focused too long on one aspect, it moved at a cracking pace, and allowed the real life story of Queen to be told, phenomenally.<br/><br/>This shows that despite the rise of Giant TV companies giving us all we can watch at home, the Cinema industry is thriving more then ever.<br/><br/>Bravo. 10/10"

"Rhubarb_King","10","8","11","4 February 2019"," I typically loath band biography movies...
","... But this work of art is nothing short of astounding!
Beneath all these revealings of arguably the greatest rock band since the dawn of time, the real story and drama triumph over this - how emotionally lonely and fragile Freddie was and how that loneliness only grows until the importance of true family is realized.
The story and script concerning all band members are highly accurate, but the acting of this script is what REALLY hits the nail on the head in portraying their personalities; extremely convincing.
The overall form of the movie, I give a perfect 10.
Without giving away the ending, in my own words:
'Several endings occur at once'.
Watch. This. Movie."
"almakrisch","10","8","11","7 January 2019"," Amazing movie!
","Bohemian Rhapsody was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. As a big Queen fan, I can say that some facts aren't really accurate in the timeline, but the movie was AMAZING.<br/><br/>First of all, let's talk about the acting. God, Rami Malek's acting was absolutely incredible. He may not look exactly like Freddie, but he has the same expressions he had. I've seen other stuff with Rami, and he always was amazing, and BoRhap was no exception. The acting in general was really, really good too.<br/><br/>Then, telling Freddie's life, I personally think they sugarcoated it too much. But it makes sense, since many young children were seeing it. Apart from that, it was pretty good.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was simply fantastic. I saw three times! And the music -I'm a big Queen fan- was incredible (duh). I really recommend it!"

The person who picked the young men to play Freddie Mercury, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor did an amazing job. The young lady who played Mary Austin was perfect. Music was always important in my life when I was growing up. I loved the 1950's musicals and my sons played Queen records when they were young. I didn't expect to fall in love with this movie, but it was put together in a way that captures your heart. I must say it is a very emotional ride, so expect to shed a tear or two. JOB WELL DONE!

No matter which members have left us and those that remain, they are in the fans hearts forever and this movie explains precisely why.<br/><br/>Story telling was great, acting was great, music was great, and the live reenactment was thrilling. I left the theater with only one question. Why did audiences forget that this is what a real band should be? I truly feel that contemporary music is tragically devoid of what Queen created and treated to the fans. Few bands create an audience like Queen and few bands have a fanbase that is so adept at knowing the catalog of music and the rhythm of a live concert. Live Aid is a great example of a well trained audience who loves a band with all their heart. Freddie said it best, ""they sing the song because it's true"", favorite line of the movie.<br/><br/>Ready for multiple watches of this film, Thank you."

But my worries has unreasonable. This is a masterpiece, no less. The music, the acting, the direction, writing, all of it was on point! I sat shaking in my seat by the end, tears in my eyes, totally blown away - wishing that I was born 50 years ago."

"RforFilm","6","8","11","7 November 2018"," Another one bites the dust? Nah, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine enough to proclaim ""We Are the Champions""
","Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. These are just a few lyrics of the famous Queen song, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that is still one of the greatest songs of all time. In fact, there are a lot of songs by Queen I can recite including ""We Will Rock You"", ""Radio Ga Ga"", ""Under Pressure"", and of course, ""We Are the Champions"". Along with very catchy melodies, the bands prominence could not been without the vocal range of Freddy Mercury.<br/><br/>That combination of an amazing voice and the right players is so prominent, that it was like catching lightning in a bottle. I can hardly come up with one good song let alone an entire catalog that still holds up. I had a lot of their stuff growing up, and even now, I still find myself going to Queen's music whenever I wanted some uplifting rock. Again, I think a lot of it rides on Freddy Mercury, who was one of the few people in existence who was destined for greatness. If a genius like Mozart has a great movie like Amadeus, perhaps Freddy Mercury can be replicated with the biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody.<br/><br/>In 1970, we open with an Indian-British man then known as Farrokh Bulsara, before he became Freddy Mercury (played by Rami Malek) who works as a baggage handler at an airport. He goes to a nightclub where he sees a band called Smile playing. When their lead singer leaves the group, Freddy meets guitarist Brian May (played by Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Played by Ben Hardy) and offers to be their new lead singer. They agree, get a new bassist John Deacon (played by Joseph Mazzello) and rename their band Queen.<br/><br/>They play nightclubs, and Freddy's voice and onstage persona get the bands fame to quick success. At the same time, Freddy even gets engaged with Mary Austin (played by Lucy Boynton). Even when their original label refuses to release ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as a single, they manage to make it a hit and their fourth album A Night at the Opera is their biggest. During this time however, Freddy questions his sexuality when he begins an affair with his manager Paul. This pushes Freddy away from the band in favor of him looking for ""Somebody to Love"".<br/><br/>You'd think that a movie about Freddy Mercury would be a grand, almost operatic like experience. For what it is, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine. Its not a great movie, but it was entertaining. It was said that the real life band members wanted the movie the focus on them all, but most people really want to know Freddy. We get some idea, thanks to the amazing performance of Rami Malek. Even if his makeup can look a little off, he still captures the excitement and flamboyance while making him human. I'm glad they dubbed him instead of trying to recreate his singing voice, as most people would have spotted it immediately.<br/><br/>So if the actor had got it right, what's wrong with the movie? Its not that the movie is bad, but that it's like any other music biopic. We see the group form, try and write and record music, get it on the radio, perform tours, see people come and go, see them return and settle their differences. I know the movie wanted to show the story of Queen, but we've come far within telling those stories. I was happy and satisfied, but something still felt missing. The best I can describe was that while it does a good job imitating Queen and Freddy Mercury, it always feels like an imitation.<br/><br/>Think back to other music movies like Love & Mercy and the remake of A Star is Born. Both movies showed the trials of being an artist, what that means for the people around them, and the pressure of living up to that fame. Part of me still deosn't know much about Freddy Mercury other then he was bisexual and loved to throw parties. In fact, the furthest I got was that most of the members of Queen were college nerds who formed a group.<br/><br/>I'll give this six A Night at the Opera albums out of ten. The movie has good moments (including an amazing recreation of Live Aid that was the highlight of the film) and even give you the story of Queen. While I think Queen fans are going to want more, most people will probably be happy. It does deliver what it promises and does so fine. So I do recommend this anyway if you like Queen. The show must go on, so see it and see if it's worthy of singing ""We are the Champions"""

There are quite some things in the movie that didn't happen in reality, but hey, it's a movie, not a documentary. 9 stars instead of 10 because they left out some very important scenes in order to make it not too long. I mean, the song Bohemian Rhapsody is quite long (six minutes) so why can't the movie be three hours?

"Thecritic8282","1","39","72","7 January 2019"," Is the Hollywood Foreign Press on CRACK??
","How in the world does this film win best drama at the Golden Globes let alone even qualify for it???? It's nothing more than a propaganda film that whitewashes the truth about a great band and the great musicianship of Mercury. There's a reason why Sacha Baron Cohen didn't want to do this role - because it left out so much about Freddie. This film had NO STORY and is unworthy of being called a movie."
"NatKaminska","4","39","72","7 November 2018"," Solid entertainment in the second half of the movie, but not much more. Overall bland and flat, Mercury and all the Queen deserve much better.
","First of all, some people here - the most fanatical fans of Queen - have to stop writing two-sentence reviews, like ""genius movie, Oscar for Rami Malek"" & give 10 stars, because this is what makes the review biased and dishonest. I'm also a fan of Queen and Freddy himself, but the same time I graduated film school and I love cinema, that's why I also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies. Here I will try to make my criticism honest, substantive, and not too long (so that everyone wants to read it).<br/><br/>Yes, sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious, and their opinions are detached from reality, but sometimes they are also right, and in the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', this is the second.<br/><br/>The film distorts a lot of facts from Freddy and Queen's life, and if these were unimportant events - I would not care at all, but these are important things and especially in a biographical film this should not be done, just to make the movie more dramatic. Fred's life was dramatic enough, if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie, they would go even deeper into Mercury's childhood and the fact he escaped with his family, against persecution, from his own homeland. And this in turn could be the starting point / foundation for a deeper, better portrait of the Queen singer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no depth here, the worst part is that this film is schematic, completely flat, only glides over important topics, does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating, complicated character that Freddy was.
I don't accept excuses of the most fanatical fans of Queen (who cannot come to terms with the fact that many critics / reviewers, very rightly criticize this movie), that ""this is the story of the band and not Mercury himself"". Because firstly, one does not exclude the other: it was possible to include in the scenario a deeper analysis / truth about Freddy and the band, and secondly the band's history is also poorly told. The best moment of a rather boring, long-lasting, first half of the movie is the recording of '' Bohemian Rhapsody '', a humorous accent with a rooster and Galileo. The rest is a fast, also quite jumping and chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting, carelessly, subsequent tours and writing of individual hits, and while I understand that in a 2-hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail, it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters - band members, thus also build better and deeper characters in this film.<br/><br/>The second half is better, I admit, both in terms of pace and in terms of writing/story, and the icing on the cake is the Live Aid concert, so really the edn. The performance, photos, acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene, unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failure.<br/><br/>Malek's acting, imo, certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. He tries his best with an empty and schematic scenario, and the writers / director's mistakes are not his fault, true, but Oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances, which are not limited to robotic mannerism, it must be accompanied by the psychological, emotional depth of the portrayed character, and there is no such depth in this film, in this main character. The only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into Freddy's soul is the scene of conversation between Fred& Mary, first at Fred's house and then in the rain. It is here, that Malek's creation is the truest and the best.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film, majority of Malek's work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism - perfectly recreated- but it is not enough to rate this role positively, let alone reward it with an Oscar nomination. Imitative mannerism, gestures, faces alone - it is only a skeleton, an acting sketch, especially in a biographical film, and not a full, beautiful, complex image, which should be any biography. There is simply no soul in this act, and it's just a crime if you play a figure as extraordinary, colorful and complicated as Freddy Mercury.
In addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director, Malek himself (for me), does not rise to the task. Sometimes he is just Mercury caricature, and large, artificial teeth don't help to erase this impression, in fact, the opposite. The make-up department didn't do good job here, famous teeth of Queen frontman could have been done better, much more subtly, it would look less ridiculous. Returning to Rami Malek - he is still a young talent who - like any actor - needs more workshop and acting experience, plus really good material, to really shine. That is why I predict Rami Malek will not win an Oscar.<br/><br/>I still think that the great mistake of the Bohemian Rhapsody creators, was to part ways with Sacha Baron Cohen. When I found out that he had left Mercury's biography project, I felt it was a big mistake from film producers, because I was sure Cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising, interesting story, not forcedly smoothed , and it seems, my intuition did not disappoint me then. Cohen, a remarkable & colorful character like Freddy, would have fit in perfectly in this role. In addition, after hearing the interview, in which Cohen told why he finally left the movie and what vision of Mercury he had - I regret even more that it was not him who played the Queen main singer. People, who can't stand Cohen (they don't understand him) say it's good that he was replaced by Malek, because Sacha supposedly only meant/wanted controversy and scandals, that he would show Freddy only as crazy sex addict, taking drugs and nothing else. However, all of this are just primitive attacks, not supported by logic.<br/><br/>Whoever saw 'Borat' and really understood the message behind it, knows that Cohen is an extremely conscious and intelligent actor / artist, at the same time, I will repeat: extraordinary like Freddy. He is a master of imitation, a master of using various accents, a great actor and, additionally, he can sing very well - which he showed in his role in '' Les Misérables ''. Cohen's strengths don't end there, because physically, with stature, he is much closer to Freddy (who was a well-built man) than frail Malek, has naturally dark eyes and hair, and with a bit of characterization, I have no doubt that he could have been the most wonderful Freddy Mercury. What's more, if he was allowed to do what he wanted with this role - to portray Freddy as a complicated, controversial figure, with a great appetite for life, but also a great artist who mixed the big ego with great sensitivity and shyness - I have no doubt that it would be a great role. Now it's just a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>As a result, we got schematic, ""polite"" movie, ironically - because Freddy Mercury, as well as the entire Queen, were as original, unapologetic and creative as you could be and deserve much better. Sorry, but real Queen fan, who wanted raw, real, complex, deep, uncompromising truth and story - just cannot like this movie. Mercury and all the Queen story has so much potential (wasted in this movie), which is weird to say and how it all turned out, considering living Queen members were involved in this movie. Sorry guys, you did awful job. I guess I'll just wait for another movie, bold and great this time, I hope."

","I was already convinced after my first time watching it that any Queen fan would love this film. It left my friends and me emotional and enthused.<br/><br/>My mum, a long-time Queen fan (she has even seen them live in 1982) and her best friend, talking about the movie non-stop even months before it came out and absolutely enthralled after seeing it two times already, had this idea to organize a private Bohemian Rhapsody screening at our local cinema.
About 150 people can fit into this small venue and we were inviting people left and right, friends, family, telling them all to bring their friends and family.<br/><br/>In the end, we actually had an entire room filled; around 115 of our own people showed up and the variety was remarkable: We had anyone between the age of 7 and 85; men, women, teenagers, parents, grandparents, long-time Queen-fans and people who only knew a song or two. By far not everyone considered themselves a Queen fan, some merely came along for a nice Sunday evening at the movies. In the end, the room was packed, the rest of the seats were given to some confused visitors.<br/><br/>A movie screening with friends and familiy is definitely worth it, the atmosphere was brilliant and I still had goosebumps after my third time seeing it. What is so special about this film is that it really does bring the generations together. Many of my friend's parents (I am 22) came along for nostalgic reasons and because they actually remember this time. Others were music fans or hobby musicians and loved the movie as a musical spectacular. But like I mentioned already, some people saw the film with no expectations whatsoever and they were still ALL blown away. I have not recieved a single complaint or bad word about the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion can be said that the people truly have spoken. A big group of various age and taste was enchanted and highly entertained by Bohemian Rhapsody and that's why I can wholehartedly say that this film is absolutely amazing and a blast for anyone who sees it, not only fans.<br/><br/>It really does do justice to a bunch of true legends.

Anyway, the picture of Freddy or better to say Rami Malek is pretty much feminized, prosthetic teeth were very bad done and looks fake from every angle waching.

"jenhajdics","10","9","13","25 November 2018"," Absolutely Phenomenal
","The only person who could play Freddie Mercury better than Rami Malek would be Freddie Mercury himself. I was blown away by the cast of Bohemian Rhapsody. The story was incredibly well written and there was never a lull. The cast meshed together so well and I think that made their ability to perform playing legends like Queen even better. This was the first time I've seen Rami Malek's acting but I know he's been on the radar for years. His ability to transform into Freddie Mercury goes beyond makeup & wardrobe. His mannerisms and the confidence you know Freddie Mercury for having were so important for whatever Actor ended up with the part to nail. The efforts they made to recreate their iconic Live Aid performance was incredible. There were times when I actually became overwhelmed watching Rami Malek play Freddie. He was one of the most talented musicians in history and it's a huge task to try living up to that but it was like Rami Malek was born to play this role. He was just that incredible. It's especially apparent at the end of the film where old footage of Freddie Mercury performing with Queen is played as the credits roll. I got my intro to Queen after begging my mom to buy me Wayne's World when I was 12. Until last year when the announcement this biopic was in the works I didn't even realize I was a Queen fan. I clicked on a Queen greatest hits album that was trending on iTunes only to discover that songs I'd been listening to whenever they came on the radio were not by different bands as I had thought. Queen was just so exceptionally talented that their sound never stopped evolving and it was impossible to hear a song by them and know right away who the artist is. If you're debating seeing this movie, stop. Get in your car, and go to the theater. Zero regrets. If Rami Malek doesn't at least earn a Best Actor nomination for his role as Freddie Mercury this year I won't even bother watching the Academy Awards. Personally, I think they ought to just give it to him now. He's was simply the perfect man to play Freddie."

"Bodhi_Dusk","9","9","13","17 November 2018"," Definitely worth seeing but don't expect it to get deep
","I knew very little about Queen before seeing this movie and wasn't familiar with their music aside from their top 10 hits. I mainly wanted to go because I was a big fan of Rami Malek's from watching Mr. Robot. I was also infatuated with how completely Malek seemed to embody Freddie Mercury in the side-by-side comparison photos I kept seeing for the film.<br/><br/>While I was mostly riveted throughout the whole film, thanks to Malek's dedication to the character, I was disappointed repeatedly each time it would get to an interesting aspect of Freddie's life, such as his relationship with his parents, only to have the scene end a minute or two later and then it would cut back to the studio.<br/><br/>Multiple times throughout the film I felt like I was watching a VH1 behind the scenes documentary of Queen rather than a biopic of Freddie Mercury. This feeling was cemented when the last 20 minutes of the movie was used to recreate an uncut Live Aid performance easily viewable on YouTube. I would have much rather they condensed the Live Aid performance into a 5-minute highlight montage and used the other 15 minutes to share more of Mercury's off-stage life. The cinematography was wonderful though for a lot of the performance scenes. A lot of swooping that made you feel like a bird watching the shows. A couple of the shots took my breath away.<br/><br/>Despite these shortcomings, I absolutely loved this movie. It might have only touched on Freddie Mercury's life but it made me laugh, it made me cry and even better, it ignited a curiosity about Freddie and the band that has resulted in me listening to every Queen album repeatedly. I now completely understand why this band, and especially Mercury, were worth making a movie about. It's not often I come across a band who is so experimental musically, has such a charismatic, engaging, talented front man and encourages each other to pursue personal projects as well. This band got each other and embraced their differences rather than allow them to cause a divide.<br/><br/>I guess in that way the movie succeeded because it led me to become a huge fan of their lesser known music and I have a whole new admiration and respect for Queen. Freddie Mercury was incredibly private and protective of his personal life. Since this film was helmed by his loyal surviving band mates, it only makes sense that the film feels like a tribute rather than an exposé."

I was dragged along with the family, and as someone who grew up singing every lyric to every Queen song as a child, I was blown away by how brilliantly the movie was conducted, and how cleverly the Director took our emotions up and down.

"The-Sarkologist","6","9","13","7 November 2018"," The Story of Queen
","Yep, this is the story of Queen, or at least the story from when they first came together as a band to their performance at Live Aid, which is apparently gone down as one of the greatest rock performances of the modern era. Me, I'm not so sure but then again I wasn't there, and even if I did watch it, I was too young to remember, except that I was made to go to be by my parents because I had to get up and go to church in the morning, and while I did catch a glimpse of the Phillidelpia set the next morning, they seemed to have more pressing issues than me watching a rock and roll extravaganze. Hey, at least my parents let me watch some of it, so that is saying something.
Well, the story is pretty interesting, though to be honest with you, it really isn't all that much different to what you would get from the story of most other rock bands. You know, sex, drugs, rock and roll and all that, or at least where Freddy Mercury is concerned. In fact it seemed as if the other members of the band were actually a lot more straight laced than Freddy, having families and all that. Yet Freddy is the face of the band, the guy who is basically an entertainer, and boy did he know how to pull off a stage performance. I guess that is why Adam Lambert fits in so well with what remains of the band these days (John Deacon has basically called it quits, though Roger Taylor and Brian May still travel about).
So, while the movie is about the band, in many ways it is also about Freddy. A guy who probably didn't fit in all that well with the people around him, namely because everybody saw him as a Packie, yet from that first performance when he stunned the university crowd, to that day at Live Aid where he literally stunned the world, there was a guy who really seemed to be able to live it up.
Yet it is also a story of how many of these rockers live fast and die young, and comparatively speaking, Freddie did die rather young, namely due to the aids virus, which is kept secret from the world until the day before he died. Mind you, that last album of theirs, Made in Heaven, is pretty depressing, as a friend, and a big Queen fan himself, admitted. I guess with me A Kind of Magic was probably their last great Album, though The Miracle did have a couple of good tracks on it, as did Innuendo. In fact, I believe the Kind of Magic tour was basically the last tour that they were able to perform, with Freddy really entering the final stages of the disease - back in those days it didn't matter how much money you had, Aids was a death sentence.
Yet I'm sure that Freddy hadn't taken the moustache look when they had written We Will Rock You, and sure enough when I go to You Tube and play the original clip he hadn't. The other thing was that there was no mention of the video clip that they had produced to promote their song Bohemian Rapsody, and honestly, from what I have heard, that song actually propelled the whole idea of the video clip into the main stream - before that it was just bands playing on live studio sets.
Look, I'm going to say that I did like the film, but in the end, despite me being a huge Queen fan (even though I only own two of their albumns, and one of them is a Greatest Hits Album - where did all the others go), this is still basically a biography of a band, and the only reason I went to see it was, well, because it was Queen."

","I'm not a fan of Queen. I like a few songs but rarely listen to them. In addition, I do not like biographical films about bands. A few hours ago I left the theater completely dismembered. I would not go so far as to place ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" among the best films of all time, and I can not rate it a straight ten because it has its flaws, but I do not want to analyze it, because this time the technicalities are completely irrelevant. Although one part around the middle was quite boring, it could not spoil the overall impression. The great selection of actors and their even better performances, excellent music and some of the best songs ever written, and perfect balance of touching drama and good humor completely hypnotized me, so I spent most of the film either in tears or loudly laughing, and often both simultaneously. A little more than two hours flew by in a flash and left the impression that will hold me for days. Do not miss the opportunity to see this film at the cinema, unless you have a really superb sound system at home.<br/><br/>9/10"

So I persuaded my mother, 67, to see the movie with me (she used to tell me that Bohemian Rhapsody was mu favourite song at the age of 2. English is not my mother language). And, Oh boy! We both sang, laughed, cried, sang... all the way. Younger crowd arround us wasn't singing, but everything else was there in the air! Great film makers did really excellent job and I hope that most people decide to watch and appreciate it. Because they will enjoy it! And whether this movie win Oscars or not, in my book, Bohemian Rhapsody DID deserve Oscars, in more than 1 category. Sure, it's not flawless. But, really, really, don't miss it.

Joseph Mazello as John Deacon was uncanny. It was so spot on, it was hard to believe it wasn't actually John.
Freddie was my first idol. From hearing Seven Seas of Rhye as an impressionable 7 year old in 1973 I was hooked. All my pocket money and birthday money went to buying Queen albums. This film felt very personal to me, now, as a gay man living with HIV. Thank you to all involved in making this."

","A truly moving story of one of the most loved musicians of all time. Story, casting, everything, was executed beautifully. Easily the best film to ever exist under this genre. The live aid performance was mimicked with outstanding accuracy, the acting of the entire band was utterly superb. And the constrast between happy Feddie and broken Freddie was immaculate.<br/><br/>The only con of this movie is maybe the duration of the songs during the film, as I thought each one finished pretty quickly. They should have expanded the screen time of Live aid to make it more moving than it was (it was already quite moving but could have been better).<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic film, normal people would find it entertaining.

","Freddie Mercury was exciting, unique, charismatic and totally enthralling as a front man. This film is none of these things. Probably because Brian and Roger were involved, but the film is dull, plodding and bland. The only star in Queen was Freddie, he lived a life of excess and there is a great film to be made about his life, this just isnt it. You have to go some in order to make a dull film about Freddie, but they have managed it. Remi does an amazing job, its just the same they couldn't create a film worthy of his talents. The clue is in the rating of the film...a 13 rating for a man who lived an X rated life. The film lacks tension or drama, of which there was plenty in Freddies life. But Brian and Roger should benefit from increased sales of Queen albums as a result, which I am sure is why they made the film. Kerching!!"

"empress1","10","10","15","10 December 2018"," THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES
","As far as I'm concerned, this is not a biopic or a documentary. This is a CELEBRATION of Queen and Freddie Mercury, arguably the best rock band and singer of all time. This movie was made with the blessings of Brian May and Roger Taylor. Enough said.<br/><br/>To some of you film school students and graduates, you're missing the point. And don't assume I don't know anything about the industry. Of course liberties had to be taken to reduce this story to 2+ hours. Of course it's not word-for-word perfect. WHO CARES?? This was a movie made for the fans! Were things skimmed over? YES. Was the ""dirt"" buried? YES. I don't believe we needed to go down the rabbit hole in order to understand what this film is about.<br/><br/>I grew up with Queen. I was fascinated by all of the members of the band. I was mesmerized by Freddie. Queen's ""Live Aid"" performance left me breathless and emotional. I wept when Freddie passed.<br/><br/>Soooooo, let's fast-forward, shall we? When I originally heard a film was being made, I thought, ""No way. It can't be done ."" Then all the hoopla about who's to portray Freddie, etc. Then the decision to cast Rami Malek. "" REALLY?? "", I thought. Boy, was I WRONG. About EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>Off I go to the theatre with my son and his lady (they're not kids) on November 2nd. Then the film started...... And I went back in time....<br/><br/>I got my own personal peek at the highlights that molded this great band. I saw Rami Malek channel Freddie Mercury. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello become Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon. Lucy Boynton's touching portrayal of Mary Austin. And I felt as if I were THERE, if only for a moment. Liberties be damned!!<br/><br/>By the time the ""Live Aid"" sequence was shown, I was SOBBING. No, not shedding a tear or two, but outright MOURNING. In the original ""Live Aid"" performance, there's a brief moment where Freddie walks to the side of the stage for something, and one of the camera crew caught the true essence of Freddie. The REAL Freddie, showing the most authentic smile and utter happiness on his face. I remembered this as the movie ended, with ""Don't Stop Me Now"" as the outro. My son and his lady left as the credits were rolling, and I stayed. I needed to pull myself together. I'm glad I stayed. Suggestion: Don't leave before the credits are over!!<br/><br/>I believe Oscar nods should go to:
Best Score;
Best Costumes (some of which are authentic); and
Best Actor (Rami Malek)<br/><br/>This movie made me eat my words and warmed my heart. Thank you, Mr. May and Mr. Taylor, for sticking to your guns and making a beautiful film. I came home from the movie and immediately ordered the soundtrack (wonderful!), AND the BluRay. Who cares if there's no release date yet?<br/><br/>I am forever grateful to Queen. This is their legacy, and a beautiful one at that."

","This movie is a disappointment. Maybe the aggressive media campaign and the oscar nominations raised the bar too high, but the movie is just another movie about rise and falls and a narcissistic main character and his path to redemption.
Much energy was spent in accurately reproducing recorded moments of the bands life and in carefully mimicking Freddie Mercury, but in regards of feeling, acting and directing is a big letdown. The acting is mediocre and not only because of the actors but because of the screenplay and directing which fails to give acting any chance.
As a biographic movie it is ok and the fans of the band will enjoy it but as an artistic movie it is dull. It almost seems as a reconstitution like ones done by the police in crime investigations."

I'm 54 years old.

I then bought (well, my parents did) A night at the opera, Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart attack and listened to them over and over on my little record player.
I read every interview in NME and the other magazines at the time and was also in the official Queen Fan Club (I got SO excited when I saw the postman coming down the drive with an A4 size envelope in his hand!)

"jon.h.ochiai","10","11","17","18 November 2018"," Having 'Almost Everything'
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" soars to the heavens as the cinematic chronicle of the rise, fall and redemption of legendary rock band Queen and its charismatic lead singer Freddie Mercury, authentically inhabited by Rami Malek: The tragedy and joy of their iconic music. Yet, what touches foremost is the love story of Freddie and his soul mate Mary, played by radiantly strong Lucy Boynton.<br/><br/>While lying in bed together after Freddie dazzled in Queen's concert, he confesses to Mary that the only place where ""I'm not afraid"" is performing on stage. Mary loves Freddie. Still discovering his amazing voice through his music, he suffers in his inauthenticity, in his sexuality.<br/><br/>After returning from a lengthy Queen tour, Freddie discloses his sexuality to Mary. He says, ""You are almost everything..."" Mary is heartbroken. 'Almost' is never enough. That visceral sense of sadness resonates in Director Bryan Singer's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".<br/><br/>This very much is Bryan's film, although the studio fired him before the movie's completion. Another director completed the filming for theatrical release. Openly gay Bryan poignantly reminds: Finding and accepting your distinct voice is scary regardless of gay or straight. Announcing who you are to the world is terrifying for all of us. Bryan, Rami and Lucy compassionately say that we try to love ourselves and gift from what is within us. Freddie Mercury brilliantly did that.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury died of AIDS at 45 years old. I was a huge fan of Freddie back in high school. Freddie had flamboyant charisma and the voice of an angel. I found cathartic joy in Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""We Will Rock You"" or ""We Are the Champions"". Although, Queen's music represented freedom, it ironically cloaked Freddie's suffering: To be himself. In his journey Rami astounds as Freddie.<br/><br/>Accepting his life's deception, Rami's Freddie tells Mary in the pouring rain, ""I'm happy for you."" Lucy's tearful visage is her hope that Freddie discovers his own joy in life. Bryan Singer's narrative is about healing as Freddie sees what he has become and his fate. Rami is powerful vulnerability and humanity. You see his soulfulness in his eyes. You hear it in his voice. He beautifully regenerates the late Freddie's immortal sound. Rami expresses Freddie's vibrant spirit that captivated us all those years ago.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" begins in London with young design student and Heathrow baggage laborer Freddie. He's the son of the Parsi family, followers of the Zoroastrian faith. Traditional Father Bromi, played by solid Ace Bhatti, disapproves of his son's choice not to follow in his professional footsteps. Freddie wants to be a rock star.<br/><br/>His opportunity arises when guitar god Brian May, played by compassionately wise Gwilym Lee, needs a lead singer for his band. Brian and drummer Roger Taylor, played by spritely Ben Hardy, take a chance on Freddie. While joining the band, Freddie falls for beautiful kind Mary. Freddie eventually meets Paul, played by subversively charming Allen Leech, who reveals as the duplicitous seducer.<br/><br/>At times Anthony McCarten's screenplay veers into the indulgent excess of the 'rock star' life, coming across as caricature. Yet, his narrative has the authentic feel for the creation of music as when Brian stamps out the beat for ""We Will Rock You.""<br/><br/>In the end Anthony and Bryan create profound compassion for Freddie Mercury: Whether he is free to express his voice in the world, regardless of what others think. We care whether Freddie finds true love, again. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is full of sound, sadness, and joy. It will rock you, too."

I went to see this movie thinking it would be good and nice to hear the Queen songs within the film and to get an understanding of the history of the band and Freddie as I wasn't around to see this. What I didn't expect was to feel as if I had been catapulted back 30 years before I was born to the era of Queen and feel as if I was sat within a live Queen concert. All the cast are brilliant and it's actually, at times, a very funny film which really shows the loving family vibe which the band had for each other. Rami is amazing in this film. Every look at the camera and every strut mirrored freddie and many times I forgot I was watching a movie about Queen and that Rami wasn't the real Freddie on the screen in front of me. So proud of the cast. Give the film an Oscar and give Rami an Oscar. It will be well and truly deserved.

Personally I have been listening to Queen's music since i was about 10 or 11. I am so glad this tribute to Freddie and Queen was made. It is now one of my top 5 movies of all time!
P.S. If you need another proof how amazing Queen's music is - go to YouTube to 2017 Green Day's concert. Before it started 65000 crowd was singing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".

","After reading a lot of reviewers disagreeing with critics, I decided to read a couple myself. In short, the users are right. I'll try to explain why.<br/><br/>When a person approaches a movie, expectations play a huge role in creating the final impression. It's obvious from the way the reviews are written that critics expected an overblown drama, a gay anthem, or a politically correct liberal revelation. The film is neither of these and more importantly, it was never meant to be.<br/><br/>When you think of the movie, you need to remember who produced it--the band. They wanted a tribute to Fredie and Queen, a monument, a celebration. The drama is there, but the film does not try to think for the spectator, to make conclusions. Instead, it presents the events and lets you feel them from your own viewpoint. And that's a very brave thing to do from an artistic standpoint in today's world.<br/><br/>Just like Queen's life work, the movie features drama, comedy, documentalism, pure humanly fun, whit, and so much more. Think of it as the cinematographic counterpart of a Queen album, made by Queen, for Queen, and about Queen and simply enjoy it."

They pushed boundaries and believed in each other and what they were meant to do, which was inspire and play music for the people. They engaged in a way no one did at the time and this movie is a perfect example of showmanship and living for the dream. Rami Malek did a great job of ghosting Freddy, because he really came alive through him in an almost eery way.. I loved the fact that they used Freddy Mercuries real vocals, Insteae if giving Rami the impossible fast, as no one can sing like him, full stop.

And the greatest live performance in the history of rock and pop. That was so the right decision. It begins and ends with Queen's crowning glory, not with the tragedy or the tortured soul within that brilliant body.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is absolutely sensational. He is supported by other brilliant performances especially Lucy Boynton and Gwilym Lee as Freddie's wife Mary and Brian May respectively. But it's Malek who fittingly steals the show. What a performance.<br/><br/>I love it when a film defies the critics. Two fingers up to the miserable pen pushers. The cinema was packed. People were clapping and tapping along.<br/><br/>Go and see this. It's fabulous."
"kayleighmechan","10","12","19","1 November 2018"," An incredible, moving tribute to the greatest rock band, and the most fabulous man that was Freddie Mercury
","The word that comes to mind when thinking about this film is ""incredible"". It was educational, it was inspirational, it was entertaining and it moved me to the point of tears. I was either smiling, laughing, miming the lyrics (and guitar solos) of some of the incredible songs created by Queen, or I was holding back tears...and failing.<br/><br/>One thing I need to express is my deepest appreciation for Rami Malek. His performance as Freddie was absolutely incredible, and in the end where they re-enacted Queen's segment from the Live Aid concert, it did not feel as though I was watching an actor play the part of Freddie Mercury. It felt like I was watching Freddie himself, and for that I am truly grateful.<br/><br/>I cannot in any way, shape or form fault this film. I can only thank each and every person that was involved in the creation of Bohemian Rhapsody for piecing together such a moving tribute to the world's greatest rock band, and to a man who held such a massive heart with a lot of love to give.<br/><br/>Freddie will always live on, Queen will always live on, and this film has helped play a part in ensuring that happens.<br/><br/>Long live Queen."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","12","19","27 October 2018"," Rhapsody on the music of Queen
","Have a lot of appreciation for Queen. Not a favourite band of mine by all means, but it is difficult to not understand their importance and appeal. They had some iconic songs (namely ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""We Will Rock You"", ""We Are the Champions"" and ""Don't Stop Me Now"") and Freddie Mercury's immediately recognisable vocals and Brian May's virtuosic guitar playing were always out of this world.<br/><br/>'Bohemian Rhapsody' fascinated me when hearing about it and became most of my most anticipated films for the year. When hearing some negativity for the film, my expectations lowered a little, but saw it anyway because it did look and sound good. It did turn out to be a good decision, it is good to see that others here loved it and don't agree with the mixed critical reception respectfully.<br/><br/>Sure there are clichÃ©s (such as what some of the rest of Queen say) , but very few films are not and many are much worse in this regard. Like a lot of biopics, there are inaccuracies that may drive die-hard Queen fans into a frenzy, and the odd factual distortion, but again 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is not the first or worst film to do this and am going to judge it as a film on its own and not on a documentary level.<br/><br/>As a film on its own terms, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has an awful lot to admire. Getting the issues out of the way, the ones that could have been handled much better was the with the revelation of Freddie Mercury's AIDs diagnosis to the rest of the band, could have been done with more tact and less crass (like saying what it was a consequence of) and revealed too early and at the wrong time, and the implications with the phone ringing off post-taking centre stage that the event was a flop when it actually was a triumph.<br/><br/>Some of the early parts were a touch rushed as well, Mercury's ascent to stardom could have been less breakneck.<br/><br/>However, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is stylishly film and evokes the period beautifully. As to be expected, the songs are incredible and will be embedded in your brain for a long time, then again it is Queen of course. They are affectionately staged and performed in a way that made me remember what made me appreciate Queen in the first place.<br/><br/>Didn't find the script that simplistic or cliff-notes like, while there is a nice mix of moment of laughter, tension and tears and enough parts that entertained and informed, if not as in depth as it should. The story is never dull and the Live Aid depiction is both rousing and poignant. It's capably directed and while all the performances are fine if underused, it is Rami Malek's outstanding turn as Mercury that will live long in the memory, true to what made Mercury so interesting a person and performer without being an impersonation.<br/><br/>Concluding, impressively done and better than anticipated. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Paul08406","10","6","8","28 March 2019"," Terrific
","I was a huge Queen fan and this movie exceeded my high expectations. That seldom happens. I loved everything about this movie and I loved every minute of this movie."
"connerburnham","6","6","8","7 March 2019"," So much potential to be so much better
","Had potential but I was not impressed with its lack of edge and griity details. Rather it moved so quickly at times I could glance away to get my drink and an untold number of years had gone by. Felt like a rag to riches story or underdog who succeeds on his Jr. High sports team. One of the last scenes is of his performance from Live Aid that had all of Freddie's band mates gawking unabashed approval at him of how good he is felt contrived and insulting to my intelligence. Overall it was enjoyable but easy to pause to prepare dinner or answer a telemarketing call from a call bank in India."
"ron23-1","10","6","8","26 February 2019"," Rami Malek won the Oscar! Why it is another 10/10 on my list:
","I start with a part of my own story of life: I am an East German born, we had restrictions to travel to the west and to the western culture. But we were able to listen to the West German radio stations and to watch West German TV. It was an open secret. Even the fckg Stasi couldn't do anything against that. So ""Bohemian Rapsody"" was released when I was seven years old. I think the first Queen song I was aware sung by a band called Queen was ""We will rock you"". I was nine years old.
But smashs like ""Another one bites the dust"" or ""Under Pressure"" didn't find many sellers in (West-) Germany.
And then end of 1983 ""Radio Ga Ga "" came into my life. Wow! What a song! Queen used fat synthesizers that I already loved because bands like OMD, Depeche Mode or Yaz(oo). So I was 16 at the time ""The Works""-Album was released, with hits like ""Radio Ga Ga"", my Queen favourite of all time ""I want to break free"" or ""Hammer to fall"". Every playlist in every club, at every party contained Queen for sure. In the 80's you couldn't go anywhere without listening Queen songs, even in East Germany.
In 1986 Highlander OST followed including classics as ""A Kind of Magic"" or ""Who wants to live forever"". Then in 1989 Queen released ""The Miracle""-Album and smash hits as ""I want it all"", ""Breakthru"" and ""The Invisible Man"".
Less than a half year after its release the infamous, damned fckg Berlin wall fell. And a 22-year-old boy (who dreamed about and demonstrated for that in late '89) suddenly was free to travel and to do anything he wants. Me.
One of the first CDs I bought after was ""Greatest Hits I"", so I learned to know ""Under Pressure"" and others.
So we come to my words about this brilliant movie. Rami Malek's performance is outstanding, awesome, breathless, whatever in this direction. I already loved him in the ""Mr. Robot"" series. On Sunday, two days ago, he won an Oscar for his Freddie Mercury acting in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Enough said. Great!
So often you think of the real Freddie automatically. Rami here IS Freddie!
And all the band members were great in their acting and they looked like the originals! And all the support actors did a great job too! Perfect. PERFECT!
My last three 10/10 ratings were How to train a Dragon? (2010), One Life (Animal documentary) (2011) and Ted (2012).
Until this film. I have to give it 10 out of 10. No fills, not a single boring second, a perfect biopic.
Thank you for reading this :)
And PS: I tried my best in English."
"astrikort","5","6","8","24 February 2019"," Not what I expected.
","Had high expectations for the movie because I'm a huge Queen fan, but sadly the movie was mediocre. This movie seemed like it tried to do everything, tell the story of freddie, tell the story of Queen from their point of view, but it did nothing completely right.<br/><br/>The acting was incredible from Rami Malek and the fact that it's about queen and you listen to their songs all the time in the movie, saved it from being completely unwatchable.<br/><br/>If you love queen you will probably like it but if we are completely honest it's not a good movie."

"winstonwolf81","9","6","8","5 February 2019"," Remi Malek will rock you
","Wow....<br/><br/>This was the most moving performance of a character I have ever seen in a long long time.<br/><br/>Remi Malek is literally perfect as the late great Freddie Mercury. Everything from his mannerisms to his voice. There is such a vulnerability to his performance, the emotion pours out of him in every scene, whether he has thousands in the palm of his hand on stage, or the loneliness and heartbreak in search of acceptance and companionship. Remy elicits the utmost emotion from every scene.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury defied the critics when he wanted to be something other than a rock band. The greatest front man of all time, a national treasure. The same can now be said of Remy Malek. A Hugely talented actor with the world at his feet. Best Actor is a must for him. Fully deserved."

","I have loved Queen and loved Freddy ever since i can remember. When i was about 10 years old i saw Queen at live aid on the TV and that was it, i fell inlove with Freddy. The charisma on that man, the AMAZING voice, self confidence and power that he had, no one else will ever have. He was and is the greatest singer, rock star, composer and talent that ever walked this earth. No one will be as good as him and the band itself. This movie showed it perfectly , made me fall inlove all over again. The live aid bit in the end was perfectly made, absolutely brilliant!!!"

"tylinti","9","6","8","18 January 2019"," Great. Shining.
","I liked it, but... It's actually probably the first movie that I ""finished"" in theatre - I sat to the very end, till the very end of the title roll (Even heard the cleaning lady say that after this movie they don't have much cleaning to do, audience is very well behaved) In terms of Oscars: best picture - nope. Best actor - definitely yes. Malek was a great choice, did a fantastic job. It seems like he is not doing much, he is not to forcing ""his own Freddy"" and that works wonderfully. He looks very realistic, he manages to be Malek/Freddy - both, not too much into the role to become a parody, but well enough to be very believable. I think it's great. He simply shines in this role. And yes, it's a movie about a character, but others doesn't shine that much. Even if this is a biography movie, I somehow missed some interesting camera work/director's decisions, something unexpected (not something as outrageous as Loving Vincent, but something unique, some twist, something that would make biography movie stand out in terms of making it - now they just let Malek shine (and bathe in his light)) - there was a moment of a split screen, but that's about it. And the whole story was more or less linear. Live Aid scene was aaaaaamazing. Will definitely see the records, videos, it seems it was hell of an event. Also there were loads of discussions that AIDS and his orientation weren't properly addressed in the movie - I liked it. F. Mercury wasn't his disease or his orientation - he was the music he made, his passion was to create, but that's still up for the discussion. So... What did you think?<br/><br/>P.S That first scene, when he is working in the airport and is called Pakistani and explains he is not, and when later Paul, in some talk show says that he knows Freddy so much and that he always was a ""Paki"" boy was great"
"george.schmidt","9","6","8","15 January 2019"," Malek is uncanny in this hearfelt biopic/origin story of Freddie Mercury and Queen
","BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY (2018) ***1/2 Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Allen Leech, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers, Aaron McMusker. Malek is uncanny as iconic rock god Freddie Mercury in this rousing biopic and origin story of the group Queen with its charismatic life-force full center and fully fleshed out thanks to Peter Morgan and Anthony McCarten's heartfelt screenplay and Bryan Singer's incredible direction (particularly in the bookending of their memorable performance at Live-Aid)."
"jadongarcia","8","6","8","15 January 2019"," The music contains power that no film can deliver like this one.
","First of, Rami Malek was born for this role, I'm sure that Freddie Mercury would be pleased with Rami's performance. The music is powerful, it was stuck in my head for weeks after I saw it in the cinema, but the way the story was told was exquisitely incredible and moving. During the Live Aid performance when Freddie's former wife teared up during the song ""We are the Champions"" so did I, the passion that Freddie had for it simply undeniable and at the same time heartbreaking because we don't have singers like him today who feel the same about music.<br/><br/>Not only did Rami deserve the Golden Globe award but he and the film itself deserve an oscar. Bravo performance from him and the music, the way it was portrayed."
"senaoz","9","6","8","20 December 2018"," Rhapsody of Malek
","Bohemian Rhapsody<br/><br/>This film is mostly about Freddie Mercury's life and poorly it narrates the story of the band 'Queen'. However, the film evokes emotions. It's a must see movie even if you are not a Queen fan because it shows the realities about the misfits' lives and how to never give up. Considering these reasons, maybe this film should have been produced before for guiding how to be open-minded.<br/><br/>Also, I truly loved the acting of 'Rami Malek'. He insanely looked alike 'Freddie Mercury' in the film. After watching the film, I watched the real 'Live Aid Concert' and I taught that Rami Malek's performance was exactly the same with Freddy Mercury's."

"dcmccrae","10","6","8","22 November 2018"," So much better than expected - one of my favourite all-time films now
","I saw the film, not knowing any critic or public reviews. I expected a good film - but what I got was a fantastic experience, that few films of any genre deliver these days.<br/><br/>I am not even a Queen fan - I am 51 at time of writing so grew up knowing and liking many of their hits since I was a kid in the 70s. I have bought only a few of their greatest hits albums over the years. However, I always understood what fans saw in the band, appreciated the many catchy hits, and felt Freddie Mercury one of the best showman and singers of 'our' time.<br/><br/>Now, I know the Queen Live Aid performance pretty well; have seen it many times and could never get over how in such a short time any band can command a crowd's attention so superbly and emotionally (and a crowd that is not even a Queen fanbase, at that). What the film did with this performance was absolutely astonishing, from the obvious stage coverage of the band, which was brilliantly done (right down the the Pepsi and beer on the piano, and Freddie playing with the camera man) to the swoops over the stadium, the whole stage layout, and the crowd close-ups singing along. This whole segment was pristine film-making.<br/><br/>The film, at the beginning, gives a teaser of the Live Aid performance, and then hops back to the start of the band's formation and Freddie's story as the main thread. Everything feels well-paced; we get glimpses of various songs in the making, the recording, the concerts, the band arguments and of course the many surrounding characters that make up the story - the managers, girlfriends, record execs, hangers-on and so on. All are well played and I felt there is a good balance between the personal, the music and the show-biz elements of the story. I could have done with a bit more focus on more songs and studio time, but accept they can only pack in so much. Now, evidently things are not portrayed 100% as they really happened; perhaps he didn't sing in the car park; perhaps they didn't split up and reunite exactly in the way depicted - but does that really matter? There will be plenty of documentaries that fill that gap just fine. This is entertainment first and foremost.<br/><br/>The casting was spot on in every respect except perhaps Bob Geldof (I felt they could have done a bit better with him, but he is a very particular type, so must have been tricky). All the band are excellently played - and without a doubt Rami as Freddie is a performance that you don't often see. He nails it in so many ways - and there are many facets to nail, it is hard to imagine any actor getting all of it right - the gestures, the voice, the looks, the concert showman-ship, the overall personality. I hope he gets what he deserves for all that hard work, and I'm sure we will see a lot more of him in future (quite how he will top this I don't know though).<br/><br/>There is no doubt I will be getting some kind of DVD with Bonus Materials when it is available (hope they do a good 'making of'), and enjoying this film many times in future. As for now, I have added 'A Night at the Opera' on vinyl to my Christmas list for Santa. My first Queen record.<br/><br/>Go and see this film is you have any interest in rock music of the 70s and 80s at all, even if Queen was not your thing. You'll love it."

It respects the artist and his personality. he was a real sunshine who wanted to see people happy around him and you can feel it inside the movie theater.
It's not like all the rock stars that you see how they went to drug and the dark side of their personality, it really shows him as a human being with mistakes and defects but a great personality to always be loyal to himself and others.
Rami Malek is truly a great actor, I totally got into the character even if I know hom from two other roles.
I couldn't believe I would get out of this movie theater and kind of love life and think that weeeeeeeee are the champions my friend ;)

","I got to watch the movie last night and try as I might, the movie just won't let me be. It is as if Bohemian Rhapsody has been tickling my soul ever since.
Rami Malek has lived the role! Boy, how convincing was he! You kind of forget that you are only watching some guy play Freddie Mercury. There is no Rami Malek in here. There's just Freddie. The same goes for the other members of the band, especially Gwilym Lee. It's really hard to tell the difference between him and Brian May.
Whether you are a Queen fan or not, you probably agree with me that there is no better live performance than Queen's performance at Live Aid and the way it all culminated in the end, it would really be difficult for you to not shed a tear, even if you are heartless. That performance right at the end, even your goosebumps would get goosebumps and the movie is filled with many a moment like that.
This isn't just a movie. This is a celebration of the life of one of the greatest legends that ever walked the earth. You must watch the movie. I'm sorry. You must experience* the movie. Calling the experience surreal would be an understatement.
When the song came out back then, it got panned by the critics. Guess what, they turned out to be wrong. Utterly.
When the movie came out now, it got panned by the critics. And guess what, they turned out to be wrong again.
They are all just a bunch of losers with loser opinions.
And as the song goes, ""No time for losers cuz we are the champions of the world!""
Chuck the critics.

Rami Malik is hillariously camp as Freddie, the guys who play Brian May and Roger Taylor are both very close lookalikes (as is the John Deacon actor who also sports the dodgy ""afro"" hairstyle) and there is some very funny dialogue throughout. However the guy who makes this film is Malik, a real gem of a performance and he carries & deploys the persona of Freddie brilliantly. I understand that there has been a degree of manipulation between fact and fiction in places, but this ""poetic licence"" is ok unless you are an uber pedant.
Bottom line .. if you love Queen ignore the critics and see this movie."

P.S. I have now seen this movie 6 times, its just wonderful. I noted that at the end of each showing the cinema audience didnt move from their seats until the credits were over, says it all!!

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","32","60","30 October 2018"," Not quite 'Bohemian Rhapsody', more like 'I'm In Love With My Car': undeniably entertaining but ultimately quite shallow.
","'Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)' does feel like it's trying to do a deep-dive on Mercury himself, showing the highs, lows and everything in-between in an attempt to humanise him, to show the man behind the musical myth. It never quite manages to do so, however, despite a blistering lead performance. It always seems to just scrape the surface of the man's psyche, only occasionally dipping a little deeper into his inner workings but still never really coming close to painting a clear picture of his out-of-spotlight self. Instead of focusing fully on this, the piece just glosses past important moments and relationships in order to get back to the 'fun' stuff, ultimately coming across as pretty shallow (especially when you stop to think about it). Thankfully, though, that 'fun stuff' consists of a series of admittedly check-list and narratively flimsy, yet undeniably entertaining, scenes in which we're treated to the origin of several key Queen tracks and then given a performance of each of them, or even a full twenty-minute live-aid concert, all presented in ear-pleasing surround-sound. The only downside to these sequences is that the actors are lip-syncing the songs, despite having performed them properly on the day. While this allows us to hear Queen in all their glory, it does take away from the believability of the picture in some key moments and gives off an ever-so-slightly disingenuous feel; the characters in the film aren't the same as their real-life counterparts, no matter how well they represent them, and they aren't really singing. Still, as I mentioned, hearing these songs blasted from a cinema-quality sound-system is a treat; it really is difficult not to smile when they're being played. It's not like the film is ever unenjoyable, either, even in its most 'check-list' or hollow of moments. It also doesn't scream ""troubled production"", despite being the very definition of the term behind-the-scenes. The most you can tell it's a tale of two (or three) minds is in the sometimes strange post-production choices, which are clearly Fletcher's doing. Overall, while the movie isn't always deep, it definitely could've been deeper, and it strangely misses out a significant chunk of its star's life, it's ultimately an entertaining time that will certainly please fans of the band. 6/10"
"catsgarden","4","20","35","8 November 2018"," Watching this movie was like drinking a stale, flat beer.
","Watching this movie was like drinking a flat, stale beer. it was too expensive to ditch, but I wasn't enjoying it, and I felt no buzz (despite any 'oscar buzz'). It's very poorly constructed, with most of the scenes being fabricated fiction rather than fact (so don't get excited; it never happened that way).<br/><br/>I rarely felt like I was watching Freddie Mercury. Only in a few concert scenes shot from a distance. The buck teeth prosthetic was too extreme, and kept distracting me (freddie's weren't as pronounced), as did the grey/blue eyes of the actor (Freddie's were very dark brown). It was very hard for me to believe that this blue-eyed Caucasian was Indian. They really should have cast an Indian actor, because in scenes with his family, he looks like he was adopted. However, I did think that the actors who played the drummer and lead guitarist did exceptional jobs. They and the actress who plays Mary were the only thing worth watching. (Though Mike Myer's appearance was entertaining as well.)<br/><br/>I was very disappointed in this movie. It could have been so much better. But it's basically a collection of mediocre Youtube videos from a mediocre tribute act.<br/><br/>Three stars are for the star performances of Gwilim Lee, Ben Hardy, and Lucy Boynton, and a half-star for Mike Meyers (entertaining, but too similar to the Shrek voice). The rest all combined was only worth a half star.<br/><br/>The biggest let down of all, is how they chose to fabricate series of events, rather than portray them accurately,which was way more interesting and entertaining than the fictional series of events they came up with."

HOW ON EARTH could the producers ( Executive Producers May and Taylor i should note )get them performing songs on a tour that were written 7 years later???

first of all he dont have half of the charisma that freddie did and to be fair he is to darn ugly in the role, not that freddie was all that pretty but he looked lightyears better than malek did in his portrayal and to be honest, freddy was a gay symbol and has been for centuries but malek is too gay, he is almost pathetic. He looks missplaced in almost every scene of the film.. i think macho is the word that describes freddie the best but for maleks portayal he falls flat and i cant understand why both paul and bryan said that it was almost like freddie was still alive, they of all should recognise the big differses between freddie and malek.

I just thought it might a and interesting way to past some time. at the local discount theater. It was minding blowing. I went into the theatre hoping to see a movie, and what i had was an experience ! I won't get into the production quality and the great acting in the film other reviewers have discussed that at length. but i will say is that the music was so great and the story so inspiring it was amazing! I am now and actual queen fan. Now i not only understand why queen is considered by many to be the greatest band of of all time
and why they gained the undying love of so many. This simply was one of the most inspiring huminist stories i had ever seen,and what has to be one of the most epic tales in entertainment history. The only other biopic a have ever seen that was this warm,human,epic,and inspiring was Dragon the bruce lee story. If this movie doesn't ,make you feel good on a certain level and inspire you bittersweet as it is, something is wrong. Awesome movie saw it 4 days ago and still can't stop thinking about it!

Some critics are being very critical of this film, they obviously have barely got a pulse.

","Queens music was, is & always shall be fantastic. The late great Freddie Mercury was such an incredible talent & is still sadly missed to this day by his friends, family & many fans.<br/><br/>Sadly this film is very low production quality. Its more of a Lifetime TV movie of the week than cinematic story. The direction is terrible & very disjointed. So is the confused editing. Story is very weak & the screenplay is utterly appalling. It gives the actors nothing to work with & makes the 4 Queen band members appear as bland 1 dimensional impersonations with zero charisma.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury was an incredible talent but here he is depicted as a selfish & unlikeable diva. The actor playing him is pretty weak & unconvincing to me.<br/><br/>Brian May is another incredible musical talent & is given literally nothing to do in the movie despite being at least 50% of Queens success story.<br/><br/>Same for Roger Taylor he comes across as a very unlikeable serial womaniser. The real Roger is nothing like that!<br/><br/>John Deacon is given so little to work with & depicted as a dumb buffoon. The real John Deacon is a highly skilled musician!<br/><br/>I am shocked May & Taylor allowed this movie to go ahead its not flattering to them & just serves as a music company promo docudrama rather than a proper tell a story about the band cinematic movie event.<br/><br/>Massive letdown for me as a lifelong Queen fan."

This seemed very watered down; like a version of Queen's story you could tell your 10 year old. The music of course was a lot of fun throughout. I think Rami's performance was good.

","I had my first child in 1983. Before that, I was a boba-fide, dancing, rock n roll girl who went to as many concerts as I could possibly afford. Saw The Rolling Stones a couple of times, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, etc. I never got to see Queen, and that's left a kind of hole in my rant history. Ahaha! I was excited to see the movie because I loved them then, raised my kids with RnR, and they know almost every word to every song...and so do THEIR 8 $ 10 year old kids!
I know the critics have been pretty lukewarm (to say the least) about the movie, because there wasn't enough time spent on the ""angst"" that Freddy must have had about being gay, the AIDS crisis and his eventual death from it.
I don't know, maybe it's a generational thing, but, unlike most critics of movies today, I got the message about all of those angsty things just fine, and in the proper perspective. Of course his music was impacted by his life - how could it not? But I was happy to not have to watch him at the moment he actually contracted the disease...the music was the important thing here, and wow...out of the park! By the end of the Live Aid concert, which felt unbelievably REAL, my husband & I, as well as other members of the audience, were weeping and singing and laughing, those all brought on by the power of the music, the stories & people behind the music, the actors' portrayals of the band (I had to keep reminding myself that they were not the actual band members!) and the sort of naive dawning of the realization of just how much impact those guys have had on our society...not just on music, but in so many aspects besides. And for less than $10 a ticket, it's a helluva concert!"

","Not just a movie but a celebration of music ,of rock, of Queen! Stunning performance of Rami Malek as Freddie, in a film with too many emotions. Music wins; we need more movies like this one. Best picture of the year for me.
About bad reviews, critics forget that it's not easy for a bio-film especially without some dynamic plot to spread all this passion and joy to the audience so successfully.
If you haven't gone to the theatres yet, you HAVE TO; it's an experience of a lifetime.

","I read a lot of critics and there will always people who manage it to get offended by the fact that the movie does not follow the complete story of Mercury's life, but thats why its called a movie and not a documentary. Its romanticized. Just like every movie existing. Although it's already said like a thousand times, they did an amazing job on the casting. I'm still convinced Brian May played himself. John Deacon was nailed as well. The production also really focused on details, they even made Ben Hardy, the actor who played Roger Taylor, look older than he actually is during the Live Aid scene by getting him wrinkles underneath his eyes. Just because Taylor was around his 40's at that time while the actor is like 25 years old or something like that. Not to mention Rami Malek as Freddie was brilliant I just have no words for it. (Oscar?) I have already seen the movie 3 times in the cinema and it was worth the money just to notice some fine details the movie includes. I wont mention them all because it would take a year to write them down. Nevertheless, I didnt enjoy a movie this much since a very long time. Highly recommended!!"

Fortunately, my worries were wrong and I enjoyed it a lot. The music was great (as it could be different when Queen is playing), the cast was relly great - it was like seeing real Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon.

This is really a wonderful movie, well built, the plot is perfectly written and the protagonist is fantastic in his interpretation of Freddy Mercury.
Each part of his life is told and explained without being excessive, especially in those aspects regarding sex, drugs and illness. I cried a lot, especially at the end, because the pathos is very high. The final scene of the Live Aid concert is magnific and totally aderent to te reality.

"spantonwalker","8","7","10","26 November 2018"," Brilliant.
","Being a fan of many genres of music, and my obsession with the life of musicians, makes every movie like this, which tells the stories of bands and artists, very exciting for me. Being young, I never saw Freddie Mercury live, and have only really seen him in footage from concerts and short snippets of interviews. Yet, from them alone, the clear confidence and the fiery, showman like nature of Freddie Mercury, made me believe, that being yourself, and thriving under that, can give you a huge chance of being successful.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I had heard a lot of things about how this movie failed to show the flair that Queen and Freddie Mercury possessed. And that the changes of director and cast members meant that this movie didn't have the identity that a movie about Queen needed.<br/><br/>However, I felt that it was quite the opposite. This movie told the story of how Queen rose and peaked, with many set backs along the way. It also showed how important each member of the band was, in grounding and supporting fellow members when needed.<br/><br/>A story that had the right tone was key for this movie. There were scenes that were were over the top in some moments, but it worked. The loud, glistening perfomances worked well against the sometimes quite life of these artists. So the odd eccentric moment gave the sense of duality that a movie needed. The success of this movie was mainly down to superb performances across the board. Rami Malek was incredible as Freddie Mercury. Incredible. His ability to portray the duality of Freddie, the fiery showman like nature that I mentioned before, on stage and in front of any type of crowd against the slightly subdued man, that hid when he was confronted emotionally. Rami Maleks emotional timing, and superb use of body language meant he dominated the screen every time he was in shot. This performance was supported fantastically by the other cast members, who all made this movie seem like a documentary.<br/><br/>Being a musician, this movie constantly inspired me. Especially the sequence where the band made Bohemian Rhapsody, my favourite Queen song. The transition from the intimidating first world tour, to a quiet country home, with just the band made me made me feel part of it. Followed by a sequence that showed a band that feared nothing, and one that wanted to test the industry. Incredible film, once again driven by impeccable performances, making it feel even more real.<br/><br/>A must see for everyone, especially those who need inspiration, and a confidence boost. All helped by the infectious vibrant aura, that came from Rami Maleks Oscar worth performance As Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that there wasn't enough!!!"

","Bohemian Rhapsody great film and by far one of my favourite films of the year such a great story and some great acting performances i would recommend this for any Queen fan.<br/><br/>The performances in this film where amazing were amazing especially Rami Malek who played Freddie Mercury did an excellent job and looked exactly like him and he played the role perfectly in my opinion.<br/><br/>There some excellent moments in the movie and some where very emotional and for a Queen seeing what he went through and learning his story was incredible and i shed a couple of tears during the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was also really well directed and showing the live performances the band was incredible and it felt like i was there watching the band live all those years ago.
You can tell everyone put all there passion in this movie and it was brilliant.<br/><br/>Now some of the movie was historically incorrect ive heard from other Queens fans that how he got Aids and how he found out played out differently in real life than it did in the movie so for Queen purists that can be annoying but it does not ruin the movie.<br/><br/>A great movie with great performances that i enjoyed from start to finish i also loved the Live Aid performance scene that was just perfect and really showed that Freddie was the best live performer and no one could play a crowed like he could.
They dont make Musicians like that anymore.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.3/10 Just a great movie with great performances and i would recommend it to any fan of Queen."

","Critics seem to have wanted a movie about a gay man, and while Freddie was gay, that wasn't (as the movie brilliantly portrays) his entire identity. It delves into as many aspects of Freddies personality, his relationships, his hardships and his triumphs as possible in the space of 2 hours. Rami Malek's research into Freddie and all his mannerisms paid off in an epic performance. There were parts that were missing to do with the bands struggles and the last 7 years of Freddies life, but that is to be expected within the time frame of a 2 hr movie that attempts capture the period of his life as lead singer of Queen.<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic, captivating movie much like the protagonist himself."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is a celbration of Queen and it's extraordinary lead singer Freddy Mercury who became a rock icon with his personality and his on stage presence and the soul that he brought to rock music in the 70s and in the 80s and he has been brought back to life as the film shows the rise of the band and what leads them up to their famous preformance at live Aid. Rami Malek portrays Freddy Mercury and he does a hell of a job bringing of the most beloved stage preformer back to life and he gets all of Freddy's mannerisms perfect and you can tell that they put a lot of love into making Freddy be shown as who he was and how he was with the other members of the band and it's brilliant and I really enjoyed the preformance. More of the cast is Lucy Boynton {Mary Austin}, Gwilym Lee {Brian May}, Ben Hardy {Roger Taylor},
Joseph Mazzello {John Deacon}, Aidan Gillen {John Reid}, Allen Leech {Paul Prenter}, Tom Hollander {Jim Beach},Mike Myers {Ray Foster} and Aaron McCusker {Jim Hutton} The cast works so well at portraying the real people and they perfectly capture the personalities of the real people and it's really awesome to see the perfection put into these people.
Did I love Bohemian Rhapsody yes defenitly I thought that it was amazing and it was worth waiting for as a Queen fan I couldn't stop smiling every part was so perfect and the use of the music was even better and I think this is my favorite movie of this year and everything was so perfect that i would gladly watch it mulitple times and long live Queen and their amazing music."

The casting was astounding, the performances (especially from the four actors representing the members of Queen) was superlative - It is proof positive that you do not need explosions and car chases to have a truly memorable movie experience.

The film brilliantly depicts the troubled life of Frederick (Farouk) Bulsara as he tried to understand who he really was, The time-line is not accurate, but so what!

","Rami Malek's representation of Freddie Mercury was stunning and completely unexpected. The critics were wrong in 1975 when they first heard Bohemian Rhapsody, and they're wrong about it now. Admittedly, the movie offered little to no elaboration on the backstory of Mary Austin, Brian May and other significant characters, but BoRhap is the story of how a poor Pakistani boy went from working as a baggage handler to being the lead singer of one of the biggest rock bands in history. I suppose this may be due to the inherent disinterest of director Bryan Singer and how he continually disappeared from set on days end. There are defects in the movie. There are plot holes and perhaps not enough angst as I personally would have liked, but no movie is perfect. For a singer such as Freddie Mercury-it was nothing short of everything I wanted."

","I postponed watching this movie for a while because I was afraid it wouldnÂ´t come close to my expectations. I have seen a few bad biograpic flicks. And I wouldnÂ´t say IÂ´m a die hard Queen fan, but I really appreciate their work, their contribution to the music and entertainment industry. They have a few songs that are my absolute favourites and just last summes I went to the Adam Lambert Queen concert and it was amazing.
I began hearing a lot of feedback from people that went to the movies and saw the Bohemian Rhapsody and all of the feedback was that this movie is somekind of magic and totally the best thing ever. Then I decided as a movie buff I canÂ´t go on without seeing it myself. And well...the 2 hours and 10 minutes of this movie felt more like 30 minutes of a whirlwind of emotions. And I have seen a lot of great and not so great movies in my lifetime, still this one gets a solid 10 points from me. Ofcourse the major part of it is because of Rami Malek who I think gave an oscar-worthy performance, who studied so thoroughly every essence of Freddie Mercury and who managed to make every scene with him bright and interesting. Even the scenes with him just staring at something or someone conveyed such deep emotions that I really felt it all. I felt his pain, his sorrow, his ambition and literally everything there was to feel. Someone should make a video of peopleÂ´s facial expressions who watch this movie for the first time.

I was around and kick myself for never making it to a concert. You know how it is, ""I'll see them next time around"" except in my case there was no next time. For me the movie was much more then just a movie. It was a time machine. It sort of makes up for the concert that I never seen.<br/><br/>Everything that I thought about and liked about the band came through very well in this movie. The depiction of Freddy as a larger than life character front man to the band holds true to what I would expect.

"matthewssilverhammer","6","7","10","9 November 2018"," Movie's Not As Wonderfully Weird As The Band
","Inimitable rock band Queen and their once-in-a-lifetime front-man Freddie Mercury have stood apart from the fray of classic rock artists by two royally distinct attributes: their bombast and their weirdness. Their bombast, as represented by the giant guitar crunches in ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" or the soaring choral harmonies in ""We Are the Champions"", is on full display in Bohemian Rhapsody. Unfortunately, their weirdness, as represented by the opera influences in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or the uncharacteristic rockabilly in ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", is sorely missing.
The film focuses on Mercury specifically, from his early days with the band in college, through their unlikely assent into worldwide superstardom, to his final days fighting AIDS. Obviously, the casting of Mercury is crucial, and Rami Malek is flamboyant, magnetic and downright incredible. His movements and personality are Mercury through-and-through, and the pain underneath his larger-than-life aura is beautiful. It's a cliché, but I honestly got lost in his performance to the point of forgetting it wasn't Freddie himself I was watching.
As for the film in whole, it's a typical, sing-by-numbers, greatest-hits version of a musical biopic. If you've seen any number of other similar films (Ray, Straight Outta Compton, Walk the Line), then you know the type: setup the sad family/home life, hit the career highlights, present a downfall, then finally crescendo into a final celebration. It's a formula as old as G chord - C chord - D chord - repeat. Still, Bohemian Rhapsody uses its formula well. And when it narrows in on the music of Queen itself, all complaints are thrown away in favor of sheer swaggering enjoyment."
"kate-14953","10","7","10","6 November 2018"," The critics have got this one so wrong!
","Absolutely brilliant biopic of Queen.<br/><br/>As a fan of Queen and musician, I was so happy and buzzing walking out of the cinema. The film honours the memory of Freddie and the rest of the band, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor and puts the music front and centre.<br/><br/>The music is as fresh as if you've just heard it for the first time. As you would hope, they did a brilliant job in the sound department (I know May and Taylor were heavily involved). It's bold, fresh and punchy and you feel like you've been to a Queen gig. I think this is a major part of why audiences are connecting with the film.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is incredible as Freddie, at times you think it is him. I also loved Joe Mazzello's portrayal of John Deacon, again, he really is him! The actors really do a superb job and fully inhabit these roles - fantastic casting. The film really 'gets' Queen's band dynamics, has a deep understanding them, and also what it is to be a musician.<br/><br/>As a Brit, it also just simply makes you proud!<br/><br/>The critics have completely missed the point of this film. I didn't need a gritty, hard-hitting netflix style drama involving all the gruesome details. This film sets out to celebrate Queen's artistry - and does rather a good job of it too."

"shitsandhits","1","46","94","15 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that excels in mediocrity.
","With a lack of substance in tandem with a stale presentation, this film left me bored and pissed off. Simply put Bohemian Rhapsody is the worst film I have seen all year and left me not only wanting to see Sacha Baron Cohen's Queen film but literally any other director take the helm but the utterly incompetent Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that depicts the story of Queen and primarily Freddie Mercury, from the origins of the band all the way to their performance at Live Aid in 1985. It shows many of the band most iconic moments like their global tours and the creation of of the titular song Bohemian Rhapsody. It attempts to show the dynamic of the members, the rise and eventual fall of the band. I say attempt intentionally because in my opinion this film fundamentally fails at building any form of compelling narrative. Firstly I want to point out two things, I am not the final judge on whether this film does justice to Queen or justice to Freddie Mercury. I don't know the band personally and I'm not informed enough on the story to make that decision. I also wanted to say that I have heard various reports on how inaccurate the film is and whatnot . I am not in tune enough with the story to know how severe these inaccuracies are and personally I have no issue with a film creating creative liberties to improve itself.<br/><br/>A biopic should be more interesting than the story it is trying to tell already is. Take for example First Man, this biopic of Neil Armstrong is true to life certainly but you also get a grasp of who Armstrong was, visually the film is stunning and the characters and script is well written and entertaining. This gives me a reason to watch the film rather than just read the Wikipedia page. The same cannot be said for Bohemian Rhapsody which I honestly just found boring. There are many reasons as to why it is boring but it mostly comes down to the pacing for me. The film is way too long and is tortuously boring. There is long segments where very little happens and as it trudged along at a snails pace I could only marvel at how little substance was stretched out to a two hour film. Not only is this film severely lacking in much quantity but also in any form of general artistic direction. It constantly feels pointless and as though it doesn't even know what it's building towards. This creates what I feel is the real issue of the film, the fact that it's just not entertaining. It is merely fun in the sense that you can look at bright colours and listen to Queen music for two hours.<br/><br/>I really was hoping that Rami Malek would ,perhaps not save this film, but at least pull it up a bit and I don't think he necessarily did a bad job, I thought his mannerisms and voice inflections were masterfully performed. However I think Malek couldn't really give it his all with the script he had. I had a major issue with the script and I saw vividly how far it dragged the film down. I am not entirely sure if the film uses real dialogue from the band or not but it all sounded incredibly over dramatic and overtly simply written. For a film that had real people to base itself on, it really cannot create compelling or fun characters. Now I'm not the verdict on whether these characters are true to life or not however I do think they are vitally flawed and miss a lot of the steps in character based narrative. An amazing example of this is Brian May who in the film serves no other purpose other than he was actually there in real life, after two hours I still have no clearer image of who this character is or what significance he has in the story other than playing guitar. The most perplexing part about this is that this is a common theme for every single character. I was astounded to find absolutely no well written or interesting characters. This is particularly surprising when it comes to the larger than life Freddie who is written off as simply cartoonish. Firstly it does not help that all the character speak in simplistic dialogue that is only ever funny or openly only existent to move the plot along. Although the plot does focus around Freddie, I never really felt as though his character was being really developed or explored. The film always feels more like it's just moving along his life like a slideshow.<br/><br/>Overall this film is just lazy and does whatever it can to ensure it draws in as much money as possible while still remaining ""fun"" and ""eccentric"". For example, the film has no original score, it only plays Queen music. I understand why some people may be confused as to why I want to bring this up, why it is such a big deal. The reason why I think it's so distracting is because it means that throughout the film either the music hasn't been matched to the scene properly because they desperately want to play a Queen song or the scene is oddly quiet because they couldn't find a Queen song to match it. I'm not suggesting the film ditches the Queen soundtrack altogether but it still should use some form of backing track to fill in scenes and compliment the film on a smaller scale. I have various other nitpicks to this degree. All of the scenes with Freddie singing are really distracting because it is clear that Rami Malek is not singing. Now I have no issue with him not singing but the film shows close ups of his face during concert scenes and doesn't even attempt to mask that it's not Rami Malek singing. I've seen a lot of people talking about how the ending is fantastically shot and it feels like you're actually at the Live Aid concert and I absolutely disagree. I felt the CGI was terrible and made it feel incredibly plastic and false and the cinematography was barely mediocre and showed nothing new or special. I also feel that during this scene and other concerts, the songs are cut off at quite odd times that ruin the scenes pacing. Overall this makes the concert scenes an odd mash up of weirdly edited music and false looking CGI where it has no place being.<br/><br/>I definitely think there is potential in the Queen story, I think there are incredibly eccentric and compelling characters to be shown and there is potential for an epic story of the rise and fall of these titans. However even though given all of this on a silver platter Bryan Singer fell flat on his face and made a boring drag of a film. I understand some people say the film is just trying to be fun. Firstly the heavy dramatization and characterization of Freddie (albeit an incredibly basic one) shows it is trying to be somewhat a serious drama. Even if I am just wrong and am ""reading too much into it"" and it is in fact just a fun Queen film, it failed as it is drawn out and boring. The film isn't exactly shockingly terrible in terms of cinematography it is mediocre, however due to the extreme lack of substance and poor pacing this standardized cinematography does nothing to make the film anything more than abismal. The flashy advertising and idea of this film may coerce you into seeing it but it is honestly the worst film I have seen all year and not worth your money. This absolutely incompetent film offers nothing more than only the information of the band matched with a Queen soundtrack and some flashy colours behind it."

","Farokh Bulsara joins pop group Smile. They change their name to Queen, he changes his name to Freddie Mercury, and off we go.<br/><br/>This biopic of Queen and, especially, its flamboyant frontman ends with a recreation of their (full) triumphant performance at Live Aid, and that's fitting - the story doesn't need to go part that point: it is a satisfactory climax.<br/><br/>There is a lot of music, and the credits show it to be Queen rather than soundalikes. The visual performances matched with the music are uncannily faithful, from all four actors. The resemblances are satisfactory rather than accurate - even Rami Malek, notwithstanding some fabulous prosthetic teeth, doesn't actually look that much like Freddie.<br/><br/>But, by havens, he captures him. His speaking voice is particularly good: the accent and vocal inflections are spot on. And the performance, showing both the flamboyance and the human frailties, is very moving. He is channelling Freddie.<br/><br/>The other performances are good, too, especially Freddie's family and Lucy Boynton as Freddie's ever faithful friend and one-time fiancée Mary Austin, the Love Of His Life.<br/><br/>I'm not in any way a massive Queen fan, but I liked their music and I watched Live Aid as it was transmitted.

"goldmaner-84727","5","4","5","30 November 2019"," Sadly, a missed opportunity
","Well, who am I to say it. My only perception of Freddie is a someone knowing him only from watching him on TV. A bandmate like Brian May really has authority on that. A Brain was completely happy with Malik portrayal. Yet, watching Rhapsody with Malik, I could not shake the feeling that was not Freddie. Maybe, to Brian, who knew Mercury up close and personal, Malik marvelously channelled Mercury and hit the mark perfectly and captured Mercury's essence as a whole person. But for me, as only a ""tv fan"", that was not even close enough. Malik did not capture theatrical over the top flamboyance. His portrayal was of a guy with mannerisms of 3rd world immigrant making it big in a show biz. Meh...
I think May is being a bit disingenuous in his praise. I get it, Brain and Roger did get exactly the movie they wanted. And Queen fans will be moved just due to the fact how emotional everyone feels about story behind Queen and Mercury's untimely death. But movie missed huge opportunity to explore why contemporary critics hated Queen so much. What Queen represented to them - decadent, pointless theatrics, totally uninterested in politics, a music for bourgeois disguised as rock&roll. What drove critics even more mad was Queen's unwillingness to pick a ""cause"" while they could have been such a great poster child for gay pride movement. Great music just for pleasure and good time is just plain wrong. Also, movie actually felt very neutered and borderline boring. The very thing Mercury would cast away. The storyline about bad influence and being manipulated was somewhat baffling and definitely given significant film time at expense of other more interesting and unknown aspects of Mercury life story."

What else is good about this movie? Rami Malek during the performances. If you compare the real life televised performances with the movie, it is spot on. The issue I had with the performance in the movie though is how outgoing he portrays Freddie Mercury. In real life he wasn't so outgoing as shown. For the performances on stage though, I thought he earned that Oscar.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with this movie is the timeline. It was messed up slightly. An example would be Freddie telling the band he has aids before the live aid performance. This doesn't make any sense because in real life, live aid took place in 1985. On the surface this doesn't seem weird but Freddie was only diagnosed in 1987.<br/><br/>Other than the couple of issues mentioned, this movie is a goosebump roller coaster sure to get you singing along!"

","I had reasonably high expectations. I was a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the historical inaccuracies, I understand it's an artistic movie.<br/><br/>But for the life of me I couldn't buy Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury. I actually love Rami Malek and I was sure he will pull it off. He did not, I don't care what critics say.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury was a man who happened to be gay. He was an extremely powerful presence. Rami Malek at no point inspires power, he seems like a little kid with a good voice who struggles with his sexuality. Probably our current PC society had something to do with this.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen would have been perfect in this role, unfortunately he's a tabloid style circus entertainer who only wanted to focus on the controversial and sexual stuff. I guess you can't have it all.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 7, but considering the budget it's probably a 4.<br/><br/>I blame the band for settling for this. They have plenty of money, they should have done better to portray their legacy, and Freddie's."
"agnusagnus","8","4","5","27 February 2019"," An Epic Poem
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a story of famous rock band Queen and their lead singer Freddie Mercury leading to the concert at Live Aid(1985)."
"mjv-57992","2","4","5","21 February 2019"," A Letdown for Queen Fans
","I have seen a number of negative reviews of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that primarily take issue with its factual inaccuracies. These reviews are unlikely to aid the average viewer--who goes to the movies to be entertained--in deciding whether to see this film or in considering its merits after having watched it. The carelessness shown by ""Bohemian Rhapsody""'s disregard for facts may serve, however, to underscore the film's deep flaws, chief among which (ironically) is its superficiality. At the center of this film is Freddie Mercury, played by Rami Malek with a sheen of flamboyant glamor constantly being threatened by an aching loneliness that, one gets the feeling, the film often wishes would just go away. In this sense, the filmic Mercury is not human so much as he is a vessel of musical talent that happens to have, accumulated around it, details that for a fully-realized character would represent more than narrative inconveniences. Malek, to his credit, persists in conveying that loneliness, Mercury's starvation for real connection and understanding. The film's creators also appear to understand the character's desperate need for love (the film opens with ""Somebody to Love,"" after all). And the film recognizes, at least in theory, that love can occur in guises romantic, familial, and collegial, and that fanatical love, often depicted as hollow and unsatisfying, can sustain a person as lonely as Malek's Mercury. But rather than depict Mercury's journey through the push and pull of relationships with people pursuing their own needs, the filmmakers settle for surrounding him with emotional wallpaper (see, e.g., his bandmates, essentially playing the role of nagging but devoted spouse) incapable of challenging or fulfilling him. Moreover, any chance Malek has of developing a well-rounded character is thwarted by the film's haste to get through its quiet moments; one wonders if the messy production history required these scenes get short shrift in favor of the money-shot concert segments. Those concert segments, by the way, are (like the rest of the film) neutered by choppiness and an unnatural sleekness--in other words, they feel too much like the BBC TV performance early in the film that the band laments it will have to lip-sync and mime through. But that's show biz, right? I am willing to forgive the artificiality of the concert scenes (they are, after all, lip-synced and mimed) because the music is great, but I cannot help but wish they held some of the raw emotionality of the concert scenes, shot with a lingering, trembling camera, in this year's ""A Star Is Born."" (I recognize that much of Queen's music consists of stadium-rock stompers that do not lend themselves to emotional revelation. But the film doesn't even attempt to convey anything more than, ""Look, it's Queen!"" with most of the musical performances. Surely, a more definite statement about Mercury's off-stage loneliness could have been made by contrast.) I could go on to complain of the dialogue, through which the film manifests its fear of emotional depth, or the cliché-ridden imagery (trucker-hat beard guy slo-mo walks into MEN room; Mercury, on payphone with wife, looks on, licks lips), but I'm starting to feel like a grouch. I will close with a final opinion, which requires no intellectualizing or arguing: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is boring. I went in optimistic, a lover of Queen's music. I should have been easy to please. But the film is a struggle to get through. It should feel like an ecstatic, powerful, sweaty, riotous, gay concert--the kind of place where a person could fall in love with a person, with a band--but instead is tour footage, sanitized and stitched together from only the most precious, perfect moments, where all of the mistakes, all of the personality, are erased."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is for sure one of best musical biopic of the past 10 years. I don't think it decreases the legacy of Queen or Freddie's neither.
The film has just some scenes that brings the emotions that should be brought when you watch a drama film, when you watch a musical film.
There are just more than one single climax, you don't feel goosebumps only once. Plus, Rami Malek's acting is perfect, and other members show some extraordinary similarities with the real Queen members. The timing between music, drama and storytelling is just on point and as a Queen lover, you just fall in love with this film, which talks Friendship, love, music and passion. I mean it's a crowd-pleaser film, and don't Say this often, but critics are horribly wrong.
This film is PERFECT: The storytelling: perfect, the acting: perfect, the music: perfect. I don't really find any failure with this movie, but unfortunately, it's not winning best picture because: 1) its social message is less important than other films this year 2) Some films are technically more sophisticated than this one.<br/><br/>That said, how the hell this Masterpiece got only 49/100 rating by the critics ? How Dare they?"

","I caught Queen fever shortly before the film's release. I was familiar with the career of the quiet storm that is Rami Malek but not enough to be a true fan. At this point I could probably write a book on both subjects! I started with watching interviews with Freddie whom I found to be an absolutely electric and amazing performer and adorable and beautiful guy. My heart aches just thinking about him. The rest of the band are all just fantastic from what I could see and the actors from the movie seemed to be cast flawlessly. The look of the movie was gorgeous and I appreciated it for what it is, not what the critics told us it should be.<br/><br/>Now, about Rami Malek. (Sigh) I could go on for a solid hour and list everything I adore about this man after watching countless interviews and making my way through all 3 seasons of Mr. Robot twice but I won't do that. Do yourself a favor and watch the SAG-AFTRA interview with him on youtube and listen to the care and compassion he put into this role, starting around 58:00 minutes. You're welcome. This man is a phenomenal person. Period. We needed him right now and I'm so glad that someone recognized his immense talent and gave him a shot. I'm a forever fan. He's a perfect choice for Freddie and I hope he gets the recognition that's he's earned"

I never cried during a movie yet, but this movie came really close! This movie really gave me goosebumps. You can see there is a huge difference in the metascore and in the user reviews; I get both sides. If you expect seeing a documentary that is 100% correct about Queens journey to succes, then this is not the movie for you. This movie has alot of beautiful emotional scenes where you wish you were living in that time. Seeing this movie in theater was part of it being such a good movie. Because it being a music-movie it is really important to have good sound quality while watching this movie. The editing of this movie is also really well done. This movie is paced pretty fast at some times, but the editing and the music together make it a journey to never forget.

"anchel82","10","4","5","1 December 2018"," An exciting musical immersion into Queen's world
","The film takes several artistic licences that deviate from reality to make the story more interesting. I guess Brian May and Roger Taylor (members of the band who started the project and produced the movie) opted for this because they know Queen fans are aware of what really happened.
Anyway, regardless you are fan or not, Bohemian Rhapsody will give you an exciting and unforgettable musical immersion into Queen's world, topped up with the astounding recreation of the Live Aid concert, which is considered the best musical performance of all time. The movie is a masterpiece, like the greatest hits of the band."

"skuggvarg","10","4","5","29 November 2018"," A fan of the music, now a fan of the movie
","Well, first of all I think I need to explain where I stand when it comes to Queen:<br/><br/>When Queen was active I was too young to actually be really aware of them and to be a real fan. However, I still came in contact with their wonderful music, especially through the movie Highlander, so it was only natural that I explored the band further and their music has meant a lot to me when I grew up but most of my life I've been a ""sleeper fan"" of Queen. I like their music a lot but I haven't spent much time actually listening to them.<br/><br/>Still, my love for their music is real, so when I saw the trailer it only took me 2-3 seconds to realize which movie it was and that I just needed to see it. Since then, I've waited very impatiently for the movie and I couldn't wait to see it. Especially since I never got a fair chance to see Queen perform live.<br/><br/>It's an understatement to say that the movie sucked me in. It absorbed me completely. It's been ages since I was this much INSIDE a movie...and by the gods, I LOVED IT!<br/><br/>Sure, there's nothing that is ever quite perfect, so in all honesty, maybe I should rate the movie something like 8-9 out of 10, but I also weigh in my emotions here and since I love the movie and wanted to see it again right away the moment I was leaving the cinema, and since I have had Queen music on constant repeat inside my head ever since I saw the movie...well, for me that's a solid 10.<br/><br/>I loved the story, the actors were great, the script was smart and funny, the music was of course wonderwul (hey, of course one likes it, otherwise one doesn't go see a movie like this), the tempo was good. And I cried several times. Because hell, why not. I love Queen and I love Freddie Mercury's voice.<br/><br/>However, that doesn't mean the movie was perfect. I think they exaggerated Mercury's teeth, it bugged me from the start and through the whole movie. They largely ignored that Mercury was bisexual and not gay. I dislike that they changed some of the historic details about the band. Not everything was correct, and why did they even change it? Why not tell the full story, and the full truth? I also would have liked to see even more of the things the band experienced.<br/><br/>But even so, I still love the movie and encourage every Queen fan to go see it. And if you're not a Queen fan but still want to see an interesting story about one of the most special bands in the world, try it out.<br/><br/>I heartedly recommend this movie...but I'm also very biased this time. ;)"
"classicsoncall","9","4","5","28 November 2018"," ""We're four misfits who don't belong together playing for the other misfits.""
","For whatever reason, I didn't follow Queen the way I did The Beatles or The Rolling Stones. I liked their music well enough, but Freddie Mercury never registered on my radar, most likely because my Golden Era of musical memories consisted of The Sixties groups representing the British Invasion, Motown, and the Sun and Surf Sound. Except for the fact that I knew and enjoyed all the Queen songs in the film, virtually everything else about the band was new information for this viewer, and as such, I can't attest to the accuracy of the story that was presented. So coming from that standpoint, this effort came across as one of the better music biopics I've encountered, with actor Rami Malek offering an inspired portrayal of the late Freddie Mercury. However I couldn't help thinking that he was channeling Mick Jagger both in appearance and stage presence, so if ever an actor is called upon to portray the iconic lead singer of the Stones in a film, Malek just might be the guy to do it. The rest of the band members, while taking a back seat to Mercury, still had moments of their own to make their presence felt in the story. With original band members Brian May and Roger Taylor signed on as executive music producers for the film, it didn't feel like their contributions sought to highlight their own presence in the band at the expense of the front man. The only quibble I might have with the picture was that the songs didn't quite mimic the sound of the original Queen, but by the time you get to the Live Aid finale, that goes out the window with the showmanship and sound of the closing numbers. Definitely a movie to watch for music fans, even if Freddie Mercury and Queen's era passed you by."

"HollyGolightly61","10","4","5","27 November 2018"," Go to enjoy Queen's musical journey
","Thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to start. Though the beginning was a bit slow but it makes up for all the making of songs and concert that follow. It is centered around Freddie Mercury but other characters are never left out. The makers didn't follow the exact order of events and left controversial stuff so that the band and their songs take the center stage. Also they made Freddie more relatable who is confused with his sexuality and showed how endearing his relationship with Mary was. I wasn't aware of their band as I wasn't born when they were popular but I am hooked on their greatest hits and performances. Critics who are complaining that the movie was too sanitized can take a hike as it's not a documentary about Freddie, it is an enjoyable Queen story to watch (and listen). If you love rock music, you shouldn't miss this."

I should have watched this movie at the beginning. The movie got me in the first scene and I couldn't look away until the end.From beginning to end this movie is a MASTERPIECE.

Rami Malek and Gwylin Lee are freaking amazing as Mercury and May respectively. Their performances are genius and completely honest portrayals of music icons. If you get a chance, also listen to the ""Fresh air"" interviews with both Brian May and Rami Malek - Terri Gross does an amazing job in both."

I thought this being Freddie Mercury's biopic it would be dark and disturbing, and what with Bryan Singer directing... Despite my doubts, I did go an watch this film at least for Rami Malek's sake. And I was super pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Epic film and yes this film shows the HUMANE side of Freddie Mercury and I can't think of anyone but Rami Malek who could justify every bit of the character!!!"

"Starbuck-13","10","4","5","24 November 2018"," An emotional 10 for an ode to the greatest singer of all time
","At first I refused to go. As a Queen fan since 1986, born a little too late to ever see them perform live, I was scared that a movie about my life long idol Freddie Mercury was bound to disappoint me. Today, exactly 27 years after him dying way too early, I went to see the movie after many fans talked positively about it where critics didn't. And yes, as you can see I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>I can see that as a biopic, the movie might be too far away from the facts too often. But what fans tend to understand better than critics is that that's not what this movie was all about. In the end, this movie celebrates, in an entertaining and condensed way, the life of the greatest singer that ever existed. A rock star, an incredible performer, an enfant terrible. His personal tragedy is shown, but while there are some scenes and many allusions converning his lifestyle and sexuality, the main focus is on the music, his grand opus and also, the band. Mercury needed Deacon, Taylor and May, and they needed him.
And that is what fans want to see. There is a whole generation of Queen fans that ""grew up proud in the shadow of the mushroom cloud"", and the movie manages to reach us on an emotional level, where we can for a moment forget that those are actors instead of the real band playing at Live Aid. And we can grieve again - one more time - for the musical genius Freddie Mercury, whose light burnt out so long before its time. We grieve for all the songs that we will never hear because Freddie Mercury is dead.
So in my eyes, the eyes of a fan, they managed to pull it off. What a pleasant surprise this movie was!"

I have seen so many documentaries on Freddie but none have put into words just how lonely he really was, I just wanted to jump through the screen and tell him how much we all loved him.
From the water spray on Rogers drums to Johns crazy perm everything was bang on.

A movie making you feel nostalgic about a time when you didn't even exist is not something that happens regularly. The performance of Rami Malek, the direction, and obviously the music, every single thing amazed me in a way that very few creations actually do. This movie is an art maybe due to the hard work of the cast and crew or maybe due to Queen's breathtaking music or as I feel, BOTH.<br/><br/>People here gave the movie a round of applause during the end credits.

Best film in a long time. 10/10. It even made me pick up my dusty guitar!"

"DKosty123","9","4","5","14 November 2018"," Freddie Mercury Biopic Is Musically Powered Epic
","Movies based upon reality are rarely perfect. This film comes close to being so. Granted Mercury's Darkest side of his personality might not be here entirely, but the positive side, his music and the story of Queen is overpowering and done with great energy.<br/><br/>Could this film have been done sooner? Not really, as during the 1990's there was the defense of marriage act mentality which would have doomed this movie to not doing the main plot line-bisexuality without actually doing it with meaning. In the 1980's, the HIV theme film portion would have been impossible.<br/><br/>The film take some liberties with the HIV making the claim that Mecury told the band about the HIV prior to the Live Aid concert in July, 1985. I am not sure that happened that soon prior to his 1991 death. It does make the story more dramatic.<br/><br/>When I watched this film, the music hooked me immediately, but the story took it's time developing. So I was sort of thinking of A Star Is Born, another powerhouse music film for this year. Then the story took hold after the early part about the forming of Queen. This film put that story together with Freddie joining the band in 1970, briefly.<br/><br/>The film becomes powerful when it hooks the viewer on Mercury and his complex life from his relationship to Mary Austin to his admitting their relationship is more complex because he is a bisexual. The film stays above most of Mercuries Drug Use except for alcohol and focus is more on his relationships with everyone close to him. This is told more powerully and hooked me into the film.<br/><br/>The breaking up of Mercury's life is more powerful than a fictional soap opera. It brings tears to many viewers and for good reason. The film builds up to the classic ""July, 1985"" Live Aid performance and that is recreated powerfully in this movie. While the cast is not well known, there are plenty of good performances and Mercury role is acted very well. Mary Austin is acted well too. So are the support roles.<br/><br/>While the great music would make this a good movie regardless, the acting making it better than a good movie. Check out this film, it is very well done."
"jenbie","10","4","5","13 November 2018"," The critics obviously don't like being entertained...
","Brilliant movie, the whole band were so wonderfully played by the actors - fabulous casting. Special mention must go to Rami Malek who was just brilliant. The Live Aid ending was absolutely amazing, I watched the real thing afterwards and was blown away, they captured it perfectly. What a great actor Rami Malek is. Don't believe the critics, go and see it for yourself."
"Lebowskidoo","9","4","5","13 November 2018"," Killer Queen Movie
","Okay, so I am a massive Queen fan and was ready to nitpick this movie to death...but Rami Malek IS Freddie Mercury, his performance is a result of one of those all time perfect casting choices. He makes you love Freddie even more.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly about Freddie and not the other band members, but let's face it, Freddie has the best story to tell.<br/><br/>The movie includes Queen doing ""Radio Ga Ga"" at Live Aid so I really have nothing negative to say about it."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is the story of Freddie Mercury, a very troubled soul. His family doesn't understand him, and he has few friends. Freddie gets his break when a local band loses its lead singer.<br/><br/>Many fans will be surprised that he comes from a traditional Indian background. He only becomes aware of his sexual orientation after he falls in love with a woman.<br/><br/>The strongest part of the film is the music....live concerts, TV shows and studio arrangements. If you love the music of Queen, you'll love this movie. I give it a👍!"
"dustyjoe","9","4","5","11 November 2018"," In a word: Mercurial.
","This movie brought me to tears. No small thing considering that the last time I cried in a movie was in 1982 while watching E.T. in the theater.
Malek carries the film with a truly spectacular performance. There is always something to be said about an actor playing a role with such enormous conviction. Make no mistake, Queen the band is Freddie. And Freddie, in turn, is all of us."
"NikkoFranco","9","4","5","11 November 2018"," Long Live Queen!
","This film made me wonder about a few things, first - if Sasha Baron Cohen aka Ali G got the role would the story be much different from the version that it is now with Rami Malek, second- if Freddie Mercury was diagnosed at a later phase would he have survive to live today as is the case with Magic Johnson? , third - if the second case was true would Freddie approve of the "" sanitized "" version of his biopic. This film will make both Queen fans and non fans cry. Yes, I cry for the reason that there is no music like that today anymore, let alone no one can perform like Freddie and sounds brilliant as Freddie. As an impressionable student during the 80s, I have vivid memories of the Live Aid broadcast and the shock I had as a very gaunt Freddie performed with Queen onstage. I also vividly recall the scandals, gossips from former lovers, partners. Most of all , I am one of those millions who cried when Freddie passed on. Fast forward to twenty plus years later, now a middle aged person, I saw the remaining Queen members two years ago with Adam Lambert. There is a genuine longing for Freddie as there is only a legendary Freddie. This film will remind die hard fans how fast time flies. Rami Malek is stellar in his performance considering for a young actor he also acquired the nuances and movements. Solid internalization for someone who might have vague recollections of the band. Well written story for the big screen albeit cut short in some parts. Must see for 70s, 80s and real rock music lovers."

","Have seen lots of negative articles and clickbait headlines about how Bohemian Rhapsody ""lies"" to it's audience...
Before people start pounding away at their keyboards they should understand the difference between a movie based on a person/group and a documentary...
There are plenty of documentaries out there, some great... some not-so.... you can get all the facts and timelines there.....
Creative license has to be taken to put all of Freddy's story into this movie, so yes, some things are moved around and/or combined or happen at different times to reality.....
This movie is SPECTACULAR! The casting of Queen was excellent, everyone were brilliant (Mike Myers was a little misplacesld, I thought, but in light of Waynes World bringing Queen to a newer audience, I understans why he was asked to be there.
Rami is OUTSTANDING, he put a lot of work into his characterisation of Freddy, it comes across on screen every second he is there.
My only (minor) complaint was the jarring transition from Live Aid to end credits.... I wish they showed parts of the trimphant concert at Wembley the following year and then went to credits, or had it playing over/alongside the credits..
Cannot wait for the Blu-ray release, this will be watched many, many times!!!"
"godspell-28491","10","4","5","11 November 2018"," An Experience NOT to be Missed!!!
","I don't usually write movies reviews, I just love watching movies, and I've seen a ton. Lately though, I truly haven't enjoyed most of the so called critically acclaimed movies out there. It seems that some producers want to pump out movies that they know will be popular with critics, leaving moviegoers however scratching their heads questioning if they missed something. One thing I know for sure though, when a movie makes you feel something, something that you know is true, I just could not give a damn what critics say, that movie is more than a movie, it's an experience.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is an experience, one that I will have again, very shortly. Queen fan or not, you owe it to yourself to experience this movie in the theatres, in all its audio glory, next to others who you know are experiencing the same event (one of the reasons I love going to concerts). I'm not going to get into the performances, i think it's quite clear Rami Malel blew it out of the water, so did the rest of the primary cast (as well as a particular surprise cast member). Aside from Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddy, its worth watching this movie for the music alone, with the final Live Aid performance capping this movie in unbelievable fashion (if you're not fighting back tears you don't have a heart). Seriously, the last 15 minutes of this movie are unforgettable, you just want to watch it over and over again (reminds me of the ending of Whiplash).<br/><br/>Forget the critics, go watch this movie. You won't regret it!!"

I wouldn't mind watching this film as a 6-hour-long feature film, it was THAT GREAT. (Missed Deacon's introduction to the band, though.)
PS: Rami Malek, here comes your Oscar! We felt like Freddie was there al the time, thank you!"
"dartea-34643","9","4","5","10 November 2018"," A great love story that could never be

There were many revelations in the movie of which I was unaware, and I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers. At the heart of the movie, it tells the journey of the band and it's lead, but what it really tells is a love story that will never work, but a love that lasted a lifetime. The casting is phenomenal as they found actors who looked so much like the people they played...really unbelievable. If the critics are not huge fans of this movie, I'll let you watch the movie, then factor in what critics look for in films, and then you'll have your answer...the music and performances are spot on and it gives a glimpse into the band and one of the best performers ever to hit a rock stage."

The actors are really on point - specially Rami Malek who deserves an Oscar, and the physical resemblance with the real life characters is astonishing.

"Vivkon","10","4","5","4 November 2018"," A Queen Resurrection
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a potential masterpiece. Most people will agree that the leading actors, director, writers, cinematographer, light, makeup artists, costumes, sound, music, set designers, - all of them should get special recognition during the award season. Authors of the film present an aesthetically and visually brilliant music biopic. Nobody has ever done anything like this before. They made Freddie alive again. This movie is a Queen resurrection.<br/><br/>Freddie's love, Mary Austin, represents his creative soul. Still, he was almost always seeking new experiences and adventures. His promiscuity, how he contacted the virus, was only a small part of his health history depicted in the film. It's great that authors mostly focus on Freddie's genius in fashion, singing, business, and other facets of the fine arts. The movie is energized by his charisma and his incredible artistic gifts. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is shot without any nudity, violence or vulgarity, and this can be considered as an advantage among all music biopics.<br/><br/>It's fantastic how a story about one person can radiate a panorama of public transformations, industry trends, shifts in fashion and more. As an historical figure, Freddie opened the door to the enormous problems of the HIV crisis of his time. The film director, Bryan Singer, dramatically chronicles Freddie's success, his unstoppable desire to create and his passionate love of music. Rami Malik shared and contributed his own artistic soul in the portrayal of Freddie's character. This is priceless.<br/><br/>Friedrich Nietzsche's popular quote: ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" is wrong. In the bio of Freddie Mercury we see, some things can kill people, but memory and representation in cinema bring the person back to life sometimes with a stronger, more vital persona. This movie is breathtaking from the beginning to end and offers a terrific example how people with HIV and AIDS can lead prolific and productive lives."

","Went to see Bohemian Rhapsody last night and the best thing I can say about it is WOW, amazing!! The worst thing I can say about it is also WOW, it's amazing!!
Now don't get me wrong this won't be to everyone's tastes and if you don't like Queen then you're not gonna enjoy it really because it is all about them and nothing else (obviously).
But if, like me, you love Queen, you love Freddie Mercury and their music then you'll love it! It's not a documentary, there's been plenty of them done. It doesn't go in depth into the life of Freddie or the other band members and nor should it, those things have been done already. What this is is a celebration of the life and work of one of the greatest bands and greatest performer of all time. Rami Malek is sensational as Freddie, pulling off his mannerisms and movements so well (makes me glad that Sacha barren a Cohen turned it down, he wouldn't have been good enough imo) that you can tell this is a role he loved playing. It starts off with you wondering if he could play such an epic OTT character, but by the end he just is Freddie.
The music is, well, amazing, as the songs of Queen are. The songs they chose were all well placed in the film and added to that sense of nostalgia and fun that embodied the band and that the film makers were obviously going for.
It does showcase around Freddie for the most part and to me that's only right, he was the flamboyance of the band and what made them so incredibly appealing. Starting from his early days in England and finishing with their world class performance at live aid.
This film for me had me engrossed, enraptured and above all entertained. I found myself singing quietly along to the songs, nodding my head to the music and caught up in the emotions of it all. It does give a rose tinted view of Queen and Freddie for the most part, but I don't mind that at all, as said previously, I don't want to see another fly on the wall documentary, I wanted to see a happier version of a figure and band that I love and this works so well. Also there's a really funny part with Mike Myers and what his character says about bohemian rhapsody, but you should watch it to see what I mean ðŸ˜‰.
All in all a bloody good watch and one that I will be definitely going to see again!!"

"denis888","1","17","32","26 January 2019"," Nonsence
","The 91st annual Oscar ceremony will be held soon, in the list of the main contenders for a number of awardsthere is Brian Singer film Bohemian Rhapsody. I deliberately endured a pause, waited until the first waves of delight and anger subside, carefully watched the movie in the original, all of more than two hours and now I would like to express my opinion on this biopic.
Remember the 1991 Oliver Stone film called Doors - there was still thin Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison? After so many years, all the flaws of that picture become apparent. In the foreground, Jim himself, the other participants are registered superficially and as if passing by. Then, in 1991, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore were somewhat offended by the fact that in the film about the group of the group itself there could have been more about themselves.
And now the new biopic, now about the Queen group - one of my favorite and respected ones. I am 47 years old, and I found the period when the group still existed and released their later albums (1989 and 1991). Many of us watched the 1986 concert film Live in Budapest several times. We remember that real group, we saw Freddie on the screen and saw who he was. And those of us who started to study the team's biography thoughtfully understood that Queen is not only Freddie. This is Freddie, Brian, John and Roger. All four wrote songs and played on a variety of instruments. And when Mercury died, the group quickly turned into ... well, into a parody of itself. Arguably, one can argue, but all later releases with George Michael, Paul Rogers and now with Adam Lambert are, in essence, a quality hack. The Queen were from the same breed as the Beatles - remove at least one member, and everything will immediately collapse.
Then Ione can argue, but what about the enthusiastic reaction of May and Taylor on the film with Ramey Malek? The answer is very simple - another chance to bask in the glow of past glory. Name at least one thing from the post-Mercury-post-Deacon Queen and so on the same scale as the records of 1973-1991. Do even try to recall.
So. Singer film. What we got in the end? Enchanting nonsense for 120 minutes for the audience of the 21st century, having the most fragmented understanding of Freddie and the whole group. An objection can immediately be heard here - yes, but in 4 hours the whole history of the group cannot be shown. Well, and who prevented to focus on, say, two significant moments in the history of the group - the recording of the 1975 album A Night at the Opera and on the performance at the Live Aid concert in 1985? Instead, we saw a chaotic race through the long history of the team, with incredible jumps from 1973 to 75, from 1980 suddenly in 1977, and so on.
I have not yet spoken about the grossly factual errors. Among the most egregious are, for example, John Deacon on bass as part of Smile, or selling a van to get money to record a debut disc, or a completely wild moment learning a We Will Rock You song in the year of 1980, although the thing itself was written and recorded in 1977 or John Deacon, suddenly singing in studio recordings.
Well, okay, viewers in their mass don't give a damn about all these delights, probably. Well, maybe the actors were great then? Not so. Ramey Malek as Freddie is not even a joke, it is a pure farce brought to the point of absurdity. A slender young man with very noticeable artificial teeth mannerates and grimaces for two hours, trying to portray a singer who, even in the years of same-sex relationships, radiated masculinity and strength. Immediately, we see a certain vocalist, who had fallen into Smile from where (all Freddie's early musical projects were simply ignored) (and by the way, it was possible to spend more time on Tim Staffell,) just as quickly changing his relationship with a girl for romance with men, and then throwing up absurd parties ... and so on, swiftly and at the top, skipping important events and moments of biography.
For some reason, it reminded me of the hackneyed clichÃ© of a number of books and films about the path of a genius - lack of understanding of relatives, the way up, excesses, painful searches for themselves, psychological drama. And yes, all this is present in the ""Rhapsody"".
Well, but what about the other members of the group? Actually, can they save the movie? No, they do not save. May is shown as such a good-natured brat with no special character traits, Taylor is d epicted as that kind of cutie, worn off with one of his songs and suddenly fiercely quarreling with Freddie, and Deacon just looks like occasionally talking furniture. Oh yeah, he's showing the song on the bass. Next thing on him - silence.
The critics are absolutely right in one issue - Malek is trying very hard, but he overplays terribly, the beautiful picture does not carry any content with it. Instead of a truly interesting team history, we absorb a bright and mannered video clip with small pieces of facts. Clip feed for clip generation.
And one more thing - Live Aid was undoubtedly important for the band in terms of reviving interest in their music. But in general, they could even asa solo event gather 130,000 spectators, as was the case in 1988 in Brazil, for example.
What can be said in conclusion? Alas, the film was completely unsuccessful, in my opinion - a complete failure. I do not recommend watching at all, well, except for fun.
My rating is 1 out of 10 (I give a point for the music of the group that sounds in the film)."

","ðŸŒŸ1/10<br/><br/>It's simply a crime to make a movie about Freddie Mercury and make him look like a man without qualities! It's not the actor Rami Malek, he's fine. It's not the rest of the cast, they're fine. It's not even the script as a plan in general - the plan to make a movie along these lines is also fine. It's the depiction of Freddie Mercury as a man who can only speak in one-liners, and slowly at that, a man who is just there in the room without any real presence, as if at a costume party where a princess arrives and maybe everyone wows at her costume, but in the room she has no more authority of a princess than on any average day (what else could you expect?). Thus Freddie Mercury in this movie just is and nothing much happens with or around him. That's atrocious! Freddie Mercury was a workaholic (partying included), a musical genius entirely devoted to music! Not a man without qualities who just is there not really knowing what to do! Such a sad waste!"

","I went to this movie knowing the music would be excellent, but unsure about the rest. I was pleasantly surprised very quickly and absolutely blown away by the end! I was a musician in my mid-teens when Live Aid happened, and I remember it well. I always loved Queen's epic anthems, and had a general idea about Freddy Mercury, but this movie made me wish I could go back and appreciate them both more while they were here. Such a great movie. If you're trying to decide whether to go or not, just do it. It's absolutely spectacular, and if Rami Malek doesn't pull down some serious awards for this, there's no justice in the world. He absolutely NAILS Freddy. The casting for the rest of Queen is fantastic also. I sometimes forgot I wasn't actually watching Brian May."

","How this could average a score of 8/10 is not beyond me; my opinion is that people have confused strong sentiment for a good movie. Our feelings for Freddie Mercury do not make this movie better and Rami Malek's excellent mimicking of Freddie don't make his acting performance stronger.
The movie's pace is not helped by Malek's rightful devotion to playing a realistic version of Freddie, because Freddie's gauche manner and innate shyness slow down almost every piece of dialogue. The other cast members don't help the pace either, and I never once forgot that I was watching a film, a film with a number of wooden performances: most notably the other band members, with Gwilym Lee about the only one to pull out a good performance. Joseph Mazzello is so annoying as John Deacon that I could barely watch him; admittedly it wasn't a particularly brilliant role in the first place, but he looked like the dictionary definition of 'phoning it in'.
On the plus side, Malek is very good and the recreation of the great live moments in Queen's incredible career are very well done, as are the romantic relationships in Freddie's life; a little coy perhaps, particularly when dealing with his homosexuality, but there does at least appear to be genuine affection and love between him and Mary and him and Jim."

Rami Malek was amazing- and deserves every award coming his way-but everyone was marvellous. I came out weeping- not only because the performances were so moving- but like many who lived through the Queen period- we still grieve for a lovely soul who was taken too early.

"jaumet-62876","10","5","7","7 January 2019"," Freddie Mercury would be proud
","This film made me go back to cinemas after years without going.
Is one of the few cases in which I got what I was expecting:
A celebration of Queen!
And it's true, you leave the cinema actually feeling moved.
You get some of the group's story, and some of their music.
You end up actually believing you are watching Queen perform, and listening to their music through cinema sound adds another layer of greatness to their songs.
I didn't like Somebody to love very much until I heard it on film, and now I just love it.
This film makes you feel lovestruck with the group, and it delivers on something important: people do not only like Queen's music, they love Freddie Mercury and the group. The plot and treatment they all get is warm, that warmth transpires throughout the film. There was something about Freddie Mercury that made you actually like him, and the film did catch on that.
Rami Malek deserves any prize he can get, by far. You feel when he feels, and for me that's what signals good acting.<br/><br/>Forget what some critics say, the film also touches the shady parts of their lives, it just doesn't need to focus on them, because the focus is our love for Queen and their music.
This film's been made for the people, and that's why people love it.
As Freddie says, we give people what they want.<br/><br/>Exactly.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching in cinemas. Definitely worth the price of admission."

The film is totally focused (or only focused) on Freddie Mercury's character, passing over the rest of the band's components, which are relegated to mere secondary characters.
The Live Aid Concert scene is memorable and practically identical to the original. Very well!!!
For my taste, the only flaw is that Rami Malek is a little less tall than the original Freddie."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","7","25 November 2018"," This motion picture will somewhat rock you! It still had that killer queen, even with, its semi generic paint by number plot.
","While, this movie hits the same old familiar plots thread that most biographic rockstar films have. There is one question, I had in my mind, after leaving the theater. Is this the real life, or is this just fantasy? How much of this biopic about British rock band 'Queen', front man, Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) was historical correct & what were made up? Well, after doing some research. I found this film written by Anthony McCarten & Peter Morgan to be, not as accuracy as it should had been. Without spoiling too much, director Bryan Singer did allow a lot of artistic liberties. One such example is how Mercury got started. In truth, 'Queen' was not his first singer gig. Before them, Freddie was in a rock group called 'The Hectics', and later as a vocalist for the band 'Ibex'. Nor did Mercury met the other band members, Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) coincidentally at their concert as 'Smile', right after their lead singer quit. In truth, Mercury actually met them, while attending Ealing Art College. However, it wasn't until May and Taylor came to see him, perform with 'Ibex' that the first steps toward of hiring him, as the lead singer of 'Queen' took place. Even with that, Mercury didn't get the job that night. As for Freddie meeting his future girlfriend, Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) on the same night as his first run-in, with the other band members. It's also bollocks. In reality, Freddie didn't date her, until much later. Despite that, it is true, that he really love her. Even on his deathbed in 1990, he often refer her as his only true friend to the point, that he left the majority of his belongings, when he passed away. I kinda like, how the film portray that, because, a lot of people thought he was only gay. In reality, he was more than that. It's just too bad, that the movie doesn't show much of his other true love of his life, Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker). Even with the scenes, they did show, with him, it's not that accurate. Hutton was never a server at a hedonistic party hosted by Mercury, but a hairdresser, the singer met a nightclub. Despite that, I kinda dig the chemistry, the two performers had for each other. However, sadly, their character's relationship wasn't well established, due to bad pacing. Instead, the film focus way too much time, with the negatives of Freddie's other partner, Paul Prenter (Allen Leech). This course of direction feels a little bit one sided, as the film makes it, look like getting into a homosexual relationship might be bad. It gave the wrong tone. Nevertheless, it's during this time with Paul that the movie makes its biggest departure from the truth. In the film, we see the band livid at Freddie for going behind their back, for a solo deal. When in reality, the band all agreed on taking a break to focus on their solo careers, but they stayed in touch. Live Aid wasn't a reunion for the band. In real life, they had actually released their eleventh studio album and had been on tour all over the world that year. They were also well rehearsed by the time they were set to perform at the event. To dig further, one of their managers was never fired, because of the failure to mention that event. He was fired by Mercury for selling the singer's saucy personal information to newspapers, years later. As for record executive Ray Foster (Mike Myers), that hired the band and later, try to derail them. That character's conflict was also fake. That fictional figure was just add to put more dramatics & a punchline for an insider movie joke. Despite the band's personal story being less dramatic in real life, than the movie; their music is still impressive. Seeing how they were able to get the ideas for them, and produce it for concerts in a humorous way, was, by far, the highlight of the film. I just wish, the individual band members were explore more. We barely got to know anything about them. They were a little paper thin. Because of that, the acting for those performances also somewhat limited & didn't shine. It cause the performances to be only mediocre at best. Despite that, the actors chosen to portray them, did look the part. As for Mercury. Malek was alright. He truly did look & sound like the lead singer. However, the portrayals of Freddie's life and sexuality is a bit off. The singer was not as reckless in his promiscuity as the movie makes it out to be. He wasn't sexual harassing men. In truth, he was very extrovert and shy, particularly with others. The idea that Freddie would host all night orgies parties, joking openly about his sexuality, all the time is also very questionable. Most likely, he was in home, resting quietly, due to the pressures of performing during hectic musical tours & suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare form of skin cancer that cause him, great pain; that the film fails to mention. In conclusion, I think the director was just making Mercury seem like a sex hound to justify his own actions when it comes to the filmmaker's very public sexual abuse allegations cases. He's trying to say, he meant, no harm with his own engagements. Regardless of that, Bryan Singer still got fired from the production, after a fight with the cast & crew whom complained to the studio about the director's absences. While, Dexter Fletcher does a great job, completing the film. His editing style was not well balance. Too many quick cuts. Because of that, the timeline didn't float well. Everything seem rushed, even the visuals. Certain CGI parts were very choppy. In spite of everything, overall: 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is still champion material. It will make you go Radio gaga for it! That's for sure."
"fledge3","10","5","7","22 November 2018"," Simply Amazing
","Went to see Bohemian Rhapsody last night and the best thing I can say about it is WOW, amazing!! The worst thing I can say about it is also WOW, it's amazing!!
Now don't get me wrong this won't be to everyone's tastes and if you don't like Queen then you're not gonna enjoy it really because it is all about them and nothing else (obviously).
But if, like me, you love Queen, you love Freddie Mercury and their music then you'll love it! It's not a documentary, there's been plenty of them done. It doesn't go in depth into the life of Freddie or the other band members and nor should it, those things have been done already. What this is is a celebration of the life and work of one of the greatest bands and greatest performer of all time. Rami Malek is sensational as Freddie, pulling off his mannerisms and movements so well (makes me glad that Sacha barren a Cohen turned it down, he wouldn't have been good enough imo) that you can tell this is a role he loved playing. It starts off with you wondering if he could play such an epic OTT character, but by the end he just is Freddie.
The music is, well, amazing, as the songs of Queen are. The songs they chose were all well placed in the film and added to that sense of nostalgia and fun that embodied the band and that the film makers were obviously going for.
It does showcase around Freddie for the most part and to me that's only right, he was the flamboyance of the band and what made them so incredibly appealing. Starting from his early days in England and finishing with their world class performance at live aid.
This film for me had me engrossed, enraptured and above all entertained. I found myself singing quietly along to the songs, nodding my head to the music and caught up in the emotions of it all. It does give a rose tinted view of Queen and Freddie for the most part, but I don't mind that at all, as said previously, I don't want to see another fly on the wall documentary, I wanted to see a happier version of a figure and band that I love and this works so well. Also there's a really funny part with Mike Myers and what his character says about bohemian rhapsody, but you should watch it to see what I mean ðŸ˜‰.
All in all a bloody good watch and one that I will be definitely going to see again!!"
"confidencegame","6","5","7","22 November 2018"," Worse Than Mockumentary
","The title of my review is not supposed to be a derogatory statement about this film, but rather a comparison to 1984 mockumentary about Queen-alike rock band named Spinal Tap. Bohemian Rhapsody does not come close to This Is Spinal Tap's wit and charm. It comes of as a glorified Queen concert which has very little to offer to an unbiased audience.<br/><br/>I came to the cinema with very little expectations about this film. I was never a particular Queen fan, even though I listen to their stuff occasionally. And even so, the film left me with a lukewarm feeling afterwards. For all its length, it managed to be all style, and no substance. Characters are very one-dimensional, while the overall band dynamics is presented as a highly naive instant success story. Also the few characters who disregarded Queen, or were unsure about it were presented as villains, of course. While Rami Malek delivered a nice performance as Mercury, and the re-creation of Live Aid concert offered its perks, it was not enough to turn around otherwise poor storytelling.<br/><br/>So to sum up: if you are a die-hard Queen fan, then this is a film for you. If you'd rather like to see a rock band film with more substance, then consider titles like This Is Spinal Tap or That Thing You Do! instead."

","I rarely write reviews but having waited patiently for this movie for many, many years, then to see critics besmirch it, I had to set the record straight, so to speak! I am a HUGE Queen fan from childhood and have read several books, tons of articles, and watched many documentaries and videos on Queen and Freddie Mercury. I saw Bohemian Rhapsody on opening night in FL with a group of friends and thoroughly enjoyed it! My brother & his whole family also happened to see it that very same night in NJ! Then, a week later, I took my mother to see the movie as she wanted to experience her children and grandchildren's favorite band on the big screen. It was definitely better the 2nd time around! I got so much more out of it, not worrying about how historically accurate the movie was or how much the actors resembled their real life personas. I just truly enjoyed the story line, the actors themselves, the flow of the film, and most of all, the incredible music filling my ears in that theater!! I heard so many more great lines and caught playful visual nuances in the film that I had previously missed before due to laughter, talking, or some other distraction. Ironically, both my brother and I were at that very same Madison Square concert, 7th row center, which was highlighted in the movie!! We remember Freddie's showmanship and many stage antics that were presented in the film. Thank you for making such a fitting tribute to one of the World's Greatest Bands and Best Singers EVER!!! Freddie would be so proud!!<br/><br/>""When I'm dead, I want to be remembered as a musician of some worth and substance""...the late, great Freddie Mercury"

Yes, there were some incorrect dates, with some problems, but outside of that, I loved the movie.

Admittedly I am a Queen fan and have been since I first heard them back in the early 1970's as a wee kid. So maybe I'm a wee bit biased.
But the cinema was packed and by the end, almost everyone was singing along. I think the bloke in the 6th row, 5 seats in wasn't..! But otherwise, everyone else was singing.

As about the movie there's nothing much to say because it can't be considered as a truthful biopic which it's supposed to be. It's because that the main focus of the movie is successful and greatness of the band and nothing more. It can't be simply even considered as a movie. It's much less entertaining than watching a live concert.
Everything is wrong to the core in this one. Awkward acting, unfunny jokes, campy editing, boring storytelling.

The film displays Queen as being a different band from the mainstream... incorporating operatic components successfully, engaging in creativity to produce a unique yet ultimately successful hit. Ignore any negative comments about this film. It is a movie, not a documentary. Not everything is 100% factually correct - but I could not care less.

","Before seeing this movie, I was mostly neutral about Queen. I did like their songs, but I was never really a fan. However this movie completely changed my perspective of the band. Even though I only knew the most famous songs, that doesn't matter. You don't need to be a fan to enjoy this film. It belongs to everyone, like Queen does.<br/><br/>The story follows Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek), the lead singer of Queen, and his rise to fame, but also his fall from grace. It sounds really simple, but the other aspects of the movie, such as the writing and acting, really set it apart from other similar films.<br/><br/>First, the script is amazing. Kudos to the script writer, Anthony McCarten. There are so many scenes in this movie that are genuinely full of tension particularly scenes showing the band arguing and practically any scene with Paul Prenter (Allen Leech). The writing really helps deliver tension in the darker scenes and make the more uplifting scenes really motivating. The writing makes you feel Freddie's downward spiral. The scenes with Paul especially made me genuinely nervous. Because, you know he doesn't care about Freddie and he just wants to leech off of him. All you want is for Freddie to cut ties with Paul. Thankfully, this movie isn't a complete downer, as there are some genuinely heartwarming moments, especially in the beginning. Then, things get dark pretty quickly. It's nice seeing the band get together and hang out. You genuinely believe in their friendship.<br/><br/>This movie also shows Freddie dealing with real issues - his race, his sexuality and not feeling like a disappointment to his parents. Life is complicated, whether or not you are rich and famous. We also got to give special attention to Freddie's actor. Rami Malek really is Freddie Mercury! It is so spot on that Rami Malek and Freddie Mercury look almost identical. That's what I call amazing casting. While the rest of the cast is really great as well, Rami Malek completely steals the show.<br/><br/>This movie also excels at showing how destiny works in mysterious ways. For example, five minutes before Freddie asks to joined to the band, the lead singer quits. I find that really interesting. To be honest, the only issue I have with this movie is the final scene. It's a recreation of the Live Aid performance Queen did, which seems fine at first. However, the scene goes on forever. It is a good scene and I get why they made it so long, but after awhile I kept wondering how much longer the scene was going to last. That's really my only issue with the film. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, as well as adults. Even if you're not a huge Queen fan, I think you'll enjoy this.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

"Ken_Buddha","1","6","9","27 January 2020"," Another shameless cash grab courtesy of May and Taylor
","When Farrokh Bulsara aka Freddie Mercury passed away almost 30 years ago, the band Queen died as well - or did it? No, Brian May and Roger Taylor simply couldn't let go of the gift that keeps on giving, and they have since milked the passing (the so-called ""dead star"" factor) of their ""gay icon"" frontman (who never came out publicly) relentlessly. First with a tribute concert ""to raise AIDS awareness"" (while Mercury and his bandmates had constantly denied rumors about his illness until one day before his death), followed by a seemingly endless stream of ""previously unreleased"" albums and new variations of greatest hits collections plus live gigs with new lead vocalists. ""Too much love will kill you"", but too much money apparently won't, right? At least bass guitarist John Deacon displayed some measure of decency when he officially retired after the tribute concert. A biopic was the logical next step in May and Taylor's cash cow approach, and the movie had to be streamlined to be as profitable as possible, which didn't sit well with Sacha Baron Cohen, who had originally been picked to portray Mercury, so he had to ""bite the dust"".<br/><br/>And for me it's not just the multitude of historical inaccuracies (which have been listed in many reviews all over the media, so I won't mention them here) that ruin the movie, it's also the casting of Rami Malek. Malek looks (or doesn't look) as much like Mercury as a black chihuahua dog would resemble the original Lassie, with Malek's bulging eyes a permanent distraction throughout the flick; and whereas Mercury even in his younger Queen years never looked like a boy and always had an almost malicious sparkle in his eyes, Malek comes across like a little kid with a bad wig (again, no resemblance to the pre-mustache Mercury's hair style) and a ridiculous set of false teeth who's trying to impersonate someone way older and more experienced. Just imagine Malek trying to play Mercury in the middle part of the infamous ""I want to break free"" video clip, in a tight bodysuit - impossible, right? (But that highly controversial sequence is not part of this movie.)<br/><br/>And while I have to admit that I have really no idea about the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's criteria when it comes to handing out Oscars, I think that the trophy for the best actor in a leading role should not go to someone who has only delivered some kind of impersonation. Okay, it most likely wasn't Malek's fault that his role didn't require anything deeper, and if he had raised his concerns about his character's sexuality, he would have probably been replaced, just like Sacha Baron Cohen before him.<br/><br/>But May and Taylor never had any intentions to show the world the real Freddie, someone who, according to his biographers and a barrage of youtube documentaries, almost defiantly kept on partying, etc., in spite of the AIDS scare, until the terrible disease eventually caught up with him. So instead of something that could have ended up being art they produced a string of re-enacted music videos for the typical fanboy/-girl, with a long lipsync finale at the end, Queen at Live Aid. My advice: watch the original on youtube, and while you're there, check out some of the Mercury documentaries, they're much better than this shameless cash grab."

","The band, Queen, is arguably the best band to have come out of the previous century, and might even overshadow or does overshadow music that gets produced in the current century. The Film however does not do much for the legacy that Is Freddy Mercury, and also the band, Queen. First and foremost, the actors portraying these legends, do so with clear reverence for their subject matter, and as such almost disappear into their respective roles, unfortunately much cannot be said about the direction of the film. The film relies heavily on the music as a selling point, and ignores what could have been a wonderful character study of a very complex man, or even men. The story is crafted so one dimensionally that the internal strife of the band feels mundane, the relationship between Freddy and his parents do not come across as problematic, but interestingly the dynamics of the relationship between Mr. Hutton, Ms.Austin and Mercury is largely left unexplored. I find it difficult to believe that the group dynamics were pretty straight forward and was largely schoolboy quarrels, that Mr. Mercury did not struggle for acceptance from his family and by himself (He left the majority of his estate to Ms. Austin, the other half to his family and minimal to Mr. Hutton). What could have been a wonderful character study(and clearly all of the cast was ready for it) is let down by a director's personal quarrels and the PG-13 rating, I'm torn in two as film itself shows promise, the cast is on top of their game, but the original director clearly did not have the same reverence or maybe there was too much corporate interference,being careful to tarnish the reputation."

","Yes Freddy looks very much like Freddy, but had an impossible job. No one can be expected to totaly capture the conflicting mannerisms of Freddy Mercury. Shy, confident, a born star who is subconsciously obsessed with his teeth (the constant nervous tounge flick) and with having a good time.<br/><br/>The movie seems to lack depth and we don't really get to learn that much about any of the characters.<br/><br/>It would have been nice to have seen more about the bands beginnings and how Freddy, who knew he was destined to be a star, had a huge influence on it. Instead Freddy joins the band and after Killer Queen, the band is on its way to fame. We never see them struggle or put in the hard work in the studio. Apart from some mild personality conflicts, it seems to be quite an easy journey for them.<br/><br/>I found the middle of the movie slow and wonder if most of the highly rated reviews here are more about Queen's music rather than an accurate reflection on the quality of the movie."

A great story and amazing music resulted in a thoroughly entertaining movie.
Remember it was just that, a movie, not a documentary, so some artistic license was taken by the moviemakers, is that really such a horrific sin?
The main concern of the critics is that the movie didn't delve into the sordid details of Freddie's private life. Does it really matter?

","Every kid who has ever had trouble fitting in has someone that inspires them. Someone to show them what it is like to be fearless, strong and bearing all of your soul stark naked for the world the see. That man was Freddie Mercury for me. I was a Queen superfan in my youth, and that says a lot for a band that had lost it's lead singer long before my time. Their music spoke to me. Rocked me to my core. Made my heart sing. Bohemian Rhapsody remains one of my favorite songs of all time. Passion, joy, rage and sorrow in under 6 minutes, and to think it was ever considered a critical flop. A Freddie Mercury biopic was decade in the making, and foundered in development hell as the surviving band members fought tooth and claw against showing the darkest portions of Mercury's life. The band ultimately had the final say. What we get instead is the fluffiest tribute to one of the greatest bands of all time. Fluff is all we've got to work with here, and quite frankly, it's disappointing.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody spands Freddie and his career with Queen from the band's conception to the insane making of ""A Night at the Opera"", to the lull's of the 1980s, to the final scene which captures Freddie's greatest performance ever at Live Aid. That scene in particular is a masterful tribute that almost redeemed BH of all of it's numerous flaws. The entire performance is covered. Every movement, every facial expression, every audience reaction. Singer wants us to live this moment. We don't cut back and forth quickly around it. We stay with it. It needs to be experienced in a loud, large theatre without a doubt. But if we're going to compare the biography portion of the film, consider this familiar territory the entire way through. If you've seen Ray, Walk the Line, Get On Up, Jersey Boys, Love & Mercy, The Doors and Straight out of Compton, you've sadly seen Bohemian Rhapsody. However, where Love & Mercy and The Doors entire the mad darkness from which these great songs were inspired, we barely see that side of Mercury being explored. Neither do we see in depth his extricating struggle with his sexuality and his later crippling AIDS diagnosis. Both are hinted at, but none of the execution truly captured his pain. Again, this is disappointing.<br/><br/>See Bohemian Rhapsody for the music if nothing else. You'll love hearing the old songs in crystal clear, loud quality. But don't expect a masterpiece."

The performances in this film are natural, they are so genuine that at several points I had to remind myself that I am watching a film and that is not really Roger, or Freddie or May.
I had to remind myself that Rami is not the one singing even though it looks as if that really is Freddie.
This movie was about the soul of a band, the reality of a man that transcended all barriers to become a legend way before he would pass away, a time in music that was precious. These are what this movie is about and that is it, if any one is looking for anything else they are not in the right place.
This movie has achieved something so pure and brilliant in its reproduction of the life of one of THE most influential musical acts in the history of music that I am still shocked by how well done it was.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 10 out of 10 for conveying a great and sad and amazing and bitter sweet story with an amazing cast with an even better reproduction of the methods used for making songs and letting audiences be a part of this trip down the memory lane.<br/><br/>Do Not Miss It!<br/><br/>Queen Works!"

It's a tribute of respect for the legendary man called Freddie Mercury. I respect the producer's point of view and how he wanted this movie to be pointed out as. It's basically a movie for everyone, more like a family movie if I might say. It didn't take apart on Freddie's disgrace, and why should they? We all love and respected Freddie as the musician he is and we don't have to know all the details, it's his privacy and leave it alone. For me that goes the same like I respected Tchaikovsky's creations, and I don't have to care about his private life. Freddie is a genius and I'm sure he wanted people to remembered him as a musical legend, not for the x-rated lifestyle he went. If you love Queen's music you will surely enjoy this. The last 20 minutes gave me chills, it's like watching a real concert. It's so good that no doubt I'm gonna watch this again."

","The critics got it all wrong with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when the song came out, and this time, the critics got it wrong again with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" the movie. Make no mistake, this is a movie made for everyone to enjoy and appreciate, just like how Queen ensured their music touched the nerves of their audience.<br/><br/>The tone was set at the movie's very first frame, when a rock guitar version of the 20th Century Fox fanfare came on, aptly tying the subject to the presentation. The last great movie which tied the movie to the fanfare was ""Argo"", and look what happened to that movie. A good omen, I hope.<br/><br/>This movie touched my heart more than any other that I've seen. The music was mesmerizing, and was adroitly and intricately woven into each sequence, each act and carried each arc of the movie, right up to its climatic conclusion : the band's epic Live Aid performance. It will give you goosebumps, I assure you.
And make you cry, which I did.<br/><br/>Credit must be given to the entire production team for making this movie so believable. The cast were so good that after a while, you forget you were watching actors but rather felt like you were the fly-on-wall seeing these events happen right in front of you. I must also congratulate lead actor Rami Malek for taking in every essence of Freddie Mercury, and replicating it on the big screen with total perfection. He was not Rami, he was Freddie. Thank goodness Sacha Baron Cohen was not cast here, and Freddie Mercury would have turned out very differently, given what we know about Cohen's acting credibility (or lack of).<br/><br/>Finally, it'll be good for viewers to accept some creative licence undertaken by the filmakers.

"tomgillespie2002","4","7","11","2 February 2019"," Wikipedia-entry storytelling
","Bohemian Rhapsody started out life way back in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen set to star as Queen's hypnotic frontman Freddie Mercury. With band members Brian May and Roger Taylor heavily involved in the development, Baron Cohen eventually left, citing creative differences with the way they wished to approach the story as the main reason for his departure. The years went by, and in 2017, the wheels were well and truly in motion with Bryan Singer in the director's chair and Rami Malek in the lead role. The production was famously dogged with problems, and when Singer was eventually fired for unprofessional behaviour (reports say he was frequently disruptive on set, even failing to turn up for three days straight), it felt like the film would never see the light of day. But Dexter Fletcher filled the vacant director's chair and Bohemian Rhapsody was released to huge box-office numbers, and recently received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Actor, amongst others.<br/><br/>Remarkably, despite the film's difficult production, there's no sign of patchwork or a clash of directorial styles. Bohemian Rhapsody actually has much greater problems, and while anybody looking for an easily-digestible Queen sing-a-long with find much to love here, anybody hoping for a deeper re-telling of one of the music's most enigmatic figures with likely be baffled at the film's eagerness to share the credit and Wikipedia-entry approach to story-telling. We briefly get to see Mercury before he took to the stage, working as a baggage-handler at Heathrow while his parents worry about his lack of academic ambition. His experience as a young immigrant is summarised by a single racial slur, and the film isn't too concerned with exploring this any further. Perhaps screenwriter Anthony McCarten (who wrote last year's similarly formulaic Oscar-baiter Darkest Hour) felt like this would be too much of a drag for the audience, so he quickly moves to Mercury introducing himself to Smile guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy), coincidentally mere seconds after the band loses its lead singer.<br/><br/>A few montages later and the band now known as Queen (bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) completes the group) are signed up by manager John Reid (Aidan Gillen) and land a contract with EMI Records. The characters act and talk like they already know how the story turns out, and the film only manages to scratch beneath the surface when dealing with Mercury's relationship with love-of-his-life Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and her gradual realisation of his sexuality. The rest consists of band squabbles that always seem to conclude with the writing of a hit song, rock movie cliches like the alcohol-fuelled parties and accelerating ego, and cartoon supporting characters (Mike Myers' meta appearance as EMI executive Ray Foster spectacularly misses the mark). By aiming for 12A/PG-13 certificate, Mercury's story is oddly sexless. For a man that radiated sex and sexiness with every air-punch and pout, the lack of raunchiness adds an unwelcome TV-movie quality. It only really comes alive when Malik is allowed to do his thing on stage, climaxing with an extended Live Aid performance that will have you singing along and waving your arms. It's a great impression by Malik, if hardly a great performance, and it helps reminds us of how great Queen really were and how timeless their sound is. Bohemian Rhapsody has certainly made me a bigger Queen fan, but this isn't the biopic the band deserve. That being said, I haven't come across a single person that agrees with me, so what do I know"
"andrewroy-04316","3","7","11","2 February 2019"," While the music is fun and Malek is good, the narrative is wildly inconsistent and builds up its characters horribly, making for one of the worst scripts of the year
","While Malek tries to inject life into the film, it feels completely segmented and disjointed, as if the film pieced together 6 small parts of Mercury's life where characters were different people and didn't show development between any of the segments. And you can't even claim the plot is disjointed because they have to squeeze real life down into a simpler, short narrative because they took plenty of creative liberties.
The simple, fundamental problem is the terrible script. They manage to make a fascinating true story seem at points unrealistic and at others boring. The first act was the lowest point in the movie. It seems very hard to believe that Queen, one of the most legendary bands of all time, was formed by three guys in a going nowhere, not very driven bar band where their lead singer leaves them, and then someone watching who apparently had little musical experience joins them, and almost immediately and without challenges they rise to great stardom. The movie just glosses over and makes it seem easy and natural that these random, previously completely irrelevant local musicians become international superstars. The narrative in the first act was no conflict at all, led by Freddie and the others just support him and songs just magically flow out of them (the first session they have, they already have Killer Queen in their back pocket?!). The creation of Bohemian Rhapsody was especially absurd to the point of being laughable - all the lyrics and exceptionally complex rhythmic and tonal changes just come to him? No natural artistic challenges to work through and change things, especially for one of the most complex songs ever made? The lack of effort they ever have to put in to make great music felt like a disservice to artists.
The characters are very poorly developed throughout. The other 3 band members are completely indistinguishable and indistinct for the first half of the movie, and even after that they are completely flat characters with little personality. His relationship with Mary begins with no reason beyond he thinks she's pretty, and of course they immediately fall in love with no depth to their relationship. Why he chooses to marry her, and how Freddie's sexuality was dealt with in general, was perplexing and poorly explained. Had he never felt any attraction to men before marrying her, but then when going on tour we see his perspective to suddenly be bizarrely sexually charged?
Freddie's character more than any other suffered from the discretized narrative chunks. Early in the movie, he's a hardworking, scrappy guy who loves music and manages to get this band to take him, though he has an odd and flamboyant style. Then we see a jump to him being essential to the band and out of nowhere bringing them success. How he had the musical experience or talent to do this is unclear. Despite his individual and flamboyant style, during this period there is never a hint of conflict and he's clearly the leader. Then there's a jump from this unrealistic period of perfect harmony to an equally unexpected shift to Freddie being utterly self-absorbed and flippant towards the band. He lives it up, parties hard, and alienates the band. During this period, the reporters scene seemed out of place and jarring, as it showed very different emotional issues than were shown in the flamboyant party style surrounding it. It also implied a frustration that people only cared about Freddie's life and not the band or their music, which wasn't shown anywhere else.
And then we reach the only part of the movie that shows something that could be quite good, but of course they ruin it. A picture of Mercury as an uber-talented but self-absorbed person who pushes everyone away develops, and he seems destined to hit rock bottom. Paul could've been a fascinating antagonist in creating this spiral and pushing others out for his benefit only to ruin Freddie, but their relationship is horribly set up and never clear who holds power and investment in the other. The shift in Freddie trusting everything to Paul to turning on him by Mary's word was inconsistent, and then the ending redemption arc for Freddie made everything ring hollow and gave the movie an immoral message: Freddie rises on talent, only cares about himself and pushes others out, but then everyone loves him again because of one concert so his talent bails him out anyways. Not only is that arc not what actually happened (he didn't really push the band away), but it leaves a horrible message. There's an interesting story there, but they were too afraid to actually follow it (and it wouldn't be true to Freddie's story, raising the question of why they brought the arc in at all).
The music is perfectly acceptable, the Live Aid concert is good, and Malek does what he can to salvage the wreck. The humor often didn't land with me, but wasn't a key problem of the movie. As other reviewers put it, it does feel like an AI adapted a wikipedia page into a script, and the outcome isn't good. Who thinks this movie is one of the best of the year??? There are some decent individual scenes, mostly thanks to Malek, but the plot is riddled with holes and character inconsistencies, and aside from hearing good Queen songs, none of it really feels fun to watch."

Nothing was given enough screen time unfortunately.

It was damn well done and Rami Malek was outstanding in his portrayal of Freddie Mercury. Do yourself a favour, whether you are a fan of Queen or not, go catch this in IMAX before it leaves the theatres. Very well made biopic, and the Live Aid scene was awesome! 9/10"

","I was about to dismiss this movie as critics seem to say it doesn't talk sbout Freddie as a person. I am glad that I did not listen, as the movie was great. Enjoyed it, shed some tears, and learn something about Freddie the person. Yes, it could have gone more deeper, but it doesn't need to do; just like Freddie, a lot is left unspoken, but you get what it means. For now, I will go download the album! By the way, the actor was fantastic. I forgot I was watching a biopic. Thought it was Freddie."

"jboothmillard","7","7","11","5 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody
","I am huge fan of Queen and lead singer Freddie Mercury, so I was highly excited about seeing a biopic, I had been hearing about the making of this much-delayed film for a few years, including the departure of original leading actor Sacha Baron Cohen. I saw a good number of trailer for it, it looked like it was going to be fantastic, and it was released four days before my birthday, so I hoped it would be a perfect treat, directed by Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men, Superman Returns, Valkyrie, X-Men: Days of Future Past), and Dexter Fletcher (uncredited, completed the film after Singer's departure). Basically in 1970, Indian British Parsi college student Farrokh Bulsara (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Rami Malek) works as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport, but dreams of becoming a singer, and has a hobby for song writing. One night he goes to a nightclub to watch a local band called Smile, after the show he meets the band, guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (EastEnders' Ben Hardy). But the band's lead vocalist bassist/vocalist Tim Staffell (Jack Roth) quits to join the band Humpy Bong, Farrokh offers to become their new lead singer, and their songwriter. The band are also joined by bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello), and they rename themselves Queen, they play numerous local gigs across England, until they sell their van to fund and produce their debut album, Queen. Their musical style lands them a contract with EMI Records, and at the same time, Farrokh legally changes his name to Freddie Mercury and becomes engaged to Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). Queen slowly climb to stardom, with a further two albums, Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack, and go on tour to the United States, it is there that Freddie begins to question his sexuality. In 1975, Queen record their fourth album, A Night at the Opera, they insist that the first song released is ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", but executive Ray Foster (Mike Myers) refuses, saying radio will not play a six-minute long, so they leave EMI. Freddie meets DJ Kenny Everett (Dickie Beau) on Capital Radio, who debuts the song on the airwaves, despite mixed reviews, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" becomes a smash hit, reaching Christmas Number One (and again in 1991). Shortly after returning from the band's world tour, Freddie is heartbroken when Mary breaks up with him when he reveals to her that he is bisexual, but she aware that he is actually gay. He then forms a relationship with his personal manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech). With albums A Day at the Races, News of the World, Jazz, and The Game, the success of Queen continues into the 1980s, Freddie has grown a moustache, but tensions arise between the band members over the direction of their music and a change in Freddie's attitude. After a lavish party at his home, Freddie falls in love with Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker), one of the waiters at the party. They shortly part ways, with Jim telling Freddie to look for him when he finds his inner self. Freddie is bombarded with questions on his personal life and sexuality, during band's press conference to promote their 1982 album Hot Space, no questions about the album itself. Freddie's relationship with his band mates dissipates when he announces that he signed a $4 million deal with CBS Records to go solo. In 1984, he moves to Munich to work on his first solo album Mr. Bad Guy and engage in non-stop gay orgies with Paul. One night, Mary pays him a visit and urges him to return to the band, they have been offered a spot in the benefit concert Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, organised by Bob Geldof (Dermot Murphy), she also reveals that she is pregnant. After discovering Paul withheld information about Live Aid from him, Freddie breaks up with Paul, who is response goes on television to discuss Freddie's sexual escapades. The AIDS virus outbreak is spreading worldwide, Freddie secretly has himself medically checked and discovers that he does have the infection. Freddie returns to London to meet with his band mates and current manager Jim Beach (Tom Hollander) to ask for forgiveness, they reconcile and are given a last-minute slot in Live Aid. During rehearsals, Freddie reveals to Roger, Brian and John that he has AIDS, they promise to keep this between them. On the day of Live Aid, he reunites with Hutton and then reconnects with his family, with his father's Zoroastrian maxim, ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds."" Queen's 1985 Live Aid 20-minute performance, with six of their greatest hits, and the a cappella section that became ""The Note Heard Round the World"", is a tremendous success, helping increase the rate of donations during the event. Following Freddie's death from AIDS in 1991, Beach and the remaining members of Queen create the Mercury Phoenix Trust to help combat the spread of AIDS worldwide, and his tribute concert followed in 1992. Also starring Aidan Gillen as John Reid, Ace Bhatti as Mercury's father Bomi Bulsara, Meneka Das as Mercury's mother Jer Bulsara, Priya Blackburn as Mercury's sister Kashmira Bulsara and Max Bennett as Mary's new boyfriend David. Featuring the songs ""Somebody to Love"", ""Keep Yourself Alive"", ""Seven Seas of Rhye"",""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (the title song became popular again months before the film's release when it was used in the John Lewis & Partners advert), ""Killer Queen"", ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", ""Love of My Life"", ""You're My Best Friend"", ""Now I'm Here"", ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", ""We Will Rock You"", ""Another One Bits the Dust"", ""I Want to Break Free"", ""Under Pressure"" (featuring David Bowie), ""Who Wants to Live Forever"", ""Radio Ga Ga"", ""Hammer to Fall"", ""We Are the Champions"", ""Don't Stop Me Now"" and ""The Show Must Go On"". Malek gives a superb performance as the flamboyant, troubled and iconic Mercury, his look (including the teeth), accent and mannerisms are spot on, Hardy as Taylor is okay, Lee as May is good, and Mazzello as Deacon is alright, Myers is great and almost unrecognisable, Boynton is good, and other supporting real-life characters are alright, special mention should go to Murphy as Everett and Murphy as Geldof. To be fair to the critics, there are things I do agree with in their opinions, the troubled production may be something to consider, the facts are not all correct (for example, Mercury was tested for AIDS, but not diagnosed until 1987), the pacing is a little iffy at times, some supporting performances are a little flat, and it does have clichés. But for Malek, the brilliant music (most from their Greatest Hits albums) used in some clever and poignant scenes (including the making and recording of them), the emotional moments, and of course the spectacular recreation of Live Aid (the first scene filmed), this is a must-see movie for any Queen and Freddie Mercury aficionado, a great biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Costume Design, and it won the Golden Globe Best for Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"
"Interestedviewer2","10","7","11","5 November 2018"," Wow, the ""professional"" criticts just don't get it
","At this moment in time, I feel like this movie changed my life. I know, that is a pretty intense statement, but that is exactly how I feel. I loved the movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I have read so many ""professional"" critic reviews and clearly, they do not ""get"" it. This is a movie that ""rocked me"". It is two hours long and it covers a man's life and a band's escalation to fame in a short amount of time. Two hours, clearly, doesn't cover every nuance in the man's or the band's life.<br/><br/>It is about the music guys. It is about how this amazing band became one of the greatest band's the world has ever experienced. Yes, we are given information about Freddie's ethnic history, his relationship with his forever lover Mary Austin, his relationship with Jim Hutton, and the, what appears to be despicable, gas-lighting he experienced from his professional supporter Paul Prenter. Perhaps the Paul Prenter story is true or not, but if the Queen members supported this movie, I assume they had some insight that the rest of us don't.<br/><br/>I thought Rami Malek did a wonderful job re-creating Freddie, and find it interesting that the ""professional critics"" are treating him just as poorly as Freddie was treated by the professional critics back in the day. I guess some things just don't change.<br/><br/>I am happy to be a Queen fan, and so glad I don't need the professional critics to inform me on if this movie is good or if Queen's music is good. Thankfully, I can feel it from my heart.<br/><br/>Perhaps some people (professional critics) are just too jealous or short sighted to understand what real people think."

","Words that come to mind after watching this film include: Contrived, boorish, superficial, overacted, and a complete waste of the material. The public deserves better than to watch a two hour retrospective about the lives of people who were unwilling to share the real truth about themselves. In short, this film was an insult to the audience."
"samyoung-82648","5","22","45","31 October 2018"," Malek was miscast
","Source: Many inrterviews with Mercury. Eg. interview with Freddie Mercury and Dave Clark, or Freddie and Molly Meldrum (and about 50 other interviews). Freddie's enigmatic personality and energy come through in his interviews. Malek is a wet sock by comparison, lacking that energy and vibrancy and cheekiness. Malek wasn't even in the ballpark, he was more of a ""Freddie-bot"".<br/><br/>What made Freddie so special was that he related to almost everybody (and EVERYONE knew he was gay and was fine with it - it was the 70s after all). Freddie was very careful to relate to everybody, to give his best. Sadly, this film reflects the modern divisiveness (Malek identifying himself by his nationality and his sexuality). Freddie rose above that, something Malek (and modern society) struggles to do. It's like watching the 70s liberation and free spirit through the ""modern"" politically correct filter. The only way to explain this is via George Orwell's 1984 - what ever the truth is, you say the opposite. That's Malek's performance and today's politically correct culture - Orwell's 1984.<br/><br/>The representation of Brian May and Roger Taylor was FAR more accurate and very well done. Watch the interview with Queen immediately prior to live aid. The only personality that differs from this movie was Malek.<br/><br/>It's a shame Baron-Cohen didn't play Freddie. Baron-Cohen has that charm and subtlety that Malek just doesn't understand. The police officer in Hugo or the time keeper in Alice Through the Looking Glass show that vibrancy and cheekiness that Malek lacks.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is very good. The story was highly contrived. The whole Queen ""split"" doesn't reflect the interviews by the band prior to liveaid, or any of the significant readings available on Queen (many of them i've read).<br/><br/>If you want a fun movie that loosely gets the facts right with fairly accurate casting (except Malek - who looks the part but gets the personality VERY wrong), then it's an enjoyable movie. However, if you were around in the 70s and remember how easy going and open minded the 70s were (compared to today), you'll sense something is wrong in this movie."

","I almost changed my mind about going to see Bohemian Rhapsody on opening night after seeing what the reviewers were saying about it .
I can honestly say that is the best movie I have ever seen.
The casting was brilliant (thank god Sasha Baron Cohen didn't play the part of Freddie)
The acting was top notch.
The music and singing was out of this world.
Normally, as soon as the end credits start rolling at the cinema, most people are getting out of their seats to leave.. Not with Bohemian Rhapsody..Virtually everybody remained seated and listened to the last song.
Me and my wife have never been to the cinema twice to see the same movie, but we were there again the following night to watch it again.
I do however have one major issue with Bohemian Rhapsody. It was nowhere long enough."

"jamiedarlow-37510","8","2","2","18 February 2020"," See it on the big screen!
","I think it's impossible to dislike this film; it's just a pretty damn perfect tribute to Freddie Mercury and Queen. Often times funny and emotional, it tells the true story of Freddie between the meeting of his fellow band mates and the creation of Queen all the way to the legendary Live Aid gig at Wembley Stadium (the depiction here is masterfully done; so exciting!) a pinnacle historic event that my parents and indeed the majority of their generation attended and when coming out of this screening with my partner and my mother, Mum was practically beaming with delight from the memories it evoked. Directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects) it's a very well rounded depiction of one of the greatest bands and greatest frontmen of all time and delicately balances the humour, conflict and sadness during this time. It's also written by Anthony McCarten who has proven to be an expert at biopics having previously scripted Darkest Hour and The Theory Of Everything. Of course the main star of the show is Rami Malek (Until Dawn, Short Term 12) in his extraordinary role as Mercury; so much so that he seems to practically morph into him through the duration of the film! Not only physically impressive but Malek captures the massive conflict inside Freddie projected out to camera. It's a dedicated performance with such attention to detail; himself and choreographer Polly Bennett worked so hard to capture the exact nuances of Freddie's live performances (fun fact! Sacha Baron Cohen was originally set to star with different writers but all left due to creative differences with the band) Everybody is so well cast, particularly Gwilym Lee who is the spitting image of Brian May! It also features a brilliant cameo from an unrecognisable Mike Myers as doubtful manager Ray Foster; as a Myers fanboy this was so delightful as there is even a very knowing nod to the audience referring to the iconic Queen scene from Wayne's World"

"one-nine-eighty","8","2","2","12 February 2020"," They are the champions!
","Chronicling the band Queen and in particularly frontman Freddy Mercury, from their creation until their Live Aid performance in the 80's, this is a gripping and highly entertaining film. I was dubious going into it as I feared it may be formulaic to other rock band films, I also feared it may tarnish my love of the band too. Fortunately and surprisingly I was not disappointed at all. There were some formulaic events but they were inevitable based on the subject matter, and even then they were done entertainingly. There were definite emotive moments through the film; I only had to look at my girlfriend's tears of sorrow and of joy to know that much. We both came out of the cinema having being entertained and probably like so many other people, instantly put Queen on the car stereo.<br/><br/>The cast was absolutely fantastic; I've seen other reviews which suggest that Rami Malek carried this film. I agree that his performance was mammoth, but I wouldn't say he carried it alone. The actors playing other band members were all equally fantastic, adopting mannerisms I've seen in the real band since being a fan.<br/><br/>I normally write very elaborate reviews about films but I found myself not looking for plot hole or CGI failures in this, I was just that gripped and blown away that I sat back and enjoyed the ride. This film managed to suspend my disbelief, which is something a lot of films have failed to do over the years. What the Hell have the critics that slated this film being watching?! From me this is a solid 8 out of 10 - which, based on my strict reviewing standards, is brilliant!!"
"emirfithri-12517","10","2","2","24 January 2020"," Tragedy in success
","I never liked gay people growing up. Part of the religion that I was indoctrinated into. But as I grow older and get to know their struggle, just to live a normal life, I am ashamed at how hatred can grow on you without knowing.<br/><br/>Thru music, Queen has captured my soul. I have never been more at awe at how amazing and jaw dropping Freddie's vocal power is. It is crazy to think, God put this man on earth with such talent, just to punish him for being gay.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I am grateful because I never knew Freddie's life story and journey. Rami Malek is great in being Freddie, he should get an Oscar for this acting.<br/><br/>The proportion of his life's told in this movie is also on point. We did not need to see more of his sufferrings as Aids patient. It would be heartbreaking. And the finale is just a great way to end the movie with - the charity concert.<br/><br/>I feel Freddie has graduated his life with honours.

"hiero66","6","2","2","23 January 2020"," Ok movie
","The songs are great and Rami is ok. I've watched many interviews and Rami's style and mannerisms do not remind me of Freddie Mercury. Young Freddie looks just creepy, though moustache Freddie looks better.<br/><br/>The big issue I have is that the major themes and motives in Freddie's life were completely changed. If these plot changes weren't the driving force of the movie, I wouldn't care. I don't mind changing the details of his life to condense the story into one movie, but major changes in how and why he did the things that he did are just deceptive.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't just get the reason behind major events wrong, it also changes minor details in a way that's not even believable. Some of the scenes are obviously made up.<br/><br/>When so much of the movie doesn't represent his life accurately, I almost start to wonder why they even made this film. It would have been better just to splice some of his concert footage together and put that out instead.<br/><br/>I also was not a big fan of the scene jumping from one event to another. There was a complete lack of depth and the characters were pretty weak. I still gave this 6 stars for the recreated concert scenes, and some of the ""making of the songs"" parts."
"bgar-80932","8","2","2","22 January 2020"," As advertised
","This movie has some pretty good acting and shows Queen starting up all until Freddie Mercury's death of aids. Rami Malek seems like a perfect Freddy Murphy although I've never watched Murphy's interviews or anything like that. Feels right though and it felt right seeing their creative process making some goofy songs. The music is great though and that's the main reason I watched the movie. The movie features most of my favorite Queen songs and it brings back some nostalgia. Really enjoyable movie although it's not something I'd probably re-watch."
"blakeknutson-87704","8","2","2","22 January 2020"," Malek Shines In Bohemian Rhapsody
","Queen, headed by Freddie Mercury, was among the most popular bands in the 1980s. In 2018, Bryan Singer directed Bohemian Rhapsody, a thrilling biopic that portrays the band's life. Despite excessive editing; superb costuming and camerwork, along with a star performance by Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, cements Bohemian Rhapsody as an entertaining portrayal of the story of Queen.<br/><br/>This biographical drama film casts Rami Malek in a star role as Freddie Mercury, with Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello in supporting roles as Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon, the three other members of Queen, respectively.<br/><br/>The film begins with Freddie joining a band he saw at a club, which shortly thereafter renames itself to Queen. The band soon begins to gain popularity and begins performing in concerts all over the world in cities like New York City, Edinburgh, and London. Later on, Freddie begins to date Paul Prenter, who convinces Freddie to break off from Queen and begin a solo career. A void forms between Freddie and the rest of Queen, however, years later, they make amends, and shine in their 1985 performance of Live Aid at Wembley Stadium.<br/><br/>The costuming and outfits in this film, particularly on Malek, are absolutely phenomenal, as they perfectly portray the characters. First and foremost, Rami Malek's fake buck teeth are a seamless fit, and help make Malek come to life as Freddie Mercury. Costume designer Julian Day puts several exquisite costumes on Malek, including a shiny king outfit, which beautiful depicts Mercury's personality as a flamboyant star.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer and Newton Thomas Sigel, the director and cinematographer, respectively, do an excellent job of creating camera angles where the lighting makes the scene come to life. In one scene that recreates the 1976 Edinburgh concert, blue and red flashing lights are seamlessly integrated into the camera shot, creating the effect that you are literally at the concert as you watch the film.<br/><br/>Malek shines in his role as lead actor on and off the stage. On the stage, his quirky movements and passionate lip syncing perfectly resemble Freddie Mercury. Off the stage, Malek is an arrogant, as he shows an unwavering desire to make perfect music, but also awkward at times, shy around those he was unfamiliar with. He occasionally shows his soft side, like when his emotions poured out when he found out he was gay. Malek's performance, simply put, is perfect.<br/><br/>Although Mary Austin breaks the heart of Freddie, she is vital to the film. She informs Freddie that he is gay and breaks up with him, and although this crushes Freddie, it helps him accept this reality, and leads him to not being shy about it in the future. Lucy Boynton emotionally plays the role of Mary to perfection.<br/><br/>The most obvious drawback of this film is that at times, the editing is unnecessary and flat out annoying. One scene stands out in particular: when the members of Queen meet their manager, John Reid. The scene is a relatively normal discussion at a table, but the editing is rapid and infuriating. The camera angle changes seemingly every second, as if it were a fight scene in an action movie, making it difficult to focus on the conversation.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody resembles Rocketman, the Dexter Fletcher directed biopic that gives insight into Elton John's life. Similar to Rocketman, the movie is entertaining enough that you will stay engaged throughout your whole viewing. So, despite hiccups in the film's editing, Bohemian Rhapsody is an entertaining movie that evokes joy, sadness, and laughter, making it a must watch."
"lalasummer","7","2","2","24 October 2019"," They didn't do the most they could considering who the movie was about
","Decided to round up to 7. The film felt like it was missing something huge to make it as big as it should and deserved to be. Rami definitely did a great job with his character. But there is so much more to Freddy's life that could've been added to make this feel like more of a journey, the story telling should have been told better because I didn't feel completely fulfilled afterwards. It was a beautiful film though, the visual aspects very much told the story that the script did not. The casting was very good though, especially the guy who played Brian May, felt almost magical."

Revolving around Mercury, Bohemian Rhapsody proves that well made films can drive you to joy and tears, both at the same time.<br/><br/>The characters are absolutely authentic. The sound tracks used were very appropriate. The plot does not seem contrived or forced. The characters of Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon etched perfectly. Rami Malek as Mercury starts powerfully but still continues to ascend towards the end of the film as the AIDs diagnosis declares him a dead man walking. It is Rami Malek that holds the film with sheer acting prowess and blows you away. Mercury... come alive. Wow!

I believe that Rami Malek(who portrayed Freddie Mercury) is a true talent because an average actor could not have done the work he did. He copied everything from Freddie, starting from how he spoke, how he moved, how he danced while singing and overall how he lived. This movie may have some scenes which do not resemble the reality, but the whole movie was shot in a perfect way so when you watch it you truly enjoy every second of it. Malek played Freddie in such a way that while watching I had goosebumps because he was so alike Freddie. I know that Malek spent enormous amount of time to make his role magical, and I want to say that he did look fantastic, sang amazingly and just gave the movie a real sense!

","Bohemian Rhapsody is a fantastic movie with a well developed plot and a tremendous cast. I know an argument a lot of people are making is that it is not an ""honest portrayal"" of who Queen are, and sure, that's a very fair reaction to this movie, but it's fun, campy, bursting with energy and I honestly could not have asked for any more from a film about a group of people who were nothing but.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is spellbinding as Mercury, chewing the scenery in this role, every move he made was unique and caught my attention. It had to be a challenge turning in to such a larger than life persona, and I walked in feeling particularly difficult to be won over because of how much I wanted it to be Sacha Baron Cohen, but Malek totally blew me away, and he deserves every award that comes his way.<br/><br/>The Live Aid performance at the end is magnificent and is worth watching for that scene alone, but the whole film itself is a romp. Bursting with fun and inspiration, Bohemian Rhapsody is a must for all music and Biopic fans alike.<br/><br/>

"scotartsproduction","10","2","2","15 July 2019"," Excellence - what they did and what they didn't do
","This movie accomplished a well-rounded, exciting, MUSIC-driven (as opposed to gossip-hype-BS) biography on film. I avoided it until just now because Queen and Freddie were defining characters in my youth. I didn't want to spoil the actual memories.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is so good, I literally lost all sense that I wasn't actually watching Freddie - except the teeth were overdone at the beginning, not accurate.<br/><br/>What they DIDN'T do: pander to gossips, PC agenda clones or History Revisionists. THANK YOU.<br/><br/>And to the critics saying they didn't present his gay side enough? Pull yourselves out of snowflake land, this is good filmmaking. It was handled with strength and dignity, and showed the true side of Freddie, who did not want to be defined by his sexuality or affliction. THAT, my dears, is an artist."

","Queen has been a part of much of my life.
In the late 70s in elementary school the Stomp Stomp Clap with the chorus We Will Rock You was just something we did at every sporting event.
In 1981, at 13, my father took me to see Queen at the Montreal Forum in 1981. I was mesmerized. I had seen concerts before but this is the one that sticks with me more than most.
Then there was live aid in 1985... wow.<br/><br/>I say this to explain that I was very reluctant to watch any film that didn't measure up to those memories.<br/><br/>When the film came out some of the reviews I read were not great... those critics either do not know anything about music or do not know anything about movies or more likely both and should find new careers. They were fundamentally wrong.<br/><br/>This movie sets a new high mark for a biopic about music. Rami Malek disappears into the role and channels Mercury in a way that is eerie. The rest of the cast is stellar as well.<br/><br/>There was admittedly an unavoidable glitch dispite an excellent performance by Aidan Gillen when you can't help but think ""Hey it's Littlefinger"" but it's soon forgotten.<br/><br/>But seriously see the movie and apparently don't ever listen to critics."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This was a thorough account of the rise of Freddy Mercury and Queen which culminates in their famous Live Aid performance. A couple bits are hurried and under developed but it does dive more into Freddy wrestling with who he is at his core. It highlights the origination of Queen's biggest hits and how Queen's sound evolved as they went. Also about Freddy's persona was as equally towering as the band's hit songs. Rami Malek became Freddy, gave a stellar performance and really carried the film. To top it off, won the Oscar for Best Actor. They did Queen justice so if you are a fan, you'll certainly enjoy this."

","I adore this movie. But I have to give most credits to Rami Malek. This is honestly one of the greatest performances I've ever seen, if not the greatest. Like some other people have said; I didn't see Rami Malek, I saw Freddie Mercury. And I completely agree. What an astonishing movie, good job to the directors and producers and everyone involved for being able to represent a feeling, a person , a life so magnificently. The amount of detail is so amazing in this movie. Whenever you see them play their instruments, they play the actual chords and music. Also with the clothes, the way of acting. Amazing. The Live Aid concert was a complete copy of the original. I was very much amazed by it. So well done. I was hooked with that Brian May style 20th Century Fox fanfare, I had the biggest smile on my face. And the last twenty minutes made me feel like I was at Live Aid, it was incredible"

I did expect quite a bit more. Only dabbling with the songs really just left me wanting more (I know the concert at the end did a better tribute, but they rushed it all leading up to that, so I was left wanting more for over an hour before I got it - and then didn't care for the coverage, accurate or not)."
"rvdspek-548-83775","7","2","2","18 April 2019"," Great and superficial
","Great acting, great music, great nostalgia. And yet: quite shallow if you think about it. It tells the story about how the band became successful and the same goes for the key struggles of Mercury's life. Being gay in a (assumably) traditional family background, being lonely with so many people around, HIV... it hardly shows any emotional depth and hardly has any complexity. A lot of interesting topics were just -almost casually- told, almost like a feel-good movie. Missed opportunity."

IMAX is highly recommanded especially for its wonderful sound system."
"timerit","10","2","2","3 April 2019"," Bravo
","I saw the trailer for Bohemian Rhapsody in Oct, I thought it looked interesting but wasn't dying to see it. I usually go to a bunch of movies in Jan., a lead up to the Academy Awards. This year I only made a few, Bohemian Rhapsody wasn't one of them. So when it won a handful of awards, I had to check it out.
The critics weren't overly kind but I like to think for myself and don't pay much attention to critics, only for reference. So I wasn't expecting all that.
Then the movie starts. Within literally 30 seconds, I had goosebumps. One of the finest openings to a movie I've ever seen. I knew then this was going to be good but I had no idea. I was spellbound for the entire movie which is over two hours but never seems plodding. Incredible casting, pacing and sound editing. Having grown up on Queen, its obviously taken some liberties with a few facts and the timeline but let's not quibble, it's a movie, not a documentary.
By the time we get to the final act, you'll feel so wrought with emotion that you'll have no choice but to shed a tear. The final twenty minutes is destined to be an iconic moment in film history. This is why we go to movies, it will lift your heart for days after seeing it. And don't you dare leave before the credits roll!"
"qaiserburch","10","2","2","2 April 2019"," Stunning and Entertaining
","Bohemian Rhapsody is an entertaining and stunning film for anyone who goes and sees the movie. First off you have the songs of Queen which are Classics and are considered to some people the greatest songs of all time. There is also the story of the famous singer Freddie Mercury which is truly remarkable, but what makes it amazing is the casting. Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury will go down as one of the greatest castings decisions ever. Rami Malek didn't just win best actor 2019 at the Oscars for nothing. All I can say is go watch this amazing movie."
"martynmccarthy1965","6","2","2","26 March 2019"," Is this real or is it just fanatsy?
","Remy Malik is superb, 10 out of 10. Having put in a tremendous amount of work and research into playing the part of Freddie Mercury, winning the Oscar is thoroughly well deserved. The supporting actors likewise are superb throughout. It is a pity that they are let down by the writers and senior producers and directors of this movie. These overlords could do with taking a bit out of Malik's book.<br/><br/>The problem with biographies and bio-pics is that these overlords often take a great story, then feel it is essential to alter that great story, turning into something which is not the great story that the original great story craves for. A story wanting to be told, being altered in such a way that it deflects the impact of the story away from that which it ought to be. It is the main reason that I confess that I am not a great fan of this genre.<br/><br/>Knowing that Bohemian Rhapsody was a famous song by Queen, and not reading any synopsis of plot, or other reviews before I watched it, I was expecting to see a movie about Queen. Instead what we got was a story about Freddie Mercury, whose position in Queen was aggrandized, whilst his colleagues' positions in Queen where diminished to one just above stooges.
There were four significant equal members of Queen, and any story that trivializes the other three loses my respect significantly.<br/><br/>The overlords seem to have sacrificed facts of historical significance in order to build up to, in their eyes, a fitting triumphal grande finale for Freddie Mercury. That grande finale being the Live-Aid Concert of July, 13th 1985.
I remember it all to well. The Love of my Life at the time travelled to Wembley with her colleague from her workplace to see the show.<br/><br/>In fact it was the Live-Aid Show that triggered a resurgence of interest in Queen. The production of their video for ""I Want To Break Free"" had caused a major backlash from conservative America, resulting in radio bans, which in turn lead to a collapse in revenue. Live-Aid was their penance completed and America wanted them back: Radio play again, TV, tours ~ fortunes restored.<br/><br/>By moving some of the events that occured after the show to a time before the show, such as Paul Prenter's sacking and Freddie's diagnosis of AIDS - which occured in 1987, what we have left is a 3 parts finished story that misses out on the significance that Queen rose to post Live-Aid. That is the shame of this story.<br/><br/>The one part of the movie that is without doubt excellent is the recreation of The Live-Aid Concert. If I was to judge this part of the movie alone, set aside from the rest of the movie, I would score it 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>During the concert scenes we see Bob Geldof in his usual for the time garrulous manner. Beside him is the well known character of Elton John, who does not utter a word, which is unusual as I have never known him to be so silent. Spares him from this monstrocity.<br/><br/>All movies have minor flaws, trivial goofs and so I generally set aside most of them. But to take such a part of history and radically alter it to such an extent that people are no longer seeing the real history, when they believe they are, has to be called out."

","The critics saw this as the story of Freddie Mercury. It was not a documentary of his inner life or even the events dealt with by Queen.<br/><br/>It is the story of Queen as seen through it's most interesting member. But it is not the tale of his suffering or what it was like to be gay in 1980. It was how they worked together to get some great songs which is why I loved it and it got great reviews from the audience. The songs were great and everyone it is was well cast. The events were rearranged to be more dramatic but that is what a movie is supposed to do. It is good story telling. This is the tale of a very competent man overcoming the odds including the challenge of being a ostentatious gay man with an audience (us) who love him. That is what Remi Malek said about the character, that he was unapologetic about what he was and we love him for it.<br/><br/>Those who hate this were looking at the wrong thing. There is a greater truth told in fiction than in events. They were looking for events."

"bkoganbing","8","2","2","5 March 2019"," He will......He will.......Rock you
","Rami Malek best known for playing subdued computer programmer Elliott Alderson in the TV series Robot takes on quite a different character as lead singer
Freddie Mercury of Queen. A rock legend Mercury died of AIDS in 1991, but
the melody as an older songwriter wrote still lingers on.<br/><br/>I learned quite a bit in the fact that both Malek and Mercury came from some
real minority religious faiths that have seen their share of persecution. I did
not know that Malek came from a Coptic Christian family in Egypt. They are
certainly people who feel it every time Moslem fundamentalism gets a boost.
I have a friend who like Rami Malek's family is also a Coptic Christian and fled
Africa for Canada.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury born Farrokh Bolsara is from a family who followed the
Zoroastrian faith. It is the religion of ancient Persia and there are not too many of them left in Iran. Most of the 130,000 left in the world are in India
known as Parsees. Like the Judeo-Christian-Moslem religions it is a religion
of an all encompassing Deity and an equal bad one like the western Satan.
Like the others Zoroastrianism frowns on same sex kanoodling.<br/><br/>Homosexuality very frowned on by his parents and Mercury himself did have a
loving relationship with Mary Austin played by Lucy Boynton. Still he could not deny himself and one of my favorite scenes in the film is when Queen is
on tour in America and there's wordless scene where Malek checks out a hunky
truck driver at a service station and follows him into the men's room. Mercury
was in the closet still, but the door was opening wider.<br/><br/>The familiar soundtrack of Queen favorites are the second best part of the
film and in concert Malek really becomes Freddie Mercury. What an incredible
name he gave himself, mercurial and flamboyant with an electrifying stage
and screen presence.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody won a Best Actor Oscar for Rami Malek and also got awards for Editing and Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. It missed out for
Best Picture.<br/><br/>Most of all Bohemian Rhapsody is quite the tribute to Queen and the performer and the artist named Freddie Mercury."

I am glad Malek got an oscar because it was a fantastic physical performance but why did they persist.....<br/><br/>Apart from that a lot of this was watchable. If you are a queen fan then you will love it. I understand the rating vs lifestyle depiction issues but there really is so much nod and winking going on that it starts to lose credibility.<br/><br/>The live aid scene was fantastic.

I have listened to songs of the band but haven't been familiar with their struggles and their rise to fame, the movie shows it and most importantly how brilliant Freddie was and in the end to only be reminded that we have lost him shows the harsh truth of life.

","The first part of the movie is basically a rock video with a little bit of story involved, part 2 of the movie is the biggest part of the movie and here we are taken down a rabbit hole of intrigue, betrayal, depression and self-distruction. This movie betrays what is possibly the greatest vocalist of our time as troubled and highly manipulated. The end, or part 3 of the movie is in some way a slight vindication of the man and the musician. The overall effect of the movie is scattered and jumbled yet also telling and compelling. It is a movie worthy of watching simply for the music. But it also allows you to see inside the mind of a musical genius. Queen will forever be rock royalty and while this movie doesn't live up to the legendary status of the band it gives us all an idea of what it took to elevate themselves to such a prominent place in the world's culture. Queen, the band is a 10/10. The movie at best is a 8/10, for now I will give it a 7."

","A biopic fitting for such an amazing individual and iconic singer. Rami Malek delivers an eerily great performance as Freddie Mercury that is more than deserving for the Oscars, and it is even better that the film does not feel carried by him, but carried by the aura of Mercury and his music. You could just see in Rami's eyes that this is not just another role for him, but he truly embodies another individual. The beginning portion of the film does feel a bit loose, but with so much to tell in such a short period of time, it is hard to place the blame on anyone, especially with such an emotional and surprisingly uplifting ending.

I occasionally heard their songs played but didn't know the artist. I first learned of Freddie Mercury when I read a chronology of 20th century music and it mentioned him. At sixteen I listened to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's parody of Queen's most famous song (basically the original sung like a polka). I then watched ""Wayne's World"" and heard the original version. It was only in the last few years that I learned of Mercury's sexual orientation.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've read conflicting reports as to the movie's accuracy with regards to Mercury's relationships with people - and complaints that it didn't address the rampant homophobia in the 1980s - but there's no doubt that Rami Malek puts his all into the role. I doubt that I'll ever get into Queen's music, but I still recommend the movie. I haven't seen all the Best Actor nominees, but I'd say that Malek deserved his win. Good one, with fine support from Lucy Boynton, Joseph Mazzello (Tim in ""Jurassic Park"") and an unrecognizable Mike Myers."

This filmed touched me on such an emeotional level and really made me see Freddie in a new light. Rami did such a great job. Watch the real ""Live Aid"" on YouTube when done with the movie and you will be blown away. This is definitely being added to my favorites collection."

","Quite impressive! The acting was top notch by all four band members. The sound and cinematography were also excellent. I have seen a few of the other nominated pictures and my vote for Best Picture is with Bohemian Rhapsody. This film has been nominated in five (5) categories and it would not surprise me if they won in all five categories, especially for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is a chameleon and his performance as Freddy Mercury has guaranteed him that his next five (at least) pictures will assure him with a starring role and be paid as one of the most highest paid actors in Hollywood.<br/><br/>This film as biographies go, is so well done. I think that this can be measured as a result of securing two of the founding members of Queen, namely Brian May and Roger Taylor as consultants on the picture.<br/><br/>My only suggestion is I wish the biography of Queen should be made into a 10 hour TV mini-series so that the background stories of all the band members could have been explored in much more depth.<br/><br/>This is a very good biopic worthy of an 8 out of 10 score plus a few Oscars including the Best Picture 2019."
"zmathis-09660","2","2","2","22 February 2019"," Hollywood Garbage
","I can't believe how many positive reviews are on here. This movie is a major disappointment. The only redeeming factor is Rami Malek's great performance but that only went so far with me. This movie does everything that Queen seemed to stand against - following all the rules. This is a Hollywood movie in nearly every aspect and you can feel that throughout the entire film. I am a Queen fan, but not once during this film did I feel compelled to move or sing along, even in my head. A QUEEN biopic and they played it safe. This movie should have been 3 hours long, it should have tested our patience, it should have bombarded our senses leaving us breathless and not sure what to think at first. Many of Queen's songs are like that, and they become greater upon repeated listenings as we discover new and rewarding layers. This movie has no dimensions. And it ignored his sexuality almost entirely. Unforgivable, if you ask me. I'm not saying it should have displayed graphic sex, but this film takes a coward's stance in that regard. A total let down."

It certainly took me back to the 70's, and gave me a whole new appreciation of Queen and their undeniable role in producing such classic rock hits as Bohemian Rhapsody, Somebody to Love, We Are the Champions, and so many others.

I'm totally a fan of Freddi Mercury now, and hate myself for avoiding him all my life so far. It was eye opening to me how energetic, full of life this guy was.

","Rami Malek was definitely ""Freddie Ready""! He nailed it. The story line circles around the Live Aid performance and Rami became Freddie. Not only was Rami amazing but the rest of the casting was brilliant as well. I remember all these songs as I was living in Europe at the time. The essence of this movie has made FMer come alive again, and more so now for Americans who didn't ""get"" the band at the time, and now new generations. The fact that the storyline may not be chronologically accurate is not a negative, as a story is being told of who FM and Queen were; really kinda normal guys, til they got on stage! Brilliantly done! Iconic movie of a legend. But even the talented legend had to become the legend through belief, persistence and hard work; values that have been washed out in our times today."
"brianharper-33017","7","2","2","19 February 2019"," Amazing movie, yet fictional as well.
","Much of the storyline was wrong. I understand it is a movie, but I feel as if the writers should have kept to what is true rather than put their own spin on things. It really discredits Freddie Mercury and a few others. The same thing was done with the Tupac Shakur movie, NWA, and even Walk The Line amongst many others. Good movie, but Hollywood...please...as I sit in my hotel in the middle of your city, please stop the BS and show people what's true."
"rannynm","8","2","2","18 February 2019"," Amazing Script, Constantly Daring And Unexpected
","Before seeing this movie, I was mostly neutral about Queen. I did like their songs, but I was never really a fan. However this movie completely changed my perspective of the band. Even though I only knew the most famous songs, that doesn't matter. You don't need to be a fan to enjoy this film. It belongs to everyone, like Queen does.<br/><br/>The story follows Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek), the lead singer of Queen, and his rise to fame, but also his fall from grace. It sounds really simple, but the other aspects of the movie, such as the writing and acting, really set it apart from other similar films.<br/><br/>First, the script is amazing. Kudos to the script writer, Anthony McCarten. There are so many scenes in this movie that are genuinely full of tension particularly scenes showing the band arguing and practically any scene with Paul Prenter (Allen Leech). The writing really helps deliver tension in the darker scenes and make the more uplifting scenes really motivating. The writing makes you feel Freddie's downward spiral. The scenes with Paul especially made me genuinely nervous. Because, you know he doesn't care about Freddie and he just wants to leech off of him. All you want is for Freddie to cut ties with Paul. Thankfully, this movie isn't a complete downer, as there are some genuinely heartwarming moments, especially in the beginning. Then, things get dark pretty quickly. It's nice seeing the band get together and hang out. You genuinely believe in their friendship.<br/><br/>This movie also shows Freddie dealing with real issues - his race, his sexuality and not feeling like a disappointment to his parents. Life is complicated, whether or not you are rich and famous. We also got to give special attention to Freddie's actor. Rami Malek really is Freddie Mercury! It is so spot on that Rami Malek and Freddie Mercury look almost identical. That's what I call amazing casting. While the rest of the cast is really great as well, Rami Malek completely steals the show.<br/><br/>This movie also excels at showing how destiny works in mysterious ways. For example, five minutes before Freddie asks to join to the band, the lead singer quits. I find that really interesting. To be honest, the only issue I have with this movie is the final scene. It's a recreation of the Live Aid performance Queen did, which seems fine at first. However, the scene goes on forever. It is a good scene and I get why they made it so long, but after awhile I kept wondering how much longer the scene was going to last. That's really my only issue with the film. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, as well as adults. Even if you're not a huge Queen fan, I think you'll enjoy this. Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

I was already a fan of Malek for his work on Mr Robot but this put him on a whole new level for me.<br/><br/>The way they laid out the music was great.

"patriciogl10","7","2","2","16 February 2019"," Rami Malek and Queen's timeless music.
","I have the feeling many moviegoers have been surpassed by the infectious and overwhelming nostalgia that seems to take over and obscure an objetive judgement of the film. While it is not nowhere near a masterpiece, it isn't bad either. It is an acceptable portrayal of the band's history leading up to their legendary Live Aid concert.
The physical resemblance of May, Taylor and Deacon are spot on. Rami Malek sort of lacks the uncanny resemblance but he makes up for it with his enormous acting, through his gaze, mannerisms and vocal inflection. He gave
such an exceptional performance which is without a doubt the highlight of the film, along with the final scene. One could say that those two elements carry the movie's weight on their shoulders, because without them, the film would definitely be of average quality.<br/><br/>The way the filmmakers depicted Freddie's sexuality was okay, I mean obviously they played it safe, because this is a filmic representation of the band, properly supervised by Queen's actual members Brian May and Roger Taylor so, a daring version of the late singer's life story would have been out of the question (many would have preferred Sascha Baron Cohen's version instead). Still that wouldn't have ensured us a tasteful handling of his personal life. Nevertheless, I actually enjoyed the film, and I'm not entirely sure what percentage of my view on it was biased by the nostalgia factor, but I can safely say the majority of Queen fans will have a blast with this film and will undoubtedly praise Rami Malek's outstanding performance, along with the Live Aid concert scene, which is shot properly and creatively, hence why is one of the better parts of the film, and of course it contains the music of Queen, which of course, is one of the most important aspects of this effort."

"MaryAnn3019","10","2","2","15 February 2019"," God save the Queen!
","Bohemian Rhapsody oozes cinematic lucidity and enthusiasm wherever you look at it.
Despite the fact that some analysts have indicated that they see a superficial proposal in the film, not getting deep into Freddie MercuryÂ´s, internal demons, struggles and controversies, I think that If we do not understand it as a subtlety for all audiences, what must be clarified is that it is not necessary thanks to the extraordinary energy and the ostensible talent that Bohemian Rhapsody contains and that drag us to joy and even move us. The intelligent dialogues, with spark and dramatic eloquence. The incredible performance of Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury. Scenes follow one another with clever transitions, in a continuum of pure rhythm, and thus, its complex structure seems elaborated with simplicity since it flows with an alluring force.
Rami Malek gives us an incarnation of Freddie Mercury so incredible that he deserves all the awards and recognition that can get, which happens to the point that the performances of his competent co-stars are enhanced by his alone presence."
"siderite","8","2","2","14 February 2019"," Malek is great, the bio pic recipe is quite formulaic
","Hollywood does biographies like they do their films: they take reality and cut and rearrange and fake it until it makes money. A lot of moments were more dramatic than what really happened or even fictitious, but it all looks good. You get the feel for Freddie's forced confidence, always looking forward, living the day, but at the same time remaining a scared little kid that needs friends and is vulnerable to bad influence. Also the band didn't split on his account alone, they all went and did their own thing once in a while, but always came back. It wouldn't look good on film, though. So while I enjoyed the film, it felt like so many other movies I've seen. The AIDS stuff is also very mixed around.<br/><br/>But Rami Malek was great. At the beginning I was having doubts, I don't think he had gotten used to the false teeth and he looked kind of uncomfortable, but really fast he got into the role so well that him and Freddie mixed up in my mind. I thought it would be off putting because he looked so much like that kid in the Invisible Man video (they didn't get the hair quite right), but he was really good.<br/><br/>So bottom line: great music, great performances, the story a bit bland and formulaic. A solid 8/10."

It follows the same formula to the letter. While it was interesting to delve into the life of Mercury and bandmates, it all felt a little watered down and simplified in contrast with the larger than life enigma that was the Queen lead singer.

Remy Malek's performance was outstanding. He was perfect for this role. He deserve to win the Oscar.
However, i'm a bit disappointed that this movie was too short. I've expected to be a little longer. This movie is somehow not finished. Why it ended with Live Aid? Where is the rest of Freddie Mercury's life from 1985 to 1991? I've expected to see the last days of his life. I know that the director wanted to end this biopic in a positive way, but come on! This biopic is unfinished!"

"mghodges","9","2","2","24 January 2019"," Having avoided this film for months.....
","I finally caved!! I have been a huge Queen fan for over 45 years and couldn't bring myself to see a composite of more than 15 years crammed into 2 1/4 hours.
If you know the band, and their history, you can pick lots of historical ""errors"" but, if you view it as a biopic based on things that happened at some stage put together in a reasonably chronological order, then it improves.
The accuracy the band members, particularly Freddie Mercury and Brian May, are portrayed which is, frankly, astounding and, I think, causes the critic reviews to be less favourable.
If you don't know the band at all it is a watchable film but professional critics would find it easy to dislike if they neither know, or like, the band.
The accurate characterisation makes parts of the film almost cringe worthy if you don't know Queen.
If you know some of the history you are carried into Queen's world where you can emotionally engage with the film.
The singing of Love of My Life from the Rock in Rio segment was, for me, extremely moving as I could understand it's meaning within the film and, having sung it many times myself with up to 125,000 others, had many fantastic memories bought back to me.
So, in summary, if you're a critic, learn a bit of the history, and characteristics, of the band then watch it again.
If you're a true fan, forgive the necessary ""errors"" and immerse yourself in the best musical biopic made for decades.
If you're neither it's bloody good fun!!"

","Hardly strays from the generic biopic formula for the first half, hitting all the major notes in Queen's rise to fame with plenty of concert montages (and in contrast, little substantial conflict). That said, the fact that I teared up at the redemptive reunion and final performance shows that that the character work is done extremely well along the way (Malek is great): Freddie is a fascinating, flawed character and his journey to find himself and his family (also well drawn) is a touching one.

","I ignore critics before seeing a film, knowing they often get it wrong. But I went to see this film thinking it was mostly going to show the excessive lifestyle of Queen members. Rather, Bohemian Rahapsody shows us the life of Farrokh Bulsara an immigrant from Zanzibar. Say what? That's our beloved Freddy Mercury alright. Son of immigrants, growing up in the UK. What a treat to see Freddy's personal life.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is done in a most human, emotional, respectful way. We see the rise and greatness of Queen, the only band in history where each member created a number one hit. But we also see how the band members had such amazing respect for one another, that they could let each other take turns in shining. Long live Queen.<br/><br/>I've been a Rami Malek fan for a while but he really knocked it out of the park on his loving portrayal of Freddy. Was beautiful to see that long sweet friendship with Mary Austin.<br/><br/>Just like critics were wrong about the band as they belted out hit after hit, the critics are wrong about this film.

I thoroughly enjoyed it - It gives us an insight into the world they lived in; there are moments of joy and excitement, however it also portrays the lows and loneliness that so many of us have heard of. The film focuses on Freddie Mercury in the main, showing his life to be one of flamboyant brilliance, and ultimate tragedy. The only other thing I would have wanted out of this film is a glimpse into the other members lives, as there is so much more to the story - at the same time I understand that it's a film and it can't possibly show us the whole story (I wish!). I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see an extraordinary life lived. The actors certainly made did amazing justice to Queen....loved it!"

"jessicakemptonjones","9","2","2","17 January 2019"," An Entertaining Watch with Many a Tender Moment - Malek Provides a Standout Performance in this Poignant, Must-See Biopic
","A remarkable portrait of a marvellously talented yet flawed individual. Top form casting for a large majority of the film's characters - although Malek's understandably praised performance provides an uncanny resemblance to Mercury himself, and his (Malek's) collection of due awards is surely not over just yet.
Acknowledging many standout events in the band's history and spanning numerous years - from the band's beginning to 1985's foray at Live Aid - Bohemian Rhapsody unfolds in a meaningful manner with all the fervour and might of Queen's signature flair for theatrics. A good idea to pin down a particular event (Live Aid) and structure the narrative around that, as so much of Mercury's life is operatic to say the least - never short of both tragedy and opulent imagery at any given moment. The inclusion of Live Aid in this biopic is ultimately poignant too: the idea of music as a medium for connectivity and positive change is a lasting one. Perhaps a biopic of this scale to retell the events leading up to Bob Geldoff's legendary hair-brained idea is next on the cards? I'd certainly watch that space.
If I can fault this film on anything it would be at times the comedy is found to be slightly contrived/forced, but altogether Bohemian Rhapsody is a wonderfully satisfying watch."

","I think many Freddy and Queen fans are overpraising this film because they're such great fans of the music. I, too, grew up loving the man and the band, but have to honestly say this movie is just pretty good--and mostly because of the music.<br/><br/>There's very little dramatic tension, as the movie shows the band rising quickly and easily without any struggles. Even if it's true that they didn't have to starve for decades before being discovered, the movie could have built more drama through the clash of band members and with other characters. The ""tension"" scene where they meet the random record producer who doesn't get Bohemian Rhapsody really lacks tension; everything is predictable and undramatic.<br/><br/>Perhaps there were too many storylines they had touch on, too many songs to cover (as all Queen fans know, they could only include about half the big hits in this movie). I would have liked to see more infighting while they were still unknown or while getting discovered. More serious tension in the family scenes would have given this story more meaning. Instead, the family dynamic is pretty much of made-for-TV movie quality.<br/><br/>But the music ROCKED! And the Live Aid performance (well lip-synced by Rami Malek) made a great ending. For that, I give it 8 stars!"

Took my teenage kids with me, definitely had some parts that we discussed after, however, it was not the theme of the movie. It was the music made through camaraderie and inspiration that truly gifted performers have given the world. There were so many songs I didn't know Queen had created.

","I'll try to keep it concise although there is so much I could say: Casting decisions were spot on, as much as I enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen's witty comedies, I am relieved they cast Rami Malek in the end. Rami really got down Freddie's flamboyant personality to a t as he pays so much attention to how Freddie talked and moved but Rami is not the only actor ot rave about. Ben Hardy, Joe Mazello and Gywilym Lee are also excellent in their roles as Roger Taylor, John Deacon and Brian May respectively. The characters felt very accurate and I'm glad that everyone working on the film strived to be so faithful to real life. The comedy in this film is hilarious, the jokes about 'i'm in love with my car' (which is actually a good song if you ask me) are particularly funny. Most importantly of all, it's so moving. Every emotion that the protagonists experienced, I can honestly say I felt it too.

"rogier-86785","9","2","2","29 December 2018"," Quite the masterpiece, in more ways than one. Go see it.
","What is it with critics and Queen? Both about the Bohemian Rhapsody in its day and now with this film, it's absolutely amazing to see how off the critics can be. Queen seems to spark resentment. Completely unjustified, as this film is quite the little masterpiece in a number of ways.<br/><br/>First of all, it was surprisingly funny. The comedic timing and content is on par with the best comedies. I kid you not, it was hilarious. The whole theater was on the floor. Of course, there is tragedy as well. The story of Queen was not written on a bed of roses after all.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound engineering is quite extraordinary as well. Provided you watch it in a big theater with great stereo (!), you get the weird feeling of actually standing in their studio. That's how close the camera and audio take you.<br/><br/>Which makes the critics reviews so strange and sour. Just from a cinematic point of view, this is an extremely well made film, regardless of its content. It even takes you onstage with arguably one of the best performances of a band of all time. If not the best, knowing Freddy Mercury his history.<br/><br/>This makes the critic reviews so strange: somehow critics dislike Queen while the people love it. It's popularity is always met with resentment from the elite.<br/><br/>Quick fires on the rest of the film: The actor performances were very good. Especially Brian May... the resemblance was uncanny. The film is a little longer than feels comfortable though, which lands it my 9 instead of 10. But that's forgivable given the amazing story. And yes, it does help if you like their music. But it's not a prerequisite. The film itself is good in its own right.<br/><br/>It seems that history repeats itself. With this film again, the critics are exposed as sour. This is a beautiful, well shot and very funny film. Go see it."

"aidenbortel","9","2","2","29 December 2018"," Only movie to almost make me cry of happiness
","Bohemian Rhapsody is now my favorite movie as of right now. I have just returned from the movie theater about 10 minutes ago as of writing this. First of all, I wish I discovered Queen's talent sooner because I thought they were a small band, and I only knew them as the people who wrote ""We Will Rock You."" But they are so much more than that. Second, the pacing in this movie is perfect. It starts with Freddie and the band getting ready for Live Aid, a concert that in my opinion is the most important event of music history. But then it cuts to Freddie but he's different and is in a small town. When Queen writes the hit ""Killer Queen"", their fame explodes. Then a sequence shows the concerts they played at. I love that pacing. Third, Rami Malek did a staggeringly amazing job playing Freddie Mercury. The movement, the dancing, everything is a great performance. I want him to win Oscars and Golden Globes and so many other music awards. He nails Freddie and from the videos I've seen of the real Freddie Mercury, I can't tell the difference between the too. Not just looks but character and so much more is what makes them alike. Fourth, this movie does an excellent job at telling the story of Queen not just Freddie Mercury. It starts with them as a local band called smile. The lead singer of it quits and Freddie Mercury joins alon with John Deacon on bass. Then they experiment in a studio with songs and create the hit ""Killer Queen"". Then from there is just success until of course, Freddie Mercury's passing. Fifth, the Live Aid scene is amazing. Camera shots, performances by literally everyone in that scene, the stadium they perform in, the accuracy to the actual concert, and sound quality. It is the most beautiful movie scene I have ever seen. I sang along with the movie and almost cried.<br/><br/>
The ending was the Live Aid scene and a little tribute to Freddie Mercury. That's why the rotten tomatoes are a down on this movie souly because of the ending. But I don't mind, because this movie celebrated the LIFE of Freddie Mercury and not his death. His death isn't important to this movie and isn't the main focus. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that they didn't show Queen perform the song ""Under Pressure."" But that's a nit picky thing so I'm sure no one else will mind. I rate this movie a 9/10"
"djbarkman","10","2","2","29 December 2018"," This movie is a champion, my friends.
","This movie is amazing, and I recommend to about everyone. When I used to think of Queen, I just thought of it as the ""We Will Rock You"" people. But after seeing the movie, they are so much more to me. This is up there with Shawshank for the best movies I have ever seen."
"aspero-12928","9","2","2","28 December 2018"," Queen music is the real protagonist
","Simply a masterpiece. It has everything: drama, music, comedy.You're not seeing a musical but a real music video. It's not far different from listening a Queen playlist with the life of Freddie Mercury on the background. Each scene is based on a song and its genesis. The reproduction of the exhibition at the Live Aid is perfect. The interpretation of Rami Malek is astonishing and the cinematography of Bryan Singer is always at the top (I'm looking forward ""Rocketman"", the biopic on Elthon John interpretated by Taron Edgerton). I expect an ample success at 2019 Oscar."

","At first I was very sceptical about the Fredy Mercury biopic but after I saw it, i was amazed.
Ok, there are some changes in the movie from the real life happenings for the paceing but in my opinion it can be seen as the freedom of the director. The movie is about a Man who wants to life his dream with one big aim. He wants to earn his money with his music, ok. But in my opinion his greater aim is to get the respect of his father who never stood behind him and his behavior / dream."

"Enchorde","9","2","2","16 December 2018"," Loved it
","Following the formative years of the legendary band Queen, from the perspective of Freddy Mercury, it takes us along two paths at once. One is what the characters would probably say it is all about, the music. Queen has a rich treasure of well known great tunes to use and play. There sure are a nostalgia factor, but I think a younger audience appreciates the music as well, and perhaps discovers something new. The music is very well used and the urge to clap/sing along is great.<br/><br/>The other part is what the actors might say it is all about. How the band formed and developed, Mercury's relationships with Mary, his family and the gay community. The emergence and the story of AIDS. There are a lot of interesting plots that unfold intertwined with each other. Some events are dramatized quite a bit compared to what really happened, but in the context of making a story for the movie it works.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Rami Malek has deservedly gotten a lot of praise, but I think the other cast is worth mentioning. The band, Mary especially, and a few minor characters (like Jim Hutton) tha bring invaluable contributions to some scenes. And I really liked the direction too. As I said, there are a lot of things to cover in this movie, but it never felt fragmented. The music, the biography, it all comes together in a splendid weave. And as a fan of movie I really liked the (hidden?) gem of Mike Myers (of Wayne's World fame among other) playing a record boss saying that no kids will sit in a car and singing along to Bohemian Rapsody.<br/><br/>This movie got pretty much everything and does it superbly. Highly recommended (and if you do watch it, do it with a capable sound system!)"
"captaincalamityclam","9","2","2","16 December 2018"," Wow, well done, my film of the year
","I don't like many films to be honest, but this seriously hits the spot, if you liked Queen or didn't (not sure how you couldn't) this addaption of the band and a overview of Freddies troubles through life, was directed and produced in the almost perfect way, sometimes we don't need all the nitty gritty details that seem to be forced on us these days, we know Freddie had a dark time, struggles with ups and downs and this film touches on most of them. For me if felt like a well documented look at Queen as a band, but the music, well what can I say lifts the whole experience right up, making you actually feel like standing up and stamping your feet and clamping your hand high above your head to ""we will rock you"" , well done, highly recommended film."

"kellybateman-78072","9","2","2","2 December 2018"," Like an atom bomb
","Finally mustered up the nerve to watch Bohemian Rhapsody. Here's my 50 pence.<br/><br/>Like all the greatest virtuosos - of our time and times past - Freddie left this world way before we were ready to let him go; leaving millions devastated in his wake, even now, 27 years later.<br/><br/>To quote Shakespeare 'Violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder' and so on.<br/><br/>As a 90s baby, I obviously never had the chance to see Queen (live and in the flesh) but I can honestly say I'm not-sad about that. Reaching the climax of his life, at the height of his greatness, immortalised Freddie and that was the universe's ultimate gift to the man (and his fans) who gave music (and the world) so much; granting him God-like status, in my eyes, if you will.<br/><br/>This film is a treat for true Queen fans. An utterly stunning and succinct viewpoint of a frustrating but beloved, eccentric and compassionate man; and those who tolerated his madness. I'm grateful for the faultless cast, for those who were able to tell this chronicle with such fervour and delighted that the story - of the enigma that was Freddie Mercury - can, deservedly, continue to live on for generations to come.<br/><br/>An absolutely touching tale of a true misfit, an underdog who recklessly believed in their dream."

Both the casting and acting in this movie were INSANE, so accurate and on par! Remi Malek did such an amazing job as Freddie... And I absolutely couldn't believe the actor who played Brian May, I literally told Dan at the end, if I didn't know the real Brian May was so much older, I would've thought he played himself, that guy was SO on it was scary!

"Movielicker94","8","2","2","20 November 2018"," Amazing way to bring the legend back!
","For a person that doesn't listen to a lot English music Queen's name was distant for me, though I had heard the name. By watching this movie I realized how big this band was in their prime time. Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) really carried this movie. His acting was just amazing. He did a superb job in this movie.<br/><br/>What I really missed in this movie was the less screen time for the other movies. Since this was a biography about the band Queen and not Freddie, the other members should also had more screen time. However, since Freddie was the artist in the band I think he deserved a lot concern. Nevertheless, I also think the other members should have got more screen time. For instance, they should have shown shortly what happened with the other members while Freddie was a solo artist.<br/><br/>Overall, a great acting by Rami. So a big applause to him and what a great movie. If you love music from the 80s and Queen, this is a movie for you! Totally recommend. :D"

"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","2","14 November 2018"," Rami Malek IS Freddie Mercury
","I really liked it despite the fact that the direction was often all over the place but I guess that had to do with the replacement of Bryan Singer after 2 third of the film as some scenes show different style. That and of course that it is not 100% historical accurate.. but then.. which biopic is? Getting this out of the way I have to see it was a great portray of a brilliant musician who, like many brilliant musicians, died far too young.
It was maybe a bit overlong, you could have cut it here and there but other than that it really drove me into the life of Freddie Mercury and into his personality. A huge fact why his succeeded is the outstanding perfomance by Rami Malek who deserves all applauses you can get for this extremely authentic portray. He really got the characteristics, movements and what is most difficult the charisma of Mercury to the point. Terrific. Also many of the other performances were good like the one by Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello, to a lesser extend. Mike Myers was also ok , despite many negative reviews he received. As expected the soundtrack was awesome and the true highlight of the film was the portray and recreation of the legendary Live Aid concert."

Bryan Singer kinda brought the format of the Opera to make this film: it begins with a soft and beautiful opening; a dramatic set of twists; a clash between Queen members; a crescendo along the dark path that Mercury seemed to follow to then explode in such a melodic and amazing performance in Live Aid. This could be insulting to the way filmmakers usually tell stories; but for the laymen and for every Queen fan this film is epic in every sense.

"scb_coldsteel","8","2","2","12 November 2018"," Long live the Queen!
","So I saw Bohemian Rhapsody at the theater. I absolutely love Queen so my expectations of this movie were incredibly high. Overall the movie has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is a must see movie for the year. It certainly deserves some criticism for sloppy directing, but it is impossible not to fall in love with Queen all over again while watching the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the film of course primarily focuses on Freddie Mercury and his complicated life while being the lead singer of Queen. The movie opens with a flashback to illustrate Freddie Mercury's immense talent, his rise to stardom, but also peppers in his descent into drug use, his acceptance of being a homosexual, and eventually discovering he has AIDS.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways the movie reminded me of the film The Doors directed by Oliver Stone. It had an absolute perfect lead to embody the star in every way. It hit all the right notes showing the birth of all those iconic songs. It illustrates a morality tale of the difficulties of stardom. Yet despite all these strengths it was a ultimately flawed but enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is sure to please pretty much every fan of Queen. Essentially the movie acts as a greatest hits reel demonstrating the conception and performance of Queen's greatest hits. It was impossible not to feel a chill of excitement watching the birth of Bohemian Rhapsody. That of course being the film's greatest strength. It really immersed the fans into the music and mythology behind Queen. The film certainly played it safe in that regard acting as a straightforward fan pleasing look into the inner workings of Queen. That is not a bad thing as it really made those scenes and the iconic songs come to life.<br/><br/>The movie also demonstrates Freddie Mercury's acceptance as a homosexual. The movie shows the struggles and difficulties he faced as he came to terms with his wife and his difficulties living a homosexual life in that era. I would have preferred a bit more social commentary on homosexual discrimination and the AIDS epidemic, but the film only lightly used these issues as a backdrop. Still the emotional conflict between Mercury and his wife was intense and really added a great deal to the movie.<br/><br/>Of course the film also depicted the momentary fall a Freddie Mercury into drug use and debauchery. The depiction of Freddie Mercury here and his poor choices, the film says is the reason Queen faced any real hurdles as a band. This aspect seems to unfairly paint Freddie Mercury in a corner while leaving the surviving members of Queen squeaky clean. Seems a tad bit biased and one-sided. This of course being no surprise as the living members of the band were actively involved in the production of the film.<br/><br/>Acting wise this film was utterly amazing. Rami Malek will get nominated for an Oscar, simple as that. He embodied every aspect of Freddie Mercury. His voice, look, mannerisms, and style were all perfectly captured. This wasn't just some caricature of Freddie Mercury, it was a genuinely amazing performance. To say he made the movie would be an understatement. This is the role that could launch his career into mainstream movies.<br/><br/>Directing wise the movie seemed to have a difficult time finding its voice. Of course the movie had a complicated history in its creation with Bryan Singer walking off set and being replaced halfway through filming. This really shows as at times it seems like the movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a simple people pleasing biography? Is it a comedy with Mike Myers in a prosthetic mask?Is it a complex morality tale regarding the dangers of excess and stardom? Is it focusing on the struggles of Freddie Mercury or the struggles the band had to go through because of Mercury? Ultimately the film suffered a bit from a lack of a consistent tone and vision.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is certainly a must-see film. The reaction in my auditorium of people standing and clapping really hammers that point home. It will certainly make you want to listen to Queen and all of their iconic hits. It also shows the complicated genius that was Freddie Mercury and the struggles he encountered. I'd largely recommend this movie purely to see the incredible acting talent. While certainly not a perfect film, it was a very enjoyable one. A 8.5 out of 10."

","First of all it's perfect but 9, cause there was no Bowie. I desperately expected to see Bowie too. Other than that, I can't find the right words to describe it.
Again, I chose to trust the user's rating cause we all know metascore mislead us most of the time. But seriously, I don't get what's wrong about those people. The movie was great. It's so huge, I don't know how can I put it into words, you need to see the movie to understand what I'm talking about. It was full of energy, full of life, full of emotions and through the whole movie I felt that damned rhythm in my veins. Sometimes when I watch a movie, I feel like that I'm a part of it, like I live in there too, I felt the same when I watch Bohemian Rhapsody. Not many movies had given me that feeling, but if you ever felt it you should have known what it makes you feel like. So yes the movie was perfect, go watch it. I'm still in my 20s so it took me years to discover Queen, I wish I could start to listen to them earlier but I'm still happy that I discovered them before this movie. Even if you don't listen to them, go watch it, you will end up as a Queen fan. I left the cinema with a throbbing heart and tears, but I'm a soppy girl after all..."

","Funny, witty, energetic, this movie will keep you watching in awe till the very end. If Mr. Malek doesn't get an Oscar for this performance it will be high time to shut the Oscars down for good. Had they given a little bit more space to Queen's creative process, it would have been a 10/10 for me."

I thought Rami malek played the role of his life in mr. Robot
This acting performance is his best so far, he'll make a career out of this film
Not to mention the cinematography, the music
And how they make you live with them every moment of the film
Marvellous!"
"isabellacatgirl","8","2","2","12 November 2018"," Ending made me Cry!!!! Hopefully this is a return to more gritty cinema...
","Not sure where to begin but after writing this review I will be watching this movie a second time.<br/><br/>The first thing that really impressed me was how realistic the acting is. Damn. It really does make you feel like you are actually hanging out with the real Freddie Mercury for 2 hours! I know it's just Rami Malek,but damn his portrayal is just too spot on. Also Gwilym Lee as Brian May is just too good. I kept thinking ""WTF!? Did they get a clone to play Brain May!?!?"" He looks exactly like a clone of Brian May,it's not even funny,uncanny and eerie even. The whole band is portayed to the tee. I love how Roger Taylor is kind of like the comic relief here. This movie is not a comedy though,imo it's definitely a drama.<br/><br/>Again the acting is really solid,and probably the best I've seen in years. Lucy Boynton is very good too as Mary Austin. The only problem I have is with the wrong chronology of when the hit songs were released. The albums Queen II and Flash Gordon are totally ignored. ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" did NOT comeout before ""We Will Rock You"",nor did the latter come out during the The Game era as they say here,but that doesn't really take away from the powerful performances of the acting. That's how solid the acting in this movie is. I was actually quite surprised how serious Mike Myers' role is in this also. Especially after reading a bad review in the newspaper, I was expecting he was gonna be like the comic relief but really wasn't. This is not his first dramatic role though either. Mike Myers was in that movie Studio 54 and that definitely was no comedy,and again neither is this film.<br/><br/>There are other small inconsistancies I find within the film(such as the accounts with Freddie's sexuality),but they are small and don't ruin the overall performance,and it tells the story of Freddie Mercury quite well and to the point. I kept thinking to myself ""OMG...this scene...did this actually happen? Did that actually happen?"" ...That's how good the acting is imo. Honestly it made me also feel like it's a throwback to 70's cinema.<br/><br/>The ending actually reminds me of Rocky, no joke. The way they build it up to that final moment at Live Aid is something. How this bucktoothed lonely mega talented outsider from a poor family went from total obscurity, to commanding that whole stage on Live Aid like a f-cking boss, just makes me think of Rocky for some reason. Lucy Boynton at the end reminds me of Talia Shire's performance in Rocky as well. that whole build up towards the end just made me cry I can't help it lol. It very might be one of the greatest endings ever committed to film!! Watching it again and again."
"Bored78","9","2","2","12 November 2018"," It was well done.
","I know there has been some controversy around this movie since the project was started. It was a long road to produce this biopic, but it did turn out really well in my opinion.<br/><br/>I like Queen and i thought it was a really good movie. It didnt focus on any one thing about Freddie but instead showed us the many sides of the person and that made it feel more real. Rami did an excellent job and getting Freddie's mannerism down. Honestly when Rami finished the scene at Live Aid, i nearly gave a standing ovation. It felt that real.<br/><br/>My wife is British and a huge fan of Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody( the song) is her favorite song. She absolutely loved the movie. She said ""It is rare to have a movie that makes you either laugh of cry and i was laughing at some parts and crying at others. ""<br/><br/>If you are a true fan of Freddie Mercury , it is a film that will move you and i would not be surprised if Rami collected an award or two for the role.<br/><br/>There are two reasons i did not the film a 10. Well three actually. The most important being that i consider a 10 to be perfection and the film was not quite perfection.<br/><br/>There were some timeline errors which were done no doubt to create dramatic effect and progress the story. I would of liked them to preserve the timeline and facts but i understand why they didnt. The movie is still one of the best written and directed movies i have seen in years.<br/><br/>The second is this movie covers about 15 years in a bit over 2 hours. It really only briefly covers each of the pieces of Freddie, sort of like a well written ""Cliff Notes"" on him. This could of easily of been a 4 hour movie or a trilogy, who knows maybe someday it will be a trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was very good and Rami was phenomenal."
"imbecile2218","10","2","2","12 November 2018"," Admire!
","I am an asian and new era. Only admire can describe my view to freddie, a legend. I never know Queen before only few song can recognise like the 'we will rock you' and no clue who performed this. This movie let me know the spirit of freddie, he is so himself no care for others view and opinions even he losts for a time still keep fighting. And for the Queen songs, i never expect 70s can be so rock n roll and modern, really brainwashing tune and vocal. I'm totally fall in love to Queen!"

","This movie is fun. Rami Malek is amazing. We can feel Mercury's gestures and moves, espacially on stage. Also film is so successful about showing great details. And it has a great voice editing and a good cinematography. But it has a problem with storytelling. I couldnt figure out, what story are we watching? Mercury's biography or Queen's? There arent some sequences I would like to see it. But Queen is a big band, right? Thats why making this movie is hard cause you have to make everyone happy."
"The_Dman313","8","2","2","11 November 2018"," A Near Flawless Disappointment
","This may have been the best a PG-13 commercial film about Queen could have been. I say this both with praise and disappointment. Praise because, despite a few obvious flaws, this film was incredibly entertaining. Disappointment because although the quality seems to have on the surface, it lack internally, failing to capture the true spirit of Queen, especially it's main member Freddie Mercury.
This film stars Rami Malek (known for his leading role in the TV series, Mr. Robot), playing the lead role of Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the widely popular band Queen. It chronicles the band as it first shows when Freddie first got the part of lead singer of Queen, to the creation of their songs, to Freddie's lifestyle, which eventually led to him contracting AIDS, ending on the band's legendary performance at Band Aid in 1985.
Despite some obvious criticism that I will later get into, coming out of the theater I am still overjoyed that they decided to make Freddie Mercury's life into a biopic. He had an interesting life. Going from a pakistan teen with buck teeth to the multi millionaire icon singer is an exciting rags to riches story. His life also includes tragedy when he was first diagnosed with AIDS, which led to his death at the age of 45, showing yet another star who left us all to soon. This all adds up to an interesting story.
This film definitely has it's great aspects. Most notably, Rami Malek in the role of Freddie Mercury is electrifying! His presence is always felt on screen, through his iconic look, way of speaking, catchphrases (Darling is one), and body language. He shares the same presence on screen as Freddie did on stage, really adding depth to the character. I then find it likely that Rami Malek will be nominated, if not win, the oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role coming next Oscar season.
The film also includes a fair share of comedic moments, mostly coming from the dialogue. The characters in this film always seem to have something to say at always the right time. Look at this set of dialogue for an example:<br/><br/>Brian May: That's a nice fancy dress, Fred.
Freddie Mercury: I've got to make an impression, darling!
Brian May: You look like an angry lizard!<br/><br/>It's the light hearted dialogue like this that helps make the film entertaining and enjoyable to all.
Yet another aspect that really made this film stand out as something great was how it portrayed the live performances from Queen. It's in these concerts that all the elements come together and work. Almost magically these concerts communicate, triumphs for the characters, humor, powerful emotions, and all let's the camera work truly pop. Being this is a biopic of as popular of a band as Queen, the film has a wide variety of great music to use, and how creatively did they use it! The music always seem to heighten all the elements to create real movie magic.
Despite how many things this film gets right, and I do admit this to be a well made movie, there are some considerable flaws. One being the pace. For a film dealing with decades of strong detailed material, two hours and fifteen minutes seems almost too short. This definitely shows, as the film seems to jump around from highlight to highlight in the band's career, never going in depth into the events. Another major flaw with this movie, is the fact that it is a PG-13 commercial film. This majoraly hinders the film, as it seems to gloss over all the sex and drugs that had an impact on Freddies life. I then find it quite interesting when considering that this film was originally meant to star Sacha Baron Cohen (Famous for portraying the raunchy character Borat) and that it was meant to have a hard R rating. Some people however feel that this kind of biopic would be problematic and not have nearly the amount of wonder as this film did. Although that is certainly possible, I feel that by actually portraying Freddie Mercury how he was it would have humanized all the more, giving more weight when it affects his life, and add depth to where it was lacking before.
I can't help but think back to a scene in this film where the song Bohemian Rhapsody was first shown to a music producer. The dialogue was as follows:<br/><br/>Ray Foster: It goes on forever, six bloody minutes!
Freddie Mercury: I pity your wife if you think six minutes is forever.<br/><br/>Somehow I feel as if the same situation happened with many of the producers of this film, rejecting anything risky that could affect how much money this film made. Instead of doing something daring and exciting, like all of Queen's music did, filmmakers decided then to stick with something much more conventional and in the process did not encapsulate the spirit of Queen."
"CeeBee86","10","2","2","11 November 2018"," 2 hours never went so fast before!
","Due to all the fan reviews, I had huge expectations for this movie, and yet at the same time I was afraid just because of that, I would find the movie a disappointment.
Luckily, I can say; it was no disappointment in any way!
What a joy this movie was. My gosh!!!<br/><br/>I've never been a Queen fan, I knew their music, I knew who Freddie was and I knew I started to dislike their Christmas song each year a bit more. But because of this movie I did research, went to play their songs none stop and finally began to see what the rest of the world see and most importantly; heard.
Youtube, Wiki. I dived into it and learned more and more about Queen and Freddie. But how much can you learn in about 10 days? It wasn't enough. But enough to gain my love and respect for the band and for Freddie. What an incredible person he was.<br/><br/>I don't know what things in the movie are and are not in the correct time order. But I didn't care. Because what I saw was a movie about an amazing band. I heard their amazing songs and I saw things that I would never been able to see in real life, due to my age (born in 86).<br/><br/>For more than two hours I had a huge grin on my face. Apart from the moments that broke my heart, mostly the parts of lonely Freddie. Gosh.<br/><br/>Rami was amazing! OMG!!! Just as the rest of the cast! The casting is just insane!
It was a two hour ride, but I've watched movies that were shorter than this, but felt longer. This movie went by in the blink of an eye!
I can't wait for this movie to be on Blu-ray, cause it deserves a rewatch. Many, many times!"

"Kingslaay","Null","2","2","11 November 2018"," Decent tribute to a musical icon
","Portraying someone like Freddie Mercury is no easy feat. The same goes for the band Queen. The director was also wise to use Freddie's voice as no one can come close to this. Rami Malek is passable and pays great homage to Freddie as he looks and acts the part. You really feel you are watching Freddie and Queen. I got goosebumps throughout this film as we relived some moments of Freddie's life especially the live performances. People can easily challenge how accurate some of it was. It shyed away from many controversial and crazy aspects of Freddie's life, the wild parties and affairs. It seemed quite PG friendly and contained no swearing, Freddie definitely swore. The ending also seemed somewhat rushed. We see Freddie at Live Aid and nothing about his last days. A number of events happened after Live Aid such as Wembley and his final album. All would have been great viewing.<br/><br/>This film was great, the music was great and finally a crew had the guts and skill to pull a fitting tribute off. 8/10"

"bankofmarquis","8","2","2","4 November 2018"," Come for the music, stay...for the music
","My musical tastes end somewhere in the late 1970's/early 1980's. Billy Joel, ELO and, especially, Queen were in constant rotation on my turntable. So it was with a mixture of excitement and nervousness that I checked out BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, the ""Queen movie"".<br/><br/>Fortunately, this film rekindled my love for the music of Queen. I gotta admit, I was cranking Queen tunes in the car on the ride home. Unfortunately, the storytelling is weak, so I really did not gain any insight into Freddy, his family, the group, his marriage, his bi-sexuality, his drug use, the times they lived in or the AIDS epidemic of the '80's. All these items were touched upon in the movie, but not delved into, leaving a void in the part of my brain that craves a good, meaningful and touching story with my movie/musicals. It certainly doesn't help this story that I have the wonderful A STAR IS BORN sitting in my recent memory.<br/><br/>But the music, the musical performances and the acting performances of all involved almost make up for this void, leaving a very satisfying experience at the movies.<br/><br/>BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY follows young Farrokh Bulsara as he joins the band SMILE, changes the bands name to QUEEN, changes his name to Freddie Mercury and becomes an International Superstar leading up to the inevitable fall and resurgence at the Live Aid concert in the 1980's.<br/><br/>In the lead, Rami Malik is wonderful. He has the essence of the superstar we know down well. He is a winning, watchable presence on screen and I wouldn't be surprised if he is mentioned when Oscar nominations roll around. Joining him as members of the band are Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor, Joe Mazzello as John Deacon and Gwilym Lee as Brian May. All are effective enough in their roles - and believable in the musical scenes - with Lee standing out just a bit more than the others.<br/><br/>Also along for the ride are Lucy Boyton as Freddy's wife, Mary Austin and Tom Hollander, Mike Myers and Aidan Gillen as music execs aiding and attempting to guide Queen to the top. Only Allen Leech as Paul Prenter is unconvincing on the screen. But, I blame this more to the decisions of the screenwriters and directors for Paul is the ""villain"" of this piece - and a not-too-subtle villain at that.<br/><br/>But, Director Bryan Singer (X-MEN, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) is forgiven his lapses in content and subtlety as the music scenes are strong - and the film finishes with a 20 minute recreation of Queen at the Live Aid concert that is worth the price of admission all on it's own.<br/><br/>All in all, a good time at the movies. If you like Queen, you'll be entertained by this film.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

"hagen-18454","3","10","18","18 November 2018"," Very weak
","The only 'pro' of this movie is the fact that it revived the interest to Queen and Freddie's legacy. The movie itself is very weak and superficial. The actor playin the main characted hardly resembles such a strong charismatic personality as Mr. Mercury was. Luckily, there are many documentaries and other footages that can show people the real story."
"themadmovieman","7","23","49","24 October 2018"," It has its moments, but Bohemian Rhapsody lacks the energy and passion that the story deserves
","As far as music history goes, Queen, and frontman Freddie Mercury in particular, are one of the undoubted all-time greats, with a unique and intense energy to their music that few acts have ever been close to matching. As far as music biopics go, however, Bohemian Rhapsody really doesn't live up to the potential of what is an incredible story, and although it has its moments, it's a generally rather superficial film that lacks the immense energy that makes Queen as a band and Mercury as an individual so legendary.<br/><br/>But let's start on the plus side, with the fact that fans of Queen will undoubtedly have a good time with Bohemian Rhapsody. That doesn't immediately render it an incredible movie, but if you're a fan of the band's music, and have an interest in Freddie Mercury's story, then this film will prove a far more entertaining watch, with the odd musical number here and there getting my toes tapping effortlessly.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that, while it features some good songs and tells a great story, it really fails to get to the crux of what makes Freddie Mercury such a legendary figure, going over the fifteen year span of the story in rather superficial and simplistic detail.<br/><br/>As a result, if you want to learn about the history of Queen, this is a great film to watch, but I was left wanting a whole lot more, particularly a deeper analysis of Mercury as an individual, rather than the simple facts of what happened to him. In that, Bohemian Rhapsody is a fairly generic biopic, and it doesn't do quite enough to spark an immense interest in something that should be so much more spectacular.<br/><br/>Above all, the film's first half is a really disappointing watch. Jumping back and forth between a focus on the band as a whole and Mercury alone, it's an infuriatingly messy period that's peppered with a few random and rather emotionless (albeit entertaining) musical numbers, making for a disappointing and underwhelming opening to the film.<br/><br/>What's more is that the dialogue is really rather poor throughout. Apart from the fact that the majority of the humour really falls flat, too many scenes feel like a slow-moving slog through some very iffy dialogue, as the film attempts to create a sense of pathos as we see Mercury discovering more about who he truly is, but unfortunately misses the mark with a heap of dialogue scenes that lack the emotion and energy that I felt the film was really in need of.<br/><br/>So, the first half is an undoubtedly disappointing, and with a rather superficial and generic biopic setup, as well as less-than-stellar dialogue and humour, Bryan Singer's direction means that the film often comes across as a rather boring watch, with none of the vigour or deep emotional conflict that's needed to transform the story from a history lesson into something a whole more affecting.<br/><br/>Fortunately, things do turn around about halfway through, and although it all takes a very long time to get started, the film's second half introduces some strong dramatic conflict surrounding Mercury's sexuality and increasingly flamboyant lifestyle, which makes for a far more interesting watch.<br/><br/>While I can't say that the dialogue or humour improves particularly towards the end, there is at least a sense of dramatic depth and emotion that shines through eventually, and that's what makes the film's second half a far more engrossing and entertaining watch, concluding with an excellent medley of Queen's greatest hits that finally packs a good emotional punch, even if it does all feel like too little, too late.<br/><br/>Rami Malek's performance is an interesting one for me, because it's the only part of the movie that's got a bit of flamboyance and energy to it from start to finish. On the one hand, that's an excellent portrayal of Freddie Mercury when contrasted with the people around him, and Malek does a great job at bringing him to life right the way through, particularly when things become a little more emotional in the second half.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there's a bit of a clash between Malek's performance and the rest of the film's rather underwhelming nature. In the first half above all, it feels like Malek is really overacting, and you're not able to see him as Freddie Mercury for a long while, definitely not until the screenplay gets its act together towards the second half. It's an energetic and hard-working performance, and that ultimately comes good, but there's something about it that just doesn't mix in with the rest of the film, feeling a little distracting and even jarring at points.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I have to say that Bohemian Rhapsody is a bit of a mixed bag. While it tells the story of an incredible man and his part in an incredible band, it fails to really inject the same passion and energy that Queen's legacy has left on the world, coming across as a rather superficial and simplistic biopic that starts off in very disappointing fashion, only coming good a long way into the film, before a very entertaining but belated finale."

","Went with great expectations, however this really is not a blockbuster or Oscar winner by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>The main actor as Freddie is superb, as are most of the cast but it's a typical British film and comes across as slightly amateurish. Brian May actor is doing it by numbers it seemed!<br/><br/>I can't say I felt much sympathy for Freddie as he was yet another narcissistic personality who could have achieved so much, apart from being a superb artist, but chose to think of himself rather than others. I'm getting a bit fed up of these types of stories. It's very very similar to the recent George Michael TV movie.<br/><br/>It's certainly watchable and the Live Aid ending is breathtaking but the rest is mediocre.<br/><br/>If you're a Queen fan you'll like this, if not it's just another life story of a spoilt celebrity on the road to self destruction.<br/><br/>I think I'll give the forthcoming Elton John movie a miss....yawn!"

"generationofswine","1","74","186","2 November 2018"," An Honest Review
","I was scared to see this, mainly because most Biopics paint people in an absolutely horrible light and Queen was one of my favorite bands and Freddie one of my favorite rock vocalists. I was ready to rant and rave if it turned out to be a smear campaign of one of my rock heroes.<br/><br/>Fortunately it wasn't, it was actually a fair treatment of all of them. And, in fact, it was really generous towards May, but then he wasn't the focus of the film.<br/><br/>And the cast actually looked like Queen. So that is a plus. Everyone did a great job and props have to go out to Rami Malek, he would have been great if they gave him actual dialogue.<br/><br/>So why the single star? Honestly, it's because of the trailer. As in, if you saw the trailer you pretty much have already seen the movie. Not just the highlights, but the entire movie.<br/><br/>Queen was an epic band. Bohemian Rhapsody was an epic song. But Bohemian Rhapsody the movie has absolutely no meat on it.<br/><br/>You walk in with high hopes, and the cast is great, but the movie as a whole is a let down. It ends at Live Aid (as it probably should) but even then it doesn't seem anywhere near as epic a finale as it should have been for such a memorable and lauded performance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there should have been more to it."

"edgamu","2","12","23","9 December 2018"," Is it Queen or Led Zeppelin?
","Great film! The Live Aid performance is carefully reproduced, it makes you feel really there! The problem is... the story around Live Aid is more Led Zeppelin's than Queen's. Queen was not disbanded in 1985, they were just finishing the year-long The Works Tour in which they played Bohemian Rhapsody and Radio Ga Ga back to back at the end of the main set list almost every night. Led Zeppelin were in fact separated since the dead of John Bonham and they did reunited for the Live Aid show, with Phil Collins on drums. And also... Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987, two years after Live Aid, so it is false that on that performance he or the band knew he was ill. So, is it OK to change the story that much to get a little more drama? I mean, imagine you make a film about The Beatles in which Lennon gets shot minutes after the 1969 rooftop concert, just to get tears from the audience."

","The reviewers are correct. The movie plays out like a Youtube video of Queen. So why don't we all just watch a couple of Queen documenteries for free on Youtube then ? Good actors boring film. Because its like spending millions of dollars to re-shoot a Queen documentary with actors. It doesn't make any sense at all. It's like spending a million dollars to re-create a tomato rather than going to the store to buy a real one for almost no cost. The film has ""Watch the real thing on Youtube"" written all over it which is not good. Don't care if Brian May or Spielberg produced it either.<br/><br/>I'd rather watch a Freddy Mercury based movie with a complete fictional story say like a dark twisted erotic action thriller than this.<br/><br/>The movie made me feel a bit stupid. Like when you take a photograph with your cell phone of an actual printed photograph. Or like when some people use their cell phones to take photographs of another photograph on a computer screen.<br/><br/>They could have made an action thriller with Freddy Mercury character for the lead role. Explosions, machine guns, sex, opera houses and rock music. That would be interesting to watch. Instead they re-shot a Youtube documentary. Wake me up when Freddy Mercury is a character in Mortal Kombat video game or has his own action movies.<br/><br/>Ideas for the producers for erotic action thrillers :<br/><br/>Freddy Goes West, Freddy's Back, Tales from the crypt : Innudeado, High On Mercury, High On Mercury 2 The Opera House Tapes, Unshaved and loving it, The Vengeance Of Mercury, Planet Mercury etc.."

","The musical legend that took the world by storm. A man's whose voice is immortal and rings through the halls, rooms, and cars of today. The legendary band of Europe with music for the people has been waiting for a movie to represent their majesty, and everything they brought to the world. Tonight, after months of advertising and media promotion, the wait is over and the movie is upon us. With it, yours truly is back to give a later review, in hopes of helping bring justice and some help in determining your movie viewing pleasure. So get your concert boots on, your voices warmed up, and your hearts open for Robbie K's review on:<br/><br/>Movie: Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
Bryan Singer
Writers:
Anthony McCarten (story by), Peter Morgan (story by)
Stars:
Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>The Acting: You've got a legendary character, you need to be ready to step up to the plate, and the casting call nailed the pick with Rami Malek. The Mr. Robot star continues to shine in his acting, apparently doing his homework to resurrect the legend for the modern age. Watching clips in preparation for the interview, Singer's direction with Malek's skills are incredible to watch. His mannerisms, his flair, his passion, and his approach match the various resources I picked up, and is the strong, central pillar to lift this movie to new heights. Malek's portrayal brings so many emotions to the screen to get you embedded into the movie and the actor's life. In addition, the rest of the cast is amazing, each contributing member of Mercury's life given incredible screen time and involvement to craft the family that got him through so much. The incredible involvement of everyone in this production really crafted the perfect cast to bring you into the full experience at hand.<br/><br/>The Direction: Musical biographies are always a challenge for me to review, because I go for the concert experience and a little for the life. Sadly, the balance often shifts in the second half to the life, leading to usually a slower, depressing story. Bohemian Rhapsody though, manages to break this mold and keep the energy of the movie going from start to finish. Singer managed to find the perfect entanglement of personal story, band drama, creative process, and concert experience, leading to an energetic, cinematic experience that make syou feel like part of a VH-1 behind the scenes experience. It crafts something for everyone and should be entertaining from start to finish for whatever type of story you want in this genre.<br/><br/>The Costumes/Setting/Craft: You've got the director and the acting, but now you need the look and this is where Rhapsody's crew excels at once more. While not the most complex makeup at times, this film's has managed to take us back in time to the 70s and 80s in setting, fashion, and look of the actors. My friends and I agreed that they brought the band back in exact replica detail, from the hairstyles, to the looks that evolved over time in aging and appearance. Transformation of the setting and decades keeps you immersed into the character's evolution and further invest your interest to the story and movie at hand. Of course Mercury's recreation gets the top honors over all, but nevertheless, it's a sensational piece of makeup, costumes, and detail worthy of an award or five.<br/><br/>The Concert Experience/Art/Music: The biggest delight of this movie, outside of the balance of story to music, is the music itself. Bohemian Rhapsody highlights the music creating process, showing the struggles and inspiration of their work as they crafted what they considered the perfect tracks. As the music comes to completion, the film jumps right into the performance, bringing the legendary vocals and music back to full, theater stomping delight, and unleashing it to the brim. Rhapsody hits almost all of the classic songs without overplaying the work, and making sure to give you the concert experience you've been dreaming of. This is especially true with the final scene, where the legendary 20-minute performance is recreated, almost every detail painstakingly recreated to pay honor to the legend. I hope many appreciate the hard work in this movie and more importantly the epic fire of Queen's music.<br/><br/>The Class: When it comes to Queen's and the band's interesting history, one should expect a lot of topics and scenes that can make on uncomfortable. A nod to the direction again, because in this film all these very sensitive topics are portrayed in a very dignified manner. Rather than sexually aggressive, dirty, gritty portrayals and over the top dialogue, Bohemian Rhapsody manages to portray the darker moments in a dignified light to explain the history without detracting from the experience at hand. Even the comedy is magically crafted into the scene, not forcing itself upon the audience for a laugh, but instead flowing naturally with the personality of Queen and the scenes at hand. It's movies like these that make this reviewer smile wide and realize that Hollywood has not been completely lost yet.<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>The length: Hard to find fault in this movie, but I can say that the movie was a little long at point, a few scenes that could have probably been left out to minimize the run time to just about 2 hours. A small dislike indeed, but I'm grasping at straws here.<br/><br/>A Little Less Of The Dark/Slower Moments: The scenes to be removed would have been some involving Paul, who's manipulation of the system crafted a good antagonist, but sometimes was a little long winded. If I could have substituted these scenes with more of Mary and his family components I would have, because it may have shed a little more light on that aspect and kept in the positive energy of the movie. I don't want the darker moments erased completely, after all they made the band shine at times, but still a little less loss of momentum was my preference.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Surprised that I don't have more dislikes? Well utilize that to note how much I loved this movie and how well put together it was. Queen's epic legacy is captured beautifully in this movie, though how much is dramatized and real is something I don't know. Note however, that this is the musical biography that currently holds the throne in this reviewer's eyes. A balance of story and drama with music is the key, with direction to keep the momentum of the film going and the energy alive. Fantastic acting and costumes further the experience, bringing you into the throngs of Queen's struggles and drama, while paying homage to the craftmanship of their work. Bohemian Rhapsody is the concert movie I've always wanted and with it, yours truly hopes to see it win big in the awards to come, not only for the movie itself, but for the legacy of Queen. I strongly encourage everyone to see it in theaters, this weekend if possible, to get the most out of your experience with this film. So please check it out asap.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Biography/Drama/Music: 9.5-10<br/><br/>Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0"

The performances of the band members are outstanding, capturing their personalities brilliantly, and if Rami Malek is not an Oscar winner, then there is no justice in the world.
If you are a Queen fan, like I am, then you will come out of this film feeling like you have seen an amazing concert, constantly foot tapping and trying not to burst into song throughout the film. if you aren't a Queen fan, then you can still immerse yourself into the bands hits, and enjoy the story being unfolded in front of you.
Some of the film had me with goosebumps, some of it had me feeling nostalgic, and other parts had em with a tear in my eye, as you realise the personal issues that Freddie went through, and the inevitable sad end to his life.
It is a film that I will go to see in the cinema again, and when released on Blu Ray, will played so many times. I thoroughly recommend you see this film and leave with a smile on your face and a song in your step."

The way Rami Malek portayed Freddie was the thing to me what was emotional (this being how much passion he put into this role.) I have seen some people complaining at Freddie's sexuality not being shown enough within this film, but I believe it was shown as much as it could. Freddie was an icon and did not want his sexuality to be the main thing people saw, hence why the film is about the band Queen and Freddie's life, not just his sexuality! Overall, this film is amazing! I can not fault anything."

"PotassiumMan","5","7","12","11 November 2018"," Handsomely shot but superficial and cripplingly overlong
","This long-anticipated biopic of Freddie Mercury and how he turned Queen into a band for the ages is only a mixed bag that suffers from serious narrative lapse for long stretches. I liked the look of this film and Rami Malek utterly transforms into Mercury but his dynamic performance alone cannot overcome the lumbering pace. He has to work with a screenplay that for many patches is an utter wasteland.<br/><br/>Although there are traces of gripping brilliance in this film (including the film's depiction of the spectacular divide between critics and audiences over the song Bohemian Rhapsody), the more challenging aspects of the story of this incredible band and Freddie Mercury himself are given lackadaisical or non-existent treatment. His struggle with AIDS is given fairly perfunctory attention, as is his relationship with the other band members. For a film with such a long running time, there is precious little to say.<br/><br/>The film comes close to redeeming itself when it turns to the extraordinary event of the Live Aid concert in which Queen performed. But it's too little, too late and I only wish the rest of the film could have that raw vitality and stirring force. This is a shame, because although most rock bands over the course of history do not deserve a feature film, Queen is not one of them. Not recommended."

"ferguson-6","6","12","24","26 October 2018"," That VOICE!
","Greetings again from the darkness. That VOICE! During my life, I've been fortunate enough to see many of rock's greatest bands live in concert, including: The Who, The Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC. Each of these bands are amazing, but no other concert combined the energy, showmanship and musicianship as Queen (two different tours). And certainly no other lead singer donned a Harlequin leotard ... only Freddie Mercury could make that look seem natural.<br/><br/>This is such an odd movie, and one that is somewhat difficult to discuss. It's billed as an ""inspiring story"", though one wonders how self-destructive living, an acrimonious band break-up, and dying young of AIDS could be considered inspiring. It's not supposed to be a biopic, but the vast majority of the screen time is devoted to Freddie Mercury. And to really confound us, the film kind of drags (pun possibly intended) during the personal story times ... and then explodes with greatness during the band and live performance segments.<br/><br/>Rami Malek plays Freddie Mercury, and he perfectly captures the swagger and strut of one of rock's greatest theatrical showmen. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsari in Zanzibar, and the film shows us his conservative family and time spent working as a baggage handler at Heathrow. Of course, things change quickly once he joins up with guitarist Brian May (played here by Gwylim Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy, MARY SHELLEY). When bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) is added, Queen is born.<br/><br/>With a story and script from two Oscar nominated writers, Peter Morgan (THE QUEEN, ironically) and Anthony McCarten (THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), it's surprising that much of the film is downright slow - especially the bits with frenemy Paul (Allen Leach). Perhaps this is more a factor of the issues with the director's chair, where Bryan Singer is credited despite being fired during production. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel filled in until Dexter Fletcher (next year's Elton John biopic ROCKETMAN) was hired to complete the film. Lucy Boynton (so good in SING STREET) holds her own as Mercury's wife and friend Mary Austin, and Mike Myers plays producer Ray Foster (with a tip of the cap to WAYNE'S WORLD). Other supporting work comes courtesy of Dickie Beau as influential DJ Kenny Everett, Aiden Gillen, Tom Hollander and Aaron McCusker.<br/><br/>The 20th Century Fox opening fanfare has its own Queen version, and is not to be missed as the film begins. Of course, it's the infamous 1985 Live Aid performance that is the film's highlight and one that will leave every audience member pumped up, smiling, and singing along. It's a stunning sequence on a custom built Wembley Stadium stage, and it helps erase much of the tedium of the film's non-band scenes. Erasing any doubt as to whether the film is worth the price of addition ... hearing that VOICE at full volume on today's theatrical sound systems. Killer Queen."
"RIK-22","1","6","10","15 April 2019"," True story with little truth and little interest
","In my opinion to make a good biopic picture, you must do two things; One stick to the true story as much as possible, two, show the things that the public has never seen, this is what makes the film interesting.<br/><br/>Now this fails on both accounts. Key scenes in this are completely untrue and therefore the motivations behind the actions we seen aren't true. In the end its a largely fictional account of Queen.<br/><br/>So many biopic movies fail on focusing on the behind-the-scene stuff, which is what we are all interested in. I don't need to see a Queen tribute band perform, I can see the real thing on YouTube. What I want to see is the real Freddie, the real scandals, the real struggles.<br/><br/>In the end I don't feel I know the Queen story any better or that I got to know/understand Freddie Mercury either."
"burlesonjesse5","6","6","10","9 November 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Bohemian Rhapsody
","Just for the record, I'm a big fan of Queen. Ever since childhood, their out-of-the-box music has always been in my DNA. From the years 1970 to 1985, the story of rock's most eccentric band is chronicled in Bohemian Rhapsody (my latest review). Actually, it's mostly about Queen's flamboyant and over-biting lead singer, Freddie Mercury. On a side note, the character of Brian May (Queen's lead guitarist) looks like a cross between REO Speedwagon's early Kevin Cronin and Howard Stern. Epic fail for the costume department.<br/><br/>Like with Lizard King Jim Morrison in 1991's The Doors, Mercury's frontman persona is in nearly every frame. The only difference is that ""Rhapsody"" is sadly rated PG-13 whereas ""Doors"" merits a hard R. I'm not gonna lie. I have reservations about that and I want some realism darn it.<br/><br/>Anyway, the best reason to see Bohemian Rhapsody is for the lead performance portrayal of ""ready"" Freddie (played by a totally committed Rami Malek). It's staggering stuff as Malek literally disappears into the role. Is it an impersonation? Yes, but it's the gold standard of rock n' roller impersonations. When he's on stage carousing at Wembley Stadium with mustache and half-microphone stand in tote, Malek makes his Freddie Mercury a totally commanding presence. ""It comes to you as to us all. We're just waiting for the hammer to fall"". Indeed.<br/><br/>""Rhapsody"", with a swiftly paced running time of 133 minutes and some choppy editing, is like a popcorn flick that happens to be a straightforward, rock biopic. The movie also has a splashy look and mounds of energy. I especially enjoyed the final sequence in which Queen performs a badass set of 20-plus minutes at the widely-watched, Live Aid concert. It's accurate, well filmed, extravagant, and ultra cool. I also dug Queen's songs of course but I would've liked to see them perform ""You're My Best Friend"". That ditty is pure nostalgia for me.<br/><br/>The only reasons I'm giving Bohemian Rhapsody a mixed review are the fact that it's not particularly deep and lacks a sense of readied rawness. It's almost like a TV movie that the Academy would wince at (sans Malek's favorable acting). Added to that, director Bryan Singer who's not known for tackling this kind of VH1 rock genre, gets the timelines wrong in terms of Queen's successful discography (""We Will Rock You"" came out in 77' not 1980, Freddie Mercury didn't get his AIDS diagnosis till 1987 as opposed to 1985, and the band claims they hadn't played for years prior to Live Aid despite putting out an album just 15 months earlier). Honestly, I would've liked to see what scorched residue Oliver Stone would have produced had he been behind the camera here. Bottom line: Bohemian Rhapsody is placidly entertaining yet sort of ""easy come, easy go"". My rating: 2 and a half stars."

","I knew from the very beginning, when ""somebody to love"" started playing, I knew it all along that this movie is going to be EPIC. Tears were streaming down my cheeks when I saw Freddie's back while he was on his way to the stage for live aid, I wasn't even sure why I was crying. Was I sad?was I moved? When I watched the movie for the second time, I realized I cried because the idea of what it felt like to look through Brian, Roger, John eyes as they were walking to the stage. And it was a privilege for me as a Queen fan, I was able to see what it was like. And that was my first tears scene ever, and it was the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>After that, I was blown away..and probably this is the first movie ever(probably the only time) where I was crying and experiencing goosebumps throughout the movie. Although there were some mixed up through the timelines, between songs and the years. I clearly noticed it with the Fat Bottomed Girls song(it's one of my favorite songs from the band). But then again, I think the point of this movie is to make people moved, to make people see the brilliant of the band. To be able to experience the amazement that people got when they saw the band performed. I never got to privilege to saw the band live, and this is probably as good as I could get, and I am thankful for this.<br/><br/>My boyfriend didn't even knew who Freddie Mercury was when we were first dating(I almost broke up with him, true story). I took him to Queen Tribute Concerts couple of time, and after watched this movie, he's a hardcore fan now. Oh and he's crying for the last 20minutes of the movie, and he's not the crying type.<br/><br/>The point is, not only about the acting, the cast, the story behind the bohemian Rhapsody song(btw, that scene was craaazyyyy), but about how the movie makes us feel. How we feel about Freddie, about the band, about life, about the said song. I totally recommend this movie!!!!!<br/><br/>When people criticize this movie, one thing they should've remembered: Brian, Roger, John WERE THERE!!! they still here to tell the story, to help with the movie..so, there you go!!<br/><br/>Ps: Brian may???

"bob-the-movie-man","9","6","10","2 November 2018"," ""Fame and fortune and everything that goes with it""
","Sometimes a trailer generates a bit of a buzz of excitement with a cinema audience and the first showings of the trailer for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was a case in point. But would the film live up to the potential?<br/><br/>Farrokh Bulsara (Rami Malek), born in Zanzibar to Indian parents, is a shy boy with a dramatic singing voice. At a concert he meets Mary (Lucy Boynton) who becomes the ""love of his life"". When a space for a lead singer becomes available in a college band, Farrokh leaps at the chance and onstage becomes an exuberant extrovert. The band, of course, changes its name to Queen and with Farrokh assuming the name of Freddie Mercury they are set for global success. But Freddie is a complex character, and the demands and temptations of global super-stardom take a terrible toll.<br/><br/>Wow! What a great film on so many different levels. As a biopic of Mercury and a history of one of the greatest ever rock bands, the film is highly entertaining. But I wasn't prepared for how emotional I would find it. Mercury's life is befitting of a Shakespearian tragedy: an estrangement from his 'conservative' father (Ace Bhatti); a public extravert, but privately an insecure and needy bi-sexual, constantly searching for his perch in life; a meteoric rise and an equally spectacular and historic fall.<br/><br/>The film culminates in a recreation of the band's spectacular 20 minute set for 1985's Band Aid concert at Wembley. It's a spectacular piece of cinema and one that - for me - puts the much hyped concert scenes from ""A Star is Born"" back in its box. Aside from a few niggles (the sound engineers in the booth were, if I'm not mistaken, all the size of Hagrid!) it's a spectacular piece of CGI work.<br/><br/>If I'm being critical, there are a few bits of the movie that are a tad tacky and twee. A whizz around the world of tour locations is composed of some pretty ropy animations that didn't work for me. And a few of the 'creations' of classic songs - particularly ""Another One Bites the Dust"" - are a bit forced. Countering that though, the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is mesmerising.<br/><br/>As for the cast, I'll just put it right out there: Rami Malek is just sensational as Mercury! I first called out Malek as someone to watch in ""Need For Speed"", but since then he's gone on to major fame in the TV series ""Mr Robot"". Here he is a force of nature on the screen and you literally can't take your eyes off him. Every nuance of Mercury's tortured soul is up there. I would love to see the performance recognized in the Awards season, with the showreel clip being a brilliant standoff in the rain with Paul Prenter (""Downton's"" Allen Leech).<br/><br/>The rest of the band - Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor; Gwilym Lee as lead guitar Brian May; and Joseph Mazzello (yes, young Tim from ""Jurassic Park""!) as bass guitarist John Deacon - all work well together, with Lee looking more like Brian May than Brian May! Lucy Boynton, so great in ""Sing Street"", gets a meaty dramatic role to sink her teeth into, and the ever-reliable Tom Hollander is great as the band's legal rep/manager Jim ""Miami"" Beech: his 'knowing looks' near the end of the film are brilliantly done.<br/><br/>The surprise piece of casting though was the very welcome return of Mike Myers as the exec Ray Foster: only seen spasmodically on screen since 2009's ""Inglorious Basterds"". It's a role that reminded me of Tom Cruise's turn in ""Tropic Thunder""! But it's well done. After making ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" famous again in ""Wayne's World"", how could he have refused? I say ""Welcome back Mr Myers"": you've been missed.<br/><br/>And a final shout out to Paul Jones, my son-in-law's brother, who gets a full screen appearance in the crowd, arms outstretched, during the ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" set! (I must admit, I missed it, so will have to go and see it again!)<br/><br/>This is a film that grabs you and propels you through the story at a fast lick. It's a surprisingly moving story, with a well-known and tragic finale. It's not a perfect film, but it is up there wih the year's best as a high-energy cinema experience. If I still gave half-marks this would be a 4.5.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or Google ""One Mann's Movies"". Thanks)."
"lauriesamuelmorgan","Null","6","10","27 October 2018"," Underrated. Breathtaking. Hard Hitting. Brilliant
","Ok. I will open strong and say, whether you are a fan of Queen or not (personally I'm a huge fan), Bohemian Rhapsody is more than worth your money. It's worth 5 different imax viewings plus the Blu Ray Purchase. From the opening titles, through the years of the bands history to the show stealing explosion at live aid, it brings a moving story of friendship, love, drama, greed, determination and power. All this sounds very clechÃ©, I am aware, but this is simply a film you need to sit down for, be moved emotionally, completely invested in the scenes, build up real nerves toward the performance at live aid, as if you were to perform yourself, and then have them all shread down by adrenaline and excitement. The critics are truly despicable for their treatment of this film, unworthy of their titles and I've lost all respect for them. Unless you're one of these stern critics, this will rock you."

","I was 12 at the time of Live Aid, and while I grew up listening to Queen, I wouldnt class myself as a mega fan. However, I've just taken my 13 yr old son to see this, and we both absolutely loved it! Such an interesting story, some of which is known well, other parts not so much. Goes without saying the soundtrack will give you goosebumps, and the acting was great. In the car on the way home, the music from the greatest showman came on the radio, my son turned to me and said ""that seems very appropriate to what we've just seen"".... He was obviously paying attention!"
"annog","1","9","17","11 February 2019"," Loved Queen, Hated This Amateurish Ham Handed Movie.
","Whether you like Queen or not, this is one terrible film. It is so bad in so many ways. The actor who plays Freddy, has two things right. Freddy's posh accent and his teeth. Maybe Freddy was not very bright, but he was as charming as he was talented and he was a gymnast on stage. I have enjoyed Malek's work in other movies but his characterisation of Mercury makes him look like a cross eyed vampire ( the teeth thing). On the concert stage Rami just looks awful. Mainy times in this film you are actually embarrassed for his Freddy. In fact some may find Rami Malek's portrayal insulting to Freddy's memory.<br/><br/>So, you might think never mind, just go for the music, and that never really happens. We only get silly, little carelessly selected snippets of the music of Queen. You rarely get to sit back and enjoy the band.<br/><br/>The writing is just putrid bad. Long periods of clumsy sentimental nothingness, and then a little bit about the band.<br/><br/>Save yourself the time and money. Go for one of the documentaries on Queen that have been popped out recently.<br/><br/>Just saying this because I am surprised a bush effort like this is so largely praised. This time the critics were right."
"kgcolladay","5","9","17","6 November 2018"," It's an entertaining movie, but don't go expecting to find true facts.
","What bothers me about director Bryan Singer moving facts around is that there is an entire generation who will assume that this film is a ""true story."" It is not. It is BASED on a true story. I absolutely understand that in filmmaking, sometimes you have to compress time, obviously you have to re-create/create dialogue, and sometimes you just simply make it up to make the story either fit in a time frame or get across the essence of what you are trying to tell. While Rami Malek's performance is terrific, I really did not feel that he captured Freddie's essence. Nor did he capture the relationship between Freddie and Mary. (Not Malek's fault, but the fault of the director and the script.) Sure, he may have showed Freddie's dependence on Mary (played delightfully by Lucy Boynton), but he (Singer) barely gave us enough time with them together for us to see why he was so dependent on her friendship. That she helped dress him once and put make-up on his eyes once, is that it? She lived next door when they broke up, she worked in his music publishing company, still lives in his house that he left her . . . has to be a LOT more there than just a passing whim. Gwilym Lee's performance actually deserves the Oscar here I felt like I was actually watching Brian May and not an actor. Recalls Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison quite vividly. It is worth seeing, just please don't go thinking that you now know and understand Freddie and Queen. While Brian May and Roger Taylor were given executive producer credit, this does NOT mean that they had any real say in the final script or the filming and this should be remembered. The film was worth spending my money on and I did enjoy watching it, but as a Queen from the beginning (in my life, I have only purchased about 10 vinyl albums with Night at the Opera and Day at the Races among the first purchases I made in the 70s - and I was rather thought an odd duck because I loved their music so very much), I think there was MUCH more to Freddie than this film is willing to give us. It kind of goes a little sideways. I'd much rather watch the real Live Aid performance on youtube, so that part was hardly worth the wait. Pleasant enough and pleased to see they didn't try to get Malek to sing but had him lipsynch instead so that was a relief."
"her000","5","21","48","29 October 2018"," Meh
","The acting was great from all, esp Rami, though I really wished they'd not have done any close ups of him lip syncing (they were quite cringe). The story was too boring and gimmicky for my liking (how they came up with their anthems was an eye roll), most superficial about his lifestyle, big dramatic scenes were dragging on unnecessarily with monologues and big pauses befitting a Theo Aggelopoulos film, and, I'm sorry, but the last 10 mins of showing us 3 full songs from Live Aid was a bit much with the audience doing singalongs and waving hands in the air. This is Mamma Mia for the old school rock fans. Which is a real shame. The only saving grace is that it ends at 1985 and doesn't show how the remaining members milked Freddie's legacy for their own gain (though they still do by producing this). Quite happy with myself for having watched it at my local cinema on their half price ticket day; I'd have been asking for my money back had I paid full price."

The fake teeth is one of the most ridicilous props I've ever witnessed in films. Typical biopic cliches throughout the film, which compeletely erases the creative proccess behind the band.

"julietkwan","6","5","8","11 November 2018"," So Hyped, Also Dissapointing
","Man, I was excited for this film. I had watched the trailers multiple times, I love Queen's music and I love Rami Malek. Rami Malek is fantastic as Freddie Mercury, you really believe him in this performance. But the amazing music makes up for how mediocre this movie is.<br/><br/>Movies that put in great music really can make you feel certain emotions while watching. If it's intense music, you feel scared, maybe it's sad and beautiful music, it makes you feel sad. Queen's music can be used in any movie and make it better, and it makes this movie better than it is. They get a lot of the facts wrong which is frustrating if you know the story. But they also mix up their image of Freddie.<br/><br/>Since Freddie Mercury is no longer living (R.I.P) the ones still remaining in the band are the ones that have control over the story. I feel like they make the band members very clean and civilized and they make Freddie look like the enemy. Sometimes they make Freddie this really annoying, aggravating character that we just want to stop doing whatever he is doing, but then right after that they make us feel sympathy for him. Maybe this is used for a good purpose, it didn't work for me. Even if he was respected for his music skills, he does seem like an outcast in the band.<br/><br/>The movie's runtime is also very long, even if it leads up to a fantastic ending scene. The pacing has problems, and when things are moving fast it's hard to keep track. Is Freddie Mozart? It seems like he is, one melody after another is just popping in his head and there is just so much going on that we don't even know what's happening! They wanted a long film, they spend too much time on making certain characters too big of a part in the film rather than slowing down and explaining what was happening when Queen was a rising success. This is a problem with the writing, and all we get out of it is how hard Rami Malek is working to piece this movie together.<br/><br/>Look, don't listen to me, really, just go see the movie with a fresh opinion. It's memorable, and I'd see it again with someone else to share the experience. People will disagree with my opinion, that's ok. People had mixed feelings about the song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when it came out, and look, it's one of the greatest songs ever. Highly recommended."
"Ana_Banana","6","5","8","11 November 2018"," Biopics' disease: more entertainment than real drama
","Biopics are always tricky: fans are outraged by the inevitable historical inaccuracies and omissions, or mindlessly blown-away by seeing (again) their idol. But those issues are not the point: the first one can be addressed only in a lengthy documentary or in a research book, while the second is as subjective as one can be (my friend who watched the film with me was thrilled simply because she is a Queen fan).<br/><br/>From a strictly cinematic perspective, the critics are right, this film is almost a flop because it has no strong, central idea besides recreating Freddie on screen (which is very well done). Most acting is fine, lookalikes are amazing (""Brian May"", ""Freddie""), the concert scenes are great, cinematography is very good, but the film is full of the clichÃ©s common in biopics about artistic characters. It also offers an almost bowdlerized image of Freddie and the band's entourage, creative aspects are dealt with incredible superficiality, and generally speaking the movie is marred by the simplistic approach of a tribute. The twisting of reality, which in ""Amadeus"" served a strong, fictional central idea (what's the difference between genius and talent), is useless and embarrassing in this film.<br/><br/>As usual, real life drama is more impressive and touching than the concoction served by most biopics, as is the case here. To avoid disappointing, the better biopics focus only on one main event in the life of their character, instead of trying in vain to tell hastily a story which took years or decades to unfold and develop.<br/><br/>So, is this film good? It's worth watching for the acting and the re-creating of the atmosphere, but when recent, easily verifiable facts are distorted with no artistic benefit as in this movie, what should we expect from a movie with a historical subject? Ultimately, watching the original concerts and videos of the band is more rewarding, and that will remain."

It just added so much more depth to the experience from the screen. When I see this again, I will definitely be seeing it in IMAX and if you haven't seen it already, I highly recommend doing so cause I can only imagine the depth feelings felt.<br/><br/>Also, if Rami Malek does not get an Oscar for this performance, it will be a travesty darling."

","I was hanging out for this movie for a while and it didn't disappoint.
Rami malek deserves an Oscar for his performance, I can't even think of anyone coming close to what he did.
In saying that, it's not just him. The supporting cast is equally as amazing and deserve full credit for it as well. Gwilym Lee especially is great as Brian May.
The only flaws I can find in this movie was it didn't dig quite deep enough. I would have liked to have seen more of the wild times of Freddie, but in saying that, I didn't feel short changed by what we got.
I also would have loved to see more of the creative process the band had in creating their music as what we did see was very interesting and captivating.
In watching the movie, it may feel like a standard bio pic as it goes on (which I think is fair to say) but what sets this apart from other bio pics is the ending. They did an incredible job of recreating live aid and you not only really felt like you were there, but you could also feel Freddie (as the rest of the band did that matter) putting their entire life force into them at performance.
Again, an amazing movie that should be atleast nominated for oscars"

This movie is the perfect depiction of what Queen was and especially Freddie, as artists. If he was alive, he would probably love it as it was everything Queen represented.<br/><br/>A story that doesn't focus on a certain aspect of Freddie's life but rather shows the journey of the band up to its most iconic and memorable moment.<br/><br/>Queen always strived to do their thing, in the purest way and deliver real entertainment to their audience and that is exactly what Bohemian Rhapsody did, without beating you with extremely personal details about Freddie's darkest moments or lifestyle or focusing on his illness to move you.<br/><br/>He himself, purposely kept his illness a secret up until the very last moment because he didn't want us to feel sympathy or focus on anything else rather than their art. He wanted to be a symbol of great entertainment which ultimately made him the legend he still is until this very day.<br/><br/>Apart from the entire cast being brilliant, we have to bow down before Rami Malek for one of the best portrayals of an actual human being we've ever seen till now.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie showed everything you need to know to capture Queen's essence and inevitably did what Queen wanted; entertain you."

There was a period of about 20 minutes in the middle of the movie that I thought was slow, but otherwise it was very entertaining, and much more witty and funny that I expected. The way they weaved the music into the movie was very well done. It helps to have a good familiarity with Queen's songs to get some of the very subtle humor. For example, there was a running gag about the song, ""I'm In Love With My Car"", and I wonder if people who don't know about that song would pick up on it. ""I'm In Love With My Car"" is a great song, BTW."

The casting was superb with Rami and Gwilym in particular putting in impressive performances. I was disappointed to read some of the harsh press reviews which suggested that the film wasn't sufficiently gritty and salacious. I felt it had the right balance with all the decadence and debauchery of Freddie's lifestyle being shown subtly. It was certainly dealt with just not in your face.

"neilwaynesmith","9","3","4","29 December 2019"," Much more than 'that' song.
","It's an interesting backstory to the formation of 'Queen', but, as a quick 'search' will show, the build-up has flaws and is not, perhaps as accurate as it could have been, as if the memory/legacy of Freddie Mercury is somehow to be protected. Nevertheless Malek does a great job of capturing the 'esssence' of Mercury.
The whole 'Queen' ensemble in the film do a great job of representing May, Deacon & Taylor, the dynamic between them, even in the dark moments is superb to watch. Tom Hollander, likewise is excellent in his scenes.
The film uses their 'Live Aid' performance as its anchor and the effort, energy, respect and attention to detail that went into this scene alone is worth watching the whole film for. I was luck enough to be there (wayyyyyy at the back!!!!) so I confess I watched this the first couple of times alone and through VERY watery eyes.... I recommend you go on YouTube and search for the Queen Live Aid split screen 'film vs. reality' download. 'nuff said! DAYYYYYYYYYYYY-OH!"

","I'd like to say I was a Queen fan from day one but it wasn't until the second album I clicked on to how good they were.<br/><br/>I waited a long time for this, even when Sascha Baron Cohen was rumoured to be playing Freddie, never was a fan of SBC but perhaps he would have played the part well, we'll never know.<br/><br/>Rami Malek richly deserved the Oscar, I almost believed he was Freddie, he must have studied hours of film of the man, the voice the mannerisms, the whole package. Also hats off to Gwilym Lee ( Brian May ) and Ben Hardy, who has shaken off his EastEnders tag as Roger Taylor, sadly not enough of Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon but then JD was always the quiet one but I could see he was really able to play the bass.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have, hence one star off, is that some of the music didn't fit the period. The worst being 'Fat Bottom Girls' being featured on their first US tour when it came from the 'Jazz' album years later. Sure there was a lot of condensing but you can't cram an over 15 year career into 2 hours just watch it for what it is, a tribute to a man and a band who were like no other. It only goes to show what a tragic loss he was to the world of rock music, there will never be anyone else like him."
"MartinHafer","8","3","4","25 July 2019"," Something rarely seen in an Oscar winner...a film that the public actually LIKES and ENJOYS!
","Long ago, I tired of the Oscars. Much of it was because too often the films they picked and the performances they praised were ones that simply were unpleasant and box office poison. In the case of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", however, the film earned nearly a billion dollars at the box office AND managed to win four awards...and one was a major one (Best Actor). What a refeshing breath of fresh air...and what an enhoyable and inspiring film.<br/><br/>One thing you should know about me is that I was a history teacher and hate most bio-pics and historical films. This is because too often they play very fast and loose with the facts in order to tell a more cinematic tale. While some of this happens in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", the vast majority of the film seems true and isn't filled with fabrications. Sure, you can find a few examples here and there where the film changes dates and facts to make the story seem more inspirational...but a lot less of this happened than I expected.<br/><br/>In addition to generally sticking to the facts, the film had two major things going for it: Rami Malek's amazing performance as well as a strong desire to entertain the audience. The film will definitely get your blood pumping and feet and body moving....and at times it feels like you've been in a time machine and are actually seeing Queen in concert. Overall, exceptionally well done and inspiring."
"fntstcplnt","3","3","4","14 July 2019"," Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)
","Directed by Bryan Singer & Dexter Fletcher. Starring Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazello, Aidan Gillen, Allen Leech, Aaron McCusker, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Superficial (and largely artificial) biopic of rock band Queen from their early 70s roots in London up to their famous 1985 Live Aid charity performance. Focus falls heavily on frontman Freddie Mercury; so much so that Brian, Roger and John barely register anything that even remotely resembles individual personalities. Countless cornball moments along the way such as offering ""origin stories"" of big radio hits and Myers' obnoxiously wink-wink anti-""Bohemian Rhapsody"" routine, separated by cloying glimmers into Freddie's personal life, with dialogue that no one in real life would ever speak and clumsy approaches to most of his important relationships, to say nothing for the wince-inducing, bordering-on-offensive surface examinations of his homosexuality. Don't expect more than a little leather-clad texture, a handful of innuendos, and a cliched declamation or two; the PG-13 rating keeps the usual rock star excess on the sidelines, but neutering Freddie's sexual identity/conflict felt more like a (poor) choice on the part of the filmmakers and the awful script. Despite distracting dental prosthetics, Malek is credible in the lead role, but he only truly shines when he's performing; the film itself only comes alive during those same concert moments, especially the Live Aid finale. Better, though, to skip the reproductions and all the connect-the-dots filler in between and just watch archival footage of the real deal. A band as driven and theatrical as Queen deserves better than this rote and absurdly inaccurate coloring book of cliches.<br/><br/>33/100"

I honestly think Queen is overplayed, but I love the story very much, if it wasn't for the use of fake scenery in driving and audience I'd give this a 10 just because I am a nice critic.

","Where to start? Along with the dated synthesiser stuff that might put off younger people, Queen produced genuinely timeless classics with a genius playing a guitar that he built with his dad, a flamboyant Iranian man with a stupendous voice, and moments of lyrical brilliance that deserve more recognition. Some lesser known songs like 'Love of my life' are subtly beautiful and barely remembered. A rock band that can produce piano ballads like is not really a rock band; they're composers. Seeing Freddie sat at the piano composing was incredible. I couldn't sleep after watching it and stayed up late singing along to my favourite songs. What does that tell you?"

","8.1/10 ? Really ? This movie is the most overrated movie of 2018, and I love queen !<br/><br/>I would like to begin with what I liked. Ramy Malek's performance as Freddy is phenomenal and it deserves all the praise its getting. Then the live aids is recreated really well, which is impressive. But that's kinda it...<br/><br/>Now for the bad part. Nothing in the story is real ! The way they met, the producer that refuses Bohemian Rhapsody, Freedy's relationships with his boyfriends or Queen's ""separation"" all of this is either romanticized or even not true at all. But that's not the problem, I have no issues with depictions of real events that aren't romanticized to give the audience a great story, The Social Network does that and it's an amazing movie. Here, they decided to change the story to have the most basic, unoriginal and bland plot of a rock band becoming famous. This is the same story we've heard a million times, but hey, it's Queen so who cares am I right ?<br/><br/>I'm going to admit that I enjoyed watching the movie, but as soon as I started thinking about it, it became worse and worse. I believe this movie is rated 8.1/10 just because it is Queen. That's the only reason, you're all (and I was) blinded by either nostalgia or your deep love for Queen's music. Because boy oh boy is there a ton of Queen's music in this movie, everywhere, at any time. They even got as far as recreating nearly the full Live AIDS concert, which, I'll admit is impressive. But why ? 20 min of concert ? In a MOVIE ? It doesn't move the plot forward, it doesn't develop characters, it just wastes time ! But it's Queen so everything is alright, right ? No everything is not alright, this is not acceptable. For a movie that praised and for Queen we should expect a better movie that this. And that editing, my god how the hell did it get Best Editing at the Oscars ?<br/><br/>Just think about the movie a bit more and you'll see all the problem it's got. We deserve a better Queen movie..."

However, I'm also an avid Oscar fan, and I felt confused when it was nominated for Best Picture. Let me be clear, this film does not deserve Best Picture status. It was a fun, whimsical tale, but the writing and directing wasn't Oscar worthy. It deserved the Oscars it received, like Rami Malek winning best actor. He made the film what it is."

It was three weeks ago when a close friend of mine saw this film on a flight and told me that I should watch the film. I told him sure I would watch the film and still put it off. When Rami Malek won the Oscar I felt I should at least give it a chance. So this morning, in fact about 20 minutes ago I finished to watch this film and I must say it was wonderful. It brought to life everything that I remember about Queen and the inspiration that they brought to my life. I only hope that some day my films and novels reach the quality that was put into the making of this film."

"mindurbisnis","10","3","4","23 February 2019"," The band who stole the show
","July 13th 1985 the world stopped for Live Aid the benefit double concerts in London and Philadelphia for famine relief in Africa. Via 13 satellites to 150 countries an audience of 1.9 billion. The greatest music acts performed and those who didn't lived to regret it. Tucked among the headliners were reformed band Queen. No one could anticipate the reaction when Freddie Mercury and Queen played. Donations had been flowing nicely but the phones lit up during and after Queens set. It was the concert of the century and Queen stole the show.
This movie project was years in development because its the Freddie Mercury story as much as we love Queen the band and who can replace Freddie? Nominated for Leading Actor for his performance as FM is Rami Malek. I wasn't sure in the first ten minutes if this movie would work but Malek has achieved the impossible. His performance is amazing.
Queen were our first schizophrenic rock band. No 2 members of the band were the same. The albums and tracks were wildly different from love songs to dance to anthems and even light opera. It was a collaborative group overplayed with a giant dollop of FM creative genius. Producer/Director Brian Singer (not nominated?) did a fabulous job with this movie. Great camera angles and pauses just long enough. When FM told the band he was going solo it was Brian May who said 'but you need us' and he was right! It was the bands push backs, rewrites and constant arguing that challenged them to achieve better than their best.
Without Freddie though there would be no movie because there's not much of a story, the good and the bad, whatever you may think of him. This movie makes A Star Is Born look tame by comparison. It's earned double the box office receipts so go figure that one. It surely deserves more than just 5 Academy Award nominations."

The impact this band has made is beyond anything we have witnessed in music history. The way they tell the story and give us a little insight in the years Queen walked this earth is just amazing. Ive always loved the music, but this movie makes the legend even more magnifecent.

It says something about a band's music that can transcend a gulf of so many different ages and preferences. I came away wishing I would have paid more attention to Queen when I was in high school. I loved Bohemian Rhapsody. I had the 45 single and played it endlessly. I've always loved rock music that incorporated orchestral music. I was a huge fan of The Alan Parsons Project. I still have all their Albums. I only had 2 Queen albums, A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. I didn't listen to them as much as TAPP, because you grow up, get married, have kids, and just leave that part of your life behind and move on. I was sobbing by the end of the movie. It really brought back fond memories of my teen years. If the movie is in any way accurate, I would have loved to know Freddie Mercury personally (who wouldn't?)

","This lavishly creative cinematic jewel honors the legend of Freddie Mercury and so much more. The story was written by Peter Morgan and Anthony McCarten (who also wrote the screenplay) and Bryan Singer directed the film with finesse.<br/><br/>The title of the film is perhaps the most famous song that Queen created - the members of Queen being Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek)- lead vocalist, Brian May (Gwilym) - guitar, Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) - drums/percussion, and John Deacon (Joe Mazzello) - guitar. The essence of the film is well described by 20th Century Fox: 'Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.'<br/><br/>Yet even that description barely hints at the grandeur and sensitivity of this spectacle. The early Freddie is shared with his family, the Bulsaras (Meneka Das, Ace Bhatti and Priya Blackburn) - a fine bow to his Pakistani heritage, and his early love affair with Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). Then the rise to stardom begins and Rami Malek soars as Freddie Mercury. The music is lip-synched to the original with great skill and the performances by Malek and his Queen family are outstanding.<br/><br/>Supporting roles by Allen Leech, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers and Aaron McCusker are strong as is the cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel. But the crowning element of film is the extraordinarily fine performance by Rami Malek. He MUST get the Oscar!"

","Critics ?? bah out of touch. Go rate another boring Oscar nominee. This movie is a MUST watch fan or no fan as far as i'm concerned. Acting was amazing. Brian Mays character kind of has you scratching your head, like am i really seeing Brian or is this an actor.. Of course its an actor, but it has you believing you're actually seeing Brian May rather than an actor.<br/><br/>Anyway just do yourself a favor, ignore the critics and watch."

","I'm 35 and I've been a Queen fan since I was a teenager. This is the closest I will ever be to actually being in a Queen's concert. Just for that it's worth watching. But it's so much more than that! Forget about the critics, a film that touches people the way this one does has to be a wonderful one. Yes, there surly are some anachronisms and things have been changed for dramatic purposes. So what? Nobody needs to know about Freddie's wild parties in detail or his addiction (even though it's hinted at). This is a celebration of Queen, one of the best rock bands in the history of music. And it's amazing. Compelling, moving, touching... All the actors were incredible but Rami Malek was outstanding.<br/><br/>A movie is good depending on how it makes the viewers feel, the formal aspects of it are less important. And the majority of viewers have absolutely loved this film. Therefore, whatever it is critics didn't like about Bohemian Rhapsody we just don't care!"
"Leegarner37","9","3","4","11 February 2019"," Crazy little film called Queen
","Not a Queen fan but can fully appreciate what they have and are still doing in music. This is a brilliant film following them in the journey of the rise to their rightful place in music history.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is superb a playing Freddie Mercury and the story was brilliant from the start to the end. It certainly appeared that he lived a full life, though at times misled by those who he trusted.<br/><br/>A bunch of misfits drawn together and drawing the genius out of each other to make some of the most recognisable songs still to this day.<br/><br/>You don't need to be a Queen nor a music boffin to watch this movie. The film flows from start to finish with some amazing acting from a brilliant cast. Telling a remarkable story.<br/><br/>Sit back, relax, turn the volume up and let Queen glide you through their rise and fall of success, fame and their musical genius.<br/><br/>I'm glad I made the effort to see this."

Hats off to Mr. Bryan Singer too, for his unique success to balance on a thin fragile line getting through. Being older from all the (live and dead) members of the band, I feel obliged to confess that I love this band. But, BUT, being well educated to movie making, I suggest this film as a lesson of film making to any aspiring actor or director, not ignoring all the people whose contribution made the effort feasible. This is the third (or, maybe, the forth) time, I wish I could rate 50/10! BRAVO!!!"

","I don't see how anyone can call themselves a music lover and not know who Freddy Mercury was. He had one of the most unique voices in the history of music and his contributions are what give us a soundtrack to our lives.<br/><br/>This was an emotional watch for me. He seemed lonely and unaware that he was so loved and perhaps that was simply because he struggled to love himself. It was sad to watch that. He was talented. There's no doubt that he could've contributed much more to the music industry had he not died at the age of 45.<br/><br/>If you love music, you really should check this out."

","The film is a biographical in 2018 based on the British rock band Queen. The film was directed by Bryan Singer it is written by Anthony McCarten. It stars Rami Malik as Freddie Mercury and other stars Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joe Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech. The film gets five Oscar nominations. The film has so far won 14 awards from different movie festivals.
The film is set in US an GB in the 1970s and 1980s. It was filmed on different locations of US and GB.
It is about singer Freddie Mercury's life from his joining the band 1970 to their Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium in 1985. The film is focus on Freddie Mercury music and his private life. During the film a lot of perfect song of Queen is sung. In the final Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium is showed.
I strongly recommend Bohemian Rhapsody because it has good harmony of success, magnificent tragedy, drama and it also has unforgettable Queen's hit songs and soundtracks. It is the most beautiful film I have watched this year."

Never a dull moment, always entertaining.<br/><br/>The fact that the actors looked so much like the people they played, including the Geldof-a-like towards the end. That was quite surreal.<br/><br/>Lot's of emotion too - so it's one of those you watch not turning your head towards other people in the room lest they see your watery eyes.

From Rami's gestures to the innocuous acoustic guitar placement on stage during the concert, it becomes obvious that the cast, crew and producer embraced the ESSENCE and STYLE of the band. For that, I enjoyed the movie and I recommend it. Enjoy"

","Okay, Let me get this straight. If critics didn't like this, they can go to hell because this was a fine, fine movie. Rami Malek lived as Freddie mercury. He gave a spectacular performance and Oscar is on it's way home baby. For us, the 90's kids and today's generation who can never see Freddie on big screen or TV screen ever again, this is a blessing. I don't think anyone cares about the accurate representation of the story or whatever. Watching Freddie (or Rami playing Freddie) on the big screen itself is a boon. Just go watch it already if you haven't yet. All hail QUEEN!!! #Queenstan"

","First i should say, i don't know much about queen and freddie Mercury. I heard couple of songs but not more. But the performance from rami malek, i think this is his lifetime performance. He didn't have much of acting experience on big scree. Despite the fact he pulled of a ripper. First half of the film is like decent, not much happening. Second half is much better. The aid performance is on spot. Other characters don't have that much of effect. It is totally a rami malek show as well as freddie mercury of queen show."

","It's very rare that I score a movie with the highest rating possible but Bohemian Rhapsody truly deserves this. It's been a real long time I watched such a powerful movie. And you don't even have to be a Queen fan for that. I'm a Queen fan, one of the old generation, grew up with it, played the records over and over again in my room when I was a teenager. I remember selling my Queen Live Killers album because I needed some money, and instantly regretting it afterwards. I remember buying that same album again as soon as I had sufficient money again and played it over and over again, driving anyone else in my family nuts. This movie/biography is so well made, and full of emotions, bringing back good and bad memories, I really can't see what other movie could be a competitor for the Oscars. Bohemian Rhapsody has to win the Oscar for best motion picture, anything else would be a farce. And what about Rami Malek? What a performance that was! He's also a real contendor for best leading male actor. In fact the whole cast was just great. They really found the best actors possible to play the whole Queen crew. It's almost like they only searched for lookalikes but also with good acting skills. As for the sound, well it's Queen music, how can that be wrong? Like I said before, this movie is for everyone, even for people that are not Queen fans per se. Everybody knows at least one Queen song out of his head, fan or not, that's how big Queen was and always will be, champions forever. Bohemian Rhapsody made me cry, but also brought me back to my youth, and for that I can't be grateful enough. Definitely the movie of 2018!"

","Rami Malek is an actor who gives a 110% performance and he does look like Freddie Mercury towards the end. In the beginning he doesn't resemble him so much because he is a bit too slender and small and his face more irregular than Freddie.<br/><br/>The movie strikes a good balance between the various aspects of his life. The creative process and the success and the Live Aid performance are given prominence. Unlike modern biopics it doesn't focus too much on the salacious or perverted parts of his life. Though they do show his love interests of both sexes. The beginning of onset of AIDS is shown but not his decline and death.<br/><br/>A good reminder of how much his music has made a mark on popular culture."

","I don't particularly like Queen's music, anthemic though it might be to someone of my generation. My wife suggested going so I went along, not expecting much. It turned out to be one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I was fascinated by the band's back story, thrilled by Rami Malek's characterisation, and impressed by the modesty that the rest of the band showed in allowing the film to be made in such a Freddie Mercury reverential way. By the end, which seemed to come far too quickly, I felt spiritually uplifted and somewhat in awe of both Freddie and Rami. A superb film. I'm not sure now why I didn't give it 10."
"damianwadetreat","9","3","4","29 January 2019"," An amazing album that gets lost in the rotation
","Went to watch this on an impulse. 8:30 showing, empty theater, why not? And I gotta say that Bohemian Rhapsody is an excellent film. Rami Malek did an A+ job portraying one of (if not the) most charismatic frontmen in the history of rock, capturing the essence of Freddy Murcury as good as anyone could hope for. From a technical aspect the film also hits on every level. The film does have issues, the first act is pretty uneventful, focusing more on informing the audience of queens backstory and giving the characters some weight. This causes the first act to be mostly forgettable because shortly into the second act is where the conflict between freddy and the other characters takes center stage and the movie immediately becomes more interesting for the remaining run time. The last hour or so is gripping, building and building to a climax that sticks the landing 10/10 and leaves the viewer on a high that continues all the way out to your car when you blast Queen through your speakers on your way home 😏 however the film I feel lacks replay value, there isnt a lot to make you want to come back and watch the film again. It is an excellent film that starts off slow but hits all the right notes, and will definatley go into my collection. Just might not get that many trips to the blu ray player. 8.8/10"

","Biographic films are always special but not every film is created very well. Rami Malek has outperformed all his previous performances and done a mind blowing job being Freddie. The body language was just perfect. He deserves awards and recognition for ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" Rami Malek will be remembered for this one.
A must see film for music lovers and Queen fans. You will be mind blown wanting to know more about the real Freddie, his persona, his early life, relationships and of course his love for music. I feel Freddie was more of a performer than a mere lead singer.
Talking about the film, it is never easy to capture the entire life of a legend and bundle and showcase in 120 odd minutes. But the film touches all important events of Freddie's life. Had the childhood and family scenes been added, the film could have been lengthy.<br/><br/>This film deserves more than just an oscar.<br/><br/>Remembering Freddie's Quotes:<br/><br/>""I love the fact that I can make people happy in any form. Even if it's just an hour of their lives, if I can make them feel lucky or make them feel good, or bring a smile to a sour face, that to me is worthwhile.""<br/><br/>""You can be anything you want to be, just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be."""

","Excellent movie! My only criticism is, as a big Queen fan, the song chronology represented in the movie's progression was flawed. Less dedicated and most latter days fans aren't likely to notice and it's only a minor annoyance that should not keep any rock music fans from seeing this movie."
"Jorge-627-653533","9","3","4","25 January 2019"," Bio-Epic as someone called it!

Once again critics mixed reviews didn't hold people from watching this, and as Bohemian Rhapsody (the song) defied the odds more than 40 years ago, the same happened with the movie.

The greatest memory concert of all times that lots of artists did with incredible performances like Axl Rose or George Michael.... I would have bet on a 3 hours Movie.

","Yeah, as a Queen fan I loved this movie. Rami Malek's performance sounded great in the trailer and took everyone by storm in the final product. I loved how well he and the other band members turned out, because more than once I stared at Gwilum Lee and thought ""isn't that Bryan May"" to myself.<br/><br/>It was kind of weird witnessing Malek sing the chosen songs from Queen, because he delivered them with the same power and presence as Freddie Mercury did back in the day. Man, he did an amazing job!<br/><br/>I agree it's a rough take on a legendary band's and singer's career, so hopefully it lights a spark in a new generation of Queen fans to go pick up their music and their fascinating story. But I am so glad the writers took the hard life of Freddie Mercury with them into the movie, because otherwise it would be disgraceful.<br/><br/>Maybe not the one I'll be rooting for the most in the race for the Academy Award for Best Picture, but I really hope Malek gets the award for his performance!"

","I am not one to take my views online, to critic someone's work for which I am no expert. Having said that, after watching this, I felt compelled to announce and celebrate my admiration for this film, the production and in particular the actors who did such an outstanding job. I was bemused by some of the critics of this film. Somethings in this world remain unchanged, everyone has an opinion but as you can tell by reviews on this website, the people have spoken, this is a hit, there's no doubt about it. It was executed to perfection - bravo!!"

","They did a really great job on this movie , that even if you don't like the band you would really have a good time watching it and you would enjoy the music of queen ( live concert at the end was very good )
But to be honest i didn't like the story of Freddie mercury ,obviously they can't change it or make it any better than that. They tried to make it as good as it can gets.
i enjoyed the music and Rami malek was great in it .
i liked how it was written , made , directed and filmed. .
The crew of this film diserve an Oscar for sure .
Thanks for reading this."

"notom-23012","8","3","4","20 January 2019"," A tribute rather than a biographical look at the life of a musical genius
","My first introduction to the music of Queen/Freddie Mercury was the soundtrack to 'Highlander (1986)' and the song, 'Who wants to live forever'.
I thought it one of the most beautiful pieces of music I'd ever heard and still do... poignant but uplifting.<br/><br/>This movie has many of the qualities of that song - in that we all know how it's going to end - but it's the journey... that's the important thing... a little like 'Titanic'.<br/><br/>The film does not idolise Freddie Mercury - it presents him as he would have liked (I believe) to have been presented - a man of many layers, of many faults but also with many great facets.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury was renown for his partying - for his excesses - for pushing the boundaries... but he was also a man of conviction. kind and generous to a fault.<br/><br/>Rami Maleks' portrayal was flawless - he manages to capture the true essence of a man struggling with his sexual identity, struggling to find a balance between love and passion and struggling to put all of this to music.<br/><br/>I do believe that the film goes 'over the top' when it comes to giving pretty much all of the credit for Queens success to Freddie - May, Taylor and Deacon were great contributors to the band and without their talents I don't think it would have been nearly that successful.<br/><br/>Lucy Boynton played an excellent role - neither timid nor overly-strident - just the right level of supportive role that wouldn't take the spotlight away from the extraordinary performance from Rami Malek.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes - all of the cast were mere supporting roles for the main star and you get zero depth of character from any of them... just an almost fawning desire to keep 'Freddie' happy and producing.
You get no strong sense of camaraderie, friendship or trust - they were as 1 dimensional as you'll ever get in a 2 dimensional medium.
This is not to say that they played their roles badly - just that they we're never, probably, given any true insights into the actual dynamics of the band - why spoil the the myth?<br/><br/>All in all - the film is not a 'biopic' - it's not looking to idolise Freddie Mercury or present him as other than he was (with the above in mind) - and to, perhaps, endear him to a new generation of fans.<br/><br/>Watch it - it's a good film!"

","Biopic of the hugely popular/successful pop band Queen and the late singer Freddie Mercury, who died of AIDS in 1991.<br/><br/>Now this film has been criticised by some clever clog critics for its apparent lack of Freddie hedonism story.
I strongly disagree. The descent into orgies, homosexuality and AIDS is all covered. Along with the little known story of Freddie's wife Mary Austin.<br/><br/>The actors give great performances as the band members especially Rami Malek as Mercury. They look so believable. Malek even wears some kind of denture device to mimic the famous Freddie overbite.<br/><br/>In a way that is one of the strengths of the film. It chronicles the rise, fall and rise again of the GROUP leading up to the 1985 Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London where Queen quite literally stole the show.
The Wembley scenes are so realistic.<br/><br/>As a story of Queen rather than Freddie himself the film is a triumph revealing some interesting facts such as the songwriters of some of their most famous songs such as I'm In Love With My Car!<br/><br/>The film will appeal to Queen fans as a chronicle of their greatest hits. A guilty pleasure!<br/><br/>A troubled production behind the scenes apparently for several documented reasons. What influence did certain ex band members have?"

","My youngest son who was born years after Freddie Mercury died. He started to sing some Queen songs when he was still a toddler. I knew then that their music was going to live forever. They have joined The Beatles and Abba whose songs transcends generations.<br/><br/>A lot about Freddie Mercury is well known. Bohemian Rhapsody brings very little that is new to the table.<br/><br/>Credit has to go to Bryan Singer for framing the story from the band's beginnings to their triumphant performance at Live Aid in 1985.<br/><br/>I was worried that some white actor would play Freddie Mercury, real name Farouk Bulsara who was of Indian origin. Rami Malek is at least of Egyptian origin.<br/><br/>We see young Freddie working at an airport. When a student band loses its lead singer, Freddie offers his services, he could reach some high notes and he dresses extravagantly. When the band has some initial success, he becomes legally Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>The band members have a tumultuous relationship. John Deakins is more normal, Roger Taylor could be temperamental, Brian May had big curly hair and a homemade electric guitar. All of them could write songs and fight to get it on the albums. Together they created a string of hit songs. Some of them catchy: We Will Rock You, others were more extravagant such as Bohemian Rhapsody.<br/><br/>Freddie though although he has a girlfriend from the early days of the band is soon struggling with his sexuality. As the band gets bigger, his appetite for a hedonistic lifestyle increases. This includes casual relationships with men and self destructive behaviour that causes further conflicts within the band.<br/><br/>Singer knows how to lift the film with Queen songs. He does well to recreate the events of Live Aid which is the point where the band best known songs get pump out.<br/><br/>Queen aficionados would know when liberties have been taken with the truth and the timeline of the band.<br/><br/>Malek delivers as Freddie, especially with the accent. I thought Joseph Mazzello was good as Deakins. I enjoyed the unrecognisable cameo from Mike Myers as the record head.<br/><br/>After Bohemian Rhapsody finished, my wife turned around and said she was really entertained by the movie."

"tuckerorrni","9","3","4","16 January 2019"," Mercury Rises As Malek Gives The Hottest Performance Of His Career!
","I don't like musicals, in fact, I hate them but I had to watch this movie. I just couldn't let this pass me by as Queen are one of my favourite bands. I did struggle to believe the mass hysteria surrounding the performance of Malek in the lead before I watched, as with many similar biopic's, I was always left disappointed. This though, was a break from the norm. The protrayal of Freddie and his fellow band mates is quite stunning. Its heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure as Rami Malek puts in an unforgettable performance. Freddie's voice and its accompanying music is still as beautiful today as it was in the late 70's and 80's. All this makes for one hell of a great movie. DO NOT MISS THIS!"
"CALLAHANRobert","9","3","4","16 January 2019"," Bohemian Rhapsody... A Great Film!
","Whether you love Queen, or have absolutely no taste in music, Bohemian Rhapsody is a wonderfully well-written, produced, directed, and acted look at Freddie Mercury and the band, from their start in the 1970's through their performance at the Live Aid benefit concert at Wembley Stadium in 1985.<br/><br/>Directed by Bryan Singer, rhe film beautifully captures the brilliance of the band's music as well as providing insight into the story of band that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody.<br/><br/>I'm usually dissapointed watching a film about a band I love, however from the very beginning, before the actual film begins and you realize the 20th Century Fox Studio Bumper's backing music (a film studio's opening logo intro) has either been played by Brian May or has been channeled through a Brian May filter sounding like him playing the music on his signature Hamer guitar.<br/><br/>Rami Malek does an incredibly-outstanding job of bringing Freddie Mercury back to life, if only for a mesmerizing 134 minutes. Not only in his uncanny physical appearance, but invoking his mannerisms, and reincarnating his essence. He became Freddie Mercury for this film.<br/><br/>The other three actors playing his bandmates were equally amazing. The fact that All of the music in the film is by Queen, and being produced by Jim Beach (former Queen Manager) and Graham King, with band members Brian May and Roger Taylor as musical consultants injects the same genius that gave us Queen, the band, into Bohemian Rhapsody, the film.<br/><br/>The best film about a rock band I've ever seen."
"smnsohail","7","3","4","15 January 2019"," Well researched..

","I would never have thought anyone could deliver or pull off Freddie Mercury.

"hounds_star","10","3","4","14 January 2019"," What do 'Film Critics' Know? Apparently VERY LITTLE!

None of which comes across as 'covers' and I really don't think there was any lip syncing at all either.<br/><br/>Anyone would enjoy this film in its own right but for those 35 and above it is also a fantastic journey that they will enjoy going on tremendously."

","The movie is wonderful! I didn't listen to Queen's music before I saw it, but I knew some songs anyway, now I got like 10 songs from the movie on my Deezer playlist :) . It's awesome how it got me interested in Queens background and their music. Also Remi Malek's performance of Freddie is so remarkable that I came home after the first time I saw it and compared it to the real Freddie by watching some live shows at yt (live aid as well), then watch it again and saw how he managed to make a real masterpiece of his performance in the movie. I read some of the reviews by people who actually know lot more about Mercury's life and why they don't like it, I say it was wonderful experience listening to the soundtrack, watching Remi Malek bring Freddie to life, delivering his persona as an amazing and world changing artist, and not some wild gay man with all the partying, drugs and alcohol.
If you want to watch a movie about Freddie's life and focus on him as a good band leader and a human at the same time this is a movie for you. If you focus on the details you should find some documentary cus this will not give you extremely accurate informations you want to get :)"

This film, whilst not historically spot on, still reminded me how good Queen's songs were and took me back to Live Aid in 1985, where they really were the standout act (if only someone had stopped Tracy Chapman coming on stage it would have been a perfect day, I'll give you a Fast Car luv). That was Stevie Wonder's fault, but enough of that.<br/><br/>What was surprising was how decent many of Mercury's entourage were for much of his career, Mary's character in particular was touching.<br/><br/>A touching, inspiring film about a man who really was born for greatness."

","Shiny look in that boy's eyes, when he saw his idol, Freddie Mercury in the same hospital. Same condition, same flesh, and blood. We are all just humans, but not all of us get a chance to shoot the sky and become a legend as he did. By every breath he took, he gave much more to music. Forget the rock n' roll shenanigans, the gift is there. Marvelous. Music got them together, got all of the people in the same direction. Queen was barefoot, always barefoot. They didn't need to put something unnatural, because they were musicians for all. The mass loved them. The Queen loved them even more.<br/><br/>If you don't like Queen, you will at the end; but if you like them, you won't be able to stop admiring. You will love them eventually after the curtains close."

","I was never a mega fan of Queen although I did enjoy many of their songs growing up. This was such an interesting story and I actually learned somethings I never new about Freddie (i.e. his background was surprising) . The actor Rami was excellent in both his portrayal of Freddie and his vocal skills which when closing your eyes sounds exactly like the real deal. I had seen him before in another series Mr Robot) which was okay at first but then lost interest. However this move isn't that. It is so good I want to see it again a second time .

","I grew up with Queen. I remember seeing Bohemian Rapsody on TV for the first time and I remember being mesmerized by Mr. Mercury's performance. They didn't sing like that in church. Last night I saw Rami Malek and was just as fascinated. The story, the direction and the design are as slick as any Hollywood movie, but what captured me was that I as a ""consumer"" was watching the actor Malek looking at Mercury's life from the inside. He didn't embody Mercury (impossible) but observed it. Just like he observed Mercury's surroundings and his battles. I was fortunate to have met and workshopped with Augusto Boal. He once said: ""Theatre - or theatricality - is the capacity, this human property which allows man to observe himself in action, in activity."" Here we see an actor who applies that principle to his role and lets us all observe the actor Mercury through his action. Boal's mission was to use theatre to induce social change, I think it was Malek's mission to have us look at our own daily performances, because we all are, to use Boal's word, spect-actors."

"LizaH6","9","3","4","18 December 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody, Rami Malek, Gwilym Lee
","I've seen it 4 times in theaters including opening night in US. I might see it a 5th time before it's out. I dont usually bother to see a movie in theaters that many times, usually just once but I am a big Queen fan, and I genuinely enjoyed it, especially the Live Aid sequence. Is it perfect? No. Could the script and other aspects have been a bit better? Yes. However, I found it thoroughly enjoyable. Despite some of the sad parts and subject matter, you leave the movie feeling uplifted and wanting to go back for another viewing! I really can't wait for the bluray where there is sure to be some extras such as an extended Live Aid sequence (the full sequence is not in the theatrical version), and hopefully a bunch of deleted scenes and bloopers (this cast looks like they had A LOT Of fun!).<br/><br/>Rami Malek has gotten the lion's share of praise for his tremendous performance. I dont know if he'll win an Oscar but if he doesn't at the very least get nominated something is seriously wrong! He does an amazing job of showing Freddie's quirkiness, showmanship, excess, struggle with his sexuality and his upbringing, and yet also shows his loneliness, vulnerability, and an endearing quality that even when Freddie does wrong you want to very quickly forgive him for it. As a long time fan of Queen who has read a few bios on the frontman, all of this in Rami's depiction really suits Freddie to a T. He was in many ways a walking talking dichotomy and an extremely complicated person to capture on film, probably the easiest part for Rami was the teeth.<br/><br/>But all 4 of the actors playing the band did a tremendous job. They didnt just look the part but managed to learn the instruments well enough that they didnt need hand doubles and could play themselves. Quite an accomplishments as Brian, Roger, and John are all considered great musicians and songwriters in their own right.<br/><br/>I was very glad to see 4 actors chosen for these parts that weren't well known stars already. I get so sick of seeing the same actors in the same starring rolls all the time, and honestly it makes it easier in a biopic such as this, to try to pretend this IS the people the movie is about, and not say... Tom Cruise playing Freddie Mercury or some foolishness like that. LOL<br/><br/>That being said, Gwilym Lee. I mean come on. Why is this man not in more movies and tv series? I've checked out some of his other roles (because I think he's cute, okay? :p ), and he appears to be a very good actor, can do a variety of accents convincingly, including going toe to toe with Tom Hiddleston in Henry V. He bears some facial resemblance to both Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch, which makes it all the more odd that he hasn't had more movie roles because we all know how much the female public love those fine English blokes. :) Cute and very young looking without the beard, with a beard, oh, boy... *fans self* He seems to have good acting range and can do both humor and more serious acting. Tall and handsome, and can act. What else is Hollywood looking for?! I do have to wonder how much movie and tv roles are based on luck and who you know, versus actual talent when I see actors like this, and Rami (and for a while there Tom Hiddleston, tho he's finally more recognized), not have more significant roles being offered to them and yet we get the same old tired actors in the cinemas all the time over and over. Hopefully Bohemian Rhapsody will be a good jumping off point so Gwilym and Rami get more significant roles in future."

The movie itself could play as as rock opera, but not in the caliber of Tommy (1975) or Gimme Shelter (1970). The acting is well-performed, as if you were right there in the band's presence. I really enjoyed it and could watch it again...it was that surreal and spot on with the songs, even if they did incorporate Queen's actual vocals and music in it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended - a must-see twice or three times to feel the storm of the music and how Mercury lived his life, with and without the band.'s presence."
"johnnyiii","7","3","4","15 December 2018"," Enjoyable movie.
","I always liked most of Queen songs to begin with. So I was kind of apprehensive when going to the cinema at first.
Nevertheless bringing some extra popcorns and drinks was sort of an insurance incase the movie was bad. Luckily for us, the movie was so good that we had to finish eating them outside after the movie was over. It is very engaging to watch.
This is one movie where the main cast members seemed to have incredible chemistry as if they were Queen in real life.
I recommend this movie to anyone who need something to take their work stress or life problems away from them."
"alvcbrasil","8","3","4","13 December 2018"," Good story of the band.
","Although some cronological ""mistakes"", the story is very well adapted."
"VVMini","8","3","4","11 December 2018"," Great production and superb Rami Malek make up for some story-telling weak points
","Going into Bohemian Rhapsody, I heard so many conflicting reports about its quality that I had no idea what to expect. Critics disliked it, audiences loved it. Usually that means the 'truth' is somewhere in the middle, and I was surprised to see myself leaning more towards the audience side as the movie went on.<br/><br/>That's not to say I don't see where the criticism is coming from though, and I actually agree with quite a bit of it. Particularly the first half of the movie is rather shallow, well-executed, by-the-numbers nostalgia porn. Many scenes are made and meant to be viewed with current day knowledge, which makes for some cheap gags and winks to the audience but not particularly compelling story-telling. The recording sessions, while well-executed and full of energy, add very little other than a game of 'who's who' of Queen's greatest hits. As someone who appreciates Queen's music but didn't grow up with it and don't have a particularly large (nostalgic) fondness to it, this didn't really do much for me.<br/><br/>All that being said, most of these issues go away in the second half of the movie, when it's a lot more insightful into the person Freddie Mercury. The key moment that changes my view on the movie is when Freddie first confronts his sexuality with his fiance. It's the first real moment of character that he gets other than just being flamboyant and it hits like a bombshell, mainly because of Rami Malek's powerhouse performance as Freddie Mercury. From there, the film focuses much more on Freddie Mercury's character, and his flaws, and it becomes a much better film because of it.<br/><br/>Together with the incredibly energetic and well-executed music scenes (other than some very noticable audience CGI at the final performance), it overall makes for a very pumped up and positive movie-going experience. The role that Rami Malek plays in all of this is crucial. He gives it his all and it elevates the movie to another level. It's definitely worth seeing for his performance alone."

","This is an autobiography and sorry for fans but I didn't know much about the band or Freddie Mercury but I absolutely liked it. So this movie is not just for fans also for people that want to have fun from a movie. It introduces mostly Freddie Mercury's life and also the band Queen. Bohemian Rhapsody is like a great concert video mix with introducing how it all happened. After movie you're getting excited about Queen then searching, listening ect. So I really recommend you to watch it. I watched two times at the theather. Have fun! :)"

","This movie was excellent. Sure, there are historical accuracies, but they don't ruin the movie. Rami Malek is incredible, he's able to capture everything Freddie Mercury did effortlessly. Same goes for Gwilym Lee as Brian May. This film will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll make you sing."
"lenaj12","10","3","4","9 December 2018"," Amazing
","This is an amazing movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. It leads up to Queen's legendary Live Aid performance on July 13, 1985 and focuses heavily on Freddie Mercury on particular. It show Freddie's family life (they came to England from Zanzibar), how the band was formed and how they eventually rose to stardom, including how a couple of their songs were created. It also shows his relationship with love of his life Mary Austin, played sensitively by Lucy Boynton, and how he eventually comes out as gay.<br/><br/>Of course, pretty much all the major Queen songs are played throughout and used very well to support the story line - from what I understand, the singing is a mix of Freddie's, actor Rami Malek's and singer Marc Martel's, but Freddie's is heavily featured. The Live Aid scene is incredible and it gave me shivers to see just how many people were there that day and how Freddie interacted with the audience. Rami Malek is incredible as Freddie, capturing his speech and gestures and energy. The actors playing bandmates Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are also great. While there are some quite funny moments and powerful concert scenes, there are quiet and sensitive moments as well and it is very moving particularly at the end; I cried quite a bit and I definitely was not alone.<br/><br/>Yes, some things are not completely accurate but I believe they had to be changed to fit the movie, and at the end of the day the main purpose of a movie is to make you experience and feel something and this definitely does that. It is a movie that stays with you for a long time, and it will make you want to listen to Queen music and probably also see Freddie and the band in a new light."

","Queen has always been one of my favorites--thanks to my parents. I grew up listening to their songs in the car, etc. but I was never that obsessed, or anything (although they've always bee my favorite group of their time).<br/><br/>However, thanks to this movie, I feel a deeper connection to them. I've listened to their music, nonstop, since Nov. 2. I've seen this movie 3 times (and want more) and each time I leave, I, immediately, play Queen on my phone for the walk back to my car. Then in my car. Then when I get back home.<br/><br/>I don't know what happened but I'm a massive fan now. I've seen so many of Freddie's interviews online, and have watched as much footage of Queen I can. I might also have a tiny obsession with Rami Malek, which helps. :)<br/><br/>I didn't really know Rami before this role but I'm happy to say I've now seen (most) everything he has been in...that I can get my hands on. I'm completely hooked. Not only to Rami, as the amazingly talented person he is. But, also, to the amazing soul Freddie is/was.<br/><br/>Two wonderful souls. And, I'm so glad Rami was able to bring Freddie back to life for 2h15m. I never got to ""experience"" Freddie before he passed but, now, thanks to this movie, I feel I was given a chance to get to know the legend that is Freddie Mercury."

As a reminder of the early days of the AIDS epidemic it was spot-on.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled at the end of the film, for the first time in my life I wanted to immediately purchase another ticket for the next performance. I compromised and came back to the theater the next day with two friends.<br/><br/>This film touched my emotions in a way that no film has ever done- and no one is more surprised than me.

"maryath8","9","3","4","28 November 2018"," Can't get the negative reviews
","This movie overall is just an emotional rollercoaster. It has you captivated from start to finish. I personally experienced all kinds of emotion and felt the power of Queen's music right to my bones.
The fact I wanted to adress is around some negative reviews from critics saying the movie didn't really adress Freddie Mercury's sexuallity the way it should have and was afraid of being to explicit. Coming out of the theatre the thing that stunned me the most though was this exact fact. I was captivated by the way I understood exactly what the film was trying to say to me without it being overly detailed just for the shock of it. It felt smooth and portrayed the feelings it wanted with a kind of grace and respect it ought to in my opinion. It didn't make a great fuss about it because that was not the point of the movie. It was about the struggles of one of the greater musicians and artists if you will in history. We all know society was not ready yet for people like him but today's society is and it would be really disapointing if it was just a movie about that. This movie wanted to paint the portrait of a man (and band) who changed music as of today and he didn't do it because he was gay but because he was brilliant and that's what the focus was. That and the fact he lost his way only to realise in the end what really mattered in his life making peace with himself his family the band and his real family. That is what the film was all about and coming home and reading the reviews had me mad to be honest because the very thing I absolutly loved and respected about the film was the cause of them.
Anyway this film was quite an experience and although it's mentioned a lot it wouldn't feel right if i didn't give my praise to Rami Malek for a superb performance. This film has captured the essence of Queen right to the core and does an amazing job conveying all the right feels at the right moments. At the end it was all about the catharsis of a unique soul that lost its way somewhere in between and that's what it should have focused on no matter the critics.
Defiantly worth watching on the big screen a once in a lifetime experience."
"estelaxsalinas","10","3","4","28 November 2018"," I simply loved it !! Amazing performances !!

","Great film! Entertaining and never waning!
Great acting. The story was excellent and easy to follow. The script was good and non-judgmental, excellent because we all love Freddie unconditionally.
I love that Brian May and Roger Taylor were Executive Producers. It made me feel they had some input and most of the portrayal was truthful.
The music of course! How could your not love the music? I'm so glad you used original music and let Freddie's voice come through. I saw a preview to 'rocket man' and I am not pleased with the actor's voice. Let the artist's music and voice speak for themselves, having said that, Remi did such a great job of embodying Freddie!
Loved IT!!!"

"hivalert","9","3","4","25 November 2018"," It will rock you!
","I believe there are some incorrectness facts in this movie. One example, in this movie, Freddie Mercury was diagnosed as HIV-positive before Live Aid. The truth is he was diagnosed with the HIV until two years after. After Live Aid, Queen had other concerts, if I am not mistaken, one of them was in Hungary. In one interview the reporter asked to him ""will you be back to Hungary?"" and he said, ""if I am still alive, I'll come back."" That moment was the sign when he already knew he had the terrifying virus.<br/><br/>However, I still consider this movie is a perfect tribute to QUEEN! After I walk out of the cinema, my brain is filled with Queen's songs and those songs brought so many emotions. That is a sign you know the movie is incredible, darling! ðŸ˜Ž<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon are so exquisitely portrayed. Just look at that picture! I sometimes forgot I watch the movie about Queen and NOT the documentary about them. Rami Malek's performance is extraordinary because he rocked the role through his mannerisms, voice, facial features, physique through the years, body language is spot on! I hope he will win an Oscar because of this role."
"Alex1972","9","3","4","25 November 2018"," Like Queen's music, critics might not like it, but don't let that influence you
","I knew before watching this movie that critics had turned up their noses on this movie so admittedly I didn't have high expectations, but I am glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment in this movie and the recreation of the 70's and 80's era felt incredibly realistic. Also, the actors playing Queen look spookingly realistic to the extent that for a moment I even thought that it was not an actor playing Brian May, but Brian May himself. Also the actor playing John Deacon looked incredibly similar to the original John Deacon and his acting made the illusion seem even more real. John Taylor also looked very similar. Actually, I think that Rami Malek was the one who looked the least like the original.<br/><br/>On top of this the music was great and the scenes showing the story how the music was created was very entertaining. It was fun to see the band dynamics.<br/><br/>So, perhaps this movie is not heavy or highly intellectual, but a movie is also supposed to be fun and captivating. It provided an interesting historic look into the past and gave some interesting background perspective to Freddie, Queen and the times back then. You can say, like Queen's music, it might not be highbrow, but it's pretty fun and catchy. I am glad I watched this movie"

"justin-fencsak","10","3","4","24 November 2018"," A classic for the ages
","Whether you hate Queen or like them, this movie is a masterpiece that will live forever. Sure, there are a few inaccuracies and mistakes from real life, but the movie makes up for it with killer performances by Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, a man born in Zanzibar but raised in London when he was around 10 by Parsi parents. The movie begins and ends with Queen's historic 1985 Live Aid concert, and in the middle showcases Queen's beginnings as a rock band called Smile, to the creation of their first album, to all the mishaps, to their first big hit, to Freddie wanting to break free from his band, and ending with Freddie's revelation to his bandmates of his untimely disease from which he sadly passes away from later, AIDS.

If you're queens fan this is a must see! All the ups and downs ins and outs how Rock bands influenced the culture of the time! How aids was part of their part of life where seemingly the person next-door to you had aids. Scary scary timer mystery where people didn't know how bad this disease can be in almost anybody could get it. Freddie Mercury at the point of history is the center of this sadly. It's very nice that they are able to share all of this explanation of his life in this fashion. Many of the fans that experience Live aid on TV live or in person must've cried , did cry or had cried during this performance when viewing it. People like myself who viewed on TV and didn't get a chance they'll be there remembers how much Freddy walked on the stage and how bad he looked when he knew that he must've had it at that point.

","I always liked Queens music, but didn't like watching them. For me Freddy was just too camp, too outrageous! This movie helped me see what was behind the facade snd I can truly say that I loved it from beginning to end.
For me, the master stroke from the Producers was using Actors who truly resembled the characters they portrayed, rather than going for big names. An added bonus was that they actually appeared to be able to play their instruments, or were at least coached to give a very good impression of doing so.
Do I see Queen in a new light? No! They were always a great Rock Band, but I do understand Freddy better as a result and can now watch the old concerts with a new appreciation.
I doubt the film will win any awards, the blind critics have done too good a hatchet job, but Queen will have won new fans the world over and the movie will become an iconic classic.

"chris_haltiner","9","3","4","15 November 2018"," You will be rocked
","The film Bohemian Rhapsody, much like Queen's experimental and hugely popular music, will take you on a journey. Whether you grew up surrounded by Queen's music, or you only know Queen from their oft-played hits like ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""We Will Rock You"", or ""We Are the Champions"", you will relive the evolution of the band from its humble origins to the sell out concert crowds.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the dynamics between the band members, the difficulties of making convention-breaking songs, and Freddie Mercury's struggle with identity and his father. The film explores the personal and emotional lows, primarily of Freddie Mercury, without dwelling, unnecessarily, on the darker parts. I applaud the film for taking the high road in character portrayals.<br/><br/>Rami Malek was masterful as Freddie Mercury. Gwilym Lee looked and played the cerebral Brian May convincingly. Ben Hardy, as Roger Taylor, and Joseph Mazzello, as John Deacon, were both well cast. While I saw Mike Myers in the opening credits, I realized afterwards that I didn't remember seeing him. (Oh, he's there in a pivotal role.) Appropriately, there are touches of humor (""Galileo!"") in many scenes that play along with the absurdity of some of the songs.<br/><br/>The biggest impact was the way the film pulled you into the rapture of Queen's concerts. You will feel present, with the stage right there, caught up in the music and the energy."
"ThomasDrufke","9","3","4","15 November 2018"," Infectious
","If there's one word to describe this film, it's infectious. I couldn't help but find myself bouncing up and down to We Will Rock You, humming along to Radio Gaga, and tearing up hearing We Are The Champions. If you're a fan of Queen going in, there's no doubt in my mind you will enjoy yourself. I think where people are finding flaws with the film are in that it doesn't break any molds or cliches in terms of musical biopics, nor does it particularly follow the story of Queen factually. But really, what movie does? Rami Malek is a brilliantly charismatic Freddie Mercury and the direction here is visceral, even if it does get messy a bit at times. This may be a paint by numbers biopic in terms of structure, but it's an absolutely thrilling watch with a concert like atmosphere. Fantastic.<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"cardsrock","8","3","4","15 November 2018"," I want to break free
","I think this film will end up like it's title song and become more appreciated by critics over time. Rami Malek is staggeringly good as the iconic lead singer Freddie Mercury and the rest of the cast is spot-on. As expected, the music is fantastic (given that Queen's music is fantastic) and gives the film a grandiose feel. The highlight is without a doubt the Live Aid concert and is just really amazing to see recreated on film. Bohemian Rhapsody definitely hits the standard music biopic notes, but it's fun and engaging enough to make it unique."

","Great performances by a terrific cast. Not chronologically accurate in a few places, but all of the major events were covered.

"PartialMovieViewer","10","3","4","13 November 2018"," Now this is What I Call a Work of Art
","I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie or not. I read the 'professional critic reviews' on this, and was expecting something kind of meh. Even after watching the trailers, I had a couple of second thoughts about watching this story. I mean professional movie-reviewers...they know everything...right? I mean, I am so tired of paying a lot of money to end up sitting through two hours of shear crap. Now-a-days, I have to be cautious. Not only do moviegoers get fleeced, but we have to sit through so many stupid commercials. For me, hemorrhaging cash is cruel and unusual punishment to my wallet. So before I go to a flick I feel I must read the reviews. Once I am done I usually have a couple of questions. This time around, my first, and most important, was, 'am I wasting money?' According to the entertainment sections of most papers, I was. Red lights went on, but the trailers were all very enticing. Still, the question lingers, 'will I really enjoy this movie? Of course, the written word, for the most part, said, 'No, I would hate it.' As much data as I had, I had no idea I would struggle so much with the instinct that told me, 'keep an open mind - Luke.' Ah yes, The Force from some other movie kept me focused. But then again, hmmm? Let's face it so many times I have seen great trailers ending up being the best part of the movie, which segues me into to my next question, 'was the director any good?' Well I don't know Bryan Singer from Reginald Singer. Judging by his resume, he has done some stuff I don't dislike - which is kind of a plus for me. Oh, and the cast-members, what about the cast? Well - let's see - there's this guy playing Freddie, and that guy playing Brian May, and this that bloke (my attempt at British-English) playing Roger Taylor and, of course, some dude playing John Deacon. I almost forgot please don't forget all the other people playing - well - other people? I really thought my decision to go would take forever, but my wife ordered me to warm up the car, we're going to the movies. Being the jerk I am, I told my wife, 'well at least there will be some great music if the movie stinks.' I am so glad I went. My biggest mistake regarding my viewing decision was to listen to the pros, and not to the real people of IMDB. IMDB contributors have to pay to see these movies, and for the most part, are looking to be entertained. The cast is outstanding. Freddie - I mean Rani Malek was great and so were all the rest of the cast. Their performances were so enthralling, at one point I felt like I traveled back in time and became some nosey fly-on-the-wall hanging out with my pals, the real ""Queen."" I understand some people are upset since this movie ended up being more about Freddie than the group. From what I read, I guess it wasn't supposed to go the way it did. With all the greatest respect to the rest of Queen, I am one who is glad it did go the way it did. More than enough time has passed. Let's see, Freddie has been gone since 1991. That is over twenty years ago. Now putting this in context, about a month after Steve Jobs passes away, a pretty good rendition starring Ashton Kutcher is produced, followed shortly-after by some overly expensive, nasty hit-piece. Neither of these flicks really shows how Steve changed for the better as he neared the end of life's road. For this story, the viewer watches as Freddie becomes more famous while his flaws become more evident. It takes a while, but Mr. Mercury recognizes what he did to his family (Queen) and attempts to make a mends. For me, when a person tries to make things right, I feel they have found a missing part of their character. This is a very important aspect of the story - Freddie Mercury admits error and reconnects with those who truly love him. Oh, if only Mr. Singer had directed the story of Jobs - ahhh well - too late. Outstanding movie, I loved it. I miss Queen more now than the day it all ended. Thank you team - Bohemian Rhapsody."

","I was 10 when bohemian rhapsody was released so Queen were pretty much the soundtrack of my youth. Always loved them , seen them live multiple times , not only that but Live Aid was the most memorable concert in my lifetime I recorded the whole thing on multiple VHS tapes. Live Aid was the day all the people who liked Queen but weren't fans understood why I loved this band. This film is special to me , a fantastic insight to their rise to fame , how their individual talents made a whole that was perfection, to Freddy's flawed genius. Not sure how those who haven't already got a special place n their hearts for Queen will find it but I just loved it from start to finish. The cast are perfect , the acting spot on, a couple of laugh out loud moments, heartbreaking and heartwarming and the recreation of the live aid performance 'almost' as brilliant as the real thing."

"bereges","9","3","4","10 November 2018"," Rami Malek and the depiction of Queen's Live Aid gig are 10/10
","Possibly apocryphal, but the scenes when Freddie brought his boyfriend Jim Hutton to visit and make peace with his staunchly conservative Zoroastrian parents and sister on the day of the Live Aid concert, and his ex fiancee Mary Austin and her new partner, together with Jim proudly watching the gig in progress backstage is heartwarming.<br/><br/>The scenes where Queen were preparing for their Live Aid gig, Freddie making his way onstage, the stage curtains being pulled aside to reveal a 72,000 crowd, as well as numerous video cameras broadcasting live to more than a billion people worldwide are top class.<br/><br/>Usually I discard movie tickets, but this one I'll keep, as a reminder of a Freddie Mercury fronted Queen I've never managed to see live."

I was fascinated at the NONmusical genius of 3 out of the 4 of them along WITH their musical ability which allowed them to be so creative.

","This film was a triumph - ecstatic music, humour and deep emotion.
Not only did Rami Malek nail Freddie but the casting and make up for other band members was amazing.
The Live Aid stadium scene was breathtaking.
What a celebration of life.
A lot has been said about the lack of Freddie's sex life, a lack of detail in his diagnosis with HIV/AIDS.
Freddie announced to the world that he was HIV+ and had progressed to AIDS 24 hours before his death.
So the lack of explicit details is how he lived his life, therefore it's how the film portrayed it.
Can not find enough stars to give this - ready to go again"

I am satisfied by the performance and the resemblance of the actors to the band . It was a satisfied movie and watching some time ago their documanter I say is close enough although I never would have thought Freddy had a girlfriend and that he went through all this loneliness. I was happy to hear again their music and how was created. I say in general having to describe a whole story of the band including fouly some of their songs in 3 hours was not bad at all"

Rami Malek to me has already won the Oscar for the Best Actor, and honestly every other actor in the film is really good.
The cinematography is incredible, direction is great and the story they told was captivating as it does get deep and emotional at times.
Freddie Mercury and Queen will live on forever and this movie will be a classic in time.

","Saw this movie yesterday. I definetly recommend it for those who love Queen and non-Queen lovers as well.<br/><br/>I am a true fan of this band, and even when there are some inaccurate facts as they did not happen that way, I understand that it was made to reenforce the dramatic proposal of the film.
A film long awaited and really complex in the making. And I think, as a fan, that is hard to balance and condense fifteen years of a band like this one in just two hours. I think the bad reviews are justified because some people wanted a different approach, a little bit gorier, controversial or extreme. That is the reason they criticise, because they never understood Queen as the band and great part of the fandom did . It is true that this whole story of Freddie, Brian, John & Roger is so full of great moments from 1970 to 1991 -and beyond- that it may have deserved an 8 hour miniseries.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, I can't ask for more. This film has a great casting (Rami Malek you'll be in my heart forever, and you deserve tons of awards) , great directing, great costumes and most of all... Great music. (Isn't that what we came for?)<br/><br/>I give it a 10 to bring my quota of balance against those f** critics (they never understood Queen nor Freddie, so I don't expect for them to do it now). This movie is less than a ten out of ten because isn't a masterpiece, but this is my heart speaking. This film is released with extra care for the artistry, the music and the songs that changed many people's life. I left the theater cheering, drenched in tears and happy as no one of the appraised films of this year could make me.<br/><br/>Queen was a crowd-pleaser band. And this film is intended to be a crowd-pleaser one. So people are loving it, and critics don't . Just like any album they made. They'll never get it.<br/><br/>Long live Queen!!!!"
"freddieisgod","10","3","4","5 November 2018"," It Will Rock You!!
","As a massive Queen fan I was a little sceptical to begin with. Would they do Freddie & the band as a whole justice? The jury was out.<br/><br/>Well my fears were well and truely put to rest. What a fantastic film. The whole cast are brilliant but I have to say for me the two shining lights are Remi Malek's portrail of Freddie - truely Oscar worthy (but sadly the movie won't win any Oscars as it's not in black & white, pretentious & with subtitles!!!!) and Gwilym Lee as Brian May. Gwilym is so scarily like Brian you simply forget it's not Brian on screen.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie with Live Aid is so phenomenally well done it's jaw dropping. If this move doesn't have you singing, stamping & clapping along then you must be dead. Cannot wait to go see it again (and again and again)."
"beezo56","8","3","4","5 November 2018"," If your not a fan, you will become a Queen fan!!
","The movie is great. It's not a bio of Freddy Mercury. It's about the band Queen and it is one hell of a story. I love the attention to details like Freddys overbite and his movements seem authentic. I wish they would not spend so much time on Paul with his devilish grin and dark forces taking over his life. Breaking up the band. They could have spent that time on Freddie's demons. Music is awesome and I would tell everyone to see it."

","This movie was SOOOOOO moving and phenomenal that I don't even have words. The critics that gave this a not so good or bad review got it TOTALLY WRONG and they need to go back to critic school. This movie was riveting and the casting so very perfect. My husband and I have not been able to think of anything else since. Rami Malek's performance was astounding and I already loved and respected him for his performance in Mr. Robot but my respect has risen to a whole new level. We saw Lucy Boynton in Sing Street (which is also, by the way, an incredible movie if you haven't seen it) at the Sundance Film Festival and have loved her ever since. The entire cast was superb. I always loved Queen and they were one of the greatest bands of all time and this movie brought them back to life for me and reignited my desire to listen to all their music again and again. It also made me so sad to think of the loss of such an incredibly talented and iconic musician.
I found the Live Aid concert footage on YouTube and watched it and the recreation of that event was no less than stupendous. I can't say enough great things about the honor of being able to see this movie and re-live the meteoric rise of one of the most talented bands ever. I'm usually great with words and vocabulary but this movie has left me literally speechless. Go see it. I go to a lot of movies and this truly is the best movie of 2018 so far. If Rami Malek is not considered for an Oscar for his performance, it will truly be a crime."

A very entertaining film and with an excellent cast - do not expect the timing in the last half to be totally accurate - and do not care about it either.
This is not a documentary and just enjoy the music, the reality of what it must be like to travel in a rock band. You get to see the humaness of the bank too.

Although there were some factual errors, particularly involving Live Aid, they were not enough to make me upset. Mike Myers scene was memorable.

Going to see this with a friend, we arrived early for a late showing and it was sold out. We still wanted to see this, so we drove over to the next town and the theatre was still packed. The mediocre reviews and the news from the behind-the-scenes were mildly troubling but it did little to dampen my enthusiasm and I'm so glad I got to see it opening weekend.<br/><br/>This is Freddie's (Rami Malek) story and I liked how they presented his journey. Freddie's portrayed as a complicated individual, he loves performing but gets defensive when the press pries into his private life. He has this magnetic energy where people flock to him but he's never sure of himself and a big part of the movie is him grappling with his sexuality and balancing his interpersonal relationships (this was all done in a surprisingly respectful manner). Maybe the most notable is his romance/friendship with his former wife Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). This is a sympathetic look at Mercury and even when the movie shows him at his most self-indulgent moments, I still was in awe of him as a performer and respected his ability. I also liked all the other members of the band. They aren't given a lot of time respectively, but they all get a few moments to shine. The movie is surprisingly funny, it doesn't carry the same vibe as other musical biopics like Ray or Walk the Line. There are dark moments but there's a surprising amount of levity and most of the best comedic moments are either the band interacting with each other or the whole band standing up to some bigwig or corporate stooge.<br/><br/>If you love Queen's music, you're going to dig the score. I was in that camp, but I also thought the movie used those songs effectively throughout. We get all of Queen's hits, but they interweave them into the movie to great effect. Commenting further on the audio and visual sensibilities of the movie, I also thought they shot this movie with a sense of style. The best moments are the concert sequences, especially the LIVE AID show that bookends the movie. The CGI on the crowd looks better in some moments than others but the energy is undeniable and those were some impressively filmed scenes.<br/><br/>The reason to rush out to see this movie though is Rami Malek's unbelievable performance as Freddie Mercury. I really hope he gets some recognition at the various awards ceremonies for his work in Bohemian Rhapsody. He does a masterful job bringing Freddie's manic performing style to the movie and equally nails both the comedic and dramatic moments. This might sound a little trite but there came a point in the movie where I forgot I was watching an actor and not the actual Freddie Mercury. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello are all solid as the other members of the band Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon respectively. They have a lot of chemistry as a group, they all have some memorable comedic lines and they all deserve praise for their portrayals. Lucy Boynton gave an emotional and well-rounded performance as the love of Freddie's life. Allen Leech was appropriately slimy as Paul Prenter. Aidan Gillen and Tom Hollander both had their moments as the band's manager and lawyer. I also really liked Mike Myers in his small role as Ray Foster. He was very funny, and he was memorable in a relatively thankless part.<br/><br/>Critics have railed against this movie for being too conventional and for following the same beats as most musical biopics. As much as I enjoyed this movie, their criticism is valid. This movie has so much going for it, but it does fail to transcend some of the genre clichÃ©s. Stepping back from the movie and looking at the product as a whole, the same beats of the rise and fall story do apply and while I think this movie executes the formula well, I'll concede the point it can be formulaic. There's also a small nagging doubt where it feels that we didn't really dive into the ugly side of the band's lifestyle. This had to be made with the permission of the band members and Freddie Mercury's estate, so they probably wouldn't allow the dirtiest bits of the journey the band went on. So, we might be looking at Freddie's life through rose coloured glasses but I'm not an expert on the band, so I was willing to set that aside.<br/><br/>I've loved Queen's music since I was a teenager, when everyone was listening to rap music, Queen's greatest hits was in my CD player. I knew walking into this I was going to enjoy Bohemian Rhapsody at a minimum but so much of this movie was done so well, it soared past even my high expectations. The strongest aspect is Rami Malek's performance which will hopefully get the attention it deserves. Its the best lead performance I've seen this year and when this movie intermittently stumbles, he brings it back. This is a funny, poignant and interesting story about a man who was larger than life trying to figure things out as he goes. I think even if you're not a big fan of Queen's music, you'll still enjoy this and the friend I saw this with wasn't a fan. He walked out and begrudgingly admitted it was great. I left the theatre humming Another One Bites the Dust with a big smile on my face. I recommend this wholeheartedly and I'm happy to give it an 8.5/10 and I'll round up to a 9/10."
"roxanneangell-22440","10","3","4","5 November 2018"," Sublime
","This movie gave me chills. I was transported back in time and given a front row to concerts that will never be again. It made me realize (again) how much the world lost in Freddie. It also reminded me how far we have come in accepting each other, but we cannot stop. Just remember to Smile. And love each other"
"brsoto-52186","10","3","4","5 November 2018"," Legendary!
","Remi playing Freddy was spectacular to watch. Queen stole the show at Live Aid with a bunch of headliners. I've watched that performance a million times throughout my life time, he deserves an academy award for this film"

","Truly entertaining and moving, you get to laugh with queen, cry with Freddie and smile when he's kind . I think the movie is a masterpiece, just like queens albums are."

","I was dreading about this movie, was pretty sure it will flop, but they pulled it off really well. Writing this while enjoying ""I'm in love with my car"" in the background. Roger, that song is a classic, don't listen Brian and John! :-)"
"Neoman1962","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Best Movie of the Year
","Amazing performances....the Live Always I'd concert sequence was incredible. If you are a Queen fan, see this film in a theater on a big screen."
"trixietrueheart","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody WILL rock you!
","I came of age in the 80's, so I caught the tail of Queen's career (Another One Bites the Dust, We Will Rock You, etc.) But I really became interested in the rest of their catalog after seeing Wayne's World. I went to see the movie because I figured this was close as I would get to seeing Queen perform live.
This movie had me feeling as if I was born a decade too late. I LOVED seeing them come up with the their different hits, I loved learning about the other band members (who knew they were so smart?!?!), I loved how committed they were to one another.
The performances were excellent. Rami Malek embodied Freddie Mercury to such a degree that at times I thought it could have BEEN Freddy Mercury! That strut! That stage prescence! He killed it!
And the music?! If you are considering this movie, you already know about the music. My audience was dry. I couldn't believe they could sit stone still and not even nod their heads while the songs were playing! Personally, I was jammin'! They may have been still, but they did applaude at the end.
The movie itself wasn't sad, but I found myself moved to tears, though I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe because I never got to see Queen perform live."
"idrincon","9","3","4","4 November 2018"," Just enjoy
","This movie does not pretend to be a thoughtful portrait of internal demons or try to answer the questions behind Freddy's early departure. It is just a story, a well told story telling Freddy's life intermingled with stories about how some of Queen's music was created. Just sit down, grab your popcorn and relax. Pure entertainment!"
"andy-68262","9","3","4","4 November 2018"," I had a great time!
","We had the best of time. The beginning is a little weird but man when the music gets playing you can't help but love this movie. Go See it"
"rjona1","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Loved this movie!!!
","Best musical since Mamma Mia<br/><br/>I lived how the songs evolved and showed the talents of each band members"
"paul-knewit","9","3","4","4 November 2018"," Interesting & Engrossing
","An excellent production which involves the viewer completely. At times the emotional involvement, for the cinema audience, raises the hairs on the neck. A highly recommended biopic which entertains but doesn't really offer anything new. That said, & I will probably be purchasing the Blu-ray when it arrives."
"ccolive","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Queen forever!!
","Excellent movie!! Could see it again and again! Music is fantastic!, Acting is fantastic!! If you are a Queen fan a must see!!"
"gem411","9","3","4","4 November 2018"," Not a wrong note...
","A movie that soars bringing heart and fierceness to the story of Queen. The making of a group and music that became the fabric of a time period. Rami Malik became Freddy in a way that let me get to know him just a little."
"denizkale-77208","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Awesome movie.
","Absolutely stunning actings, had so much goosebumps. It was almost like a real concert experience."
"Dynamohumm","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," A Triumph
","Simply put, this film (despite its omissions) is an absolute triumph. Queen fan or not, it will give you a glimpse of the brilliance of Freddie Mercury and a snapshot of his early solitary/lonely lifestyle."
"amandazz100","8","3","4","4 November 2018"," A must see film
","I wasn't expecting to go see this, but I'm glad I did. it held my attention from the very beginning to the end. The jutaposition of "" normalcy"" and "" rock stardom"" made for a fascinating study of the effect of talent and fame.
well worth a visit"
"EAA123","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," nailed it!!
","Just loved the movie. Got to see Queen them once at MSG July 28, 1982. Awesome show. Rami Malek nailed it!"
"mcavnah","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," A beautiful tribute to Freddie
","I can understand where the critics were coming from... this movie definitely grazed over the true depth Queen and could have gone deeper into the full story of Freddie and the band, their rise and struggles, and the aftermath of Mercury's death and the impact it had... But all in all, it was a beautiful movie with a brilliant cast. Malek's portrayal of the iconic Freddie Mercury was, without question, one of the best performances I have ever seen. At times I thought I was watching the real Freddie, and for that matter, the real Brian, John, and Roger. As a lover of Queen's music, I was immersed in the story, singing along to all the songs, and felt all of joy and sorrow that you should feel when remembering an epic musician that perished far too soon... Though I was left wanting more, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from the first line to the closing credits. It is the Queen we all know and love, and it was a beautiful tribute to Freddie. I wish he was still with us today... And, if he was, I believe he would absolutely approve of this movie! If you love Queen then you will love this movie! It may be a watered down version of their story, but the story is still amazing.. and worth watching time and time again."
"semaj-95339","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," This will rock you
","If you want a successful movie add a Queen soundtrack. This has it all, the casting is perfect. The audience at the cinema were all middle aged and they were travelling back in time. Queen are all time legends there will never be another Mercury.
When then movie ended I turned to my GF and said we lived through some great times music wise, the couple next to me agreed, they'd been dancing away in their seat throughout.
Long live Queen"
"zrinko-17607","8","3","4","4 November 2018"," As long as you´re not expecting a documentary, you will be satisfied.
","This long awaited film is not an unforgettable masterpiece, but it most certainly won´t disappoint the majority of the viewers either. The flamboyant personality of Freddie Mercury is shown in a slightly caricaturistic manner, yet not in a way that would make his character seem unreal and fictional. This is also due to the fantastic work provided by Rami Malek who captured the essence of Freddie´s persona flawlessly. The film doesn´t necessarily always present the events in a very accurate historical way, but it delivers what it was meant to deliver; an entertaining biopic focused on a very charismatic artist. You will be mesmerized by the perfectly recreated Live Aid performance. Not only because of the brilliant sound, but also due to the fact the emotions Freddie and the other band members felt were shown as well. I strongly recommend watching, especially if you are a Queen fan."
"schairunisa","8","3","4","4 November 2018"," All my thumbs up!!
","GOSH! I couldn't find any right words to describe this movie. Surely it's HIGH RECOMMENDED. I'm far away from Queen era. I was born on 1990's, and only know their songs from radio, tv, internet, etc, you named it. But, after watched this movie I had no idea that Queen has such as high musicality, unique taste I could never imagine. Thanks God we have Bryan Singer, and sure Rami Malek and all other casts work very hard to meet fans expectation. Guys, you rock!! I already watched it twice and still I can't move on. Bohemian Rhapsody will be my movie of the year! 🤘🏾"
"viapetty","9","3","4","4 November 2018"," screw the critics
","This was a masterpiece. absolutely magnificent. If you have ever head banged to the title song, and even if you haven't, it's a must see"
"wazakenn","8","3","4","4 November 2018"," It was enough
","It didn't quite knock my socks off as much as I thought it would but it was still a rollicking good ride through Queen's glorious reign. They provided the score to my teens and twenties and just hearing some of those songs again was glorious.<br/><br/>The film has copped a lot of flack. Apparently, it is thought by some to be a vehicle towards garnering more attention to the remaining members of Queen. Some have criticised the lack of depth to which the film probed Freddie's personal life and his complicated relationships with lovers and friends.<br/><br/>I thought what it gave was enough. Enough to realise that he was complex and at the very heart of it an insecure man who sought love and attention in ultimately destructive ways. The media was out for sordid details when he was alive (as evidenced in one scene of the film) and the thirst for those same details long after he is dead is just sad.<br/><br/>He was an imperfect artiste extraordinaire - please, let's just leave it at that."
"lynpalmer1","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Loved it!
","Here is where the critics get it totally wrong. Freddie Mercury was NOT a gay icon. He was a ROCK icon. Back in the 70's we didn't know he was gay. When it finally became known, nobody cared because even those against gays (and in those days there were many) were already totally blown away by Queens music and especially Freddie's charisma. He wasn't loved BECAUSE he was gay. He was loved IN SPITE of being gay. We all know about his personal life by now. We don't need to see an entire movie about his sex life. We want to see a movie that reminds us if why he was so loved, even by homophobes.
In 1977 when my husband was 17 he got a call from a school friend asking him to go see a Queen concert with him. My husband said no because it was a school night and he didn't really like them much. A little later the friend called back begging him to go and offering to pay since he had found no one else. My husband finally gave in and went. He said within seconds of the opening song he became a life long Queen fan and was totally blown away by Freddy Mercury's stage presence. This movie perfectly captures that feeling for Queen fans. Not that we've forgotten, but it recreates the love we all feel for the band and the over the top personality of its lead singer. Oscar worthy performance by Malek. To this day my husband likes to gloat that he saw Queen live and I never did. I (not so) secretly hate him for it."
"montyashtonlewis-09189","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Unbearably good
","You can ignore the critics. This movie is so good."
"nmr0401","10","3","4","4 November 2018"," Amazingly done!
","I may not have lived during the era of this talented and amazing band, but as soon as I was exposed to their music, I knew they were going to be one of my favorites. This movie was epically well done. The amount of their music they actually include in this movie was on point and also well thought out how they incorporated it and transitioned it from scene to scene. I don't know how anyone could be giving this movie a poor rating! I really hope to see it win some awards because it was nothing less than awesome! Will definitely be buying it on dvd, though the experience will not quite be like it was in theaters! If you love queen and their music... this is a must see! Actors that portrayed the members resemble the actual bands members and did a fine job!"
"artlover0811","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," A Must See
","Rami Malek's performance is top notch. The way he moves about the stage truly is like Freddie Mercury. We also see the early days of Queen as a whole. It is interesting and entertaining. I loved this film. If you love Queen or music in general you'll love this movie. All of the actors in this movie were amazing performers."
"jrsycountrygrl","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," AMAZING
","I laughed, I cried, Rami was AMAZING, BRILLIANT and did such a truly glorious job ! MUST SEE!!!!!"
"wajjwa","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Brilliant movie everyone must see!
","I was never really a Queens fan, as it was a band of my parents "" era"" . I knew their songs, as their music was played through all of my childhood. And here now, after coming back from the cinema, after this brilliant masterpiece, I think I fell in love. It changed my mind and rocked my world. How could I never knew their full story, how it all started, how it grew to the greatest band in the world. I'm sooo glad I had this chance to change my view to this band. All the actors portrayed it all so well, it seemed I was really watching them live, their life story, with all the drama, jokes, love, sadness, loneliness and joy altogether. It was a magical movie I highly recommend to everyone who knows them, loves them, or have heard of them at least once in their life. My gosh, I'll have to watch it again!"
"petrin-mailbox","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Absolutely incredible!
","I have never waited for a movie with this much excitement and anticipation before!
This film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride back in time, lifts you up, brings you to tears and at the same time makes you realize this kind if band/character is sadly never to be again. It reaches it's crescendo at Live Aid where the music goes through your chest and Rami's mesmerizing performance (and Martel's mind boggeling Freddie voice) transports you to Wembley where the only Queen worthy of the royal title unites millions of euphoric people once again, in 2018. I was so happy that a new generation will get to learn about Queen as I'm not sure any artist today, or ever, can come anywhere close to them. A success of immense proportions!"
"jasongkgreen","9","3","4","3 November 2018"," Really did ""Rock Me"".
","Wow.<br/><br/>No really. Firstly what about the critic reviews? I can see the thoughts but think they miss the point. The feeling. I have heard:<br/><br/>""It didn't go as far as it could""
""It's like a trailer for the film""
""It wasted an opportunity""<br/><br/>Then there are the public reviews at 8.4 out of 10 as I write this. If you like Queen music (who doesn't) you are onto a winner already.<br/><br/>I felt moved on numerous occasion. Rami Malek was superb. He took some growing into those teeth, but a performance that made me think at times I was watching Freddie. The rest of the band and ""supporting"" actors were excellent, and as I expected them to be as characters.<br/><br/>Yes I think the story was somewhat ""cleansed"" as it would be. These are Freddie's ""family"" involved in making this, directing it. But a great story, sensitive and left me missing Freddie, emotional and taken on roller coaster of wonderful, nostalgic Queen music. The ""Live Aid"" is sensational.<br/><br/>I loved it, and recommend it highly. 9/10"
"adrian-prodanel","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Trully emotional!
","Incredible performance! The team was doing a great job! We have to thank for bringing back to us the spirit of Queen! Bravo! The critics made again a mistake. Go and see the movie! You will enjoy every minute of it!"
"mollyvoorheis","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Wow. Just wow.
","We saw ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" last night and it was phenomenal. Malek does a great job as Freddie Mercury, and this movie makes you laugh, and cry, and you learn about the best band ever essembled. Run, don't walk to see this movie."
"DylanAnglin","9","3","4","3 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody Review
","Watching the tale of Queen on the big screen was an absolute treat. The cinematography and acting was amazing and seeing how the band came together and claimed their fame was entertaining. The story itself was more about Freddy Mercury than anything, but that's not to say the rest of the band didn't have a huge role themselves. The level of detail was amazing and they couldn't have found better actors to use to portray everyone involved. Bohemian Rhapsody is a must watch for any Queen fan. 9/10"
"wileykite","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Brilliant. Funny. Sad. Queen.
","What a show. If you have the opportunity to see this in a Dolby Atmos theatre, I highly recommend it. This film had a little bit of everything but the cast really brings it home. Everyone did an outstanding job."
"amir_hassan01","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," A magnificent portrayal of true artists
","I was never much of a Queen fan, and I only became acquainted with their music when Freddie died. However, my expectations for this film were high, especially after having seen Rami Malek's performance in ""Mr. Robot"" and after reading how the band had approved of him as the actor to play Freddie.<br/><br/>This film outdid my expectations -
I was either sitting on my seat, laughing or crying as the story progressed. The music was well selected and the story told in a way that succeeded in explaining why things turned out the way they did in a way that captivated the emotions.<br/><br/>I watched this film with my wife who told me afterwards that she has never sat through the closing credits for any movie.<br/><br/>This film transported us into Queen's and Freddie's reality with all their struggles, accomplishments, heartbreak and happiness. Bravo!!"
"mariajames929","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Thrilling!
","Three of us saw this last night, and it's the first time that I've been moved to actually write a review, because it was a thrilling experience. I should mention that I had just become a teen when Killer Queen was released in North America, and I have been a Queen fan ever since. I know the true stories of the band, and their albums. So I was aware when the chronology was off, but I understand that sometimes that is necessary in order to include important events. The others I was with like Queen, but are only in their late 20s. They loved it as much as I did.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it was brilliantly acted by Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, and I also thought that Gwilym Lee's portrayal of Brian May was spot on. The rest of the cast also brought in their A game.<br/><br/>There were so many funny moments, touching moments, and most of all, great scenes of the band recording and playing concerts. The songs were well chosen, and the movie flowed at an excellent pace. The more personal moments were done beautifully.<br/><br/>After the film ended, the entire audience applauded, which is very rare indeed where I live. I can't remember the last time I saw that happen.<br/><br/>We happily stuck around for the credits to watch actual video of Queen playing a song. It was truly the best movie-going experience that I've had in a very long time."
"Reynou","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," The Show Must Go On
","Honestly astonishing, Bryan Singer is offering a masterpiece, lead by Rami Malek who succeeded in interpreting the powerful role of Freddie Mercury. The movie describes well the story of the band, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor are not forgotten, they are well interpreted ! We learn more about the life of the egocentric, and sometimes selfish Freddie Mercury; we are also electrified by all the biblical hits of the band ! What a good time at the theater, like if we were at Wembley in 1985 !"
"clumsyclaw1974","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Brilliantly nostalgic
","If you were old enough to remember watching Live Aid live then this film is worth watching just for that. However if you love Queen, loved the 70's & 80's and just want to tap your feet to some great music, be amazed at some inspired casting and chuckle at the dry humour that I would imagine was a huge part of the person Freddie Mercury was then ignore the critics, listen to the real people who have loved this biopic and go and see this film.<br/><br/>In short, I loved it."

"agibbs-24869","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," Like the Band, the critics will get this wrong
","As they say in the movie ""In the court of public opinion it's different"". Yes the critics have a point, but don't let this stop you seeing it. The whole family (11 to 52) loved it. What's not to like with that soundtrack, but it's the actors who steal the show. Mesmerising."
"ApolloBoy109","10","3","4","3 November 2018"," It was like a religious experience
","My lord what a wonderful movie. It struts and amuses and sings, gets into your heart and gets the audience fired up.<br/><br/>Rami Malek becomes a legend and has the power to follow thru with a stunning performance. Best Actor nod, I'm thinking. The Band members, Brian, Roger and John were wonderfully performed. The cast worked well together.<br/><br/>This movie for some unknown reason is getting at lot of flack from critics ... reminds me of the scene in the movie when ""Ray"" doesn't want to play the song Bohemian Rhapsody because he doesn't get it!! I don't think the critics get it.<br/><br/>We fans, we get it. We loved it and I'm goingg back again. See it in Imax format!"
"horribilivisu","9","3","4","3 November 2018"," Great Movie
","Like the critics were unable to recognize the genius of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when it was released, the movie critics are failing to recognize the value of a great movie. Since the beginning of theater the concept of simulacrum is used to bring even divinities to the stage. Rami Malek is certainly not Freddie but it is a perfect simulacrum to convey his spirit and his charisma on the screen: ""When a wise man points at the moon, an idiot looks at his finger""
Of course is the real voice of Freddie singing that made me cry about 6 times during the movie. Absolutely RECOMMENDED."
"sefrafer","9","3","4","3 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody : for the fans, not for the critics apparently.
","Queen is undoubtedly one of the best rock band in history and to comment on a movie about her fame is something really complicated. The critics have been divided, half loves her and the other half hates her and I understand both sides, the movie If it has a lot of potential but if it is poorly developed, the film may fail, even though the film is credited to Bryan Singer. His departure is clearly noticeable, although his departure was a few weeks after finishing the filming. being edited maybe it affects the final production, it has great problems of chronology and that tend to lose meaning in some things, although on the other hand to lighten the issues of Mercury's personal life to see them softer than they were. quite, despite its failures, however as a fan I love every second of the movie despite its mistakes that for a radical fan can be unforgivable in the end you ignore them, because you come to see Queen and you have them, each one of the actors and their interpretations are exalted, Rami Malek is Freddie Mercury of that you have no doubt, his expressions, his movements, the voice when speaking, also Marc Martel does a very good job in equalizing his voice to the sing and that's to applaud, Ben Hardy is Roger Taylor, Joseph Mazzello is John Deacon and Gwilym Lee is undoubtedly Bryan May, Lucy Boynton also does an amazing job being Mary Austin, it shows that in the music work they are sitting very Bryan May and Roger Taylor because certainly something that knows this biographical film is make you want to sing especially in the best concert of all time Live Aid of 1985 makes you go into the scene, in conclusion Bohemian Rhapsody is perhaps not the great biographical film that everyone wanted but if a love letter for all the fans of Queen, if you're looking morbidly see the stories told about your personal life better not bother to see it that you will not find here, what has the formation the band and the motivations that kept them as a family and not just as a band."
"tombruna","2","12","25","19 November 2018"," Music is nice
","A collection of old cliches. No drive, no real drama, no interesting lines nor anything of value. Any plain boring documentary on the band is much more entertaining and has the bonus of being accurate. Sets look artificial, the extras are from a B list movie I could go on, but it just didn't make me care enough.<br/><br/>Music was nice though. Through no fault of the filmmakers."

","Terrible acting, terrible dialog. Felt like i was watching a stage musical, over dramatic acting while delivering dumb and unenspiring dialog is just enfuriating. It seems like the ammount of effects and the quality of the way in which they filmed it has tricked allot of people into liking it. Also, the way with which the music underscorred ""jokes"" or ""punchlines"" was very looney tunes like, and very out of character for a movie like this. Also Rayn malik seems to be freddie a little too much, it felt like i was watching a film in which Rayn Malik fullfills his dream of being Freddie. The characters where very 1 dimensional and lame."

"kof-13050","3","4","6","20 January 2019"," Do not underestimate the spectators!
","I am quite disappointed from this movie.
Firstable the story itself is quite intresting, which is quite favorable for the director. At the moment the movie begun, I was sure of what we will see at the end. I would even say that it underestimates the spectators. The movie tends to explain some details of the life of Freddie in a very artificial and appropriate way, for instance - ""I have a big mouth, my voice cover 4 octaves"", the initial game with the mic stand etc.
We all know that the band insisted to show the peak of the career, but with such an artist like Freddie I feel quite offended of the quality of cinematic art presented there, I would say that the movie rely on the glory of Queen and thats all. Another suspicious scene was when Freddy announced to the group that he has AIDS - they hug him right away. During the 80's there was no that much information for AIDS, so I really doubt that people with families and kids would hug a HIV positive person, no matter what. Freddie, giving a press conference was the only moment when the director used some effects and it was really bad, it can't be compared to what Gaspar Noe could have done with that scene showing that Freddie is high.
Malek tried his best but could not save the whole movie and to be fair, Cohen could handle this role the better.
The make up and the artificial teeth gave a caricature image of the whole character and in some moments it was much close to parody.
And to be honest, Life Aid is not the best moment of Fredfie and Queen, you can see so many people there, but come on, this is Queen, its not enough for Queen.
Lets also not forget that Freddie was intentionally contaminated with AIDS, this topic is not at all in the movie.
We all know that the members of Queen insisted on how to present the story, but its too old, too boring, there is nothing original in it, it is censured, so I really doubt that Freddie would have enjoyed such a view."

","I've read the critic reviews and really, that's just who they are - critics. I doubt very much that they can find enjoyment in much of anything. Although I do think that the film itself has a strange plot development, I found myself in awe of the genius of Queen. And of course, the genius of Rami Malek's exquisite performance. The other actors did a stellar job as well - they perfectly complimented such a drastic performance from Malek, by forefitting overacting and simply just BEING. They were, for me, the silent heroes of the film - you see only the characters, without giving much thought to the actors themselves.
The film felt a little fragmented to me, but the performance in every aspect, was a wonderful tribute not only to Queen and to Freddie, but to the eccentric, and the misfits.
Oh and the music is of course, just delightful."

"kaptenvideo-89875","9","4","6","7 December 2018"," We are the champignons! A lot!
","Ah... ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". A movie about legendary and flamboyant rock group Queen and its even more legendary and flamboyant lead singer Freddie Mercury. Color me excited!<br/><br/>Queen is one of the best bands that I know of but almost never listen (I don't even know why not). And ""Mr Robot's"" quirky leading man Rami Malek as rock god is irresistible, just based on trailer alone.<br/><br/>There's somebody about his fragile body, rodent-like (or maybe even vampire-like) face and mysterious gaze that screams ""genius casting"".<br/><br/>It is said that when Malek was contacted about playing Mercury, he had only a casual knowledge of Queen. To become the rock god, he had to work many intense sessions with a movement coach (as well as learn to talk with prosthetic teeth). And the result just blew me away. A total transformation worthy of Oscar the next February.<br/><br/>Malek seems so haunted and soulful, and yet has such a strong physical presence on screen, that I totally buy him as a performer who just mesmerized the audiences around the world.<br/><br/>Queen fans and others who know stuff have criticized the authors' decisions to change a number of facts about the band's history.<br/><br/>I, on the other hand, knew little about it, and was able to concentrate on the actual movie. And you know what? ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is an absolute joy, a triumphant example of what musical or music-filled movies can be! I loved it!<br/><br/>The screenplay is not perfect - in addition to errors mentioned above, the story just rushes through the many years and key events that made Queen and Mercury what they were.<br/><br/>As a result, some of the things may seem strange if one is not familiar with the history, for example Mercury's sudden lust for men soon after finding the love of his life with a woman, or how he was so confident about his performing style already the first time on stage with Queen.<br/><br/>But all these little niggles are compensated by the awesome atmosphere the movie has. Everything about it feels big and immediate - like an epic should - and the performing scenes really immerse the audience with their power and energy.<br/><br/>Which owes a lot to Malek's great acting work, of course. He doesn't impersonate Mercury, he is him! It's probably even better than having attended the concerts in person - the physical closeness and the best viewing angles you can ask for.<br/><br/>And despite rushing through the story, there's still somehow always enough room for characters and what they live through. You can see total commitment from all involved, these are not just characters saying stuff to move the story along. Everybody feels like a real person.<br/><br/>In addition to Malek, there's another total transformation by a famous actor. Did you notice Mike Myers? He is truly a human chameleon, he is.<br/><br/>By the way, the famous comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (""Borat"", ""Bruno"", ""Ali G"" etc.) was once considered to play Freddie but Queen's Brian May and Roger Taylor were seriously against it, and also had a final say.<br/><br/>They deemed him not serious enough to do the part. But still... would have loved to see Cohen's version too. He's also known for method acting (of sorts) which give him a potential to do a good job embodying this unique rock god.<br/><br/>Most of the director Bryan Singer's 11 movies have been noteworthy for some reason or other but I consider ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" his most glorious achievement to date.<br/><br/>Which is easy for me to say because most of his past works are superhero movies - a genre I have zero entusiasm for. But ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Apt Pupil"", and ""Valkyrie"" are cool too, no doubt about that!<br/><br/>Having written that, it should be noted that Singer was fired before completing the work, due to his clashing with cast and crew, and erratic behavior which saw him routinely showing up late to set or disappearing altogether.<br/><br/>So it may not even be thanks to him that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is such a fine movie as it is! Dexter Fletcher directed the last 16 days of filming and oversaw post-production. And he is currently busy with Elton John's biographical movie too!<br/><br/>We recently also had a chance to see ""A Star Is Born"", another great movie filled with music, great concert scenes and performances to die for. But I dare to say that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was even a bigger thrill for me altogether.<br/><br/>Both are amazing movies, of course, but ""Bohemian"" has Queen's music which stands a test of time. ""A Star Is Born's"" music, on the other hand, is more derivative and works best only in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>Which is fine too. But... you know, just saying."

It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it has everything one could wish for and more, digging from the rich selection of Queen tracks to accompany the magnificent acting.<br/><br/>The only way I could imagine not to recommend it would be if you'd absolutely hate Queen. If you think Queen is 'meh', definitely go, you'll love them afterwards. Freaking Bohemian Rhapsody gets stuck in your brain."
"preppy-3","8","4","6","6 December 2018"," Great but a little too long
","Movie about Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) lead singer of Queen. It follows him from 1970 to 1985 and how he became part of Queen till his tragic death in 1991 of AIDS.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a great movie. It's well-directed by Bryan Singer and has almost all of the bands best songs. Also Malek is good as Mercury. He sounds, looks and acts like him. Also it doesn't ignore the fact that Mercury was gay. However it's just too damn long. It runs 135 minutes and could have easily run at 120 minutes. Sequences go on far too long and it gets dull. Still it IS worth seeing.<br/><br/>Malek also won numerous awards (including the Academy Award) for his performance. As I said he's great but I don't think he's that great."

"rbrb","10","4","6","28 November 2018"," Celebrate Musical Genius!
","This is the best movie I have seen this year and amongst the best ever.<br/><br/>It is compelling throughout with super music and convincing believable players all inspired by real events.<br/><br/>The show-stopping stand out performance comes from Rami Malik who deserves a clutch of awards as does the film itself and everyone associated with it.<br/><br/>Some professional critics and others have for what ever reason tried to be critical of this movie but once again they are totally wrong and the public ticket sales confirms the quality of the movie.
If some of the seedier aspects of the true events are not fully shown then need to remember that the central focus of this movie is the music.<br/><br/>Freddy Mercury was the lead singer of the band Queen and the film shows how the band and their music evolved and at the same time explains the life and demise of the bands principal artist at a time when AIDs began its' cruel epidemic.<br/><br/>This picture is a celebration of the music and artistry of genius musicians and showmanship and thankfully does not dwell so much on the plague of AIDs but when the movie does focus on that subject, it does so with devastating effect.<br/><br/>There is one scene When Freddy Mercury is leaving the AIDs clinic and a fellow suffering has a ever so brief exchange with him: that is heart-breaking.
Another scene when Freddy tell his band members:
""I've got it"", and they are clueless as to what he is talking about. That sadly sums up the previous apathetic attitude of the straight world to gay issues.<br/><br/>
A lot of the public will of been perplexed with Freddy's apparent sexual preferences and the woman in his life. The movie unravels and explains it. Because of his ethnic background and the pressures on him he needed to be straight or believe that he was; or if not then the most he could do was to claim bisexuality.
He was of course always a gay even though Freddy resisted for a lot of his life that realization.<br/><br/>Adding to the magical music and fine acting is a delightfully amusing but insightful script and with wonderful presentation and production I can award:<br/><br/>
10/10."

Gosh, what an entertaining film. I mean, not going to lie, any film featuring an extensive Queen soundtrack is usually already gonna get a bump up in my book. (ala ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Highlander"") So, a biopic about Freddie Mercury already has an advantage with me. But then go out of your way to add a great story with a fantastic cast and solid direction that is both slick and stylistic and you got a winner. Rami Malek deserves an Oscar nomination, period. The man literally transforms into Mercury. Go watch any retro behind the scenes clips of the real man and you can see for yourself. He managed to deliver Freddie's heightened personality and his more emotional behind the scenes moments, namely his fight with his sexual desires between the woman he loves and the men he also can't seem to stay away from either. The rest of the cast delivered as well. I particularly enjoyed Mike Myers as a music executive that isn't all that fond of Queen's efforts to break from traditional formulas. Bryan Singer and Dexter Fletcher both deliver a well directed movie that thankfully doesn't feel like the mess that ""Justice League"" was when it's original director had to jump ship. Not only is it sheer entertainment, but there are legit moments that had me tearing up a bit. If a movie can do that, then it is REALLY doing a good job. I think critics are just bunch of sour pusses with this one. 55% on Rotten Tomatoes? Tell that the 95% of the audience that loved it. The only way I could see someone not a least enjoying this movie is if they just don't like Queen in the first place. Which, if that is the case, you probably got other issues to worry about honestly. I do think the movie could have gone deeper into Freddie's life with his family. Actually, it could gone deeper with many things. But, nothing about the movie feels chopped out. Go see it! On the biggest screen if possible because the Live Aid concert is more than worth it the extra cost."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic about the iconic rock band Queen, consisting of Freddie Mercury(Rami Malek), Brian May(Gwilym Lee), Roger Taylor(Ben Hardy) & John Deacon(Joseph Mazzello). It showcases the ups & downs of the band, leading up to their unforgettable performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is an epic film. Director Bryan Singer has given us a masterpiece that all Queen fans will dance to & singalong with. All the portrayals of Queen's various onstage performances over the years, are impeccable. There are various feel-good & emotional moments as well, apart from the legendary music from Queen. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Rami Malek gives us the best performance of his career, as Freddie Mercury. Malek steals the show in every scene he's in, portraying all of Freddie's mannerisms flawlessly. Lucy Boynton is spectacular as Mary Austin. Gwilym Lee is superb as Brian May. Ben Hardy is outstanding as Roger Taylor. Joseph Mazzello is brilliant as John Deacon. Aidan Gillen is great as John Reid. Allen Leech is excellent as Paul Prenter. Tom Hollander is amazing as Jim Beach. Mike Myers & Aaron McClusker are awesome as Ray Foster & Jim Hutton, respectively. Meneka Das, Ace Bhatti & Priya Blackburn are incredible as Jer Bulsara, Bomi Bulsara & Kashmira Bulsara, respectively. Bohemian Rhapsody is a must watch, especially on the big screen.

So Gwilym Lee as Guitarist Brian May, he looks and sounds like him to the point I thought it really was Brian May playing himself. And everybody else does is pretty good. So is the music, this film I believe will make new fans of Queen. The movie shows how success changes you a little.

Rami Malek is superb as Freddy Mercury and has every possibility for an Oscar nod or even win. Brian, Roger and John also carry their roles with breathless ease. Whether the story is fact or fiction almost becomes irrelevant as you are taken in this emotional rollercoaster as Freddy struggles internally with his love of his life vs his bisexuality. This is where Rami excels in his performance. Finally the music, its a queen dream on many levels. The scene at Wembley has to be worth the entry fee alone.

A movie that turns the viewer inside out and which recalls for us a beautiful and profound Freddie until the last moment. A well-done biopic, with no emphasis on the tabloid aspects, but on complexity of Freddie's personality, beyond all the appearances. The movie ended in the note which was supposed to be, in a climax of Queen's performance, leaving an image of a Freddie full of energy and satisfied by the way things carry on. We all know what's the turmoil he faced in his life till the end, but even in the last moments of his life he continued working and be defined by his music. As final words, I just want to point out that on my behalf the Oscar goes to Rami Malek. Well done, young talented actor!"
"tonyd-43338","10","4","6","7 November 2018"," Critics just don't get.
","Ok, the first time I heard Bohemian Rhapsody was in the summer of '76. I've been a Queen super fan since. Yes there are some chronological inconsistencies, but all of the events did occur. I'm not sure if critics understand that the film tells a story. If this were a sheer documentary film, then the events of Queen and Freddie's history would have been recounted exactly as they occurred, and the film would have been rather boring and educational.
Fundamentally the intent of the film is to entertain, tell a fact based story(more or less) and introduce an entirely new generation to the band, the members, the music and the social landscape of the time. If you want to know the all the details of Freddie's lovers you are better off consulting the micro fiche at your local library (tongue planted firmly in cheek) for tabloid news from the 80's.
The film delivers in spades, it entertains, it touches you, captures your imagination and generally makes you feel good. I took the film in at a 10:40 PM IMAX screening with my 23 year old son and 13 year old daughter. Each of them had interesting perspectives on the movie about real music, passion fighting for your belief and society.
Ok, I'm rambling. Queen fans, music fans unite. Watch this film, take it in, be entertained. Critics, don't over analyze look for fault in the script's simplicity or over analyze events put into the movie to enhance the story telling and or dramatic effect. Take it for what it is and what is meant to be. ENTERTAINING!!!!"

I remember saying that I doubt Rami Malek's performance would be a ""Gary Oldman-playing-Churchill great""
I STAND CORRECTED!
It was indeed that great! I bloody cried and claped and sang! Everyone in the theater did! It truly was an amazing performance!
I have to say, it's been a while since a movie managed to touch me that way - equally accurate and respectful to the legend of this great man.
One thing I've come to realize is that Queen's songs are still popular and loved - everyone even the youngest knew and sang their songs, in a non-English speaking country, I might add!
And that I think is the true measure of Queen's greatness and Freddie's in particular."

The movie had flaws if you want to nitpick, but it's quite entertaining. Every character felt real and fleshed out, and you couldn't help but feel for Freddie Mercury.

"Gpanther67","8","4","6","5 November 2018"," Despite some streatching the truth, this is a solid, entertaining biopic!!!
","Cinema has many bio pics about people from all walks of life; famous, infamous and some even legendary. Their subjects pull us into theaters to learn more about them and we hope that their story will be as entertaining as it is enlightening. The newest biography to hit screens is about the band Queen and their lead singer Freddie Mercury, as legendary as they come in rock music.
The film shows us the band's early years as they formed when guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor lost their lead singer/bassist and was approached by a young singer named Farrokh Bulsara. He took the nickname Freddie and would change his last name to Mercury. After recruiting bassist John Deacon, the foursome would call their group Queen and become one of the most innovative and creative in rock. Their live performances were sellouts mainly for Mercury's flamboyant and theatrical style as well as his superior vocals. In his early days his is involved with a woman named Mary Austin, a woman he loves dearly but his true sexual preferences would take over and as he is touring Mercury would secretly have sex with men until he is confronted by Austin who breaks up with Mercury but remains close friends with him. Like many groups, Queen had their ups and downs. The film highlights some of these moments culminating with their greatest performance, a performance that many consider the greatest in music history.
For fans of the band this is a must see, you'll probably recognize that the film does take some liberties with Mercury and Queen's story but it is able to keep the story moving and entertaining in a cohesive order. At the forefront is Rami Malek's performance which is impressive. He delivers Mercury's presence in the film's many stage performances as well as his personal mannerisms we have seen in interviews. Although most of the singing is past recordings of Mercury, you have to forgive that Malek couldn't duplicate his immortal range. As far as the rest of the band, it proves to be one of the film's shortcomings due to a drab, almost ordinary presence by the rest of the group. It almost seems they purposely didn't want to upstage Malek by making them too likable or personable, but in the scene in where Mercury announces that he is going solo is where they shine and come alive for the rest of the film, so this criticism doesn't go through the whole movie. What the move does hold is perhaps one of the greatest in-jokes in the history of film with Mike Myers as a record executive telling the band that their groundbreaking hit ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" isn't the type of song teenage boys will listen to in their cars banging their heads along with. It didn't hit me of the irony of Myers' role in the film until he says this line. If you don't get it I won't explain the brilliance of it, you'll have to get it yourself. Much is being made of the lack of Mercury's gay lifestyle, instead it shines more on his relationship with Austin. I think the balance was justified because she was truly his best friend and love of his life. There are many scenes of him with men. Perhaps it's the fact that the most negative influence on him in the film is from a gay man that has upset some. It does share a glimpse of his relationship with Jim Hutton, who was his partner the final years of his life. Like many bio pics it does take liberties with actual events and timing; for example the rousing Live Aid performance is built up by a few untruths like Mercury discovering he has AIDS before the concert (most accounts have him finding out in late 1986) or that the band hadn't played together in years before Live Aid because they had broken up (in reality they were just coming off of a tour to promote their newest album). What was true was the band slipped in popularity in the states and they weren't probably the most anticipated performances of the lineups from either the US or England concerts. What the film does deliver, and deliver well was the reception they got from the Wembley crowd. Although it doesn't recreate the entire 20-minute set, it certainly hits the highlights from their opening ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Radio Gaga"" in which they had 72,000 people clapping in unison with the song or swaying together during ""We Are the Champions"". It's truly one of the most emotional moments of the film and easy to see why it is called one of the most important moments in music history.
Its not perfect and its not the best of the year but thanks to Malek's strong performance and its interesting central figures, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a film well worth seeing. It's a celebration of a great band and if your not a big fan of theirs you might come out of the theater as one thanks to a great ending."

","I graduated high school in 1980.

As a 55 year older that enjoys a glass of wine during movies (we have a dine in theater in our hood) I usually be-line it to the restroom at least once per movie and ask the wife what I missed. Not this movie. What I did do was run home and watch Queen's Live Aid Performance (68,001,176th).<br/><br/>They got this BioPic pretty dang right on. I will see it again and buy the DVD! RIP Freddie!

I LOVE the fact that Brian May, Roger and Peter Freestone were involved in making this movie.<br/><br/>To me, this makes this movie more genuine than anything. It is just like another original Queen thing to me. This movie Freddie Mercury would approve. He definitely wouldn't approve the movie that was all about his private life.<br/><br/>The people that were involved into this movie makes the movie original despite some different things, which I already knew about months before the release! Listen to Peter Freestone speaking about making this movie! He is one of Freddies closest friends, such a warm and loving person and explains Freddies life in details with such love and respect for him.<br/><br/>I've listened to his speech months before the movie release and knew that this was not going to be a documentary. I knew it was not going to be all accurate.
His closest friends and fans knew about Freddie's wish to keep private things private. And that he wanted to be remembered for his creative accomplishments. Freddie never wanted to become a tabloid freak and I am so happy that this movie RESPECTS FREDDIE'S DIGNITY and that it is NOT made for mocking VOYEURS like Sacha Baron Cohen and critics, who now say that they would like to have movie about cocaine parties and gay orgies. I'm 100% sure that if this would be this kind of R-rated movie, the same critics would rip it apart as well. Freddie Mercury's movie would be ripped apart by critics either way. BUT REGULAR PEOPLE, FANS AND MISFITS LOVE IT ALL ABOUT BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.<br/><br/>(I was actually a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, but than I saw him in a whole new bad light after he made that evil remarks about the members of Queen that made so many headlines and triggered so many critic quotes... I believe his future movie career could also suffer a bit because of these remarks - It was like he's spitting in his own ball. )"

","Love, love, love this movie! As a massive Queen fan from the early 70's I can say that although some of the things in the movie were incorrect or out of synch with the real time line of the band - Hollywood changes probably - it was still an awesome movie. Rami Malek plays a wonderful Freddie and at times I had to look twice as he was so like him in certain scenes it was uncanny. If he doesn't win an academy award for his portrayal I would be very surprised! The rest of the cast were very believable in their roles and the likenesses to their real life characters was at times simply amazing. I left the movie feeling elated and extremely emotional at the same time that such an amazing talent such as Freddie is no longer with us. I've seen it twice in less than a week and I will probably see it again very soon!"

","Can a movie like this have spoilers? It's not like we don't know what happened to Freddie and Queen.<br/><br/>I will make this review short. I enjoyed it until I read about the BIG LIE of this movie. Freddie did not find out about him having Aids until 2 years after Live Aid. They made it look like they got back together after he found out he had Aids. They also made it look like he was struggling through rehearsals for Live Aid with Aids. Then at the Actual Live Aid Performance they made it seem like he pushed himself beyond his deadly disease and delivered an inspiring performance as he was dying. ALL THIS WAS A LIE. I told people after I saw this movie about that Live Aid performance and it was all inaccurate.<br/><br/>After hearing all that I wonder what else wasn't true. And if you question what you see as being real or not than what really is the point? Now I see the whole movie as a lie. I was hoping for an history lesson about Queen and Mercury. It was not that.<br/><br/>There were some slow points and Freddie was definitely a flawed person. So was Roger Taylor, but Brian May and John Deacon came across as saints. I know this in not totally accurate either.<br/><br/>Some people also complain that there was not more early life story to Freddie and nothing after Live Aid. Freddie died 6 years after that performance..I was ok with that I did not need to see him die. The movie starts up when Freddie joins Queen.<br/><br/>So in the end, sad that this movie was not as true as I had hoped. Other than that the performances were amazing. The guy who played Brian May was incredible...looked just like him. John Deacon also. All four guys had the mannerisms nailed."

"Horst_In_Translation","10","7","13","11 December 2018"," Malek's Mercury is a landslide
","Okay here we have ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and these 2 hours and 15 minutes are from what I have seen so far the best film of 2018 and chances are high it will stay that way. Mamma Mia 2 wasn't bad either, but I really don't understand why everybody is talking about the sub-par ""A Star is Born"" as the defining music film of the year when clearly this one we got here is it. I am glad to see it receives a great deal of awards recognition these days, even if sadly the critics don't like it as much, but still hopes are high Rami Malek gets in at the Oscars too and I think he may even have an outside shot at the win. Best Actor seems very open this year and he is in every scene of these over 2 hours and carries the film basically alone on his shoulders. I am a bit surprised how much I liked Malek. I was not sure initially knowing him from other projects if he is the right choice for the lead here, but he really won me over 100% and not just because of his ethnical background. Shame on me for not knowing Mercury was of Parsi origin. The other strong aspects here besides Malek are the music of course and also the script/story. You really get to know the Queen frontman in this film. For example I did not know about his strict father or that he was really married to a woman before discovering his true sexuality. There is one scene when Mercury confesses to his wife that he thinks he is bi not to hurt her, but she responds clearly that he is gay. That stayed in the mind.<br/><br/>The longer the film goes, the more it moves towards its destination: the Queen performance during Live Aid in the mid-80s. This was kept away from Mercury from his (false) friend for quite a while, but eventually with the help of his former wife, Mercury makes the right decision to bond with his former band members again and leave those that don't want the best for him, the vultures and leeches, another fine quote by Mercury when he says farewell to the man who tore him down. But there's many other interesting characters like the band manager who seemingly wants the best for Mercury and his career and also suggests he should leave his band members, but he is not a villain like the lover he stays with until almost the end. Or of course the record producer played by the almost unrecognizable Mike Myers (Austin Powers) who says Queen will never be big if they release Bohemian Rhapsody as a single. And we see him again towards the end when Queen are at the peak of their popularity right during Live Aid. The latter is probably the biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the film, but there are also more serious references like about H.I.V. slowly killing Mercury and it seems he knows it with the ""what if he does not have that much time left"" comment. But still, it is all in the filmmaker's mind and also good for the audience that this is never intended to become a sob story at all. ""Show must go on"" is the best example and we have Mercury talk to his band members that he does not want to waste time with getting pity or being sad for himself, but instead invest everything he has left into the music to make his heritage as spectacular as possible. And boy did he succeed with that.<br/><br/>Okay I mentioned Bohemian Rhapsody and Show must go on already, but there are other great hits included in here, some more significant and longer, some less significant and shorter. I Want To Break Free, Under Pressure, Radio Gaga, We Are The Champions, We Will Rock You, Love of my Life, Somebody to Love and so on. These are just a few and even if you are not a great Queen fan, you have come across all these tunes at one point in your life or another and you will recognize them immediately while perhaps also starting to hum the melody for yourself. I would not call myself an expert on Queen or Mercury, so I listened to some of their most known in the days/weeks before watching the movie and I think it was a good idea to get me in the mood and enjoy the film as much as I wanted to. And I told you earlier how I really really loved it. I think they did everything right here, showing us the greatness of Queen, but also how talent-wise and entertainment-wise Mercury was the absolute standout from them, also with his scene early on when he wants to become a lead singer and sings to prove himself, but in terms of the band also when we hear him say they are all legends towards the end. This film will really make you curious about the actual Live Aid performance by Queen and you should go for it. It is on Youtube and runs for over 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Also this is not a film about gay rights or anything. It is a character study and a whole lot about music too of course, so don't be scared of any kind of political messages really being shoved in your face. Like I said before, experienced director Bryan Singer did everything right here and his two Oscar-nominated writers Morgan and McCarten add their fair share too and show us their experience in coming up with one of the best screenplays of the 2010s. And the ""doing right"" also includes the casting of Rami Malek for the lead. Perhaps many movie-goers who don't watch small screen series will not know him or Mr.Robot and the rest of the cast does not include any big names either (except Myers perhaps), so maybe the cast will not lure millions of viewers into theaters, but the subject should and I think it did. I think this film is an absolute must-see from any perspective. I am writing this as somebody who sadly (or luckily?) is too young to remember Queen and Mercury from back when they were really big, so maybe those who do remember find some flaws with the film, but then I guess I'm lucky that I didn't because the consequence is that these were the best over 2 hours I've had at a theater in a long time. Also from a neutral less Queen-focused perspective, the film includes all you want to see in a music-based movie, great songs, struggles with band members and managers and the press, popularity getting to your head, the impact of time and why Queen was successful when they were successful in the 1980s in terms of the (then) contemporary state of society and a lot more. So in short, this one gets a perfect rating from me and I still find it strange to see Malek/Mercury without the trademark mustache from his later years. I highly highly recommend seeing this film, preferrably on the big screen. Do not miss out."
"Scarefish","3","9","18","28 November 2018"," Stone Cold Lazy
","I'm going to be frank, I did not like Bohemian Rhapsody. The story writes itself, and that's part of the problem. There is very little effort put in and it feels like the director skimmed Freddy Mercury's Wikipedia page and whipped this film together as a cheap cash-grab on the legacy which Freddy made for himself with little care on providing a deep, respectful, and meaningful biopic on the legend of Queen.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is its blatant disingenuous nature, opting for Hollywood cliches over either fact-based story-telling or fantastical surreal execution. What results is a muddled mess which is neither true to life nor outrageous enough to capture the spirit of Freddy Mercury at any point, instead opting for a middle-ground that takes the shortcomings of both approaches with dull, drawn out bits of melodrama which never goes deeper than surface-level and moments of artistic liberty with about as much artism as Freddy the Hedgehog and as much liberty as North Korea. I find myself disgusted knowing that Sacha Baron Cohen's R-rated version of the film would have been much more interesting than what I'd watched, and I expressed the same concerns over Cohen's ideas that the surviving band members did. This film is so safe and laid back and set on preserving Freddy's image that it makes AIDS seem better than a common cold, and is filled with numerous sex scenes ripped straight from daytime television. To say that the film was sanitized would be an understatement; this film is about as uncomfortable with its homoerotic subject matter as Catholic priests are with adult women. The scene of Another One Bites the Dust was so dated in its portrayal of homoeroticism that I thought the movie should have been called Freddy Goes to Hollywood. With its PG-13 rating, there certainly could have been more done in terms of the sexuality, and especially given the Freddy's AIDS there certainly should have been much more touched on here and it should have been a bigger focus rather than the fluffy melodrama before this point. If you're going to do a film about a legend, it deserves only the best, deepest, most sincere telling one can give, especially when this film goes on to portray Freddy as a perfectionist and then hands the directorial duties over to Bryan Singer, director of mediocre, soulless, sub-par blockbusters such as X-Men: Apocalypse and Jack the Giant Slayer. If this film wanted to be a great one, it should have been more like Walk the Line, a serious and gritty film about the lives of those in the band, or it should have been Whiplash, a crazy wild ride that sacrifices realism in favor of bashing you over the head with stupid, stylish, vacuous, guilty-pleasure no-holds-barred entertainment.<br/><br/>Rami Malek did an excellent job as Freddy Mercury, and the interactions between he and the bandmates are some of the only bits of livelihood in this otherwise paint-by-numbers Hollywood film. Though much of the melodrama was overlong and petty in the grand scheme of things, the actors did a fine job bringing scenes to life with some charm despite lackluster pacing and proper editing (Perhaps the filmmakers were running out of tape and had to make do with a single cut.). Malek brings an energy to Mercury that is miserably not met by any other element of the filmmaking process, and the creative overdubbing from multiple voices to mimic Mercury's is practically seamless and renders the aspects of the film outside of musical performances utterly trite in comparison, as I found myself struggling to stay invested in the in-between parts.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is decent, but lacking a few staples in Queen's career. Notable exclusions are Stone Cold Crazy, Death on Two Legs, Bicycle Race, I Want It All, and One Vision, which are each among Queen's greatest tracks. Instead, we get two versions of Bohemian Rhapsody, Keep Yourself Alive, and The Show Must Go On. This could have easily been remedied with more focus on the music rather than petty infighting with the band, allowing more songs in the movie, and with less redundancy in the film itself regarding tracks which appear more than once. There is also a grave missed opportunity to portray David Bowie performing Under Pressure with Queen, which would have been incredible especially given Bowie's recent death and comparable legendary status as a musician. Instead, Bowie receives a single passing mention in the film and not a single legendary artist mentioned are shown performing (eg. Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, or even REO Speedwagon who hardly have much of a legacy to tarnish). Several songs are even out of order in the film, such as the second version of Seven Seas of Rhye, Fat Bottomed Girls, and Another One Bites the Dust.<br/><br/>The inaccuracies are plentiful and too numerous and too important to ignore, especially given the pseudo-factual presentation of the film. Much creative liberty taken throughout the film's plot destroy the film's credibility throughout. In reality, Freddy discovered his condition after the Live Aid concert, and even the concert itself was no matter of difficulty as the band hadn't broken up, and Freddy's solo project was not a problem for the band, and Queen was not squeezed into Live Aid last minute as the film portrays, and Freddy did not give an emotional speech about his AIDS just prior to the performance, as all of these contrivances were added to appeal to the generic Hollywood drama formula. Even the formulation of the band is gratuitously simplified and given that boring ol' Hollywood sheen, and thus literally every element of the film must be brought into question as I truly believe at this point that not a single moment in this film is true to real life. Is this the real life? No. It's just fantasy, and the true shame is that it's not even a self-aware way, which would make such liberties borderline acceptable.<br/><br/>If you want a great biopic about a legendary musician, watch Walk the Line, and if you're not interested in Johnny Cash then there's certainly nothing worth watching I suppose. If you liked this film, you're certainly allowed to, but many people I've seen praising this film simply love the band Queen and the soundtrack of the film and they overlook the unforgivable shortcomings of this shamefully lackluster motion picture. If you insist on bringing your family to this, you'll have to Tie Your Mother Down, otherwise she'll be leaving in offense as she grew up with Queen and truly cares about the legacy this film abysmally fails to tell."
"thechair","4","21","51","26 October 2018"," Outside the music, eye-rollingly bad
","Apart from the soundtrack, which is of course excellent, this was terribly hum-drum. Malik was distracting and the rest of the cast straight out of the Grange Hill school of acting, but that was perhaps because the laughably clunky band-supervised (co-producers) script was so utterly bland and lacking in even a trace of originality. Still, the songs are good and the audience I was in cheered at the end (and not because it was the end like me, I don't think) so if you're a mega mega fan (I'm just a lowly fan) of the band then maybe you'll cheer too."

","This is my first time I writing a comment. I watch this movie first show on a local cinema. The acting of Rami Malek is marvelous. I am big fan of Queen. I like to write here what really happened to me for watching this movie. Few weeks before its release I am disappointed that no cinema in Pakistan show's Bohemian Rhapsody. Few days before I come across a facebook page a cinema near my shop (where I running my own business) showing Bohemian Rhapsody on Friday. I so happy after see this news finally watch this movie on the cinema. A day before I discuses with my friend on the phone that tomorrow I am going to watch this movie he said to me that there is strike going in the country so you are not able to see this movie tomorrow. So I told him that whatever happened I am going to watch this movie. The next day (Friday) I check my cinema facebook page again they cancel the two earlier shows of other movie due to law and order situation. but Bohemian Rhapsody show which is on 5.00 pm is not canceled . So I went to the cinema bought the ticket sit's in the hall . I surprise after few minutes I check my right , left, front and behind only me in hall and entire hall is empty. Movie starts right on time after half 'n hour I again check the hall I am surprise nobody there entire hall is empty. It's strange for me that I am only one person watching this movie and it is the first show of the movie. So really enjoy this movie. I give full credit to the management of the cinema allow me to watch entire movie. After the movie end I went back to my shop I am on the road suddenly my cousin phone me and say's where are you? I told him I am going back to open my shop after watching the movie he surprise and said that do you know what happened ? I told him no I watching the movie. He told me a religious leader is murder and there law and order situation in city (Rawalpindi Punjab) don't open the shop go home immediately it is risky to be on the road . So I take a cab went to my home. Reaching the home I realized that I take a huge risk to watch this anything can happened to me. In our country in these kind of situation anything could happened. But as a fan of Queen it is worth to take a risk."

However, I wasn't expecting the film to end when it did and I feel the end of his life was glossed over because of it.<br/><br/>The music was of course fantastic and there's plenty of moments where this sweeps you away. The place they used 'Who Wants To Live Forever' was very poor for me though, as it implied it was written for a completely different reason to the one it actually was.<br/><br/>The performances of the main four actors were generally excellent; Rami Malek played Freddie particularly well.<br/><br/>So overall, as a cinema goer a great night out.

The story was all over the place, not sure what it wanted to tell the viewer as its filled with mainly annoying sassy moments with highs and lows with no real meaning, symbolism, plot direction, etc.. it's supposed to tell the story of the infamous band queen but instead feels more like a look into egotistical behaviour.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
There were lots of great shots and transitions strewn throughout this film and I really enjoyed the quality of the production. However a lot of scenes were splayed randomly but that's more to do with plot than anything.<br/><br/>Acting:
Okay, okay. I've heard everyone say what a good job rami malek did of portraying Freddie, but I disagree. The prostectic teeth they had in looked way over the top and made his speech very muddy. He also acted in a way where you just wanted to strangle him the whole time.. no matter how Freddie was I just dont understand in a movie all about how great a person and band was that you just make the viewer hate the protagonist so much.. I mean he is a damn right all the way to the end. Drug addict, cheater, betrayer, bossy, egotistical and the list goes on.<br/><br/>Overall:
I wouldnt reccomend this film at all unless your a die hard queen fan, and dont mind messy films. The redeeming factor in this film is how good and cool the concerts and song design are. But that's about it and you can just watch those scenes on YouTube and save yourself a couple of hours."
"gameraz10742","4","4","7","10 August 2019"," Overrated
","Missing loads of thing about Freddie with no scenes of his childhood there is no character development and the movie rushes through the story so much dates wrong they said Freddie got aids on 1985 when it was 1987 and I would like to see what happened after live aid. If this movie was 3 hours long I would have liked it more the acting is good though"
"dtrobb","5","4","7","29 July 2019"," Just Can't Get Behind The Hype For Bohemian Rhapsody
","Love Queen. Many, many terrific, iconic songs. One of the best bands of all time. Problems with this movie resulting in 5 star rating:<br/><br/>1. Rami Malek's (Freddie) teeth and wig. When Freddie is on screen, which is almost every shot, I cannot take my eyes off his mouth/teeth and his wig (in the first half of the film). A lot has been written about the meticulous attention and remarkable teeth prosthetic for Malek. I'm not seeing it. Thought it was way overboard. Cartoonish. Watch a real Freddie Mercury interview. He did have protruding buck teeth. Not like portrayed in the movie. Not close. The wigs? Absurd.<br/><br/>2 The opening scenes over the credits, I think, are supposed to showcase how much Rami is able to imitate Mercury's walk/strut. And, by extension, you'll see how much Rami has become Freddie. No. Again, not feeling it. At no point in the movie did I think I'm watching Freddie Mercury, not an actor.<br/><br/>3. Every scene with Freddie's parents was embarrassing in its stressing of their ethnicity. Not believable. In fact, insultingly stereotypical.<br/><br/>4. Finally, the closing scene, last 15 minutes or so of the film. The music portion was spot on, perfect, remarkable, super moving. However, the cutaways to the side of the stage where Freddie's friends were goofily watching brought you back to the fact this is a movie. And these are actors. Ruined the realistic effect."

Don't believe the Hype!"
"kiekeo","4","4","7","15 March 2019"," Very overrated
","I love Queen but damn, I was very disappointed with this one, I feel like many people only really liked the film because it was about Queen, and maybe gave them a bit of a feeling of superiority or somewhat of nostalgia that they got from being a fan of Queen. This movie was ok at best, definitely not deserving of an 8.1/10 though..."
"Roobin3358","3","4","7","28 February 2019"," Most generic biopic I've Seen
","The acting is great by Eami Makek but that is the only redeemable quality of this generic rock film. From any filmmaking perspective this film fails. Has the odd feeling of being cheaply made, especially during an early montage scene of Queen touring America where it appears that they are on the same stage wearing the same clothes shouting out different cities- ""Thank You New Orleans!"" Thank you Portland!"" I honestly thought this whole sequence might have been filmed in an afternoon. Not even sure they're actually in front of an audience at any point during this nonsensical thing.
Freddie Mercury is the only band member given a personality. The other members just wander around and play basic character types- mostly just being annoyed by Mercury's antics. It's easy to see why the living members of Queen authorized this- the film does nothing but adore its' subjects and the only member of the band under any scrutiny is not around to defend himself.
It's really bad."
"drali-87181","6","4","7","9 February 2019"," Could have been masterpiece
","I saw this movie with so much hype and really was disappointed . The story of Queen is v impressive but few moments need more details and emotions which could have been done but the story was made in a rush . Dialogues could have been better especially in few scenes like the breakup between Freddie and Mary & the band breakup then reunion . It was like when the scene was about to be created it suddenly ends . The highlight of the movie is excellent acting by Rami Malek . He s done awesome job but average direction and weak dialogues faded what could have been oscar winner . Overall good movie and can be recomended but not excellent ."
"horsebeaverfoxman","3","4","7","31 January 2019"," A marshmallow sandwich between two slices of white bread
","Mythical heroes are hard to make movies about, especially rock 'n' roll stars. After all, how can a wild, prolific celebrity like Freddie Mercury possibly be brought down to Earth with the rest of us?<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" tries to humanize him, and it affords Rami Malek plenty of showboating in the role. If for nothing else, it's a movie that's in love with its subject. The rags-to-razzmatazz Queen biopic worships the ground Freddie walks on with a devotion that borders on fetishistic. Hell, sometimes it just makes Freddie into Rock 'N' Roll Jesus. (A pivotal scene in the third act finds Freddie confiding a secret to his bandmates inside a church, as if they're his feather duster-haired disciples.)<br/><br/>The original director, the troubling Bryan Singer, abruptly left the project, and how much of the film he completed before dropping out is unclear. Yet his fingerprints are all over ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" The concert scenes - and it feels like there are hundreds - have all the coldness, sterility and grandiloquence of one of his ""X-Men"" films. Like the rest of the movie, they're edited within an inch of their lives and too often confuse blinding backlights for dramatic heft.<br/><br/>The movie tracks Freddie's rise, as well as the band's, in a blurry, relentless cavalcade of dramatic arguments and shows. Freddie, in his 20s and with a garish fashion sense, yearns to break into the music world, and he meets his would-be bandmates (Gwilym Lee and Ben Hardy) outside a pub. They need a lead singer, he wants the gig, and one hour and many montages later, they've added a bassist (Joseph Mazzello) and recorded four albums, and Freddie's realized he's bisexual.<br/><br/>All that hurried hullabaloo envelops a blustery record producer (Mike Myers), a serpentine manager (Aidan Gillen), and Freddie's romance with Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). Boynton is underutilized in the film, but so is everyone. The other members of Queen have zero personality apart from their tremendous wigs - their interchangeability is a bit like those homogenous dwarves in The Hobbit series.<br/><br/>Yet the film's larger problem lies in its failure to find deeper substance to the band and their continued popularity. Queen, an ordinary band with an extraordinary lead singer, has been turned into a myth on par with more interesting musicians like Elvis Presley and The Beatles. They've been the basis for a wildly successful blockbuster stage musical, ""We Will Rock You,"" and everything from ""Guitar Hero"" to ""A Knight's Tale"" has cashed in on their legacy. They feel less like a band than a product, and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" happily hawks said product at sixteen bucks a ticket.<br/><br/>The movie jitters between subjects, sometimes examining Freddie's sexuality or raucous personal life, sometimes looking at the band's musical process, but never marrying these focuses together into anything coherent. This rote structure recalls Freddie's own opposition in the film: ""I'm tired of touring,"" aren't you?"" he says to the band. ""Album, tour, album, tour. I'm sick of it.""<br/><br/>That Malek manages to act through his ridiculous prosthetic teeth is the film's biggest achievement. But his peacocking and hip-gyrating only thrust skin-deep. Malek, like his other talented colleagues, never gets to play a human being. Nobody in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" least of all Freddie, wants anything, has any goals. Malek simultaneously brings something liberated and something robotic to the role, as if every step, every tilt of the head, had been carefully choreographed weeks before shooting.<br/><br/>And yet, despite the film's litany of problems, there were moments I was drawn into the action. Some of the quieter, slower scenes gripped me, and for all its playing fast-and-loose with the band's history, I left ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" feeling that it's largely harmless. It doesn't bring any of the subtlety or emotion to Queen that, say, ""Love & Mercy"" did for Brian Wilson, but ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a comfort film first and foremost, a marshmallow sandwich between two slices of white bread. Surely (and hopefully) there will be better movies about Queen, but few, if any, of them will have performances as virtuosic as Malek's."

"dargosmunteanu","9","4","7","9 November 2018"," Touching and though-provoking
","I'm the type of person who always find something to complain about about every movie, yet for this one, I could only whine about my behind hurting from the hard chair it's been sitting on for too long.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a movie that doesn't keep you at the edge of your sit (not that it could... or should), nor is it boring you at any moment and the latter is quite a feat for its given length. It's a movie about the band, but it puts a lot of focus on Freddie's life.<br/><br/>It is not a documentary - and as such, it doesn't follow religiously the timeline. But then again, it couldn't be one, unless it would turn into a shallow tv series. It also isn't a live concert recording or a remastered album (that's for those who are or were expecting the songs to queue up on their proper length). It also isn't CGI infested like the movies we're so used with nowadays.<br/><br/>Granted, the dialogues do feel a bit short, but again, I wager it would be impossible to squeeze more in - given the movie's scope - without turning it into a series. As such, everything that's been put it this movie properly capture the most important aspects of every episode of the band's history presented and, as the credits started rolling, I was left with a lot of thoughts about our nature, about society's standards, about the music industry as a whole.<br/><br/>Malek plays great, as I got used with and expecting from him, after seeing his performance in Mr. Robot. The whole cast does. I won't comment on the soundtrack as I'd be strongly biased and would overestimate it. The missing star, for me, is due to the rather clumsy way of pushing the movie's timeline."
"jshy206","8","4","7","9 November 2018"," A pleasure to watch! Rami Malek steals the show as Freddie Mercury, maybe the best rock frontman of all time
","Thoroughly enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody! Don't believe the critical reviews. Yes, they had to take some liberties to fit in such a long and complex story into 2 hours. It's not a documentary! Rami Malek's performance is amazing - he captures both the flamboyant and quiet parts of Mercury's persona so accurately it's uncanny. The movie spends a lot of time developing Mercury's relationship with Mary Austin (who he declared the love of his life) and the rockier relationship with Paul Prenter. I wished Jim Hutton had received as much screen time - Jim was with Mercury through his final years and feels a bit rushed into the story at the end. The musical performances are stellar: from the earliest gigs through the arena shows chronicling the greatest hits, and culminating in the LiveAid show, which is known as one of the best live rock performances of all time. And though Mercury is obviously the star, the movie does a reasonable job exploring the dynamics between the band members as well as their songwriting collaborations and process. A must-see rock biopic!"

","Yesterday we went to see Bohemian Rhapsody. Honestly it was excellent.

The film has had great ""normal people"" reviews and I thoroughly recommend it. Queen aren't one of the bands I listen too normally so i'm not a starry eyed fan.

I have been a movie buff for years including watching hundreds of foreign films. It is hard to believe the critics are falling all over themselves to criticize this movie.

But this movie is a unique one from all of these, from all the other films that you've seen are amazing. Every thing that you put effort to watch this is so much more than that. Bohemian Rhapsody literally takes you back from the 1970s and how hard it was to compete to other bands and musicians while that era was running. Queen- was one of the outstanding bands around that time- that made them successful and keep on going. Rami Malek, in my opinion, is a new-risen modern artist in the artist world. Not only him mind you, but all of the cast of the movie. Every single person in the cinema with us couldn't stop themselves from singing along- and I couldn't too. I only had one feeling- goosebumps. Goosebumps all over the film. It hits you, it moves you, it gives you a clearer vision. It even made me tear up. It's amazing. It's unique and I think one of a kind masterpieceain the film industry.

Freddie is obviously centre of attention, but the film does reveal how each of the band members contributed in their own definable way. Creating, refining & defining possibly the greatest ever rock band.
The film does draw on Freddie's sexuality & confusions, that lead him to his eventual fall.
Tear jerking moments(felt by many in the audience)towards the end of the film when visiting his mother & father before the live aid concert with his final true friend.

"joshbarton15","8","4","7","25 October 2018"," Rami Malek will rock you!!
","Queen are and will always be one of the most iconic bands of all time, there is no denying that. Fronted by Freddie Mercury, the kind of showman that comes around once in a lifetime, they rocked the world with a number of hits that remain as classic anthems, recognisable to many around the world. I grew up listening to their songs so Bohemian Rhapsody was always going to be film to keep an eye out for me.<br/><br/>Starting in the early 1970s, Bohemian Rhapsody chronicles the formation of Queen and the life of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek), leading to their legendary appearance at the Live Aid concert in 1985.<br/><br/>An icon such as Freddie Mercury needs a memorable performance and in the shape of Rami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody certainly has that. Malek transforms into Mercury, mannerisms and all, and the end result is just superb, Malek delivering a performance of gravitas and showmanship akin to Mercury. There's also a slight sense of vulnerability to Malek's performance, evoking an emotional response to how hard Mercury's life must have been while handling life-changing events.<br/><br/>Malek shares such a great chemistry with other cast members portraying the rest of Queen; Gwilym Lee as Brian May, Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor and Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon. It's great fun to watch them interact with one another and see how some of Queen's most famous songs were created and brought to life in the recording studio. Lucy Boynton impresses as Mary Austin, Mercury's lifelong companion, but due to the creative choice in making this more family friendly she feels a little underused. There's also an unrecognisable Mike Myers to look out for in the film which adds a bit of light relief to proceedings.<br/><br/>The family friendly approach to this biopic means restrictions on how much they could delve into the personal life of Mercury so, if you're expecting an unflinching insight into his life, you won't get it here. That isn't to say Bohemian Rhapsody avoids any issues in his life to make everything seem sunny because this film has some powerful moments in relation to Mercury's AIDS diagnosis, the moment he breaks the news to his fellow band members really striking an emotional chord with me.<br/><br/>Then comes the emotional crescendo that is the entire Live Aid performance the whole film has been leading to. The old Wembley Stadium is resurrected through visual effects wizardry while Mercury is resurrected through the brilliant Malek, strutting his stuff with such stage presence to admire. Seeing that iconic performance brought to life in such an admirable manner made this closing sequence, particularly the ""We Are The Champions"" segment, such a joyous experience.<br/><br/>Ending on such a high note means you just can't help but leave the cinema with a beaming smile. Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration of Queen and one of the greatest showman to ever live, Freddie Mercury, and the film does a fine job in making sure both will never be forgotten."

","On the surface you will think you are seeing what appears to be a movie, it was advertised to be one and said to be like one , and so it , you thought appears to be so. It must be one you thought , it is shiny enough , it looked like it has all the elements of a movie didnt it? It had actors a director a scriptwriter (The Worzel gummidge tv show writer) and had money, a budget of $ 50 million, but once the opening credits have rolled you see it is not a movie at all but a real piece of excrement but even worse! it is a cleverly disguised piece of excrement that is actually one of those fake plastic pieces of excrement that are so cleverly designed to look wet and real and squishy so you dont want to tread on them in case you put your foot in it. ... But , truly I am not exaggerating when I say this is infact the worse movie I have ever seen in my entire life of seeing movies .
With the promise of the interest of the subject matter being a total missed opportunity, the dissapointment is compounded by the fact that this literally is one of the worse made movies ever. It is exploiting the sadness of Mercury's death, but ends up attacking him personally.
Zero out of ten. A lie of a movie .<br/><br/>And as for the ten star reviews? I do not even trust the bad reviews!
People give it one star then say its a great movie. There's something up something is not right, its obvious something IS going on , its not the real life put it that way. The acclaim is not convincing, how could it be? seeing the movie is soooo bad.<br/><br/>The dancing dinner lady in the trailer never appeared. And the photoshoped young lithe man that was not Rami Malik that was used as the early publicity shot was never in the movie either.
For patties sake! Are you people aware that Queen made their first album in the heart of soho in London in the 1970's??!! Dont you know that is ROCK MUSIC HISTORY TIME AND PLACE David Bowie !!! T REX !!! Queen !!! THE 1970 !!! GLAM ROCK and you dont even attempt to convey the situation? The place the EVENT!!? So have you all gone stark raving mad!!! Are you all completely insane?

Overall, by the end of you still feel as detached from the legends as before. I imagine the way some one wrote this script was by trying to find a way to make a movie about their favorite band. When you value the subject of the story over the story, you end up with a lame movie. In summary, if you took all the queen music out of this movie it would be a bad movie."

"gary-444","3","5","10","8 February 2020"," Great Expdctations - Mediocre Reality
","I had been looking forwards to this. Queen were a great band, the reviews had been enthusiastic, but the experience of watching it fell short of my expectations.<br/><br/>The entire film felt contrived, a construct by Brian May and Roger Taylor. The pre Live Aid schism was inadequately explained, and flawed , the gratuitous multicultural crowd shots during Live Aid were historically inaccurate. The narrative a disjointed cut and paste.<br/><br/>Mercury's compulsive sexual behaviour is awkwardly shown, as is his personal relationship with manager John Reid, whose character was poorly written, particularly in contrast to his portrayal in the Elton John biopic ""Rocketman"". Aiden Gillen's Reid here is insipid, and anonymous. There is no hint of his business or sexual prowess, Richard Madden's portrayal in ""Rocketman"" smoulders.<br/><br/>The making of the film was disrupted by a false start with Sacha Baron Cohen dropping out as Freddie, and veteran Hollywood Producer Bryan Singer also leaving for Dexter Fletcher to complete the project. It shows. Current Queen manager Jim Beach is on the production team ensuring that the image is as favourable as possible. It feels like a feature length promo.<br/><br/>I found Rami Malek as Freddie irritating, superficial and lightweight. The dynamic of his relationship with Sarah Austin never worked, or was convincing. Lucy Boynton as Sarah Austin performs well, and looks good, yet she feels like a plot device, rather than a person. Malek is strong in being fey and affected, weak in demonstrating the force that Mercury was.<br/><br/>As a film, rather than documentary, it has clearly succeeded. The music is strong, memorable and well presented. But I found the work as a whole unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Comparisons with the contemporaneously released ""Rocketman"" are inevitable. The distinction is clear. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" relies upon the personality of a dead man, and is produced by third parties with a personal interest in the favourable depiction of their supporting roles. ""Rocketman"" is an Elton John project in which he dares to bare his soul rather than rely upon the music to carry the day.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" taught me nothing. There were no facts or insights of which I was unaware as a music fan. Following the success of the musical ""We will Rock You"" the film was the logical last piece in the artistic Queen jigsaw. As a stand-' alone music film it is pretty good, but only because of the live music sequences, particularly Live Aid. Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page must look on ruefully at the way in which Brian May has kept the money tree blossoming without Mercury."

I think it was an episode of Saved by the Bell, and that was done better. Destroys Freddie Mercury's legacy and makes him seem like a spoiled, selfish child and his bandmates all boring prats.

This was just a number of things that that bothered and there's many more.

"Miles-Morales","2","3","5","27 December 2019"," We will (not) rock you
","*sigh* Where do I even begin with this film?<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a sanitised, by-the-numbers, formulaic biopic about Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury. Now, when it comes to films that follow a formula, I'm not that harsh compared to some other cinephiles. For me, it's more about the execution; originality is great and all, but if it isn't executed well, the uniqueness kinda goes for a toss for me. The problem here is that Rhapsody is basic and by-the-numbers in the worst way possible: it takes the standard-issue formula of a music biopic, follows its every cliche to the tee and executes it without any nuance, subtlety or depth. Ironic, considering how beautifully unique the titular song is.<br/><br/>The original director Bryan Singer was fired after 2/3rds of the film was shot. Dexter Fletcher was assigned to finish the rest of the film and it really shows. The direction is all over the place - compare the sweet and understated scene where Freddie and Mary signal each other with lamps to the cringeworthy and hamfisted scene where the band meets an EMI executive played by Mike Myers, and the difference is clear. Editing is also haphazard and shoddy; some shots never last longer than 5 seconds or so, and there are even some random frames added in certain scenes. The concert scenes particularly suffer from this; these sequences never focus too long on the performances themselves or the crowd's reaction, instead they're half-heartedly cut back and forth, nearly ruining them in the progress (not that they were that great anyway). Even the Live Aid recreation in the end falls victim to the subpar editing. The film's probably edited that way to make it appear fast paced and create a sense of dynamism. The final effect, however, is closer to being annoying. The cinematography is strictly okay; a few good shots and not much else.<br/><br/>What's truly awful, though, is the writing. The film simply skims through most of Queen's career, no more obvious than in the first 30 minutes of the film where Queen go on to a USA tour barely minutes after having their first college show together. There are no signs of struggle for the band apart from repetitive montages where the band is brainstorming about how the songs should sound like, then going ""Eureka!"" and coming up with iconic riffs thanks to their ""innovative thinking"". The film seems to imply that Queen achieved massive worldwide adoration without much hiccups. The dialogues are on-the-nose and sloppy. It got old when the band members talked about their ""uniqueness"" and ""artistic integrity"" for the 30th time. The character development here is pretty much garbage. No one apart from Freddie Mercury (not even the rest of the band members) get any sort of development, and even then, Freddie only gets a generic ""tragic rock star"" arc. Due to this, certain scenes in the third act which are meant to elicit an emotional response ring completely false; Freddie belabours the point about Queen being a ""family"", but it means nothing because we don't see Freddie bonding with Brian, Roger and John much and neither does the film spend time showing how were these guys like. Similarly, when Freddie's father finally feels proud of his son, it means nothing simply because we don't get the opportunity to get to know his family or his upbringing.<br/><br/>The portrayal of homosexuality in the film is... troubling, to say the least. I won't go much into it because many people have dissected it better than I ever could. I'll say this: I hate how the film decides to focus on Freddie's miserable and toxic relationship with Paul Prenter (who's exactly the kind of loathsome, one-note villain you see in Indian soap operas) while almost completely shafting his relationship with Jim Hutton. It's appalling how this film disrespects Jim, to the point that Freddie greets him in the creepiest way possible. And what was up with that truck driver scene?<br/><br/>Along with fast-forwarding through Queen's career, writer Anthony McCarten also alters historical facts to a ridiculous degree. The most egregious examples of this are the whole band breakup and Freddie's AIDS diagnosis. Roger Taylor and Brian May made solo albums before Freddie Mercury, Queen never broke up, Freddie Mercury didn't get diagnosed with AIDS until 1987 and as a result, Live Aid wasn't a Queen reunion nor was it an ""One Last Show"" for Freddie, and yet McCarten fabricates all of that in the name of manufactured drama. It's one thing to change facts in the name of artistic license, it's another thing to flat-out lie to the audience. We also don't get a sense of the music industry of that time, besides name-dropping Elton John and David Bowie. Bob Geldof gets an incredibly small part, and that's it.<br/><br/>Among the gamut of flaws, however, there are still a few bright spots. Rami Malek's performance may not be my favourite of last year, and he does struggle to rise above the material initially, but he slowly becomes more comfortable in the role and he injects genuine emotion and feeling in his portrayal of Freddie. Lucy Boynton is also good as Mary Austin (and oh so beautiful!). To be fair, the rest of the actors aren't bad, but they're not noteworthy either. The scene where Freddie comes out as bisexual is well directed and well acted, despite some questionable writing choices. The Live Aid sequence in the end of the film nicely captures the energy of the original concert, and the We Will Rock You montage is pretty enjoyable too. Apart from that, there are a few funny throwaway lines, like ""If I go any higher only dogs will hear me!"". Oh, and the soundtrack is great, of course.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is obsessed with the image of Queen and Freddie Mercury being legends without going into the reason as to why. We get only surface-level portrayals of these guys, though Rami does try (and almost succeed) to give Freddie more depth than the script allows for. As a result, we get a dull, dismal biopic that does a disservice to the band's legacy. Queen deserves better, and so do we."

","Bohemian Rhapsody follows the well-worn groove of celebrity bio-pics, as a brilliant artist pushes his vision into the world while dealing with personal travails before ultimately doing a triumphant celebratory something (the other path, not taken, is similar but with a downbeat ending).<br/><br/>Rami Malek makes a persuasive rock star; theatrical, intense, egotistical, driven, his oversized personality masking the lonely, unconfident inner man.<br/><br/>But Malek's Freddie Mercury is also pretty annoying, self-centered and arrogant, and ultimately he struck me as someone I wouldn't want to meet. And while at first I found the movie generally entertaining, fueled by Queen's music and Mercury's drive, my attention began to flag as the film became increasingly soap operish, and the final recreation of the 20-minute LiveAid concert was something only a concert-movie fan (I am not one) could love.<br/><br/>For me the movie was most notable for the trivia I learned along the way. We Will Rock you was conceived as an audience participation song. Zoroastrianism is still practiced. The filmmakers have no idea when Fat Bottomed Girls came out (judging by where the put it in the movie).<br/><br/>Admittedly I am in the minority on IMDB, where almost everyone is raving about this film. And while I was increasingly bored, at the end I looked over at my girlfriend and she was weeping, which I wouldn't have even guessed as a possible reaction to the film.

Which may be fine if you like Malek's Mercury, but I'm not a fan.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of his teeth, which seem exaggerated to the point of caricature. Kind of like a dental codpiece.

Mercury deserved better.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm not a fan of the smouldering man pout. I am so not a fan of the smouldering man pout. I hated in the TV series Poldark. I disliked it in this film.

However, I do believe the input from the remaining band members save it from this terrible fate. This movie tells the story of Queen & it does exactly what it says on the tin!
Rami Malek becomes genius showman Freddie & the chemistry between Malek & the rest of the cast is electric. Lucy Boynton is lovely as Mary Austin (Mary is sidelined by many Mercury fans who see him only as a gay icon) so I am glad she was included because she was a big part of his life. I also like how the many aspects of Freddies life were woven into the movie, like his wild parties, his relationship with Jim Hutton, his bust ups with the rest of the band on the direction of Queen because Freddie had very eclectic musical tastes like opera & dance music. Freddies AIDS diagnosis was handled tactfully & sensitively & had me in tears, but it also shows Freddies resilience to carry on & ""Punch a whole in the sky"" & the Live Aid sequence is almost identical to the real one. Pure Perfection!
Overall this movie is well paced with good editing, costumes & direction. & It tells the true story of one of the greatest rock bands in British history. There is humor that is typically British, with irony & has a real feel of the essence of the 70's & 80's that puts the viewer in a virtual time machine! (trust me. This was the era I grew up in!)<br/><br/>Simply put this movie IS Queen, & the magic we lost when Freddie died is now celebrated in the form of a movie...

Just donning a pair of false teeth does not do it, for me. As for the script and direction, to me it adopts all of the worst cliches of biopics. So much so that it was laughable. I really cannot understand the support that this film as experienced. I may be in a minority, but sorry, for me it was a complete dud."
"itsactuallyamanda","9","3","5","19 February 2019"," Freddie Mercury would be damn proud.
","Wow, Just wow. Bohemian Rhapsody honestly delivered more than I thought it would. For a Queen bio-topic, I along with most likely thousands of Queen fans were nervous of what they would do with this movie but once it was actually released, it sure did not disappoint. The portraying of Queen by the cast was just simply incredible but more importantly, Rami Malek. Rami sure did deliver a stunning and jaw-dropping performance of Freddie Mercury, a role that no one ever thought Malek could pull off but he did an amazing acting job that at some points in the movie, you would think that Rami is actually Freddie. Also, a major key to this movie was the music. As the actors didn't sing the music, I thought it was pretty amazing that the movie included the actual audio from performances and albums by Queen. Bohemian Rhapsody was just overall amazing and I can see it winning all the Oscar awards this year. And as I put in the title, Freddie Mercury would be damn proud, no doubt."
"Front-Row-Reviews","10","3","5","18 February 2019"," STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10)
","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>Simply amazing - this biopic is what movie magic is all about. For those of us who grew up listening to Queen and Freddie Mercury, it cuts to the heart. It really reminds us of what a truly great loss he was. For anyone born after his passing in 1991, this film does a wonderful job in capturing Freddie - his dynamic voice and stage presence. Welcome to the club.<br/><br/>The movie starts in the early years when Freddie (Rami Malek) first meets Brian May and Roger Taylor when they were still with the band Smile. Having just lost their current lead singer, Freddie gets the job and together with new bassist, John Deacon, they begin to set the world on fire. Despite the flaws and inaccuracies in the band's actual timeline, this was a very well crafted film which covers all the important areas. Freddie's love for Mary Austin, his discovery of sexual orientation, the band's meteoric rise to fame right up to the film's (and band's) high point when they performed at Live Aid in front of over a billion viewers. Some even view this event as not only the best that the band had to offer ... but the best that rock n' roll in all history had to offer.<br/><br/>This film really reached me. It took me back to my younger years when music was so important to me - and Queen was a major part of that. I remember watching Live Aid that day, when it actually happened. I remember the exhilaration I felt, how I cheered even though my parents didn't understand - and how I treasured every moment of it. This film really brought it all back again.<br/><br/>This comes with the highest recommend possible. It is an important film to watch - vital, in fact. Rami Malek is deserving of an award for his performance. All I can say in closing is, thank you, Queen! Thank you, Freddie Mercury - rest in peace."

","The problem with this kinde of film is that you are likely to recollect ""The Queen"" as though they were exactly as depicted in the film. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe people after seeing the film, will go deep in order to better understand.
It made me thinking a lot listening to Freddie Mercury saying to his father that he wasn't suppose to became anything and that he didn't recognise any root to be followed. Actually I do feel the some urge to not follow anything and to not accomplisch any expectation."

Rami Malek shines and embodies Freddie Mercury like few other actors when they take on biographical roles. Lucy Boynton plays Mary with so much depth and they could not have cast more spot on actors than Gwylim Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazello to portray the band members. To see the lives of this incredible band was amazing. I know Freddie is raising his microphone in approval and smiling that cheeky smile and saying ""it's epic darling!"""

","This movie brought out the best it all of the actors working on it. The dedication Rami Malek must have had to take on such a role is astounding, yet that isn't to say that this movie didn't have its fair share of flaws.<br/><br/>First off, this movie had barely any exposition on the characters themselves and I would have liked to see more about Queen's ride to stardom, which we barely get to see any of.<br/><br/>I, myself, am a fan of Queen's music, but honestly I would have liked a story about Freddy mercury's Life with queen songs mixed into it. Instead we get a movie about queen songs with Freddy Mercury's life mixed into it.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is a great movie and I think you should see it, but the writing isn't the best it could have been."

"TheEtherWalk","10","3","5","21 November 2018"," A triumph. One of the best films of the year
","Critics are wrong on literally everything they nitpick on. The historical changes are fine as well as the ""sanitization"" of Freddie's life. It's a sign of respect on the part of the filmmakers that they didn't make this a cautionary tale, a story of gratuitous sex and drug use, or a film focussing entirely on AIDS. Everything in the film serves the development of Freddie and his journey to find happiness and find his true self... even at the expense of true history, the story told here is a masterful TRIBUTE to the trials and tribulations of his life, with all the pomp and drama that HE HIMSELF WAS INTO. People complain that the story was dramatized but I think Freddie would have loved it. This movie is not only about Freddie, it's FOR Freddie. Rami Malek gives the performance of a lifetime. Every nuance is perfectly practised and he gives the character a deep inner life even when he's not saying anything. A good example is the scene where he gets the biggest room in their bed and breakfast at the expense of everyone else, and he looks out a window and seems lost even in the midst of success. He turns to writing and through his musical writings you can feel the conflict in him between trying to reach his dreams and trying to stay a good person... the story of him finding his sexuality is perfectly executed... the musical journey of the band is excellent if quite shortened for time constraints... the concert setpieces send chills up the spine... the comraderie between the bandmates gives for tons of laughs and is endlessly endearing... just see the film already and give Malek the damned Oscar already"

","I don't really write reviews often but here is one for bohemian rhapsody.
It was entertaining all the way through telling the story of queen and mainly freddies career/life.
Rami Malak was brilliantly cast and did an excellent job, I wasn't expecting him to be as good as he was to be honest but he was exceptional.
His co-stars as the rest of the band also did a great job and didn't look out of place.
The story flowed as the years went by telling just enough of what you need to know about their life but not getting too bogged down in certain situations that the band found themselves in.
And then there was the soundtrack, it doesn't get much better than queen.
I walked out of the cinema thinking I could easily just watch that again and that's got to be the sign of a good film.
I advise anyone to go and watch it!"
"gluonpaul","9","3","5","19 November 2018"," Magnificent Movie, a must see for 2018
","So recently a lot of films I see have lackluster acting, poor scripts, badly written characters. Not all but an awful lot, far more than in previous decades. This however stands out not only for being an excellent movie in its own right but for being a key example of the exact opposite of all of these things.<br/><br/>The acting was in every single actors case excellent, not a single person does a bad job in this movie. The script had believable dialogue and portrayed the characters in a way which made them very clear and recognisable. The music was Queens and so given its one of the greatest bands in history is of course magnificent. Its a wonderfully produced and moving movie.<br/><br/>The only gripe I would have is, yes given the actions we know Paul Prenter took he has been villainised and it seems with some legitimacy. Still given he has died and cannot defend himself I am not sure its fair to portray a person without their own perspective in this way. Its understandable though and the reality is you cannot talk about Freddy Mercurys life without discussing him so they had to do something.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie though, an absolute must watch."

"robmarchant10","9","3","5","17 November 2018"," Superb throughout - a must for Queen fans
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic of one of the greatest rock bands of all time - Queen. Much like one of their concerts, it's two hours of unbridled, outrageous flamboyancy that would be hard-pressed to make more entertaining. The film has everything that one might want from an exceptional piece - from moments of desperate, heart-wrenching sadness, to beautifully-timed, laugh-out-loud humour. Not to mention the music. My god, the music.<br/><br/>As one might expect, one of the film's core concepts is Freddie's never-personally-revealed homosexuality, and the demons that his prohibition spawned, a depressing necessity in an era that didn't just treat gayness with intolerance, but with a reviled spit in the face. I remember an old alcoholic who I used to play darts with bragging about ""queer bashing"" back in the 70's, that glorious decade when it was considered admirable by some to assault men because of their apparently abnormal sexuality. With such people not just lurking in the shadows but bragging about their behaviour, Freddie Mercury didn't stand a chance of showing his true colours. His closeted position was smart, but dismally sad nonetheless. The so-called norms of society also pervaded the expectations of those who were supposed to love him most - his Zoroastrian, traditionally-Persian family. His father, cutting a typical dominant, authoritarian male figure, wished his son to be more straight-laced and conventional, an untenable concept for someone with an unstoppable flamboyance. The unreasonable expectations that he placed upon his son lent a distasteful tension to their relationship throughout the film - like anyone else, Freddie just wanted to be loved and accepted by his parents. In addition to his father's traditional, typical stance, he had the potent racism of the era to contend with, in which ""Paki bashing"" went along with ""queer bashing"", making him positively ashamed of his family's heritage. In order to distance himself from his ethnic background, and as a way to be more appealing to an often bigoted public, Farrokh Bulsara became Freddie Mercury. In those days the world wasn't ready for an openly gay, ornate Persian, no matter how indescribably entertaining he might be.<br/><br/>Freddie wasn't committed to his homosexuality from an early point, forging a sexual relationship with the acclaimed ""love of his life"" Mary Austin, who he pledged to marry. This wasn't a meaningless, throwaway attachment, but a deep and genuine love for his fiancée, the chemistry from which Remi Malek and Lucy Boynton can be applauded. This aspect of the film expressed the beauty and power of intimacy, transcending the traditional notion of black and white sexuality to create something sublime - simply two people's love for each other. Despite Freddie's clear penchant for males, he was able to thrive in an endearing and enduring sexual relationship with a woman, the love of whom provided a rock-steady anchor in his greatest times of despair. Freddie would be considered gay beyond measure by most, but the greatest love of his life happened to be a female. Like Queen themselves, this was refreshingly unconventional. Mary Austin's devastation when Freddie finally confesses his ""bisexuality"" is a beautifully poignant moment in the film, and one of its best.<br/><br/>As Mary's suspicions are increasingly aroused by Freddie's flirtatious behaviour with males, he can feel his fiancé slipping away from him, a catalyst which pushes him to a universal coping mechanism - partying. But booze, pills or cocaine never solved anyone's problems, they just force them down and swell their potency. Freddie was so frightened of facing his demons that he submerged himself in a world that eventually, would kill him. If he were born in a more tolerant era, perhaps Freddie Mercury would have had the courage to reveal himself in all his glamorous, shining glory, and he'd still be alive today. As his love with Mary Austin slowly morphed into something disagreeable, the intimacy in his life shrank, and the escapism that he sought raged. A rock star loved by millions the world over, suffering from loneliness of the most extreme degree.<br/><br/>After revealing his sexual preferences to his fiancée, Freddie's partying reached new heights, encouraged by the film's only real villain: Paul Prenter, the band's manager. Also a marginalised, lonely homosexual, Prenter encourages Freddie's destructive behaviour, which ultimately ended up killing him. Both men were portrayed as having years of pent up homosexuality, erupting into decadent extremity. The blame can't be placed solely on Paul Prenter, but his slimey, snakish actions throughout the latter stages of the film, culminating in him revealing Freddie's homosexual exploits to a tabloid newspaper, create a genuine dislike for the character. As for the tabloids themselves, their moral corruption was typical - all they wanted was to sell more newspapers, despite the pain it may have caused. During a press conference scene, Brian May repeatedly enquires as to whether the so-called-journalists are going to ask about the band's music, the most important part of Queen's legacy. This speaks to the nature of that entire sickening industry. Giving the people what they want is no excuse.<br/><br/>In one of the final scenes of the film, as Freddie confesses his sexuality to his parents, his father becomes angry for a moment, but then softens and finally accepts his son for what he is - another truly beautiful moment. This leads to Queen's famous performance at Live Aid, a hair-raising 20-minute medley of their greatest hits, with Freddie's flamboyance more extreme than ever before due to the long-desired acceptance by those closest to him. The digital reconstruction of the original Wembley Stadium, Twin Towers and all, was extremely well done.<br/><br/>Mike Myers was cleverly positioned as a record manager who fell-out with the band over their most famous record and the film's namesake, a song that he's famous for enthusiastically headbanging to in Wayne's World. Even though the character never actually existed in real life, his presence in the film added satisfying humour, particularly in the closing scenes when he's sat alone in his office, watching Queen's Live Aid performance on TV along with 1.5 billion others.<br/><br/>Another comical scene in the film shows Freddie prostrating himself before the band years after quitting - a complete reversal of power which Brian May takes advantage of by politely asking Freddie, for the first time ever, to leave the office so that the other band members may confer, proverbial tongue wedged into his cheek. The band's greatest star had finally learned how to be humble.<br/><br/>Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury was truly awesome, from his authentic facial expressions to his extravagant on-stage movement, the actor must be a contender for an Oscar. He positively transformed into the character - Mr Robot was nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>The entire movie was a parallel of Freddie Mercury's life - thrilling to the extreme, ceaselessly troubling, but never boring. Brian May's euphonious guitar, Roger Taylor's furious drums, John Deacon's subterranean bass, and Freddie Mercury's exceptional voice create an incredible soundtrack, which when combined with the story, forges a captivating film. Four characters who seemed to have little in common, and who on their own were mediocre, formulated genius when working together. We can be thankful for Queen's turbulent, unhinged passion in producing some of the greatest music of all time, and the film's creators for making a wonderfully enthralling story, deserving of the band's glorious legacy.<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>Originally published at http://antidotesforchimps.com on November 17, 2018."
"Ant-ManSalinas","6","3","5","17 November 2018"," A Critique on Bohemian Rhapsody
","Let me start this by saying that I am a huge fan of Queen. I love Freddie Mercury, Brain May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon. I even dressed up as Freddie for Halloween one year. Point is, I love Queen so I was naturally excited for this movie. I don't believe it's as bad as everyone says it is, but I don't think it's as amazing as the general public is making it seem either. This movie has very obvious and frustrating but also has incredible things in it. Firstly, Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury is perfection. I saw Freddie Mercury reincarnated. He nailed everything about him including his mannerisms , the way he talks, his body movements, literally everything. I also really liked the moments we got with Brain May and Roger Taylor, even though they don't get much character. I can't say anything about John Deacon because honestly he doesn't have a character here. He's only in this movie because he's the four member of Queen. He doesn't get a single thing to do and always gets picked on by other characters. Everyone in the movie does a good job as well, and the whole Live Aid segment gave me so many chills you don't even know. Where this movie frustrates me is their depiction of when things happened. They act like they've never collaborated with David Bowie or Michael Jackson, they tell us News of the World came out in the 80s when it was released in the 70s, and Freddie wasn't diagnosed with aids until 1987, after 1985 which is when he's diagnosed in the movie. They also never mention Jazz, Flash Gordon, and skim over most of their albums.
This is Queen. One of the most influential bands of all time. You have to accurately present information to the audience. This movie also has classic cliches, which very easily comes across as lazy. As they say in the movie, Queen isn't like every other band. Queen IS Queen. I just wanted to quickly share my opinion on the movie after seeing it twice. This movie had so much potential to be one of the best of the year. We get stuck with something which I do like, but still wanting something better. I'm very curious to see what the Sacha Baron Cohen version of this movie would've looked like, but unfortunately we probably will never see that version. I still recommend seeing this movie to anyone who's a fan of Queen, just don't expect something great from this movie."

People have forgotten that if anything QUEEN was an ACT where the audience was part of the show where people left happy and elated after the show. None of the other bands of the era had that and the after parties were something else. I highly recommend you watch the 1981 Montreal Concert on youtube to get a feel for a complete show!!!"

","Soooooo... Amazing movie, way better than i expected. Ofcourse, if you're a fan of the band youll see some minuscule errors or changes for the sake of hollywood, but overall, as a music lover, as a movie junkie and as a Queen fan, this movie is phenomenal. I teared up, I laughed, I sanged and even felt sorry for poor Freddy. Its a handful of movies which often take some off story liberties and still keep the true nature and essence in a pure way of the message, characters and actual facts portrayed on the silver screen.
I had my doubts, I expected something worse, but it has all the main ingredients to make a concrete statement; rise and fall of queen as a band, quemistry and family. Internal band/personal problems plus sickness, drugs, alcohol, fame and romanticism of the so beloved songs we all love, without the need of going more graphic than what it was needed (just as Queen did towardsthe media).
On my books, 9.5/10. But here it will be a 10. Instant masterpiece.

Over editing makes some scenes look cheap, and some scenes are so rushed into ending that they seem pointless.<br/><br/>However, Rami Malek alone makes up for these errors, he wasn't playing Freddie Mercury, he WAS Freddie Mercury. At times I forgot I was watching Malek, known from Mr. Robot, Until Dawn ect, this film is completely unrecognisable from anything he's done before. You forget you're watching him and are completely encapsulated into Freddie. If this man doesn't win an Oscar there's something not right here."

If they want to watch a documentary, please tell them to watch it at their homes on television.<br/><br/>The performances of all the actors in this movie is great.

It captures the performances and drive of Queen and provides great insight into the mind of Freddie and his passion and love of life and music."

","As someone who was born in the 80s, I wasn't a die hard fan of Queen or Freddie Mercury but did know their music and loved it. His story intrigued me, which is why I went to see this today. Rami Melek played Freddie very well. They couldn't have picked a better person to play him. The movie gave me more insight into Freddie's life. I had no idea he was so funny either. Very Quick witted. I felt like the film was missing something, though. I can't pinpoint it. It is a very sad story and Its a shame that he left us too soon.

","I am a huge Queen fan and this movie helped me re-live their story that I already know. And yes, they left out a lot. I would gladly have watched another hour of the story, but I get that time is money and not everything could be included. Freddie was so beautiful and vulnerable, and Remi does and amazing job portraying him. Their actual performance at Live Aid was incredible and I have watched it many many times on YouTube. So when they portrayed it in the movie, I felt like I had already seen it. I hate that they left out two songs, but oh well. If you were blown away by that scene in the movie, go watch the actual performance where the crowd was actually and totally into the moment and not holding a device to record, text, IG or Snapchat an event. It was such an amazing time in history to be in the moment. I will see this movie many more times!"
"bloomchanning","10","3","5","6 November 2018"," I smell an Oscar in the force.
","Rami Malek is just so awe inspiring as Freddie mercury and really captures the turmoil and the struggles i his life that really drained on him. Seriously i think he deserves an nomination at least. seriously he was that good. But the marketing does show that the movie is just about Freddie but it's that the members also whit Brian, Roger, and John. This movie depicts the characteristics of the band queen as just any other family, they fight, they disagree, and agree on certain topics and was kind of an eye opener to see what came about behind close doors. Mary Austin too gets more depth and it was hard to watch at times for Freddie trying to love her but it just pains me to see Freddie lying to himself after so long of a persona that he made for himself. The one problem is just one Really bad of a close of Freddie's face in the live aid sequence but i turned out that none of friends that saw the movie didn't notice anything bad in the live aid sequence so i though that it was just me. Regardless though Bohemian Rhapsody is a must see for queen fans and fans of awesome biopics."

"dierregi","9","3","5","5 November 2018"," Entertainment with a soul
","This movie does not need another review, but I enjoyed myself so much that I wanted to post my little tribute.<br/><br/>The plot is encased between the beginning and the end of Queen's show at Live Aid and it tells 15 years of their story. The costumes, settings, etc... inclusive of 70s awful hairstyles, are impeccable.<br/><br/>Malek does a great job as Mercury. Of course, he could not be expected to do the singing, but that does not impact the movie a bit. Some scenes are quite moving and thankfully, they do not dwell too deeply into Mercury's sexuality. We all know how that worked out... no need for cautionary tales.<br/><br/>The movie is not the glorification of a gay icon, but of the story of a human being, with all the luggage, problems, loneliness, happines and despair that are part of everybody's life. Maybe that's why it touched people's hearts."
"blackwaterjulia","10","3","5","5 November 2018"," Exceeded all my expectations
","Most people will remember the first record they bought. I sure as hell remember mine, it was the Queen greatest hits album. I bought it for a fiver on the local flea market, just because the boy I had a crush on back then happened to love Queen. The boy was soon forgotten, but the music managed to capture and keep me.<br/><br/>With that music being so dear to me, I was both thrilled and apprehensive about the movie being made. I hoped it would be nothing short of magnificent, but I feared it would be the opposite. It's a hard job to portray any of the band members accurately , but Freddie? No... impossible in my eyes.<br/><br/>Yet this movie did exactly that. This movie, the actors, the script and the entire atmosphere; everything about it is right. The band has never settled for mediocrity and neither does this movie.<br/><br/>I can't say anything about the plot, or about the story line. It is what it is, the life and history of four completely different and extremely talented people that gave the industry the middle finger and went their own way, creating something unique.<br/><br/>By sticking to the band's real history and maintaining their quality standards, this movie has become the epitome off a phrase that was once penned down by Shakespeare: ""This above all: to thine own self be true"""

I'm not sure if all the facts about Queen are accurate in this film, but I love Queen and I left the theater even more intrigued. On entertainment value, acting, visuals and sound.

They're trying to create a movie that this wasn't.<br/><br/>This wasn't really a biopic of Mercury, though he took up most of the screen time, much like he did as the lead singer of Queen. There were three other band members, though, and had the movie focused just on Mercury, it would have lost some of the content that makes it so enjoyable.<br/><br/>There were HUGE timeline issues that bugged the sh** out of me, but I put them aside because I just enjoyed every minute. The actors were phenomenal--not just Malek (though he deserves award noms). It was witty (I really hope that Freddie delivered zingers like those I saw in the movie), so sad (geniuses can be lonely), and ultimately so uplifting that people in our theatre were yelling ""A-O"" back at the screen, pumping fists in the air, and delivering a round of applause when the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>That is a great movie experience.

","I am not one to write movie reviews, as I don't think I'm well versed in what folks are looking for. When I read reviews, they often touch on things I was not even looking at during the film. However, I had to step up and say the critics are so wrong about this one. They basically say it has no depth, and they must have been watching a different movie. I never realized how lonely a man that was so loved could be. Every individual in the band contributed a uniqueness that was the roux which made Queen so uniquely amazing. I was never aware of Mary Austin, and that dynamic was intriguing to me.<br/><br/>As for performances, Rami pulled off Mercury's mannerisms beautifully! And Mike Myers was a fun addition and little nod to Wayne's World reintroducing Bohemians Rhapsody with Wayne's World.<br/><br/>Between this and A Star is Born, the academy has their work cut out for them...unless they pull some obscure artsy film out that no one has heard of to award."

"twbond-00867","10","3","5","4 November 2018"," From a SOMEONE, to an ICON!
","Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) is absolutely sensational! Rami Malek IS Freddie Mercury, from the beginning-to-the climatic ending. From an ordinary shy baggage handler-to one of the greatest artists in history, it really tells you the story fresh from the beginning, up to the band we now all love. It's breathtaking biopic soars through a well-deserved motion-picture that chronicles a history of loveable music, with an emotional story.<br/><br/>When he meets the band, the movie just dwells into a new, captivating path that makes us learn the introduction of who they are today. As they pursue a music career and rely on each other to be the best they can be, it also makes sure it focuses on the lead whilst allowing us to understand more about his bandmates. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello, as Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon, all deserve the praise in their performance. It's geniusly well-fitted, and it fills with energy along the way. As they progress through the band's album with spellbinding drama; about their music releases, the band's origin, Freddie's personal life and the problems he faces, all in 2hrs 14mins, it really makes you explore the real invention of the Mercury we know today. The costume designs and the prosthetics just make the movie better, with the moustache keeping it so real, Malik steals his identity, and you just see Mercury in the background. His methodical acting skills just do the trick.<br/><br/>Malek deserves the Oscar, and this movie is without doubt one of the best musical movies I've ever seen! I'll always love Queen, and now I get to see it on the big screen! This movie WILL ROCK YOU! And this movie deserves a round of applause!<br/><br/>10/10.<br/><br/>WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!"
"thiagolopes-42143","10","3","5","4 November 2018"," THE BEST OF 2018

"Okonh0wp","7","3","5","4 November 2018"," A significantly different experience if you're not familiar with Queen
","Films that draw on historical subjects can produce an interesting divide in the viewer based on how familiar you are with the subject. A great deal of the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" reviews to date have expressed disappointment because it's a paint-by-numbers of all the major points of Mercury's life.<br/><br/>As someone who grew up in a household where my father listened primarily to classical music and my mom listened to a radio station called ""The Sounds of Sinatra"", I'm embarrassingly unfamiliar with most music before 1998. My knowledge on Queen boils down to A) songs I recognize by Queen like ""Bohemian Rhapdsody"", ""Killer Queen"", ""Somebody to Love"", and ""We Will Rock You"" and B) songs that play on commercials or in summer festivals or movie soundtracks that I knew of but didn't know they were specifically Queen like ""Under Pressure"", ""Another one Beats the Dust"", and ""We are the Champions"" (thanks ""The Mighty Ducks"" for the assist on that one) and little information on the band members. I honestly have no idea how people can keep track of the names of so many band members of groups that came before their time. The point, however, is that your knowledge of Queen is going to affect how you see this film.<br/><br/>If you follow the school of film criticism that the film's intent matters, I'd suggest that this film was made for people like me. Reading the interviews with Queen's surviving band members, director Bryan Singer and producer Graham King, this was a passion project because they wanted to educate. Look at Graham King's quote:<br/><br/>""But I was also fascinated with the idea that there is so much about Freddie Mercury and Queen-arguably one of the greatest bands in history-that the general public does not know....This is such an important story to tell, and, for me, it was crucial that we not only celebrate their music and achievements, but also give people a better understanding of the band's history.""<br/><br/>At the same time, if you're not going to see the film specifically to rediscover Freddy Mercury from a backstage perspective, this will read kind of like every other rock biography in existence. The protagonist is a man driven by pure id and does whatever he pleases and, for the most part, doesn't care who's in his way. It's the result of having all the right creative instincts and being isolated from reality by handlers who want to feed off of him. The protagonist's ego becomes oversized and he sews his wild oats. He either gains self-control or doesn't (they often dies young) but the audience is encouraged to see his beautiful soul and his contributions over his sins because that audience is biased before the movie stars by an appreciation for the music.
It's not really the fault of the film if it all follows a predictable script: The screenwriter is beholden to the details of the subject's life and Freddy Mercury is what they had to go with.<br/><br/>Some of these entries (Love and Mercy is a good example) manage to transcend the genre even with figures who fall into the same narrative but Bohemian Rhapsody is largely beholden to the genre. As interesting as Mercury was of a person, the story flattens some of the more interesting chapters of his life by not involving his origin as a Parsi immigrant (his family is largely absent beside the opening chapter) or a promising student. His conflict with his surname and legacy and status as an immigrant is never explored.<br/><br/>Similarly, there was a harmony among the members of the group that is overlooked in the film because conflict is juicier. To what degree were they ok with his gay lifestyle? There are erroneous complaints that the film straight-washes Mercury (not true), but it would be interesting if his band mate's reaction was covered. Similarly, the band was held together because ""they were a family"" but I was told that more than I was showed it.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is screen time: With his marriage to a woman that fell apart because she was upset with him for being bisexual (it seems that there is a misunderstanding over whether bisexual means faithful), his bandmates, his family, his lecherous manager, his exploration of himself some of these chapters get short shrift.<br/><br/>On the whole, it's certainly watchable but it had more unanswered questions than room to fill."

","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is the story of Queen, one of England - and the world's - greatest ever rock bands. More specifically, the film focuses predominantly on Freddie Mercury (Malek)'s life, genius and struggles. It must be said that Malek, his mannerisms and fake teeth are exceptionally close to the real-life Freddie.<br/><br/>The film is helped by not being 100% about their music, albums and touring, but also not spending excessive time with Freddie's personal life. The other Queen members get their fair share of screen time - guitarist Brian May (Lee, uncannily similar), drummer Roger Taylor (Hardy) and bass player John Deacon (Mazello) - and have lots of good moments. Mary (Boynton) plays a key figure, being Freddie's wife early on.<br/><br/>The film does delve into some of the trappings of celebrity that Freddie fell into, but does showcase Queen's music superbly - the making of Bohemian Rhapsody, Another One Bites The Dust and We Will Rock You is fun and insightful. The climax of the film is Freddie seeing his parents and then an almost note-for-note replica of Queen's Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium and it's superb."

","The movie leaves a lot to be desired, and is definitely not the masterpiece people are making it out to be, but an average biopic at best. Highly predictable, the actions of the characters are very expected and the characters are mostly stereotypes even to a non-fan.<br/><br/>For a biopic about such a colorful individual, the colors are certainly very drab, as are the sets. This picks up a bit after the middle, but the bland colors reminiscent of a Marvel movie are a strange choice from Singer.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly rushed, obviously trying to fit everything into a viewer-friendly 2 hours, but unfortunately it sacrifices characterization & establishing relationships. Halfway through the movie I realized i still have no idea who the other members of the band are, I wasn't even sure hoe many they were (I'm not a big Queen fan), for me it was just one big mess of long hair. By the end, the characters are finally established, but you have no empathy for them and feel no connection since they get almost zero depth.
The Paul character I am still not sure who he is or where he came from, or how he influenced the protagonist so much.
Malek is adequate, although definitely not worthy of any awards since the material is simply not enough to warrant even a nomination. He never manages to make us believe he's anything other than Rami Malek playing Freddie Mercury, and the overdone prosthetics definitely don't help.<br/><br/>The final scenes are of course very epic and moving, leaving you with a sense you watched a movie that's far superior to the one you actually just watched.<br/><br/>6.5"

","Finally saw BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. I didn't expect to like it and was not pleasantly surprised. It portrays Freddie Mercury as a selfish hedonist and his bandmates as uniformly upstanding, monogamous family men. It also implies that you can never be complete as a human being unless you find your soulmate--especially if you aren't strictly heterosexual.<br/><br/>Like all biopics, BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY was not about to let the facts get in the way of a good story (or even this one). Here is a (far from complete) list of its inaccuracies:<br/><br/><ul><li>Freddie Mercury was not a shy, withdrawn youth. By all accounts, he was supremely confident at a very young age and always believed he was destined to become a star.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He never tossed a rock through the office window of a record executive. In point of fact, Ray Foster is a fictional character (played by Mike Myers) who may have been loosely based on EMI label chief Roy Featherstone.

","When I first heard about 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being released as a movie, despite loving Queen, I had no intention of going to see. However I got invited to see it and agreed to do so. I then watched the trailer and did a little research into it and started to get the feeling I was going to have a truly great time with this film. Sure enough I got into the cinemas and ten minutes in knew that I was in for a very special couple of hours. What an incredible ride this film was. It felt like having a front row seat to the life and performances of Freddie Mercury. I find it is often the films you are reluctant to see that turn out to be the best ones.<br/><br/>Rami Malek in the lead role absolutely captivated me. From the look, to the voice, to the little things like the way he held himself. It was all perfect. I can't remember the last time I watched a performance without a thought regarding the Oscars going in, and by the end knew that that person was going to be in running.<br/><br/>The film takes some creative liberties and changes things around here and there to make things work. I was okay with that though. They needed to get everything into the film and did that adequately. The pacing of the film is great, the music was used perfectly and there's no real lull in the story at any point. This was one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've ever had. A must-see film."

"JakeBrinkman","2","6","14","2 January 2019"," A brilliant capture of Freddie, although accuracy would have made the movie great
","Freddie's character and actions were captured expertly, even if his story was not.<br/><br/>This movie's primary conflict was Freddie vs himself, or Freddie vs Paul. This arc is shown quite well, allowing us to sympathize with Freddie's misguided actions and his true desires at the same time. However, this arc is fully completed with approximately 45 minutes left in the film. This forces the story to rely on a secondary arc, Freddie vs the band, but that arc also ends with 30 minutes remaining. The film then turns to a tertiary arc, which is Freddie and Jim, or Freddie vs his parents. By this point, we are so far removed from the primary climax that this tertiary climax feels like the movie is truly dragging on beyond its boundaries. But there is *still* 20 minutes left after this third arc is completed. The result is that the Live Aid concert feels exactly like watching a concert. Most of the emotional attachment has ceased long ago, and while watching Freddie perform is fun, there is no reason to include it in a film unless there is an emotional reason to do so.<br/><br/>So how do you invoke an emotional response from the Live Aid concert? The answer is extremely simple: show what actually happened.<br/><br/>In reality, the second arc, Freddie vs the band, is *entirely fictional.* Now, this movie needed a secondary conflict since the primary conflict ended so early. One band member selling out is an extremely common trope for the music genre, but it can be forgiven if it actually happened. However, that did not actually happen for Queen. The band continued to play live shows, and they even had to cancel some of their regular shows to attend Live Aid. There was no hiatus and no internal conflict. Including this cliched arc can also be forgiven if no other conflict actually occurred, but that is also not the case (which I'll discuss after a couple paragraphs).<br/><br/>I propose that the movie should have been made by showing the truth. Freddie vs himself, the primary arc of this film, should become the minor arc. It will occur first chronologically, but it is still the secondary arc. After that is complete, the completion of the tertiary arc, Freddie vs his parents, can then occur, or it can be removed completely since it is not known to be a true event. Finally we reach the primary arc of the film: Queen vs the world.<br/><br/>In reality, most people had forgotten about Queen before the Live Aid concert, and that concert reminded them that they actually enjoy Queen. Without that concert, Queen may have gone down in history as a successful band during its time, but also a band that could not live up to the rock legend status that they still have today. This concert was the life-or-death conflict for Queen, and it absolutely should have been the climax of the movie. Removing the band argument scenes leaves room for scenes showing the band's decline. Perhaps they perform at concerts that are only half full, or nobody in the crowd knows the lyrics to a popular Queen song, or they are rejected for a new record deal. Just as things seem hopeless, their manager pulls every last favor he has to get them a spot in Live Aid, and the band knows this is their final chance. Now instead of going into the concert emotionless, the viewer is filled with tension hoping that the band's performance is a success. Then the show begins and the crowd starts to remember how they love Queen. They sing along and get active...<br/><br/>The movie also said that every band got 20 minutes, which is another false fact. Each band got 15 minutes, but Queen played for 20 because the crowd loved them so much. Even in the film's version, there is no reason to leave this fact out because it only serves to make the band look better.<br/><br/>... Then once their 15 minutes is up, they begin to walk off stage. The crowd begins chanting ""Queen! Queen!"" and the concert director tells them to get back out there. BAM! That's an epic climax with the crowd's love as the conclusion. Now the final 5 minutes of the concert is all the ""wasted"" time in the movie, and it feels like an excellently satisfying ending rather than the 45 wasted minutes at the end of this film's original script.<br/><br/>I believe it is absolutely inexcusable for this movie to show such poor screenwriting ability when the best script is simply a historically accurate depiction of events."
"erik-gunnarsson87","5","6","14","3 November 2018"," Remember Steve Jobs?
","There are two types of biographies, and this is the one with Aston Cutcher, where there's endless of material and the director tries to fit it all into two hours of film.

For excemple, why even bother with ""giving"" him AIDS in 1985 when he first got diagnosed in 1987?<br/><br/>Some sceens tickled my mind, but I expected much more.

"promind","1","5","11","7 July 2019"," Real shame and failure!
","I don't agree with most of the reviews. I can't believe this film won Oscar! For what? What incapable director will choose this kind of actor to play Freddy Mercury? He is a short, small, thin man, with artificial teeth, can't be farther from the real person. Awarding Malek an Oscar for this role was an offense for the good actors. And it shows again and again how everything in Hollywood is arranged in advance, unfairly. Not to mention the chaotic editing.
Malek is not natural, he over-performs, not convincing at all. He just makes faces and mimics without showing any emotions. Bad actors just cannot show emotions. Most of the times he is ridiculous, leaving the viewer in wonder if this is supposed to be a comedy.
The story is artificially decorated, forced and unreal. It is part of his life but it doesn't reflect the real life of Freddy Mercury who left much bigger legacy with his voice and music. Why important parts of Freddy's life were neglected? Does it have anything to do with Hollywood greedy to make money? Where is the art in all this?
Unfortunately, the people born after Freddy Mercury's death will have a wrong impression about him. He was a great performant with exceptional voice and he deserved more. This film was a real shame and failure! I prefer not to have watched it."
"breannaexcell","3","5","11","31 December 2018"," Not Good.
","I love Queen. Freddie is a legend. This movie is not good. I didn't have high hopes, but I thought it might be kind of interesting. I actually can't stop thinking about how bad it was.<br/><br/>First, what was the point of this movie? Was it supposed to focus on Freddie? Was it supposed to be about Queen? It didn't focus on the other band members much at all, and I was left wanting to know more about them.<br/><br/>It jumped from one significant event to another. Queen was formed and then BAM suddenly they come out with A Night at the Opera and then WOW they're playing stadiums. What about their other great albums? What about their rise to fame?<br/><br/>Rami Malek did a pretty okay job at playing Freddie, but he was portrayed as kind of vapid which I'm pretty sure is not how Freddie was. I also had issues with the portrayal of his sexuality and his death. We all know that stuff, but I feel like the movie just looked over that. Fine, I'm sure the writers didnt want to focus on that, but I mean... Suddenly one day he is gay after looking at a trucker? AIDS was mentioned maybe twice in the movie, but the AIDS crisis was a pretty significant event in the 80s and, you know, Freddie had AIDS, so maybe a bit more focus on that would have been good? I would also have liked to have seen a little more about his relationship with Jim Hutton, rather than just Freddie ringing Jim's doorbell and then suddenly he is invited for tea with Freddie's family and then they spend the rest of Freddie's life together? Also, what about Freddie's relationship with his family?!<br/><br/>The movie focused way too much on performance and the big songs rather than on Queen itself and the effect Queen had and still has in the music world. Also why did they have to recreate the Live Aid performance? I can and have watched it online numerous times, I don't have to see actors recreate it. It would have been better of they just showed the actual footage or had the footage interspersed throughout the movie performance. I know that is where the writers wanted to end the movie, but it wasn't a good ending, sorry.<br/><br/>The directing was also kind of terrible. The fast back and forth during conversations is unnecessary. I love cats, but why were there so many shots of the cats? And during the Live Aid performance, why did they keep focusing on Mary and Jim and then the fake audience?WHY?!?!<br/><br/>I am a fan of Queen and Freddie, I know the music, I've watched the performances numerous times, and I know the history. If you're one of the people that didn't know about these things before, I feel sorry for you. This movie probably introduced you to the hit songs, but that's probably it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, only see this movie if you want a very PG-13 version of Queen/Freddie, if you don't know anything about Queen/Freddie and want a really bad/ shallow/ inaccurate/ incomplete look at their lives, or if you want to be disappointed. Why did it have to be like this."

I have no problem with this new Queen ""fanbase"", and while these kids quoting lines from the movie everywhere did bother me a bit, I learned to grow okay with it.<br/><br/>Still, the thing that bothers me most are the people who believe everything in this movie is what actually happened, and take everything as facts, when in reality, most of it is made up to keep the pace going and get teary eyes by the end of the movie, which I find unnecessary, but understandable.<br/><br/>Again, this is more fantasy than real life, and once you learn to watch it with naive eyes it actually becomes a pretty fun movie."

","There are plenty of opinions as to how authentic this is, as a retrospective on the life of Freddie Mercury; but there can be no doubting that the pairing of Rami Malek and Queen's music makes this a captivating couple of hours of cinema. We are taken on the compelling and enthralling roller-coaster that was his life and the excesses of his lifestyle and behaviour are comprehensively conveyed without being at all graphic, or even particularly seedy. Malek is simply magnificent. Tom Hollander is also outstanding too. I bet it did wonders for sales of Queen music too - they created one hell of a repertoire."

There's no real substance to a cheese puff and there's not really any in this movie either.<br/><br/>That said, I love Queen. A movie full of their amazing music? Yes please. Add to that the fact that the actors playing the band do a really solid job and that's even better and Rami Malek is an exceptional Freddie Mercury. Honestly, between this and Mr Robot, I want to see anything that Malek puts to film next.<br/><br/>But then there's the other side of it. The ""villains"" are so over the top, cartoon-like bad guys that it's ridiculous. The movie is practically a paint by numbers biopic, hitting all the overplayed notes even at the cost of accuracy to the actual events. Which, to me is a problem in and of itself. I'm not a super fan by any means but I have a passing knowledge of the Queen story, so there was really no hope of surprise here, making the formulaic approach all the more mundane.<br/><br/>Still, did I mention I love Queen?

","The Queen soundtrack is great, of course, and technically ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" deserves the praise. It's a well-paced biopic, too, that hits all of the expected notes, but it's manufactured vapidity conflated by an ahistorical arrangement to create baddies while trivializing the part of drugs, homosexuality and AIDS in the life of Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>Reportedly, the biggest mainstream LGBT movie yet, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ridiculously makes its gay protagonist's romantic life revolve around a woman, whereby he's not depicted as having a boyfriend until after he's diagnosed with AIDS. There are several references to his apparent sex life with his to-be wife, including them lying in bed and him boasting about it in front of her deaf father, in addition to the overriding theme of their love for each other. Meanwhile, his homosexual relationships are either hardly hinted at with the odd glance or confused with sexual harassment by a forced kiss here and a posterior grab there, until he's outed in the media, for partaking in a series of sexual encounters that were never shown. Tellingly, illicit drugs receive a similar obfuscated approach, with their mostly being only suggested by dancing and partying, alcohol and ashtrays. A PG-13 picture of a rock star is just a mistake, but the apparent shyness and queasiness over sexuality is worse. Hiding the queerness off stage while celebrating Mercury when he struts it in front of a crowd--consequently, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is more of an extended Queen concert than a biopic.<br/><br/>A recorded concert, that is--more akin to watching the Live Aid event on the telly if it weren't live instead of being there in the stadium. It's a ""perfect performance,"" as one band member quips, when they're told their show for the BBC will be playback, requiring them only to lip sync. Well, Rami Malek won an Oscar for lip syncing his way through the performances of Mercury. Admittedly, he does the part well visually, including the prominent prosthetic teeth. The singing, however, is reportedly a mix of Malek and a professional singer. I suppose, then, that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is even more like Queen recording a record in studio as opposed to concert performances. Indeed, some of the best scenes here are of the behind the scenes of the music industry and recording business. I also recently viewed ""Rocketman"" (2019) and was disappointed by its depiction of Elton John's creative process. ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" at least, demonstrates the band's experimentation and genre mixing, and the quarrels they have throughout the picture are largely based in the making of music. The movie itself likewise showcases technical virtuosity--not only in the soundtrack, but also with the swirling camerawork and narrative construction building up to the climax. Too bad it's hollow inside."

At the end of the movie during the credit roll, there is some real vintage footage of Freddie. That gave us a good comparison of how his teeth were supposed to look. Instead it was like two giant chicklets on Malek. And what was so distracting, is you can see how much he was struggling with this appliance. He's constantly running his lip over the thing throughout the entire movie. Like an old man with dentures! Also the way he sucks in his cheeks in the early parts of the movie were very unconvincing. In both of these cases, less would have been much more. I found myself just staring at this poor guy's mouth struggling with this thing and it took away from the movie. Nobody else?<br/><br/>The story itself was good. I would have liked to learn more about who Freddie really was. What was his musical background? How did the band gel so quickly and without any explanation with Freddie's vision of the band? I feel like a lot was left out and it was just throwing in the top 10 songs in a haphazard fashion to appease the viewers.<br/><br/>I should also mention that while Malek's acting was good (certainly not Oscar material IMO), I don't think he was the best one to play Freddie.

","The story of rock band Queen, with particular emphasis on the life of their flamboyant, larger-than-life vocalist, Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>Superb. While being a fan of Queen, I wasn't sure how this would turn out. This movie could easily have turned into a conventional, linear telling of the Queen / Freddie Mercury story. For the first half it appeared that this was going to be the case: director Bryan Singer whizzes through their early history with the interest largely being sustained by the fantastic music.<br/><br/>However, from a point the movie becomes highly engaging and quite moving. The music is still great but the characters have more depth and the band dynamic comes more to the fore. Moreover, the emptiness of Freddie Mercury's life and his diagnosis with AIDS are examined, making for a profound and emotional second half.<br/><br/>Perfect ending too. Singer could easily have ended the movie with Mercury's death, which would have made for a sentimental yet predictable and down-beat conclusion. Instead he chooses the moment of Mercury's, and Queen's, greatest triumph, making for a joyous, positive ending. Rather than mourning Mercury's death, we're celebrating his life.<br/><br/>Great performances all round. The problem with biopics is that either you often have to choose between actors who look the part, but then can't act, and good actors who don't look the part. Here there were no compromises: the actors can act and they look like their real-life characters.<br/><br/>Superb performance by Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, a performance that saw him win the 2019 Oscar for Best Actor.

However, I think after the movie shifts from the 70's into the 80's, I think it slows down and gets a little less interesting. Also, there are many historical inaccursies, which isn't awful but stand out to a hardcore Queen such as myself. Finally, after watching Rocketman, I realise that this movie could have been done so much more better if they had chosen to do a 15 rated movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very good and enjoyable movie although it does have it's flawed it's a movie I did buy on Blu-Ray and I have fun watching."

","""And following Him was a large crowd of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him."" - Luke 23:27<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with a biopic that twists the truth a little to keep the plot going. but when the story of a people, icons, is interesting enough to make a movie about them, why create false drama where there is none? why tell lies about how they handled their career or when they got sick and how? eventually these stories would be considered as true stories and the lies of Hollywood will blend into the history books. I do not want a world where we learn history from movies. I want a world where historical biopics focus on the truth, without making vomit-inducing-cut-storms and crazy wacky false tales about a rock-god just because they want to recreate a famous live performance"

"jessiejpb","10","2","3","27 May 2019"," Rami Malek was magical! Freddie would be proud!!
","I saw this movie the night before it opened, on November 1st, 2018. For some reason I never got around to reviewing it back then. I don't know how many people will read this since it was out 6 months ago, but I still wanted to write my perspective on it.<br/><br/>So here I go... Before this movie I had only seen Rami Malek in one movie, and just from that I became an instant fan. That man knows how to act!<br/><br/>When I left the theatre after seeing Bo Rhap I walked home and the entire way I kept saying to myself ""Rami is so winning an Oscar for that"" over and over. It was kind of an instinctive thing that came to me but I also knew that it was pretty early into awards season to make that kind of prediction. But I am really glad I spoke that into the air!<br/><br/>Rami was just perfection on screen! Ever since that night I dove into watching countless interviews of him talking about the movie and his prep for it. What a committed, hard-working, but also humble and grateful guy he is. For someone who is self-proclaimed ""not a singer and not a dancer"" he really pulled off a beautifully convincing performance. He took singing lessons and did sing in the movie, but Freddie's voice was blended into his, with the edited result being mostly Freddie's voice coming through. He had Freddie's mannerisms down, his mouth movements, his sense of humour, his onstage energy and charm, and his sensitivity and vulnerability. I can't say enough good things about him. I'm so grateful for this movie because it turned me into a massive fan of both Rami AND Queen (most specifically Freddie)!<br/><br/>The movie had great flow and pace and I loved the editing, especially all the cuts during the performance scenes. It provided a feeling of great energy and felt like you were right there onstage with them or in the audience. I also loved some of the camera transitions they did like swish pans and match cuts. It was all very creative and fun. There's a scene near the beginning of the movie (the band's meeting with John Reid) that has been bashed online for it's poor editing and now people are saying the entire movie is terribly edited and are outraged that it won an Oscar for editing. It's like someone throws an idea out there and everyone runs with it like wildfire. I can guarantee the reason the movie won for editing is because of how perfectly the Live Aid sequence at the end of the movie matches that of the real one from 1985. There are comparison videos online and the similarities are mind-blowing, not only for the editing, but mostly for how Rami nailed Freddie's performance almost to a T! I'm also convinced that is what sealed the deal for Rami to win the best actor Oscar.<br/><br/>As for the criticisms this movie has had to constantly endure... I feel so disgusted by all of it. I don't know understand why so many people feel the need to tear it to shreds. Yes, the timelines of a lot of the events are mixed around and it showed a very tame PG version of Freddie's wild lifestyle, but why is that such a horrid thing? Something in the movie worked apparently because it made almost 1 billion $ worldwide, won 4 Oscars, and has a great rating on here.<br/><br/>I think it was very wise of them to make it suitable for all audiences because that is exactly how they raked in so much profit! Freddie endured so much hate from the press during his career for his flamboyant persona and sexuality that it would've been disrespectful to him if his bandmates allowed a ""smear piece"" to be made about him and his sexual indiscretions and drug use, without his approval or consent first..which was obviously not possible since he's not around.<br/><br/>This movie focused on Freddie as the musical genius he was, and provided us with enough information about his background and struggles in order to sympathize with him, but not too much to the point that it felt like a depressing pity party or that anything was unnecessarily gratuitous. I think it was very effective in its execution of that. I walked out of the theatre feeling uplifted and like I had just witnessed a true celebration of a great man and artist! Because of this movie, Queen's music has now simultaneously reached many generations, which is a very exciting thing.<br/><br/>I've seen some reviews of Rocketman, the Elton John biopic coming out in a few days, and there are some very unfair comparisons to Bo Rhap. One is how Rocketman, being a musical, challenges the traditional biopic storytelling/arc that Bo Rhap had, and that it is ""superior"" to it. My question is what is wrong with the traditional biopic format? Some people prefer that style of storytelling and some people would prefer a musical version. No one's opinion is right or wrong. It's all about what speaks to each individual person, and I personally was very touched by Bo Rhap, especially when it came to Freddie's humble beginnings, his relationship with Mary, him kind of losing sight of what was important, his AIDS diagnosis, and Queen's triumphant Live Aid performance.<br/><br/>People have also criticized the movie for not being completely accurate but this is a Hollywood movie, it's not a documentary. There are great Queen and Freddie documentaries out there that they can access if ""facts"" are that important to them. No biopic movie is completely 100% accurate. They're more for purposes of entertainment rather than education. It is the entertainment industry, after all.<br/><br/>So that's just some stuff I wanted to speak on. I've read so much hate for this movie ever since November, and it's gotten a little out of hand. How many awards, IMDb votes, and $ is a movie supposed to receive/make before people realize that they might've been wrong to judge it so harshly?<br/><br/>Funny how things have come full circle - Bohemian Rhapsody the song was a critical failure but the world loved it and now this movie is experiencing the exact same thing. Freddie is no doubt laughing at this!"
"laura-olivieri","6","2","3","18 May 2019"," Freddie
","Rami Malek was fantastic at playing Freddie Mercury but the film is missing in the plot that does not follow the story of the facts actually happened, but that takes liberties that do not benefit the plot."
"joaodossantos-89573","10","2","3","8 April 2019"," Review: Rami Malek ressurects Freddy Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody""
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" shows us the story of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, rock bands ever, in a very good film.
This amazing film tells the track that Queen had to become one of the greatest rock band ever. Every glorious, dissapointing, and difficulty moments that the band, and specially Freddy Mercury, had in their carrer.
Bryan Singer did a great job by directing this movie. His camera skills shows a lot of though fellings, specially Freddy Mercury's dramatic moments with his parents.
Rami Malek gives his best in this movie. He acts exactly iike Freddy Mercury in the most part of times. The talent he shows here proves why he deserved to win the Oscar. His acting is a masterpiece for sure.
The live shows parts are wonderful. The camera cuts, the cast acts, the crowd singing the songs, it all works in a beautiful way, that makes we feel like we are there. Also, Queen's show at Live Aid was incredibly represented in this film.
If you are a Queen fan, you MUST watch ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". If you are not a Queen fan, you MUST watch it also. This film is amazing and a Hollywood masterpiece. Please watch it, you wont be sorry for that."
"FultonDM","8","2","3","6 April 2019"," Gwilym Lee & Joseph Mazello under rated
","I can appreciate Rami Malek's performance in this movie. He did a good job of portraying Freddie Mercury, but Gwilym Lee and Joseph Mazzello have not gotten the praise they deserve for their spectacular portrayals of Brian May and John Deacon, respectively. I was absolutely blown away by their acting and their performances in this movie. If you were to watch the actual LiveAid performance of Queen at Wimbly and the movie's recreation leaving out Mercury and Malek you would be hard pressed to tell which one was which. The casting people nailed it with Lee and Mazello. They had the looks and the moves down to the letter. I was really impressed. I hope they don't get overlooked when the awards get handed out because they deserve high recognition for their impeccable roles. Well done!!"
"Gary010581","10","2","3","5 April 2019"," Very enjoyable watch on the large screen
","I watched this film in my cinema room on the large screen, and came to the conclusion that it lends itself to the large screen and has the ability to engage the viewer in a way watching it on a smaller screen might not do. I especially liked the live aid concert towards the end of the movie.
I thought the movie was even paced throughout, and that the portrayal of Freddie Mercury was particularly well done. Soundwise - excellent and once again benefiting from the large scale surround that a cinema is capable of."

","Okay, so I hardly ever give any movie a 10/10 because I believe that not many films out there are for everyone to enjoy, and when I first started watching Bohemian Rhapsody I'll admit I didn't know if it would match up with my love for Queen. Not everyone is in love with Queen either, so I didn't think the plot would be enjoyable for every viewer. However, Singer did an incredible job assuring that the storyline went deeper than just a fanatic movie about a band, and more specifically Freddie Mercury. The storyline touched general subjects of hope, aspiration, inspiration, and the hardships of life that I feel everyone can relate to on some level. The chemistry between the actors was raw and I felt there was a realistic mix of comedy and drama. Rami Malek especially blew me away with his stunning recreation of Freddie Mercury and I was so thoroughly impressed. I could really tell that the amount of thought and effort put into this film had a personal touch, and I don't think I have met one person who didn't enjoy watching this film. Well done to the cast and crew of Bohemian Rhapsody!"

","I sat down to write this review of BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY and had it nearly complete. But while typing I realized that what I was writing was a pat review, a listing of what takes place when with a small comment at the end. Like the movie I reflected and felt that the review needed to be better. I scrapped what was written and began again. While the movie is entertaining a part of me wished they had done the same thing.<br/><br/>Don't go into this movie thinking you're going to see a movie about the rock band Queen. This film is all about Freddy Mercury with Queen added in the mix. The makers of the film couldn't have picked a more popular person to make a biographical film about. Mercury's life lent itself to the big screen. He was larger than life and the legend of him as a quintessential rock star lives on.<br/><br/>The film follows him from humble beginnings to meeting the band as they are in search of a new lead singer. The right place at the right time. Heckled by the crowds expecting the band's previous incarnation Smile they're quickly won over when Mercury (Rami Malek) begins singing. He meets the love of his life Mary (Lucy Boynton) who he writes a song for titled just that, ""Love of My Life"".<br/><br/>While recording their first album on their own an executive hears what they have to offer and takes an interest. The band is given a chance to tour in Japan and a record deal follows. Here is where one of the first items comes into play that delves far from reality and into Hollywood style alterations of the truth. If you're a fan you'll notice it immediately. Songs are chosen randomly rather than how they were actually released making the story seem jumbled.<br/><br/>Mercury starts off as aloof and imposing, demanding his way when he can as a representation of the band. The band gets a tour of America and afterward begins work on a new album. While working on this one Mercury comes up with his grand experiment in creating something never done before, a 6 minute opus called ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". So different for a single at the time that the record executive the recorded the album for refuses to release it causing the band to walk out of his office.<br/><br/>The film moves forward after the first 30-45 minutes and then turns to a completely different story almost where Mercury begins experimenting with his bisexuality. A gay member of the band's entourage, Paul (Allen Leach) encourages his interest. This seemed forced into the film, as if Mercury was being coerced into the lifestyle rather than delving on his own. Admitting this to Mary results in her leaving him.<br/><br/>Success continues but at a cost. Mercury begins doing more drugs and experimenting with his sexuality. It becomes an issue with the press and he begins a slow downward spiral. After one concert Mary shows up to his joy only to then feel crushed when she introduces him to her new boyfriend. It isn't long before corporate big wigs come at him and offer him the chance to go solo. The offer angers him at first but eventually takes the offer, essentially breaking up the band.<br/><br/>Manipulated by Paul and living an extreme lifestyle which Paul takes full advantage of Mercury seems lost. This part of the film takes up far too much time and results in the well-known fact that Mercury eventually contracts AIDS. As we near the end of the film the band reunites to play at Live Aid, the most successful reunion to ever take place.<br/><br/>So what works? The fact that we're hearing about the band works. The performances all around are well done. Malik has been singled out but each member of the band (Gwilym Lee as Brian May, Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor and Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon) are exceptional as well and underused. As for Malik I don't think this is an Oscar worthy performance in spite of his being nominated. The majority of the film feels like a caricature of the man and it isn't until the last 45 minutes or so that his performance changes for the better.<br/><br/>In the end I neither hated nor loved the film. It's not one I'm likely to revisit. This is the music of my youth, the band being popular in my high school and college years. The end of the film will cause many to find themselves wiping away tears, I found myself that way and the loss of what could have been and a man who died too young at 45. But it did make me go back and listen to their music again. Perhaps that will be the legacy of this film, that it will make people rediscover Queen. In a time of programmed music we can only hope."

"sailor-mac-43282","10","2","3","31 January 2019"," A biopic that actually LIKES its subject
","Plenty has been said about this very special film already, so I'll just focus on what I think makes it truly unique. Most showbiz biopics very obviously hold their subject in contempt. There's a lot of dwelling on the negatives in the person's life - a lot of scenes of sex-drugs-rock and roll, temper tantrums, diva moments, etc. The film is usually saying, ""Yes, this person accomplished great things, but he/she was an ABSOLUTE RAT! Don't you feel superior to him/her?"" Not this film. It doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of Freddie Mercury's life, but it doesn't wallow in them, either. Instead, it focuses on the positives - the way iconic songs were created, the friendships between the band members - and there's a healthy dose of humor. (Ben Hardy, who's the focus of the funniest scenes, is the unsung hero of this film. Rami Malek may be the captain of this ship, but Hardy is definitely the first mate). Remarkably for a film set in the music industry of the '70s and '80s, there isn't a single shot of a person doing a rail of coke. A whitewash? Maybe. But you get the impression that the filmmakers were saying, ""That's not what was important. This guy's personality and his relationships with the people closest to him? THAT is important."" You leave the theater feeling positive and uplifted - because even though it ends on a sad note (Freddie's AIDS diagnosis), it goes out with warmth - his reconciliation with his parents and his legendary Live Aid performance. You end up thinking that Freddie might have had his issues, but in the end? He was an okay guy. And his bandmates? They were okay guys, too. Combine that positivity with the acting quality, the sharp writing and Queen's incredible music and you have an unbeatable package. No wonder people see this over and over - I plan to as well."

"vinylvanilla","5","2","3","29 January 2019"," A movie that had potential but looks and feels like a boring TV biopic
","Amid the controversy regarding Bryan Singer and the scandals he's involved, I will try to stay away from the accusations to give my most neutral review on Bohemian Rhapsody.<br/><br/>I have never been a huge fan of Singer's work - his best work was definitely ""The Usual Suspects"" with its non-linear narrative, but after that he's basically specialized himself in directing superhero and action movies, that basically rely on boring and linear narratives, so I think he's lost the ability to shoot an interesting movie again. I honestly don't understand the hype of Bohemian Rhapsody, and I really think people are mistaking their love for Queen with the love for this movie.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody unfortunately commits this sin - its linear, predictable narrative makes the movie boring, looking almost like a TV biopic. Freddie Mercury's story is summarized in a very reckless way - parts that could have been shown (such as the years when Freddie lived in Munich, Germany and worked a lot with David Bowie) or more properly developed (the creation of Bohemian Rhapsody, Freddie's relationship with Paul and Mary, Freddie's bohemian parties and lush lifestyle, etc) were basically ignored or portrayed in a very flat, emotionless way. Not even the part where Freddie finds out he's got AIDS was touching - it look amateurish, bland, just like something from a cheap TV biopic.<br/><br/>Those who haven't read or known more about Freddie Mercury will never feel, by solely watching this movie, what a larger-than-life figure Freddie was. He had a very strong, flamboyant personality, with a lifestyle that matched his epic attitude - and the movie fails to show that. Here, Freddie is just a lead singer - a very talented one, by the way - and nothing else. A talented singer with no soul - that's what the movie shows, and that's nothing close to what the real Freddie Mercury was. I also question the need to reenact the Live Aid concert - we can watch the original performance on YouTube at any time, why the need to make actors reenact it? Those were several minutes wasted in the movie, minutes that could have been used developing better other parts and elements of Freddie's life and personality. I honestly think the movie would have ended in a better and more interesting way with the following final scene - Freddie steps on the stage at the Live Aid concert and sees the enormous audience praising him, sits by the piano and starts playing Bohemian Rhapsody. At the first notes, screen goes black and the credits begin with the song in the background.<br/><br/>Casting wise, I wish a stronger-looking actor was cast to play Freddie - though Rami Malek did a great job in a disappointing movie, physically speaking he doesn't send off the strength and physical charisma that Freddie had. I have to praise Rami for being the only interesting element that made me keep watching this movie - though I still think he wasn't the best choice for the part and his teeth were absurdly exaggerated (which kind of annoyed me) - I have to acknowledge that he did his best with a poorly written character in a poorly written plot - he studied very well Freddie's gestures and could imitate them perfectly, his acting was decent and his presence is undeniable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is a movie that had a lot of potential, but that fell flat into a boring narrative, weak plot and a very summarized biopic of Freddie Mercury. It's a pity that Bryan Singer didn't use the flamboyant personality of Freddie Mercury as an inspiration to shoot a more poetic, artistic movie with more daring shots and visual elements that unfortunately were absent in this work."

","The film opens in London 1970 with Freddy working at Heathrow. In two hours it touches on the main aspects of his life, including his bisexuality and love for Mary (Lucy Boynton). The film concludes with the Live Aid concert where Rami Malek does a horrible lip sync. Rami Malek reminded me more of Mick Jagger than Freddie Mercury. In spite of my criticism, it would be difficult to find someone else more fitting for a difficult role who manages to break down the complexity. I was glued to the screen for the entire showing...singing along.<br/><br/>Guide: 1 F-word. British swear words. No sex or nudity."

"andrewmerritt-31652","7","2","3","27 January 2019"," As a fan of Queen i enjoyed this.
","Bohemian Rhapsody tells the history of how the British rock band Queen was created and it also tells the life of Freddie Mercury played by Rami Malek. I listened to Queen and I thought they were good, but I wasn't a fan. And then I watched Wayne's World and they played Bohemian Rhapsody and I remember listening to them and I have been a fan ever since. Funny enough Mike Myers was in Wayne's World and he's in Bohemian Rhapsody as well. That's just a little trivia of the day. And let's be honest who hasn't head banged to that drum solo, I know I have. Rami Malek nails it as Freddie Mercury that for the whole movie I thought that was Freddie Mercury and not Rami Malek. If the movie were bad, I still would've walked out of the theatre admitting that Rami Malek carried the film from start to finish. Even if you like Queen, or your not a fan of Queen, its really interesting these four random people with nothing in common got together and decided to form one of the most iconic rock n' roll bands today. But Bohemian Rhapsody does get confusing, but not awkward. The movie focuses on Freddie Mercury's life and the title is one of their songs so it gets confusing on which side should this focus on that I was left in the middle. One part of me is glad that they choose to focus on Freddie Mercury's life as we get to find out more about him, and the other one wants that part to focus on their songs that they didn't cover. And as much as I love Queen, there are way too many songs by them that are crammed in this two and half hour movie. I'm not talking about the songs that they come up with, but the whole soundtrack is their song and that's it. No other bands like Credence Clearwater Revival, Led Zeppelin, The Who, just Queen where I asked myself I know that this is supposed to be about the history of Queen, but do we really all their songs in this? The balancing could've been done better, but with what everyone did they have given us a biographical film about Freddie Mercury, while at the same time not going into too much detail about his life and also saving room for the history of Queen as well. So overall, this is a fun movie to watch if your fan of Queen like myself, but its still worth the watch even if you don't like Queen. And also say what you will about the movie, you have to give credit to Rami Malek, because he absolutely destroys it as Freddie Mercury."

","Another film I'm late to review, I wondered if I should even bother reviewing Bohemian Rhapsody, simply because I have nothing fresh to add the wave of mediocre and decent reviews but nonetheless here we are.<br/><br/>The film isn't anything special, there are definitely special aspects such as the subject matter and Rami Malek's committed performance but the overall outcome is a sadly mundane biopic that doesn't have the extra star power to make this viewing nothing more then ordinary.<br/><br/>The performances are decently committed with Malek of course being the highlight but one should not forget Gwilym Lee and Lucy Boynton who are arguably the backbone of the entire picture. Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Ace Bhatti and Tom Hollander also are worthy of mention with their solid supporting roles.<br/><br/>Technically it's a solid film yet again nothing really special of mentioning. Live Aid and perhaps this is because I was not of the generation wasn't as epic and stunning as previously reported, especially with some dodgy cgi work.<br/><br/>The entire picture just fell a bit flat, some scenes were so heavily edited (not the musical sequences which were edited to perfection) but the more intimate moments between characters just couldn't help but cut back and forth for honestly quite pointless reaction shots when they should've just let the camera hold for a little longer without cutting.<br/><br/>I also wanted to know more, instead of fleshing out (arguably the more boring aspects of Queen's rise) the film decides to just fall into biopic cliches. Before writing this review I took a look at the many inaccuracies the film provided and it's just a tad shameful.<br/><br/>A film about Freddie Mercury needs to be a film that Mercury himself would be rushing to see, yes the performances are decent, the music of course is great but that's thanks to the band., the film arguably doesn't deserve the music provided by the great band.<br/><br/>I do need to give credit where it's due, the picture went through a hell of production woes and it's a damn good achievement that a film this cohesive is even on our screens but all in all Mr Mercury wouldn't be rushing to see this anytime soon and I can understand why."

","I cried during watching a movie that shows the very beginnings of the music band Queen, the emergence of their popular songs, the world tour and a series of difficulties they faced both as people and as artists, but who managed to master it. The film concludes with the spectacular performance of Freddie Mercury in the Live Aid concert organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to help the hungry in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>On July 13, 1985, Geldof and Ure organized Live Aid, a huge event was held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. Thanks to an unprecedented decision by the BBC to clear its schedules for 16 hours of rock music, the event was also broadcast live in the UK on television and radio. It was one of the most monumental stage shows in history, with Phil Collins flying on Concorde so that he could play at both Wembley and Philadelphia the same day. It is now estimated that around £150 million in total has been raised for hunger relief as a direct result of the concerts.<br/><br/>Now I have more than 50 years, and with joy I remember that I watched that concert in Yugoslavia in direct satellite transmission. This excellent film, with great acting from Rami Malek, I experience in a very deep emotional way. I want to watch it again.<br/><br/>Are you ready, Freddie? Run for Oscar, Freddie. Run!"

Mainly, just a warning....When seeing this, the previews included a movie about Elton John, ""Rocketman"". I predict this will become a new genre of popular movies; rehashes of music stars of the 60's/70's/80's.
I can just see a Jimi Hendrix movie, another Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, even a Kiss movie and more! This is not all bad if it gets new audiences into the classic rock music. However, most bands and musicians are simply not that interesting in their personal lives.

There are important things about the band's history that are missing here, some of them came outta nowhere (like after they made the first album of the band that was called Queen, they skipped everything that happened with Queen 2, and they go directly to the release of Killer Queen) and also some data was wrong (like when they say that Freddie got angry with the band, so he went to record his solo album.

"bbewnylorac","8","2","3","7 December 2018"," This is a fantastic biopic
","I had low expectations of this movie. What could it possibly have to say that was new about Queen? Purists have criticised how it's not perfectly historically correct. But I found it very entertaining, and crisply directed, written and edited and with impeccable costume and set design.
The songs are beautifully slotted in to the story, either in the studio, being composed at home, or in live performance.
The writers follow the band from when they were formed in 1970 till 1985 when they performed at Live Aid. They somehow effectively choose what to leave in and what to leave out in Queen's sprawling history. The story flows well, although that means not always slavishly following what happened in real life. So what? It's not a documentary.
And what about the casting? Whoever was in charge of that should get a medal. The actors playing band members Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are so eerily similar in looks, voices and demeanour that you'd swear it actually was them.
But the actors do actually act their roles and don't rely on their looks to carry the film.
As lead singer Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek isn't an exact likeness. But Mercury was such an unusual person that that would be a hard ask. Instead, Malek does an excellent job in portraying Mercury's quiet determination to get into the band Queen, and to get his musical ideas taken up, no matter how weird they may seem at first, such as Bohemian Rhapsody.
I love the scene where he boldly approaches May and Taylor about becoming lead singer. Even though Mercury is quite shy and modest, he rustles up enough courage to sing to them. And he gets up on stage, can't use the microphone properly, but belts out the songs beautifully.
And the band are such an affectionate, respectful and tight unit that they generally support one another, although there are tiffs, such as over Another One Bites the Dust because some members don't like disco.
I love the scene where their new manager, John Reid, asks what makes Queen so special over other bands, and they point out that they're a group of misfits, whose audience are also outsiders. It's later pointed out that Freddie was an Indian Zoroastrian baggage handler from Zanzibar, Brian was an astrophysics student, Roger was a dental student and John Deacon was an electrical engineer. All geeks who were willing to try different styles of music, and who somehow stuck together for more than 20 years.
If there's a villain, it's Mercury's personal assistant, Paul, who (according to the band's version, that's taken up in the movie) kept Freddie in a partying lifestyle away from his friends and family, and who ultimately 'outs' Mercury as promiscuous and gay to the media. The latter did actually happen, albeit in newspaper interviews, not TV, and Malek probably doesn't portray quite enough how distressing this must have been for Mercury. Instead, Malek just watches, in total shock.
The Live Aid performance is spectacularly good. The directors try and convey how immersively fantastic it must have been to be in that incredible crowd, singing along to all the lyrics, and clapping and doing the movies to songs like Radio Ga Ga and We Will Rock You.
The movie is quite prudish with no drugs and no sex scenes - it just shows Freddie kissing a man, and going to gay discos, and wearing leather.
Malek doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Lucy Boynton, who plays Mercury's fiancee, Mary Austin. Austin doesn't get much character development, apart from that she works at Biba dress shop and her father is deaf. But I think it was well potrayed how Mercury gradually becomes aware of his attraction to men, tries to ignore and suppress it, then gradually walks towards it. I love the scene where Mercury tracks down a gay acquaintance, Jim Hutton, who years ago had made an impression on Mercury, but knew Mercury wasn't ready for a gay relationship.
Overall, this is a very good movie."

Given the legendary status of Queen - and especially Freddie - it's a shame, that the film doesn't take more risks.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the setting and direction is good, film is full of energy, casting is great, the music is divine and Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury is (despite some limitations) outstanding.<br/><br/>The film definitely isn't any masterpiece or historically accurate, but it serves well as a simple memento of undying musical legend(s)."
"JaydoDre","7","2","3","20 November 2018"," The story is a missed opportunity and lowers the overall value
","The main show here is Malek. This movie is his masterpiece. His energetic antics on stage, his accent, his prosthetic buck teeth and his tragic tension bring Freddie Mercury to life. He is the most interesting thing in this movie, as he should be. The second most interesting thing is everyone else's performance, especially Ben Hardy's, playing Roger Taylor.<br/><br/>The last thing that stands out is the historical polish. The 70's and 80's are faithfully recreated, along with all the Freddie's funky clothes. The flying camera shots of the giant crowd at the Live Aid concert are impressive. This is all somewhat expected, considering the film's high budget.<br/><br/>But that is where the interesting things end, unfortunately. All the other aspects of the film are good, but to me, nothing else stands out enough to justify the standing ovation that this movie seems to be receiving from the public.<br/><br/>The story, in particular, is one big missed opportunity. It would have been interesting to see Freddie's development as a singer in his younger days, perhaps his flight from his country of birth. There is none of that. Once Freddie meets the band, he is already the perfect singer. From then on, it's a steady rise upward and the film ends at the top of Queen's fame. There is drama towards the end, but that drama is touched upon lightly and treated like a nuisance in an otherwise awesome hall of awesomeness.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting historical moments with regard to Queen was the release of the fatalistic song The Show Must Go On right in the middle of the rumours about the singer's health. None of that either. That songs gets played during the credits.<br/><br/>The part of the story about the break-up of the band feels like it's been taken out of a cheesy kids' movie about a teenage band and the dialogue is appropriately cheesy.<br/><br/>In short, this film is about great performances and it is a nice audio-visual treat for those who are interested in the band. Malek's performance is well worth the price of admission. There is, however, little else of note."

"Thrashman88","8","2","3","19 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody WILL rock you!
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a nice, if heavily sanitized biopic about Queen's legendary singer, Freddie Mercury and the rest of the band. Although it plays a bit of hanky panky in the timeline department, those in the audience who know little about the band's history won't surely mind. The casting Rami Malek as Mercury was spot on, although I do believe that Sacha Baron Cohen (the producers original choice to play the legendary singer) would've been even more spot on due to his much closer resemblance to Freddie. The rest of the cast was also perfectly cast: Gwilym Lee DOES look like Brian May and Joseph Mazzello IS John Deacon (to the point of limiting himself to only utter one-liners and be, like the real John, mostly in the background of things). Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor is physically less convincing but more that makes up for it with his amusing performance.
This be said, and I'm sorry if I sound obvious, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a movie FOR the Queen fan, even the casual fans. If you're not a fan of Queen or hard rock it's less likely to fire you up. I grew up with Queen, so in my case I enjoyed it very much despite some historical innacurracies (which Brian May and Roger Taylor eventually gave their concent to).<br/><br/>The film is basically one huge build up to its ""Live Aid"" finale. It would've been interesting to see the aftermath of Live Aid and how the band functioned normally for almost 6 more years, but the movie would've ended on a downbeat.<br/><br/>Hearing Queen's greatest songs on a movie theater's speakers will definitely send shivers down your spine!
Great, solid entertainment in an era where we will hardly see another band as massive as Queen."
"aayushsapra-51923","8","2","3","18 November 2018"," Wanted more expressions from Rani else it's a classic like the Queen's
","Never heard about Bohemain Rahpsody before. Lately, I was seeing so manyt posts about Bohemian Rhapsody on social media so curiosity kicked and learned more about them. Figured it's the band which owns "" We will rock you"". Deep dived and instantly fell in love with the band and their music.<br/><br/>Their lead singer Freddie Mercury, what an freakishly amazing and iconic performer he was. Just saw the movie Bohemian Rhapsody and I am here to express my views for the people who are going to watch it. The movie is extraordinary with showing a roller-coster journey of the Queen's, also has many goosebumps moment, one being my favorite, during the Live Aid when Freddie says ""Alright"". The actor Rami Malik has done an extraordinary job though he is missing on some of Freddie's expressive styles on the stage. Also, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello were amazing in their roles.<br/><br/>The movie was a delight for me to watch. May or may not be accurate to the facts but is a sure shot classic. Go buy the ticket and watch it now!"
"RNMorton","8","2","3","18 November 2018"," Good biopic
","Well done, surprisingly conventional telling of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Malik gives 110% in his portrayal of the flamboyant(!) lead singer, and the rest of the band is also very capably played. There was a little something off with this that I just couldn't identify, something that could be fairly easily corrected but wasn't. I don't know that they fully projected Freddie's enormous live presence, and honestly some of the concert scenes were so obviously CGI-enhanced it detracted from the moment. Where the sequence of events is important I'm a stickler, and I must say this film falsely presented the juxtaposition of some key events, but to avoid a spoiler I'll leave it at that. Despite all of the above, a better-than-average film."
"srastogi-90935","8","2","3","17 November 2018"," Electrifying biopic, a must watch for Queen's lovers!
","A gripping musical extravaganza. Must watch for all Queen/Freddie Mercury's fans. Rami Malek has given an excellent performance as Freddie, the rock and role star of 80's. Initial half is little slower making you think if this is how complete movie going to be, but then it starts picking the pace and pulls you in it. Best part is reunion performance of Queen in Wembley Stadium, which itself is good enough reason to watch this movie. Would have loved to see live performance of song 'I want to break free', which was shown in a small clip using official video. Very good movie! Go for it if you are fan of 80s rock and roll songs."
"Tss5078","8","2","3","16 November 2018"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","I never really liked the rock band Queen, and as far as it's front-man, all I really knew was that he was the first superstar to die from AIDS. Knowing this, I feared that this film would be just another Philadelphia, and I was hesitant to see it. That is until the reviews of Rami Malek's career defining performance were released. To my surprise and delight this film wasn't just about Freddy Mercury's lifestyle nor was it about the way he tragically died. Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that not only parallels the life of Mercury, but it also shows everything that goes into making a successful band. From their humble beginnings to the process of how music is made, what it's inspirations are, what goes into making an album, and finally to the internal conflicts involved with the different personalities in a band. Bohemian Rhapsody illustrates better than any film I have ever seen, what it truly means to be part of a successful band. As for it's star, Mr. Robot's Rami Malek proves in one foul swoop that he is so much more than simply a TV drama star. His performance was far and away the best I've seen all year, and even though we're a long way away from Academy Award nominations, if Malek's name isn't at the top of that list, it will be an unmitigated outrage. Not only does Malek nail the performance, but he is Freddy Mercury right down to his mannerisms. To be honest, if Freddy Mercury were still alive and starred in this film, I don't think even he'd be as convincing as Malek was. The film is truly a performance that will be talked about for decades, but what about the film itself? Being that music is a huge part of my life, I found everything to be very interesting and informative, but others could see it as slow moving and somewhat boring. Some of the choices Bryan Singer made could be questioned, such as showing the entire Live Aid performance, all twenty minutes of it. Yes, it is an important part of the Queen story, but to show the whole thing in a feature film? Overall, I thought this film was terrific and even if you aren't into the music and aren't a fan of Queen, you need to see this film for nothing else than the performance of it's star. Performances like this one are what gives films the title of classic and are talked about and studied forever."

"Dollhousehorror","7","2","3","13 November 2018"," This band was Freddie
","I loved the movie don't get me wrong, but I feel like they wanted to make Freddie into a villain and into this huge a-hole. I don't know personally if he was or wasn't, but I feel like the band mates wanted to be seen in a good light and like every issue they had was Freddie's fault. To me Freddie was the first male diva, and you know what, he deserves to be that diva. I feel like Sasha Baron Cohen got it right when he talked about how we wanted to just see Freddie and not the whole band, because they liked it or not, he was the face, the soul and the heart of that band. They wouldn't even be Queen if not for him."

","Bohemian Rhapsody had great music, an excellent performance my Rami Malek and creates an amazing atmosphere that makes viewers feel like they are at the concerts. It is this incredible combination that makes Bohemian Rhapsody such an enjoyable and entertaining watch.<br/><br/>While the film definitely delivers whenever Queen were performing, they can't always be on stage and whenever they are not I can only say the the pacing is slow at times and may even seem formulaic. How many times have we seen a movie about a band that hits every checkpoint as they do in Bohemian Rhapsody. You got the simple pattern of, 'formation of band, label disapproval, success, descension, lead goes away, lead fails and abuses drugs, returns to sing kumbaya. I mean, seriously, outside of the eccentricity that is Freddy Mercury brought alive through Malek's performance, the rest of the movie can be seen as quite a drag.<br/><br/>But, the movie still got me singing along and on an absolute Queen craze afterwards, so I guess they did something right."

"msbreviews","8","2","3","6 November 2018"," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>I didn't know anything about how this movie was performing in the box office or how critics were receiving it. I was blown away with the number of mixed reviews because I genuinely didn't expect so many divisive opinions. This is one of the best films of the year, even if I do have a couple of issues with it, but apparently, a lot of people can't even positively review it, giving it terrible reputation.<br/><br/>So, where can I start? Let's go with Rami Malek. Everyone knows an Oscar nomination is coming, but right now, he's the top contender to win the award, maybe tied with Bradley Cooper. If you watch Mr. Robot, you know the ability Rami has to turn himself into a completely different person, incorporating his character's personality like very few other actors can do.<br/><br/>From the surprising physical similarity with Freddie Mercury to every tiny little detail of how he moved, talked or sang, Rami nails his role. His presence on stage extraordinarily resembles Freddie's, and his attitude is incredibly alike. As expected, he carries the entire movie on his shoulders, but he does receive help from an amazing cast, who provide undeniable chemistry which delivered some great moments.<br/><br/>Gwilym Lee (Brian May), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) complete the band and Queen are born. The interactions between the four members are priceless and extremely entertaining. From the funny banter to the most emotional and dramatic scenes, Bryan Singer does a great job directing the actors on what and how they should do certain bits.<br/><br/>The most common negative that a lot of critics are pointing out is the fact that the film doesn't delve deep into Freddie's personal life. Honestly, those reviews seem so out-of-place that they remembered me of the First Man's issue with not showing the American flag on the Moon. These two themes have nothing to do with the purpose of each movie's story. Bohemian Rhapsody is a musical biopic of one of the biggest bands of all-time.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's always going to address its lead singer's life. Every film needs a protagonist. With that in mind, I think Anthony McCarten's screenplay is very well-balanced. It doesn't go in-depth with Freddie's issues with the last years of his life, and that was definitely a good call. His memory has to be respected and honored, not trashed by a movie who wanted to make him look like a male prostitute.<br/><br/>Actually, that is one of my minor problems with the film. In the third act, too much time is wasted with Freddie's life and him dealing with his own sexuality, drugs and everything else. A part of it should have been cut and its time given to develop the band's backstory, and continue with one of the movie's best attributes: the songs' lyrics. Learning why and how the lyrics for so many famous songs came together is a blessing and something I won't ever forget. I was already a Queen's fan (who isn't?!), but now I'm even more.<br/><br/>So, story and genre-wise, I think Bryan Singer was able to produce a success. I wasn't bothered by some less positive points in the screenplay, and as a musical biopic, I love it. They took Queen's music and used it as a fantastic soundtrack. One that creates so many epic and memorable moments that I can't wait to watch again at home. Every major song is powerfully delivered, whether by a stage performance (sadly, the lip-sync could be a lot better) or in a recording studio.<br/><br/>The build-up for one of the biggest shows of all-time (if not, THE one) is remarkably well-executed and those final 15-20 minutes of the film are chill-inducing. I felt like crying, but my excitement and enthusiasm was so much that I just couldn't. Like I wrote above, the lip-sync didn't always work throughout the movie, but in this last concert, it was seamless. Visually and sound-wise, it's one of the most impactful musical moments of cinema of the last few years.<br/><br/>I just wish they allocated more time to the remaining members of the band and to the group itself. Freddie Mercury is the front and center of the story, but Queen has to surpass that. Technically, I can't seem to find any missteps. Tonally well-balanced, the pacing is adequate, and the sound editing and mixing are exceptional. Watched this film on Dolby Atmos for the first time and I didn't regret it!<br/><br/>All in all, Bohemian Rhapsody is a beautiful musical biopic of one of the biggest bands of all-time and its unbelievable lead singer. Rami Malek books himself an Oscar ticket and maybe even a golden statue due to its perfect representation of Freddie Mercury. With a great chemistry, the cast delivers a lot of entertaining moments, both musically and dramatically. Brilliant use of an incredible soundtrack which culminates on an epic reenactment of the famous 1985's show. Just wished that more time would have been given to the rest of the band and the band itself, plus some better filmed lip-sync. Minor issues that don't overwhelm (not by a long shot) a well-written story and an excellent direction from Bryan Singer. Go see it and enjoy!"

"Samhain-Halloween","8","2","3","5 November 2018"," Way Better Than Expected
","I'm a huge Queen and Freddie Mercury fan, and a bit of a snob when it comes to portrayals of Freddie/the band. Even though I knew that Brian May and Roger Taylor were intimately involved in the movie, I was worried it was going to suck because it's just so hard to do justice to a band and a person that were so larger than life. Malek is wonderful as Mercury. Gwilym Lee played Brian May so well that a couple of times I couldn't tell the difference between he and May. Mazello played Deacon really well, especially 80s Deaky. Ben Hardy was perfectly ""meh.""<br/><br/>Two glaring issues I saw: The scene where Brian tells the band about his idea for WWRY, Freddie in the scene has short hair and a mustache. WWRY was written in '77 though, while Freddie didn't adopt his short hair and mustache until 1980. Also, there is a scene where Freddie is describing to Mary how amazing it was to sing ""Love Of My Life"" in front of an audience (in Brazil). Well, that scene took place somewhere in the mid-70s (Freddie and Mary were still together, and he still had long hair!), but Queen didn't tour South America until 1981's The Game Tour.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me understand the reason for both inaccuracies. I understand the ""artistic licence"" aspect of these kinds of movies, but what was the point in mixing up these timelines? It couldn't have been a mere oversight, since Brian May and Roger Taylor were both creative consultants for the film (unless they happened to miss both of these scenes), right? Otherwise, I can't come up with a compelling reason for mixing up these timelines. Most casual observers probably wouldn't notice these flaws, but both slightly spoiled the experience for me. Still, it's very solid movie, and as a ""Queenie,"" I can't get enough of the band!"

","I would have wished that they would have shown harder times in terms of music production and claim to fame. Like the vibes the trailer gave. But I think this movie was brilliant.

","When i entered the cinema, i had to lowest my expectations. And, after the last concert i cant even blink my eyes. Thats beautiful, even though they can't describe the hole queen band but Freddie Mercury life hit me so hard. I know his life before from literature i read, but when i see it i believe he is the real legend, the one and the only one. Love it"
"catalinna99","10","2","3","5 November 2018"," definitely best movie i watched this year
","As a queen fan, i had my expectations, my doubts and some curiosity since i've first heard about this movie, back in summer. just came back from the theatre, i'm still bawling my eyes out, this was everything i could ever ask for, and so much more. it's seriously SO great. rami malek's performance is flawless, as well as others'.
i am gonna watch it multiple times for sure."
"mahardikaitokid","10","2","3","5 November 2018"," EPIC MASTERPIECE!!
","I just watched it today,and honestly...
This Is Beyond My Expectation!!<br/><br/>Rami Malek really nailed it as Freddie Mercury,and he's the showstealer in this movie.
The story build up is also awesome,but the accuracy of the story is questionable.<br/><br/>Overall,This movie is one of the best movie of all time and really recommended for those who is fans of the Queen or not."
"banuyagmurlu","9","2","3","5 November 2018"," A legend to remember
","Best movie of this year according to me no surprise as I was/am a huge fan. The acting performances were astonishing not just Rami but the rest of the band as well. I was moved cried laughed and my heart melted time to time. I have been listening to Queen since the movie (2 days in a row now and will continue some more I assume :) I felt lucky to be born in their era as there is nothing like them at the present. The only thing came to my mind as a con is this. Why didn't Rami used brown contact lenses? Then it would be a perfection."
"MarkyLouiG","8","2","3","5 November 2018"," Queen always delivers
","Bohemian Rhapsody is the story of how the band Queen, came to be and the story of Freddie Mercury.
The thing that definitely stood out in the film was Rami Malek, his performance was outstanding. He didn't just play a character but he brought Freddie Mercury to life. From the way he moved to how he spoke he definitely embodied Queen's frontman. Now biopics are in general difficult to do especially because you are recreating the life of a person, I thought the film did a great job but it was a little
lacklustre. This was evident in the 3rd act of the film, everything went too fast
unabling the audience to fully connect to the film.
All in all I enjoyed the film immensely it could've been better if it took its time so the audience could connect even further to the life of Freddie Mercury. With that being set, this is still an outstanding film."
"steve-82731","9","2","3","4 November 2018"," The critics are wrong once again!! Fantastic Film

"ldh-31427","10","2","3","4 November 2018"," Absolutely EPIC
","I've been waiting almost a year for this film and went opening night. It exceeded my expectations! Were there plot holes? Yes. But nothing that compromised the beauty and tragedy that was Freddie. Malik's spot on performance is Oscar worthy and all of the secondary characters were superb. It's uncanny how much they resemble their real life counterparts. The music is the icing on a magnificently decorated cake of excess, creativity & nonconformity. Run, don't walk to see this movie!"
"manutza","9","2","3","4 November 2018"," The best music band movie!
","A film to watch for all music lovers, not only for Queen lovers. It shows, for me, the true genius of music and how they created such special songs, loved by many and blamed by others. It also has a drop of humor, that makes this movie more complete.
Rami was absolutely fantastic in this role. He got so good in Freddy's shoes that it gave me goosebumps. I recommend you this movie, it will remain in your heart. It has everything you wanna see in a music band movie."
"chantalroxanne","10","2","3","4 November 2018"," Moving, entertaining and inspiring
","I am and have always been a big Queen fan, so this could either be a huge hit or a terrible miss. As you can see by my rating, this was a fantastic movie that exceeded my expectations.
The story is being told in an entertaining yet moving way and the acting blew me away. Rami Malek should win an Oscar for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury!
Whether you're a fan of the music or not, this movie is a must-see for everybody."
"andyhain","Null","2","3","4 November 2018"," Seen in XD - pretty Good!
","Saw BR in XD (one of 5 so far during 2018) and this seemed like a worthwhile expenditure. Malek gives about as good an impersonation as you'll ever see! Good production values."
"AmyJenson1995","10","2","3","4 November 2018"," Chills through my spine!
","OMG I can't say how much hyped I am right now. As a huge Queen and Freddie fan, I have been waited for years to finally see that movie. And I did yesterday!<br/><br/>All I can say is WOW! This movie got me chills throughout my spine especially the Live Aid reenactment which left me in awe completely mesmerized! It was just perfect and if I was already envying the very blessed ones who had the chance to see that performance live, I do it even more this morning! If Freddie would still be among us today, he would have loved Bohemian Rhapsody!<br/><br/>I have to thank Rami Malek for his amazing performance as Freddie. He was just above great throughout the movie. He's truly worth an Oscar for it as he nailed it. I already loved him as Snafu in the Pacific but him as Freddie is from another level. The actors who played the rest of the band were as great especially the one playing Brian. I couldn't distinguish him from the original as they share a striking resemblance. Lucy Boynton is so gracious as Mary, Freddie's love of his life. Joseph Mazzello gave me another image of John as the real one was so reserved and shy and we see him in the movie joking even sometimes taking the lead. That was refreshing. Ben Hardy was also awesome as Roger Taylor and I could feel that even if he clashed a lot with Freddie in the movie, he cared deeply about him.<br/><br/>Now of course you have the music. I don't want to break the magic as it was obvious they used the real Freddie's recordings to match Rami's game which itself is quite a performance. But Rami had some chances to sing in real and he has a pretty good voice. Maybe he should start a singer career when he's done with acting.<br/><br/>But again the real big moment of this movie is the Live Aid at the very end and this movie deserves the biggest praise just for those final moments as it's just pure bliss! I have chills throughout the performance and I had the feeling I was back in time watching the Queen Epic performance that day right in the Stadium! That was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I don't want to spoil the moment but trust me it's something you're gonna love as it shows the true power and aura of Freddie Mercury. I'm pretty sure younger people will love to see the real performance back home from the theater!<br/><br/>On another note, sure the sexuality of Freddie is mentioned several times in the movie and you see Rami kissing guys a time or two but it was never a center part of the movie. Actually it's more focused on his love story with Mary even when they broke up. Aids is mentioned too but not in the negative way as it actually brought the very good of Freddie as he decided to focus the last years of his life to Music and Rock'n'roll and give his best no matter what!<br/><br/>So Go see that movie it will blow your mind! And if it doesn't get an Oscar wave this year, I will lose my trust to Hollywood."

"chris-227-22257","8","2","3","4 November 2018"," Good movie but fragmented music
","Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie BUT not great. More Queen songs could have lifted this movie to greatness but instead songs were limited and fragmented or even pushed to the background to support dialogues. This includes Bohemian Rhapsody which was unfortunately as well chopped up in pieces throughout the movie and should have been one complete piece to do it full justice"
"bhilbern","8","2","3","4 November 2018"," It is difficult to like this movie
","I am a huge fan of Queen. I've seen them in concert twice, I had every album, I read every book, and saw every documentary. When I saw this movie I had to separate reality from fiction. Much of this movie is fiction. The fiction made me walk out of the movie initially but the quality and my desire to hear the music brought me back. This is not a true story but rather it is based on a true story. I had to come to this realization. There are so many inconsistencies such as the way Freddie and Jim met, the way he told Mary he was bisexual, Queen didn't reunite for Live Aid (they had just finished a world tour and had only been apart for 2 months and I know this because I saw them), Live Aid wasn't their ""swan song"". They had two more albums and and more hit songs. In fact, they released Radio Ga-Ga (a top 10 hit) well after Live Aid.<br/><br/>I would have liked for them to have delved into the lives of Brian May and Roger Taylor. It's amazing that Roger was on his way to being a dentist and Brian was working on his PhD in Astrophysics when the band became successful. How many lead guitarist of a mega huge rock band have a bloody PhD?<br/><br/>Freddie was an interesting man. He was a shy introvert who came alive on the stage. He was embarrassed by his overbite and would hide it with his hands or cover with his lips and not smile but yet he was so proud of his overbite because he believed it gave him a four octave voice. He was madly in love with a woman but his sexual desires drew him to men. Even though he knew about AIDS and knew it would kill him, because it already killed a close friend, he still lived a promiscuous lifestyle.<br/><br/>I don't know if Freddie would have liked this movie but I am happy that the rest of the band does. In the end I have come to accept this movie with the liberties taken with the true story. I wish the filmmakers would have acknowledged the liberties taken with the story so that people don't leave the cinema thinking this is what actually happened. There are some good documentaries on YouTube that have the true story of Freddie and Queen. Take some time to watch them instead of depending on a film based on Wikipedia. Condensing 21-years into a 2 hour movie is difficult but others have done it and still stayed true to the story being told."
"loriaronson","9","2","3","4 November 2018"," Finally a Queen movie
","The actors in this movie did a phenomenal job telling an insider view of life as a rock star. It's an honor to see who Queen's master musicians are, who's music poetically continues to moves us, and watch how they creatively designed there deep, magical, emotionally moving music. The entire time I was watching I was whisked into their characters, the storyline, never once thinking of anything else but what was on the screen. I didn't want this movie to end, the beats were fluid. I left the theater feeling I know who these people are now, not who I thought they were. I have a new respect for all of them and especially Freddie Mercury. This movie is awesome and long overdue. Bravo."

"cruise01","10","2","3","4 November 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody is a triumphant of Queen and Freddie Mercury rise to fame.
","Bohemian Rhapsody (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a pure triumphant of a biographical film about the lead singer Freddie Mercury and some brief events of his life and the british rock band Queen. If you love Queen or never heard of them, you may enjoy the film. The film moves at a fast pace and it never had a dull moment or a scene that was prolonged with unnecessary dialogue. It may not be detailed or went into extended focus on Freddie's life.<br/><br/>The plot follows Freddie (Rami Malek) showing his earlier years when he was a baggage handler at the airport. When he met a local band that lost their lead singer. They recruit him to sing for them and got a few hits with a couple of songs. Years go by, they get albums made and go on tours. Freddie's marriage with Mary (Lucy Boynton) is struggling cause of his sexuality is interested in man. The film also focuses on the rocky relationship with Freddie and the rest of the Queen band. And towards their regroup to sing for the Live Aid in 1985.<br/><br/>The film may not gather every detailed historical event of Freddie's life. It briefly showed when he was working at the airport, meeting Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon. Then, years go by and they are meeting managers and recording albums. Their experimental rock band was hitting the ground. So much that one of the managers played by Mike Myers rejected their offer of a six minute song of Bohemian Rhapsody that no one will know who Queen is. Love Mike Myer's portrayal as the character which he is nearly unrecognizable. The film also goes over briefly of Freddie's failed marriage cause he was sexually attracted to men. When he falls for Paul, one of his managers. Which he was manipulating most of Freddie's choices.<br/><br/>The film does pack a punch with emotions that you feel for Freddie and his band. As Freddie tells his band that they are all legends. The moment you see him becoming sick with an illness. It was getting emotional to see him trying to get his band back together for the Live Aid concert. Every song that was playing in the movie from Queen was just pure awesome. It was loud, it was fun, and the story packed a punch of emotions with Freddie and his band. A scene with Freddie visiting his parents with his partner was also an emotional touch as he and his disapproving father hugged it out.<br/><br/>Rami Malek was perfect as Freddie Mercury. Lucy Boynton was great as Mary. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello playing the band members were all great.<br/><br/>Overall, Boehmian Rhapsody is a great biographical film. The film pays great homage to Queen. Freddie Mercury's story of his growth to Fame and the powerful moment during the Live Aid concert was just pure spectacular. I loved every minute of the film."

"ha77y73ad97","9","2","3","3 November 2018"," Epic performance from Rami Malick and the whole cast
","Only one place to start for this review and that is the performance of Rami Malick as Freddie Mercury, this has got to be a potential Oscar nod!! Every Single detail was captured in this performance down to the smallest ticks and pitch changes in possibly 1 of the best retelling of rock gods there can be. As always the song are awesome but brought to life by the performances of the whole cast. Brain May was uncanny, down to the voice and his presence on stage.<br/><br/>From the start of the film we see the rise of a young guy working as a baggage handler in Heathrow airport looking for his big break. Heading down to the uni bar where we see the first band of May and Taylor where they have lost their current lead singer. The opportunist steps up and shows his vocal range where May and Taylor are blown away.<br/><br/>After recruiting John Deacon to the band a few favours are pulled to get a sample album together. With some very odd experimental ideas literally being thrown around, a bin on a microphone and quickly trying to get together a sample before the studio opens for the morning.<br/><br/>Heading off to the record company and promoting their first album, grabbing the deal with both hands to head off to america on their first tour. We also catch a glimpse of the live at the rainbow concert which put them on the road to becoming the music sensations that today we know them as, white capes and all. During the American tour we also get the first of the personal life of Mercury in who he truly knows he is.<br/><br/>After the success of this tour we jump to the fallout of Sher Heart Attack andthe record label is looking for something new to compete with the last single Killer Queen. Heading back to the original studio and the creative process of their greatest hits of their carers, Bohemian Rhapsody. Retracking and Dubing 26 plus times to the point where the tape is wearing out 6 minute long track was born.<br/><br/>Back to the record company where this was the first time that i notice the record producer was Mike Myers and this was a prefect cameo where he mentioned that BoRap would never be played load in teenagers cars and head banged to, Wanyes World anyone!!! This was where Freddie pronounced that he was he producer that lost Queen. A brick through a window later Queen had found their new record label and released the track to the masses.<br/><br/>A Night At the Opera tour montage later the small frays in the group start to emerge along with Freddies party life with the music producer. The performances along this part of the film are so emotional and the 4 together pick the film moving at a great pace for a 2 plus hour run time.<br/><br/>Where we see heartbreaking point Freddie finds out that he has HIV/ Aids and his ""friend/ producer"" is pushing his solo career, which prompts his ex fiancee to save him basically in a rain soaked evening where Freddie learns about Live Aid for the first time after being promoted for months before hand. Really emotion is shown at this point where he knows hes got a short time to live and needs to reconnect with the family that he lost due to his solo albums.<br/><br/>After a few home truths in the record company with the 4 band mate they start to practice for the Live Aid performance. Where the truth of Freddie's condition comes to light to the whole group, May, Taylor, Deacon and their manager.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is the full 20 mins performance done the full original set justice, BoRap, hammer to fall were just perfect all mannerism for the quartet. One great detail was the manger being able to turn the volume up in one of the best fables in the music industry from this performance.<br/><br/>To end the film here does the music legends justice not to end it on a low in 1991 but one of their biggest and most well know sets."
"tennisboyn","7","2","3","2 November 2018"," Great music, good acting, not-so-good script
","Anybody who sees this movie will surely have a good time, but by no means is it a consistently strong film. For the lows of this movie, let's start with the script. The dialogue is a mix of cliche one-liners with some ""heartfelt"" moments that don't have enough impact on the film. This means, it doesn't dive deep into the more romantically dynamic life that Freddie had. Although this was NOT the intention of the movie, clearly the writers struggled to make each aspect of Freddie's chaotic life more meaningful. Also, some of the CGI effects were weak, most notably during live aid. To finish off with the cons, his teeth were cartoonishly large and should not have gotten as much attention as they did. For the pros, Rami Malek completely aced his part as Freddie Mercury! He was able to show his conflicting emotions with still highlighting the frontman's flamboyant and godly persona on stage. The crew did develop the character exceedingly well and Malek convinced the audience that Mercury was a one-off, that is for sure. Lucy Boynton also played her part very well, and was certainly the highlight of Freddie's ""personal life"" scenes. The rest of the band also crushed their roles and gave justice to the uniqueness of Queen and their music. Also, the cinematography deserves attention. I found the creative use of camera angles and effects very impressive. This could've easily been annoying and even distracting at times, but only added to my interest in the film. Of course, the music is phenomenal and despite what others have said, I didn't notice any problem with bringing his Freddie's voice to stage. I think this editing and mixing job was done very well. Lastly, does this movie do Queen justice? Yes, I think it does it's job at celebrating Queen and their achievements. No, it was not made to sweep the awards season, it was made to celebrate Freddie Mercury's life, and I think it does just that."

"i-12702","9","1","1","22 January 2020"," One of my favorite movies, brings meaning to their songs
","The new film Bohemian Rhapsody, also the name of one of Queen's most popular songs, released on January 11, 2019 was a controversial film regarding if it was produced amazingly, or not so great. The movie starts out showing young Freddie Mercury finding his passion for singing, his wild style, and meeting the love of his life at a younger age. Freddie, the lead singer of Queen and acted by Rami Malek, goes on to defy stereotypes and conference after joining a small band, and ends up considered one of history's most cherished entertainers. The band's progressive sound and famous songs cause Queen's meteoric upward push in the 1970s. After leaving the band to pursue a solo career where he spirals downward into drugs and parties, Mercury reunites with Queen for the large concert Live Aid after finding out he has the incurable disease Aids-- resulting in one of the finest performances in rock 'n' roll history. The (controversial) director Bryan Singer, did an incredible job with hiring actors, the lead roles are Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, Lucy Boynton as Mary Austin, Gwilym Lee as Brian May, and Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor. These main actors that we mostly see steadily through the movie did an incredible job portraying their roles. Throughout the movie I felt a range of emotions, and not just from the plot line, but from the way the actors brought the script to life. Especially well done by Rami Malek, who channeled the real Freddie Mercury's enthusiasm and unique personality as well as his high energy performances. He even won multiple awards for his role such as Best Actor at the Oscars and even more nominees. Another highlight of the film was of course the music, and the showing of how the songs came to be was really interesting. I have always loved Queen's music, but seeing the background of how the band recorded and thought of the melodies and lyrics gave the music more value and background for me when listening to their music. Among the abundant amount of positives of this movie, the only thing that felt off about this film was the pacing of some scenes. For example the band is thinking of selling their now broken down van in the middle of nowhere, and using the money to buy time in a recording studio; However, the scene then cuts straight to them in a recording studio with no context of how they got there or where they were at first. Although, I enjoyed the movies historical background and deep look into the bands' lives so much that it was easy for me to overlook the issue of pacing in the film. I agree with many fans of the movie that it was an overall great movie and would definitely watch again, and probably again, but movie critics were not so pleased with the film. The film only accumulated 60% on Rotten Tomatoes, and was due to non date appropriate props, possibly not portraying the timeline of Queen correctly, etc, and even though it had bad reviews the movie won multiple awards and even won the most Oscars for a movie in 2019. As a younger listener I did not experience the time when Queen was ruling the Rock world, so I did not notice those smaller details. In conclusion I recommend seeing Bohemian Rhapsody because of its amazing character portrayal and the interesting and exciting plot line."
"bogdanbalostin","9","1","1","20 January 2020"," Amazing performance, despite being shallow at times
","Another movie I rate based on the performance of the lead actor. Rami Malek was fantastic as Freddie Mercury, bringing his soul to life. But, we need to make one point clear, this is a fictional movie, not a documentary. And I do agree that Rami Malek is at times different than the way Freddie Mercury appeared to be. Needless to say, his performance is consistent and I understood the message of the movie, therefore I think everyone did a good interpretation of this story.<br/><br/>And then there are the songs. It was impossible to make a bad movie with these iconic songs in them. And I am not even a Queen's fan. I've just heard their songs while growing up and I didn't realize they had so many, so famous, so different songs.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is the start, I wanted to see Freddie's thinking and upbringing before he joined the band so quickly and become famous so quickly. The thing is maybe nobody knows and it's true to life, but I would have liked to see in this movie a smoother transition from nobody to world-famous."
"alexbeaumontpokemon","7","1","1","19 January 2020"," Watered down- needs a sequel
","For the time it fills, it doesn't really go too deep into certain aspects of their lives. Some dates are also wrong, for example Live Aid was in 1985 and Freddie didn't get diagnosed until 1987. Rami Malek was incredible as an actor and the casting was very good"
"FixedYourEnding","9","1","1","19 November 2019"," I actaully came in thinking I was going to dislike this movie
","Boy, was I wrong. This ended up being one of the best movies of 2018, well worthy of a few Oscars. I was never the biggest fan of Queen the band, but this movie, with the lead role of the excellent Rami Malek give you a thriller-full journey of what godly-like effort it was to create the legacy that is Queen's songs. Sure, probably not 100% historically accurate, but yet an excellent balance between entertainment and realism. The songs are beautifully performed and not in a musical-film way or in a remake of the songs which is a good way to ruin a good cake.
This is in my must-watch category. Yes, it's a bit grotesque at times and Hollywoodish so not a complete 10 from me, but to criticize it down to a 4 or 5, seriously? go watch and enjoy this masterpiece.
Exact score: 88/100"
"agmoldham","6","1","1","23 October 2019"," Watch the real thing
","Finally got around to seeing Bohemian Rhapsody. Instead of watching the movie at a theatre when it came out I decided to watch the real thing. I am of an age where I can remember sitting down to watch Live Aid. I wasn't a massive fan of Queen and they were just one act in the lineup of the best music acts on the planet that day. As acts came on and played their 30 minute sets starting from noon it was incredibly flat. Regardless of how popular the acts were they couldn't project themselves on such a big occasion. By evening it was frustrating just how poor the day was. Enter Freddie Mercury who turned everything round with one of the great live performances of all time. Maybe that gives a hint of why I wasn't jumping to watch this film. It couldn't live up to the real thing.<br/><br/>And it doesn't. Whilst there's no doubt that Remi Malek puts in a great performance he isn't Freddie Mercury. The movie was a little too kind for my liking. Pretty sure Freddie Mercury will have been a lot wilder in real life. It's worth a watch, but make sure you take a look at the real thing if you enjoy this."

"allanmichael30","5","1","1","20 September 2019"," QUEEN-BETWEENERS
","This band was more like Inbetweeners, than queen with poor dialogue and was like watching paint dry,failed to capture the charismatic Freddie we all know. The record Executive Ray looked like Fat B****ed from Austin Powers. Rayfoster did not exist according to rolling stones magazine, he was called Roy Featherstone. Their was also Tom Hollander and Aidan Gillen stuck out and ruined the first half of the movie,especially the scene with Freddie in dragon wings next to that character from game of thrones, whats his name, i can't put my finger on It. Any how their was some parts of the film where it lights up and you sort of forget you're watching a movie and Rami Malek seems like Freddie but, poor casting and direction of movie stifled the characters performance. The best part of film was live aid and the real footage of Freddie. I don't think his performance was best actor worthy. Green Book won best picture and if his performance was that great then it would have won best picture but was snubbed."

","My honest review reflects that so many artist are coming out with their life stories and fill the theaters and making money on stories from the past. Rocketman, The Dirt, etc. I get since stranger things 80's are so cool but my personal feeling are keep that were it belongs in maybe a documentary form. Beyond my feelings on this the film itself was great the cinematography, VFX (Creating the arena, ect) was amazing. I feel a ton of work came from the production company that had to do a lot of homework to make this film successful. I think as so many fans Queen has even gaining popularity in newer generations it was a good move to make a film. They are an iconic band that's music deserves to live hundreds of years as well as The Stones, Journey, U2, and many others."

"truemythmedia","8","1","1","22 August 2019"," A Good Performance but that is all
","Malek does an amazing job, not just of acting like he did on stage, but performing with the sort of power and rhythm that Freddy did and bringing that same yet subtly different energy into the non band performance based scenes.<br/><br/>In fact, his performance as Freddy Mercury is the only real reason to see this film. It's entertaining, funny, sad, moving and everything else we all expect from a musician biopic. Guess what? He did drugs, was a homosexual, had issues with his dad, and resented his band. If you didn't already know the story just from knowing about his life you could still predict most of the story beats of this film if you've seen ""Walk the Line,"" ""A Star is Born,"" or any other of the myriad of musician rise to fame movies out there.<br/><br/>That isn't to say it's not worth watching. It totally is. The acting is just that good. Not just by Rami Malek either. Gwilym Lee (""The Tourist""), Ben Hardy, and Joe Mazzello (""Jurassic Park"") all do a wonderful job of mimicking Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon. In fact, while the movie spends the vast majority of its time with Freddy Mercury and in awe of him, it definitely doesn't forget the rest of the band. In fact, it does so in a more profound way than most movies about bands.<br/><br/>You really end up getting a sense of camaraderie and family from the band. Of course, I don't know how much of that is accurate but it makes for a good movie and that's what I'm judging here. This movie is as much about four guys realizing they love and need each other as it is about the rise of a Rock n' Roll hero.<br/><br/>On a side note, While Rami Malek did sing for his performances in the movie, the actual recording you hear is mostly by Marc Martel, the lead singer for Christian Band ""Down Here"" and they sound phenomenal. I would have loved the way it sounded even before finding to that one of my favorite bands from back in the day supplied the vocals. After finding that out, I love them even more.<br/><br/>For the hardcore Queen fan, I imagine much of this movie will seem like old news but as Freddy is no longer with us, this is probably as close as one could get to seeing him perform and for that reason, I think it is totally worth seeing."
"christophersarles","9","1","1","21 August 2019"," No words!
","No words can explain this movie. I could say awesome, or great but they don't do it justice. Even for a long time queen fan, who knew the story, has seen the video, remember the night at the opera and killer queen vinyl record jackets as a kid, it was mind blowing to see the band come to life in a movie. What a talented man. It makes me sad that he wasn't born even 20 yrs later, he would probably have been alive today if he had been.
Freddy was another shooting star.
Go watch on YouTube his opera, Barcelona. Right before he died and he was MESMERIZING!
He changed the world, and people loved him for it. Very few humans get to stand on a stage as 200,000 sing every word to something you wrote, so few get to see how immortal they truly are. RIP Farouk"

","The movie did an amazing job at delivering the emotions Queen would make you feel, the center was the music, as it should have been, and the persona of Fredie Mercury, over the top & eccentric as he was.

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","1","4 August 2019"," Nothing wrong, but give me the original any day
","BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY is the latest musical biopic and this time it's about the legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Mercury is one of my all-time favourite singers, and this film is certainly a well-made exploration of his life and rise to fame. It's also rather lengthy and more than a little laboured at times, so that many parts of Mercury's life are skipped over or excised altogether. Rami Malek does a fine impression of Mercury and certainly looks the part, and the attention to period detail is enjoyable. I could have done with a few more songs amid the family drama and genre tropes; the only time this really picks up with the right kind of energy is for the climactic Live Aid gig. The real-life footage of Mercury singing over the end credits puts things into perspective too."

","I grew up with Queen in the mid 70s, and have been looking forward to this film for ever.
It doesn't disappoint. Great performances, and reminds you how phenomenal Freddie Mercury was; it is easy to forget with the passage of time.
I listened to nothing but Queen albums for a week after watching, so it did its job.
Except.....If you're a bit of Queen nerd like me, and know when certain songs were released or certain events happened, you'll know know, and it may irritate. However, if you're normal, and either don't know, and don't care, it really doesn't matter."
"gnomesgardeningservice","10","1","1","31 July 2019"," MASTERPIECE!
","I give this movie a 10/10 simply because I believe the actor who played Freddy Mercury gave it his heart and soul, he delivered every aspect of his character superbly, especially the Live Aid scene at the end of this film, the way they delivered this movie was spot on and the best life based movie ive seen to date"
"nancylmarine","9","1","1","31 July 2019"," Beautiful tribute to a magical musician
","What starts out as a musical movie, sharing with viewers how Queen got to where they were, and how their biggest songs came to be, turns into a beautiful tribute to an exceptional man.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie, though, you come to realize just how much Mercury gave of himself and how much he lost of himself due to the price of the fame he desperately sought in the beginning.<br/><br/>The most enlightening part in all of this was how much he struggled with his sexuality. I'm not sure just how honest this facet of the movie is, but if it's correct, Mercury certainly tried to live his life on his terms, albeit without the love of his life, and was unable to do so because of the pressure put on him by both the press and a puritanical public. I truly appreciated how much Mary meant to him and why it was so important to him to have her in his life, given the other parts of his life that meant so little to him, but was foisted on him by those around him. He certainly relied on people who meant more to him than he meant to them. The more the movie went on, the more I came to loathe anyone but Mary and his fellow bandmates, seeing everyone for what they really were.<br/><br/>Rami Malek's acting captures Freddie Mercury so well, it's easy to forget you're not watching Mercury himself. I felt my heart lurch several times during the movie, feeling the deep sadness inside Mercury, who just wanted to entertain the people. As much as I love the music of Queen, still, it actually became secondary to the story unfolding as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to not just enjoy the music of an amazing band, but to see what life inside the life of a huge rock start is like, warts and all."
"mkalako","10","1","1","29 July 2019"," Great movie
","I was never a big Queen fan but thought this movie was fantastic. It isn't an in-depth biographical film, it's more of a generalized overview of Mercury and Queen. Since I was never followed the band, the differences between what actually happened and how the film portrayed them didn't matter to me. The story was completely engrossing.<br/><br/>Malek's performance is not to be missed. He completely embodies Mercury showing why he so deserved his Oscar win. Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the best, if not the best, biographical music films I've ever seen."

","Whatever else you have read in regards with this movie; let me assure you of one thing. In 1991 the world lost an amazing voice and an incredible stage performer. The musical world seemed just a little bit dimmer from the loss. When I watched Bohemian Rhapsody? For a couple of hours, I had Freddie Mercury back. That light shone bright again. I'm not sure I can pay the film any higher compliment."
"sixstud-9-376449","9","1","1","22 July 2019"," Loved it all
","I truly enjoyed this film. I went into it not knowing what to expect, and although I loved several Queen songs, I was unaware of a lot of the background as to how the band came to be and it's the development of both the band and the ""mercurial"" frontman of Queen that I found so fascinating.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is one hell of a watch, and again, although I have listened to and enjoyed several of their songs, the story of how they came to be and the proverbial rise and fall of Freddie Mercury that I found so bloody enjoyable.<br/><br/>Rami Malek did a masterful job in his role, you could see the work that was placed in how he presented the man, and I felt he was absolutely incredible in the film.<br/><br/>A lot of people including some hardcore Queen fans have complained endlessly about how unrealistic and off the mark the film was, how they changed history and told things differently to how things really were, but honestly a film about both a band and a man this eclectic cannot possibly be crammed into a 2 hour time slot, and there may come a day when the life and times of Freddie Mercury will be fully exposed through this medium, but for now I'll settle for a faithful reproduction of that incredible night at Wembley when Queen held the world in the palm of their hands for 20 minutes.

","Objectively the film was pretty good. Good story telling (well, it's almost a documentary), good visuals. But nothing super outstanding.
Until you put in the lead actor - the music of Queen. Queen's music is already awesome but in the context of this film it takes on a persona of its own and transforms the movie from pretty good to greatness.
Then you add in the second lead actor - Rami Malek. The descriptions you've read are wrong - he doesn't ""play"" Freddie Mercury - he IS Freddy Mercury. I'm someone who's watched Freddie on TV - unless the camera moves in for a facial close-up Malek is indistinguishable from Freddy Mercury. It's not acting, he's pretty much a doppleganger. Even if you don't care much for the movie, Queen's music (how dare you!) or any other thing, just watch to see a pinnacle of acting"

Yes, it is pretty contrived, which, unfortunately is the fate of the biopic. From the beginning the character was larger than life. We did get a bit into the recording industry stuff, but I'm not quite sure how much of the pain was put forth. Also, Freddie's recognition of his gayness had to have been hinted at a but earlier. But the music was so good and it makes me want to check out some videos of Queen in concert. By the way, did the Mike Meyers character actually say that Bohemian Rhapsody will never be sung by people in a car? This was a bit much."

''. His influence has been so great that they came to be portrayed in a complete movie, and he has done it in an excellent way.<br/><br/>A biographical film, exciting and full of excellent sounds, carried out under a good direction and above all, incredible performances that give life to each of the members; it is not necessary to emphasize the incredible thing that is Rami for Mercury, an act totally in point, from its ways of behaving, compustura, tone until the expressions and the movement, is to see Mercury with life in the big screen, an experience difficult to forget for so emotional it is. I think it makes a good judgment of Queen's story and portrays them in a realistic and tangible way, a sample of the whole band's journey and the person who was Mercury."

But the fact it was more detailed than I imagined. At the beginning of this movie, I feel confused with the story. It is maybe because I'm not the Queen's fan and don't know anything about this band's biography. But time by time, I can immediately follow the story-line.

It has an interesting storyline, and has a tint of humor, not too much humor that it makes it a huge comedy that comes clingy and try-hard, and the music is well presented. Everything is so raw and real, and if someone smiles, you smile with them. If Freddie cries, you cry and bear with him. If Freddie is angry you feel angry with him. Everything makes you feel. And it proves that Queen is not just a band, it is a life-changing group of musicians. This movie is surely a queen, and his story is as intriguing as his music is.

I remember watching the previews months before it came out I knew it was going to be a smash the previews were that good. This movie is addictive, once you watch it you will watch it over and over and over. My sisters and I love it. We are in our forties we were teens when we knew of Queen. And my youngest sister in her thirties is also a fan. A lot of African American people didn't hear of Queen until another one bites the dust came out LOL but we were fans from day one because we love all music. And Freddie is greatly missed by everyone. This movie just sucks you in and you will find yourself going back and playing all the songs and rewinding and replaying everything. And it makes you miss Freddie more yet it reminds you Fearless lives on FOREVER!!!"

","Rami Malek did an absolutely great job of portraying Freddie Mercury. that even his moves and his singing where exactly like his. The Song was a great hit, and the movie itself is a great hit. Nice 2 titles."
"kosmasp","9","1","1","6 May 2019"," What a performance
","If Imdb had a performance rating - well Remi Malek would have gotten a 10/10 from me. Now still let's adress the elephant in the room: is this correct in all of its portrayal when it comes to Queen? No it is not. There are quite a few things that are ... let's call them artistic freedom changes. So if you are not hardcore about those things and can accept these things, then you will be treated with something really amazing.<br/><br/>The performances are great and the story is quite incredible. Yes some things seem like cliches, but that's how stories go. Well probably except the one about Elton John coming in 2019 (Rocketman), which I also look forward to. But this is about Queen and as controversial as Mercury was, almost everyone knows the songs he and Queen created - I guess there might also be some questions about who came up with what song and not having Mercury around answering those questions, the remaining band members answered them - do you believe all of them? Whatever the case, it should not ruin the movie going experience for you. Sit back and just let the movie and (not so much accurate) history take over! Marvelous, splendid and quite extraordinary!"
"stevenrotherforth","7","1","1","3 May 2019"," Malek deserves an Oscar. The film itself doesn't quite live up to such an accolade.
","Bohemian Rhapsody<br/><br/>I would consider myself as a casual fan of Queens music. It is undeniable that the band produced some good tunes throughout their career and the genius of Freddie Mercury is now legendary.
This is perhaps why this movie exists in the first place.
Bohemian Rhapsody is a good movie that tells the story of the bands journey up until their famous set at Live Aid.
Rami Malek is very convincing as Freddie Mercury and his performance is so good that the actor disappears into character and we do indeed see Freddie onscreen.
The rest of the cast do a great job too but this is Malek's film.
A performance that in my opinion is Oscar worthy.
The film itself may not be great enough to deserve such an accolade but still this is an enjoyable piece of cinema.
I'm not one that knows the exact history of the band and I have read that the movie is littered with historical inaccuracies.
However this takes nothing away from the enjoyment.
Bohemian Rhapsody isn't a movie that blows you away with 4K HDR picture quality but sound is very good when the band are cranking out their hits on stage.
I had a much better time with this movie than I thought I would.
If you're a Queen fan you may go two ways.
Either you'll enjoy the film for what it is or be annoyed by the liberties taken with historical fact."

","I knew this would be good, I did not know it would be a movie I would never forget. I don't know if Freddie was indeed the kind and gentle soul he was portray as in this film, I only know he was a musical legend. He is portrayed as too complex a person to even describe in this review. The scene where he is standing drenched in the rain and realizes he must cut loose the toxic people in his life is one of the most intense I have ever seen. He 'evolves' in this film, always knowing he was talented, but not always knowing he had so much more to offer as the person he was and the kindness he exuded. We are taken in moments to him tenderly caring for his many cats to giving performances to rock you out of your seat. We are taken to his journey to the hospital where he is recognized by a fan who sings a few notes as he begins to walk out the door. He stops, pauses, and sings back. We must remember this was a time when this horrible disease was kept utterly clandestine, so this small action was enough. We are taken on his journey with Mary, the Love of his Life. He is shy, wild, lost, kind, conflicted, lonely - but always fearless. Always loved."

You watch interviews with Joe and he had more then 4 wigs, each named. Gwilym stepped out of his trailer and Brian fixes his hair.

"mulcahyj-07545","10","1","1","1 April 2019"," Ups, downs, ups. Tears, laughter and all just like life. A film I thought had failure written all over it. Then I watched it and was stunned. Brilliant.
","To write a review of this movie is hard. Complicated. Like life. When I heard this movie was being made my head sunk. I will make it clear. I am a Queen fan. I thought Freddie Mercury was an incredibly talented person, musician, writer, performer.. I could go on. He was the nucleus, or mitochondria(?) in Queen. But he would not have any success in the music business without the other talented and amazing individual persona's of the rest of Queen.<br/><br/>I also need to make it clear I am not an obsessive fan of Queen. Nothing wrong with being one but my taste in music is wide and broad. Wont bother you with my other taste in music.<br/><br/>But Queen were unique. Making a film about this band, which effectively it is but the central story is rightly Freddie Mercury, I thought would just be too difficult. To put an enternaingly two hour film together telling the story of Freddie Mercury and needingly Queen too and balancing them all together just seemed impossible and switched off interest when I heard it was being made. Then seeing the cast before release in trailers, in the news, in interviews perked my interest. Then the directorial issues made me worry. Then I thought, ok the actors playing the band look like Queen. They sound like Queen talking. Obviously your eyes turn to the actor playing Mercury. But how will the but a good plot for a movie around this?<br/><br/>So I watched it. And I was stunned. No plot spoilers here! You don't need any. You know the Freddie Mercury and Queen story. But this was put together so very well you almost forgot what happened next and needed to see watching.<br/><br/>I worried how they would end the movie. I thought that would be a mess with the ending. I said no spoilers so not detailing any of the plot from start to end. The movie drawed me I every moment to be one of the films I will watch again and again. The music is astounding at every level from the band playing live to practising and record. All intertwined to the different paths our lives lead.<br/><br/>Incredible. A movie based on a band we know much of, a singer who had such a complicated life and wanted to please with his entertaining and also desperately just to be happy.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film I hope in a little way makes you consider it. If you have seen it hope you can see it is very hard to write a review without giving spoilers or even scenes that made you laugh or cry or just stand up cheering to the powering music at every stage even back to when before Queen there was Smile.<br/><br/>The film is incomparable and touched my heart. If you see it and it gives you only a little what it gave to me you will Smile. For what life is. For where it takes you. And how good sometimes it is."
"kylenorty","9","1","1","1 April 2019"," Even More of a Queen Fan Now
","Rami Malek is incredible. That's what the consensus is on this film. The rest of the movie has been debated. I believe this was a fun frolic of a summary of the band Queen, but mainly Freddie Mercury, because although the band as a whole is great, Freddie is what we all came for.<br/><br/>Some say the movie took a too family friendly approach to the story; however, they did delve into Freddie's personal issues, but maybe not as deep as the movie enthusiasts that crave depressing themes desired. This did not bother me in the slightest. I found the movie to be a genuinely exciting experience watching the band form and develop their beloved music. The concert scenes were so well done that you truly believe the actors portraying the band members were born to be rockstars.<br/><br/>The acting all around was excellent with the obvious stand out and scene stealer being Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury. This film was definitely one of my favorite of the year and a left the theater with a big smile on my face."

"maccas-56367","8","1","1","30 March 2019"," Entertaining, yet flawed biopic of the legendary Freddie
","My opinion on this film is about as mixed and conflicted as the critic and audience reviews out there.<br/><br/>I both loved it and disliked it. I think Queen's input was a large part of the problem - they were a dull band who happened to create awesome music and had a phenomenal (and interesting) front man. This creates a problem in a movie where band members have so much input and need to divide screen time up.<br/><br/>The music was a highlight, but I thought the ""origin"" scenes of certain songs had been done so much better in other music films. It was just a bit the same same over and over. Rami Malek delivered a really captivating and charismatic performance. Oscar worthy? I'm not sure, but he seems like a nice guy, so I'm glad he won.<br/><br/>It also felt kind of hypocritical at times - one second Freddie is delivering lines of not wanting to be a poster boy for AIDS etc, the next they're just lathering all the AIDS on real thick and steady. This film really tried to make Freddie out to be that poster boy for it, when it was only just a small part of the remarkable human being he was.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a comedy with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", but it often felt incredibly serious (regularly taking itself too seriously) and devoid of many laughs. Despite this, it kept me glued and invested for its 2 hour run time which must be some testament to the film's entertainment value, right?<br/><br/>The Live Aid performance was a fantastic finale and great way to wrap things up. It has made me want to delve into my Queen albums and read up more about who Freddie Mercury really was."

I was also underwhelmed with what part of the history of the band was picked out to show and in what extend: What is the purpose of restaging the Life Aid gig when I can watch the real thing? Early years of the band members and post Live Aid where blanked out while the generic ""rockstar gets rich, breaks with band and comes back to sense"" was blend at best."

"proud_luddite","9","1","1","22 March 2019"," Compassionate and Exhilirating
","Based on a true story: the life of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) is portrayed beginning with his connection with the group that would later become Queen and ending with Queen's performance at the Live Aid concert in 1985.<br/><br/>Throughout, this US-UK co-production has many moments that are lively, energetic, and fun especially the early segments and various musical moments. The directing (by Bryan Singer, later replaced by Dexter Fletcher) also shifts easily to moods that match the stages of Mercury's later life including loneliness at the top, coming out as bisexual, and being diagnosed with AIDS. The film benefits greatly by having Malek in the lead role. He gives a fully rounded performance in all of the ups and downs of an extraordinary life and his simulation of the Live Aid performance is outstanding. He deserves all the awards and other recognition he has won.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has special resonance for those of us who could remember Queen's rise to fame and beyond. This includes a very amusing scene that includes criticism of the length of the titular song and how this could never be accepted by radio stations. (As they say, the rest is history.) There is also the collective attitude of compassion that was behind the Live Aid concert.<br/><br/>Many criticize the 1980s as a decade of greed. While this was indeed the decade when the seed of greed was planted, the terrible results of that seed would later flourish in the 1990s and beyond. The 1980s was like a ""between"" decade. It had the greed already mentioned but it also had much of the residual heart left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This kinder attitude created Live Aid which received many charitable contributions. Such an event would be very unlikely today. This is not necessarily because the average person is greedy; it's mainly because the average person of today has much less disposable income than the average person in 1985. Here is yet another way that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" creates such a yearning nostalgia.<br/><br/>While there is solid development in Freddie's character, this is much less so in the character of Paul Prenter (Allen Leech), Freddie's lover and manager during the early part of the group's prime. Paul is portrayed as a character who slithers his way into an already established group and then becomes a manipulative control freak. While it is easy to sympathize with Paul in the beginning (coming out as gay was much more difficult back then than it is today), he seems to suddenly become a jerk with no character arc.<br/><br/>But this flaw does not stop ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" from being one of the top films of 2018. It has many moments that make it compassionate as well as exhilarating. One of the highlights is a scene when Freddie announces his health condition to his fellow band members.<br/><br/>This film compares well to other great films about music performers - fictional as well as real. It has the energy and passion of ""A Star is Born"" also released in 2018. And it is also very much like the Édith Piaf biopic ""La Vie en Rose"" (2007); like the latter film, each portrayed brilliant, larger-than-life singers who died too soon in their forties. And all three films conclude with musical numbers that could make angels weep with joy. - dbamateurcritic<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:<br/><br/>Directing by Bryan Singer and Dexter Fletcher<br/><br/>Acting by Rami Malek"

"Mike_Devine","7","1","1","22 March 2019"," A search for identity told through a bohemian rhapsody
","One of the biggest blockbusters of the awards season, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' had all the elements needed for the perfect storm of attention - lots of controversy, both on and off screen, an iconic band with a killer soundtrack, and a frontman who is nothing if not interesting.<br/><br/>When you put all of this together, 'Rhapsody' becomes a story that is one of tragedy, overcoming adversity and personal identity. Without a doubt, it is Rami Malek who is the standout, as his portrayal of the conflicted Freddie Mercury leaves very few stones left unturned. The fact that Malek earned an Oscar for this role tells you pretty much all you need to know - he's the star of the show, and he won't let anyone forget it.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are plenty of openings for audiences to criticize 'Rhapsody.' Perhaps Mercury's story was sanitized more so than it should have been. Maybe it was how Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) was portrayed. Maybe the friction between Mercury and the rest of Queen was downplayed. Whatever may be the truth, it shouldn't take away from the fact that the film is entertaining. Just take the Live Aid concert scene - that in and of itself is worth the watch.<br/><br/>It won't be remembered as the greatest music-focused film of all time, but 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a pioneer in this genre and may in fact be responsible for a new wave of similar films that will be hitting theaters over the coming years."

I'm usually not a big fan of drama films, but this one was so captivating that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Freddie's life-story is extremely intriguing. It was fascinating to see the band perform some of their greatest hits. I had no idea how many great songs were by Queen! I absolutely loved the parts of the film where we get to see the band in concert, especially when they perform at Live-Aid. It is such a touching moment, and if you've seen the film, you know why. I've never been to a concert, but after seeing this movie, I felt like I was sitting in the front row! As for the acting, Rami Malek portrays Freddie Mercury PERFECTLY. He exudes the EXACT same energy as the singer, and he looked identical to him. When I got home, I watched Queen's actual performance at Live-Aid, and Rami even did the same MOVES as Freddie. I can barely tell the difference between the two. Everyone else was fantastic too, but I honestly think Rami Malek deserves an Oscar for his performance in the film. In conclusion, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and sing along. I wasn't a huge fan of Queen before, but after seeing this movie, they're my favorite band. I honestly think it's one of the best films of the year, and DEFINITELY one of my favorites. It better get nominated for a few awards, because it deserves every single one of them.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","1","1","8 March 2019"," A pretty standard musical biopic with some extraordinary source material.
","It's difficult to hate a film that's filled with so many great songs. Fortunately for Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), almost all of Queen's greatest hits are pulled out and strung together to cover a rather large timeframe of 15 years. Of course, like most musical biopics, it does tend to hit the same notes as predecessors before it. Perhaps this is merely due to the ""rock and roll"" lifestyle, but I couldn't help but see similar situations in films like De-Lovely (2004), Ray (2004), and Walk the Line (2005).<br/><br/>While the cultural landscape has changed a lot from the 1970s and 1980s until now, some of the film's ""reveals"" that would have been a little more shocking (i.e. Freddie's homosexuality) were perhaps lessened due to the fairly famous end of this talented singer. That being said, some of the lyrics of these well-known songs take on a strikingly more poignant context during the recreated Live Aid concert in 1985. Of course, since most of the movie focuses on Freddie Mercury (an extremely-on point Rami Malek), it was easy to also gloss over the extreme talent of Brian May (Gwilym Lee), Queen's lead guitarist. Listen to those guitar riffs and tell me he wasn't just as important as Freddie.<br/><br/>I was a little surprised to find that Bryan Singer (of X-Men (2000) movie fame) directed this film, but his unique style certainly helped bring this band's tale to life. If anything, this film made me think a little bit more about Queen, and how there really wasn't a band like them before, and there really hasn't been a band like them since. Sure, there's the shoehorned drama and the drugs and sex that inevitably come between band members, but it was still an entertaining ride, nonetheless. And the fact that I learned just a little bit more about these musicians is just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>A pretty standard musical biopic with some extraordinary source material, I give Bohemian Rhapsody 4.0 stars out of 5."

","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" tells the life-story of Freddie Mercury and his band Queen. It follows the singer through difficult personal and business decisions, depicts the relationships with real and false friends and sets a monument for a quite unusual band.<br/><br/>As someone who isn't an expert on Queen, even though some of the songs are universally known, the movie helped me to better understand the phenomenon and develop a new point of view on some of the songs. The only thing I found really strange is the choice of a starting and ending point for this film, since it tells nothing about the childhood and ends with a rather randomly chosen concert. The portrayal is impressive but the focus is also laid widely on the music, which makes perfect sense but for me kind of limits the biographical aspects.<br/><br/>All in all this is still a very powerful film that fans will love and others will at least repsect. It tells the story of an unusual life, celebrates brave decisions and visualizes the memories of millions of fans all over the world."

"marcvuijk","7","1","1","4 March 2019"," The show must go on!!!
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a very good movie and its defenitely an entertaining couple of hours.
Within the first 5 minutes of the movie you know this movie is a very good attempt to see what Queen but mostly what Freddie Mercury was all about.
Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury is very convincing and his performance is outstanding, but i prefered his performance as Freddie in the earlier years of Queen a lot more then Freddie during Live Aid for instance. Freddies Performance during live aid was amazing, inspiring and a very powerfull performance and i feel during that part of the movie Rami Malek lacked the powerful charisma that Freddie had at that moment.
It just didn't feel right to me.
Maybe its me but Freddie wasn't a small man but Rami during Live Aid looked quite small, and all the other members looked like teenagers while they were orginally already in their late 30's.
Also there were a couple of things that were not factual and that bothered me quite a bit.
During one of their first shows before getting famous, in the movie, they played fat bottomed girls during their show, but that song wasn't released until 1978 and not in early 1974 before they release killer Queen.
Same with the way they introduced we will rock you.
There were a couple of more things that weren't actually the way they happened and i couldn't help thinking how that was possible knowing that Brian May and Roger Taylor were executive producers of the movie.
Besides all that Bohemian Rhapsody is a really fun movie and you realize how good Queen really was, their music is really endless.
Rami Malek really deserved his oscar as Freddie Mercury but lets not forget the actors that played the other members.
Brian May was an outstanding performance and for me a brilliant choice and John Deacon was a great choice as well.
Bohemian Rhapsody is really worth the watch and very entertaining.
My rating would have been higher if not for those couple of things in my review.
A great effort and a great movie for Queen lovers and for a new generation to discover their amazing music, but for now the show must go on!!!

There are moments when it's good, when it actually captures something of Queen but those are too few.

I'm stunned it was nominated and won an Oscar for best editing. It is awful editing. That is half the problem.
Terrible or lack of direction, bad editing, leaden storytelling, and a multitude of inaccuracies for no reason made this a mess.
Queen's music and Malek's performance is what I think most people are giving good reviews for because the movie itself is below average.
So disappointing."

","Scanning some reviews here I had to agree when someone wrote they felt both sad and elated at the end of this film. Exactly! I found myself in tears and it was because of how incredibly moving the film is. What a masterful portrayal of a real person. When Queen was in its heyday, I was still mourning over the end of the 60's and didn't pay too much attention to those bands with one-word names. It wasn't until later in my life that I started to really listen to Queen and get into it. Also, I didn't know much about Freddie Mercury so watching this film taught me a lot. I didn't know what a creative, energetic, driven artist Freddie was, or how hungry he was for his audiences' love. The way the film showed him as well the other band members and the music drove home how extremely talented he was. I kept wondering what would have become of him had AIDS not gotten him. Somehow I feel he would have died young anyway, the way stars do who burn so bright they just explode and are gone."

"itsbobr","10","1","1","28 February 2019"," A Tremendous Tribute to Freddie Mercury
","The rise and fall of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) a Super Rock Star with his band: Queen.<br/><br/>I have no knowledge of Freddie Mercury prior to watching the movie: Bohemian Rhapsody, but after watching the movie I am impressed with Freddie Mercury and Queen. I liked the music probably since a lot of what I heard had echoes of 1950 and 1960s music.<br/><br/>I have read many times that Rami Malek portrayed Freddie Mercury as close as possible so I will agree that his performance is a solid and honest one and was deserving of his Best Actor Oscar Award.<br/><br/>I see Queen's music as the next step in where Rock and Roll did go after the 1950s and 60s. The hard rock music that came in with other Rock Stars was too hard on my ears and those howling electric guitars didn't help me much. (You are just more than a little bit Country)<br/><br/>I did learn where the Lyric ""We will , we will rock you"" came from. Never knew where it came from before. Never really thought about it. Now it will never leave me.<br/><br/>The movie didn't go into Mercury's gay relationships in any detail. In other words nothing salacious or erotic in here. His girl friend Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) knew he was gay and he admitted to her that he believed he was bi-sexual. This occurred long after he had asked her to marry him.<br/><br/>But the music is what impressed me the most even though the lyrics were sometimes hard to understand. Lots of catchy stuff in here.<br/><br/>Notables: Gwilym Lee as Brian May ,Queen Lead Guitarist; Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor Queen drummer; Joseph Mazzelo as John Deacon as Queen Bassist; Ace Bhatti as Mercury's father; Aaron McCusker as Jim Hutton, Mercury's significant other; Mike Myers as Mr. Foster a record label executive;
Dermot Murphy as Bob Geldof, one of the promoters of the 1985 Live Aid show.<br/><br/>Even though Freddie Mercury was notified of his AIDS diagnosis he wanted to participate with Queen in the Live Aid show. These scenes at Live Aid with Rami Malek were probably as good as the real Freddie Mercury's performance. It was very uplifting.<br/><br/>When the credits roll you will see the real Freddie Mercury in some performances.
I read somewhere that Freddie Mercury left all of his estate to Mary Austin, who was indeed the love of his live. He died in 1991 at age 45.<br/><br/>All in all a great tribute to Freddie Mercury and very entertaining for all of us. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: At times.

"matthewgavin-47768","7","1","1","28 February 2019"," This film will stand the test of time... but...
","I was fortunate to see this film as a preview in Japan; where perhaps more than any other territory the band Queen found their initial success as a genre defining act.<br/><br/>To keep my observations short: was the film entertaining? Yes. Informative? Yes? Would I see it again? Yes?<br/><br/>But with all this positive exposure and Academy Award glory, it is important to remember that this is not a perfect movie. It is a perfect vanity project. In an age of social justice and equality it is important to tell Freddie Mercury's story. It gives the audience that did not grow up in the era of 'classic rock', an opportunity to see how times were so much more difficult in the 70's, 80's and early 90's. However the arts have always been a safe area for the casual observer to explore what was then known as the counter culture. Artists, musicians and athletes whilst all significant and progressive, have all been portrayed previously. For me, this project tastes a little like exploitation theatre, with a garnishing of some of the finest music the modern world has experienced."

"GerryofNorVA","8","1","1","27 February 2019"," A feature-length ""Behind the Music""
","Bohemian Rhapsody reveals a fairly decent glimpse ""behind the scenes"" of Queen's beginnings but focuses more on Freddie Mercury, of course. You'll find out when and why Farrokh Bulsara changed his name and when he determined he was bi. You'll also learn that when Freddie makes a firm decision, it's final. You'll also see the beginnings of their hallmark title song but interestingly it's never fully played, kind of ironic. In many ways, the film is very similar to A&E's ""Behind the Music"" documentaries. What it doesn't show, though, is actual footage of Freddie/Queen, nor does it show Freddie's death/funeral, both of which I found a bit disappointing."

","I loved this movie and before you read any further, I don't want to be negative in any way, but i think this movie would be better if it ended with the death of Freddie. The movie is simply 1 hour too short. I love the Queen music and i really was captivated by the story. But somehow this movie ended in a pretty happy way. It should not have ended like that. I rather would have seen the complete story and leave the theater in tears. That way the movie would have given me a bigger impact. There is so much more to tell about Queen and Freddie after Live Aid. It's a shame they kept that part away from the movie."
"atlasmb","7","1","1","25 February 2019"," An Interesting Portrayal Of Queen And Its Flamboyant Frontman
","This film about the rock group Queen primarily focuses on its frontman, Freddie Mercury. Based on actual events, it starts with the formation of the band and ends with Mercury's death, though Queen exists today with other members.<br/><br/>The film shows Mercury to be charismatic, capricious, dramatic, inventive, confident and, appropriately, mercurial. Often he would subject others to his emotionally neediness. But he was always passionate about the band and their work. He is such a compelling figure, one might wonder why the writers chose to change any actual facts, often with no discernible dramatic benefit. Because of this factual digression, I am downgrading my score by one. This is quite disappointing.<br/><br/>Still, the film is worth seeing. As a fan of the group's music, I enjoyed the inclusion of many of their best songs, especially the set from the Live Aid Concert at Wembley Stadium. Even non-fans have plenty to enjoy with the film's mix of music, drama, and comedy.<br/><br/>Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury has been singled out by most critics. Dental appliances and weeks of training to mimic Mercury's stage antics contribute to this compelling transformation. Mercury's flamboyance makes him very watchable and a suitable subject for a biopic."

When I first saw the movie, in the beginning I thought it was kinda boring, but once Queen started to record their most popular songs, my opinion changed completely. The movie started to get really emotional once Freddie went solo, and when he was diagnosed with AIDS. Like Brian May said, they were reluctant to some things in Freddie's life, but overall was a fantastic movie. They did a magnificent job of recreating Live Aid in 1985. I got very emotional during Live Aid and with a re-recorded version of Don't Stop Me Now for the end credits. I would recommend this to kids over 10. 11/10"
"Lejink","6","1","1","24 February 2019"," Mercury rising and falling
","This two hour plus celebration of the flamboyant Queen front-man Freddie Mercury, chooses to put his music at the forefront of his brief and often troubled personal life and indeed ends at the scene of his greatest career triumph, to wit, Queen's day-stealing slot at the London setting for 1985's Live Aid set, even eclipsing R.E.O. Speedwagon in the process! So the movie starts and ends with the group doing their twenty minute Live Aid set, jumping back from their getting ready to go on stage to tell the singer's story in conventional format, from his days as a rebellious teenager in his parents' strictly religious Parsi household, to working as an airport baggage handler, where he is the object of casual racist comments to his fateful meeting with his band mates just as their lead singer walks out on them.<br/><br/>Their story of struggling to get signed by a record label, internal group squabbling, finding success, more internal group squabbling, Freddie's key relationship with his muse and soul-mate, if not bed-mate, Mary Austin, yet more internal group squabbling, his mushrooming hedonistic, by now gay lifestyle although he never publicly came out unlike say, David Bowie or Elton John and yes, even more internal group squabbling before the band all kiss and make up in time to boost Bob Geldof's fund raising Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium.<br/><br/>Naturally the soundtrack is peppered with any number of Queen classics which helps to gloss over the sometimes over-dramatised sequences in Mercury's life. Rami Malek never once looks like Freddie, at least from the front, although ironically the actors playing the other band members strike greater resemblances. Malek is credible as the troubled Mercury and is equally good in the musical set pieces, although I felt the Live Aid climax looked a little unconvincing at times.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it was impossible not to enjoy the movie as a whole, despite its shortcomings, even if Freddie Mercury still maintains his enigmatic mystique once the movie has ended."

My mom has read every biography, watched countless interviews and docs about the band and always told me stories of their lives and the relationship between Freddie and Mary Austin. Seeing it portrayed onscreen felt like tales from my childhood come true. And the performances are simply incredible on all ends. My favorite scenes in particular are the studio creation of Bohemian Rhapsody and when they experiment with all different sounds. It really gave insight to just how innovative and brilliant they were. I watched this film on my own the first time and insisted my parents watch it with me the second. My mom is currently suffering from brain cancer so music isn't the first thing on her mind, but watching them watch this film made emotions happen I haven't seen from my parents in awhile.

","A Queen's movie will always be entertaining since it includes their amazing songs. That's the reason probably, why its rating is sooo high. People loved hearing their songs once again, me too, and of course loved them once more. Malek though. killed the movie for me... I had to avoid looking at his ""psycho"" reactions through out the movie. Malek is not an actor, I think that he's always playing a character with ""esoteric issues."" Real Freddie for example also looks and performs like a genius. Mr. Robot suits him fine because the character is someone with esoteric issues that fit him.<br/><br/>In my opinion you don't become Freddie Mercury neither by simply exposing his teeth (ridiculously too many times), nor by raising his arms and opening his mouth every time he sings! The acting was ridiculous, I only saw the Mr.Robot guy with a wig, fake teeth, and the ""psycho"" deep voice! All this have nothing to do with the real Freddie! If you want to know what kind of a super talent Freddie was, just watch one of his lives. There you'll see all that you missed in this certainly missed opportunity film. .<br/><br/>I love that the audience didn't focus on the impersonation's quality and liked the film, on the other hand I don't think that we'll see another ""Queen film"" and that sucks, because we're left with this horrible impersonation of the amazing Freddie!

","Bohemian Rhapsody is not a movie about just one thing. Freddie Mercury's story is one with many relationships. The film brings up many of these relationships all at once. There's Freddie's relationship with his parents, with Mary, with the members of Queen, with his mangers, with his lovers, and with himself. By the end of the movie the point is driven home, that Freddie has come to terms with who he is. After having found himself in this way, Freddie is able to give appropriate closure to each of these relationships. This surprised me, given how many of these open areas were present. Halfway through the movie, I did not imagine that the ending would be so satisfying. Still, the one fault I saw in the movie was just that it divides how much I care among each of these relationships.

Rami Malek delivers an insane acting performance, and totally deserves to be awarded. The pictures are so agreeable to watch thanks to the filming skills of the team. That is a great piece of art.
Unfortunately, I found it slightly long but perfection is hard to reach and honestly, it is definitely not what I'll recall."
"tgdamsi","6","1","1","18 February 2019"," Excellent performance by Malik in a mediocre and shallow pander
","It is clear that remaining members of the band had total creative control of this movie. It never really dives into the evolution of the music and there is very little character development. It is down to the superb performance of Rami Malek to let us glimpse a little of what could have been. The movie pulls on all the punches. There is barely a controversial character and the villain is figuratively shoved down our throats in a manner of speaking.
Being a Queen fan of decades, I found myself watching a summary of the band's portfolio rather than ansight. If you have seen the excellent documentary ""Days of our Lives"" then you are in for a dull couple of hours really. But still watchable just to see Mailk shine."
"barevfilm","9","1","1","18 February 2019"," Don't need to be a Queen fan to appreciatiate the film
","Subject: Bohemian Rhapsody<br/><br/>Finally caught it at a sold out Friday night showing where I lucked out and got the very last ticket. (At the PUSKIN)
Can't say I enjoyed it but I was entertained by the proceedings. I have never heard any Queen or Freddy Mercury music so I was watching it purely as an informational biopic depicting a pop music era that totally passed me by. At the time frame of the story I was living in Japan and basically out of touch with all things western.
I was quite impressed with the acting of Rami Malek, perfectly cast. I saw it more as a struggle of him dealing with his fluctuating sexuality terminating in death by AIDS, than as a rock n roll epic. The turning point scene is where he tells the female love of his life that he is bisexual. It takes on a whole different direction from there. A tragic one.
The grand finale on July 13, 1985 in Wembley Stadium, the AIDS Concert
is truly spectacular with literally a ""cast of thousands"". Can't help wondering how he did that. Musta been digital trickery because who can afford 80,000 extras -- but it was extraordinarily well staged. I wouldn't mind watching it again on a rainy afternoon.
Rami Malek makes you glad that Sacha the Mad Baron didn't get the part.
Incidentally Malek is an Egyptian Copt (Coptic Christian) which kind of fits the actual Mercury character, who was a Parsi of Indian origin. Therefore, in the film he is occasionally referred to as a ""Paki"", a pejorative term in England for Pakistanis.
The music is to my ears a bit grinding but the way the Queen musicians are shown on stage is the best such staging I have ever seen. Really gives you the feeling of what it feels like to be up there yourself looking out at the crowd.
All in all a very well assembled,film."

","To call this movie a biography would be inaccurate as the makers have taken many creative liberties, hagiography would be more accurate. Despite that, the movie is highly enjoyable and at the end, I had a deep appreciation for the band, their music, what they stood for and Freddie Mercury. Rami Malek is outstanding, his performance cannot be described by words. The scenes featuring the band members interacting with each other and creating music are like fireworks, spectacular to watch. The 'live-aid' performance which has been meticulously created and executed. It is impossible to not be swept away by the rhythm, for me that was the best part of the movie."

"ldcsp","7","1","1","16 February 2019"," Bohemian Rhapsody-Movie Review
","Bohemian Rhapsody is the true story of the life of the singer Freddie Mercury and the band Queen.
If you want to watch an honest, true depiction of the life of Freddie this movie might not be suitable for you. Bohemian Rhapsody has some true events mixed with some who were invented, let's say ""ideal events"" of the story made for the movie. It's this formula with drama mixed with humor, to satisfy the audience.
However the script it's decent, although all the events depicted might not be true it's a decent storyline. The cast is very good, mainly Rami Mallek. It's a great interpretation by him, he's the soul of the movie actually.
The directing is not bad too, and the movie moves well in terms of rhythm.
The final sequence of the concert is fantastic, even if you weren't present in live aid you can experience the exceitment, and emotions of the moment.
Bohemian Rhapsody has its problems for sure, it could have been better, but it's not a bad movie. I liked it. Maybe you will too.<br/><br/>7.0/10"
"royalewithcheese2020","8","1","1","16 February 2019"," Very well made, but could have been better
","My expectations may have been too high going in considering how many people are praising this movie, but it fell just a bit short for me. From a technical standpoint, it is done very well. The musical parts were amazing and Rami Malek was incredible, but the stories outside of the music parts were mediocre at best. I didn't have a problem with them focusing more on the band instead of Freddie himself like many critics would have liked. The only problem is that while it brings out all of the emotions we feel for Queen and Freddie the musician, it doesn't exactly do justice to Freddie the person in the process. The writers could have done a better job of at least getting more facts straight. I know it's a movie and adjustments have to be made, but the plot is scattered and ultimately falls flat outside of the musical aspects. I simply didn't find myself connecting with or really caring about any of the characters by the end of the movie. All in all though, it is great entertainment and I would definitely recommend it to Queen fans. However, probably a movie that is best to see at the theaters, not in a film class."

"rosswkcarlabk","10","1","1","25 January 2019"," A Triumph!
","This movie inspired me so much it has quickly risen toward the top of my all time favorites. I am a lover of music without visual (there are some of us who still prefer to use our ears) but I'll make an exception for a musical or music biopic. As a theater experience it was heaven to hear Queen playing full blast and well worth watching on a big screen to get the full concert effect. The band is well portrayed by all the actors-- Brian May (Gwilym Lee) the all around musician's musician, guitar god and band's unspoken leader, John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) the quiet and unassuming brilliant bass guitarist, Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) the rockstar drummer/ladies' man, and the irrepressible Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) flamboyant front man and performer who shaped the band's public persona, gifted with songwriting musical genius and a voice that could make angels weep. In Bohemian Rhapsody it's like Queen are all together again making music on our cinema screens, not like a dry documentary but like a concert with all the heart, charisma and chemistry the real Queen had in the 70's/80's, this was a band so tight they were sort of family each one talented on their own but together produced music for the ages. Rami Malek is not a doppelganger of his character in looks but no matter because he doesn't just play a role it's like he got taken over by whatever charisma and power Freddie Mercury possessed. It is a goose bump inducing portrayal and deserves every award for acting there is. I could see Freddie's joy and pain, triumph and tragedy, conflict and resolve--he was not so different than other stars of the era of sex, drugs and rock and roll--it was for many a path to unbridled hedonism and Freddie was adored by rock and roll fans for being Freddie both because and in spite of his escapades and this respectful movie heightens the feeling without taking away his humanity or sexuality. His relationships with his family and with Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker) are very touching and the actors are noteworthy as was (Tom Hollander) as the instantly likeable Jim (Miami) Beach, the band's manager. The movie follows the biopic pattern but I don't see that as a negative when Queen and Freddie's musical story is so tailor made for it--they didn't have to change the story to fit the pattern just condensed and moved the events around to fit the movie running time. Some characters were fictionalized but this is a movie and most movies are entirely fiction so I don't have a problem with it. The editing was outstanding for both visual and sound. The soundtrack supports the story magnificently. I was a mess of emotions while watching Bohemian Rhapsody and haven't stopped reflecting on it ever since. Bravo to the cast and crew!"

"nicfernando","10","1","1","24 January 2019"," Your my best friend
","This film has been misunderstood by many critics expecting it to share Freddie Mercury's homosexual lifestyle with precise timelines which would have made it a less favourable direction for a story, what we witness is a bitesize skipping through timelines of the fantastic journey of the band Queen with its charismatic front man Freddie Mercury. This made me feel I was there travelling through time watching their rise to greatness as one of the best rock bands we will ever see and a band that captures the imagination of old and new generations of music lovers, it's timeless in its delivery and despite inaccuracies that many seem to point out at a whim, I found myself becoming Freddie best friend willing him on and comforting his moments of losing faith in himself, I just found myself loving a person by the end who was the genius of the music that will be played for many generations to come. The acting surely is the success of this movie and the tears evidence that this legend surely won the hearts of many, Freddie showed a complex character in many ways but his inspiration was the love he couldn't be true to and the main influence on his life Mary, this was fundamental to the story right to the end."
"nirome","9","1","1","23 January 2019"," It will rock you.
","In spite of all the bad reviews this movie has received over the few months since its release, it's managed to attract a following that, if I'm not mistaken and I don't think I am, it's made it a box office hit and the highest grossing musical biopic ever made.
And I can perfectly understand why. It sure uses some well trodden paths and formulas to tell its story, but it also conveys something that most films nowadays lack. It conveys emotion. Whether you're a Queen fan or not, you cannot help but be moved by the story and especially the lead singer of one the best bands of the 20th century. Whatever the movie's faults may be, historical accuracy for the most part, it more than makes up for with heart and above all, a mesmerizingly uncanny portrayal of Freddie Mercury by Rami Malek. The rest of the cast help give his performance the necessary backbone that the story otherwise would lack. What's worth taking away from it, it's that it gives voice to a rock band that most young people nowadays wouldn't necessarily know existed. The movie goes in a crescendo until it finally reaches its end; Queen's Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium. And if you're still not convinced to this point, that set piece alone is well worth the price of admission. That alone, and Malek's performance, did it for me. Do not miss out."

Happily I was wrong. Yes there are sad moments but I was so blown away by the acting and the whole movie when it ended I felt joy. Freddie will be truly missed. He definitely left his mark though. This film was a celebration of sorts about his life and achievements that defined Freddie as a true showman. He was a master entertainer. His amazing voice is uniquely his. That is why the singing in this movie was lip synced. The acting was amazing. Rami Malek did an excellent job of his portrayal of Freddie. All the other members of the band were portrayed exceptionally well. I was truly amazed. this movie is a keeper and one that I plan to watch over again. I particularly loved the Live Aid scene.

Can't wait to see it again!"
"BandSAboutMovies","7","1","1","20 January 2019"," Surprised by how much I enjoyed this
","When asked what makes Queen different from any other band, Freddie Mercury is quick with an answer. ""We're four misfits who don't belong together, we're playing for the other misfits. They're the outcasts, right at the back of the room. We're pretty sure they don't belong either. We belong to them.""<br/><br/>In 1980, when Queen's ""The Game"" came out, I was that eight-year-old misfit. Too chubby, too weird, too loud, too nice. I hated school because it meant getting beat up every single day. And even on a day when I'd get the opportunity to bring in a record for music class, the other kids would all make fun of me. I didn't listen to popular music, but brought in the band's ""News of the World"" album, with a Frank Kelly Freas cover of a robot killing people, including Queen itself. No one liked it. In fact, they hated it. But when ""Another One Bites the Dust"" came out that year, more than a few of them learned about the power of Queen.<br/><br/>Queen was always too much in the best of ways. They've continued to be there for the best and worst moments of my life. In fact, the solo on ""We Will Rock You"" is probably my favorite of all time, as you can hear the hum of Brian May's guitar even before the first note is played. When this movie was announced, I worried, as how could any movie, no matter how huge, capture the spirit of Queen?<br/><br/>Originally announced in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen cast as Mercury before leaving in 2013 because of creative differences, the film sat unmade until Rami Malek (TV's Mr. Robot) was cast in November 2016.<br/><br/>Directed by Bryan Singer (the X-Men films, Apt Pupil and The Usual Suspects), the film concentrates on Freddie Mercury while also touching on the rest of the band.<br/><br/>It starts when young Farrokh Bulsara is just a college student and airport baggage handler who has been following a band named Smile. After one of their shows, he meets Brian May (Gwilym Lee, guitarist in the band Male Friends and a near identical twin for the man he's playing) and drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy, who played Archangel in Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse). With their lead singer quitting, he joins the band along with bassist John Deacon (Joe Mazzello, the kid from the original Jurassic Park).<br/><br/>After selling their van to finance their first album, the band quickly signs to EMI, travels to America and Freddie adopts his stage name as his real name. He also gets engaged to Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton, who is great in this) while beginning to question his sexuality, including a scene where he stares at a truck driver played by Adam Lambert, who has performed with Queen.<br/><br/>That's the crux of people's worries with the film - that the movie plays hard and fast with the facts of Mercury's sexuality and AIDS-related death. Many believe Mercury learned he had HIV between 1986 and 1987, but not before Live Aid in 1985 as depicted in the film. He didn't tell the band until 1989.<br/><br/>But back to the movie - when Queen record their fourth album ""A Night at the Opera"" they end up leaving EMI when Ray Foster (a made-up person loosely based on EMI chief Roy Featherstone, who was actually a fan of the song) refuses to release a six-minute long single. There's an interesting meta moment here, as Foster is played by Mike Myers, whose use of the song in Wayne's World led to it being loved by a whole new generation. The best part of this scene is the triumph of the song being released, only for horrible reviews to emerge. Such is Queen - they didn't belong to critics.<br/><br/>Freddie falls for Paul, the band's manager, and comes out as bisexual to his fiancee. They live next to one another for years, but Freddie is hurt when she finally moves on. The band has ups and downs, but Freddie decides to leave in 1982, recording an album for CBS for more money than he could make with Queen.<br/><br/>This is another fallacy, as doing a solo record is seen as Freddie sinning against the band. The trust is that Taylor released ""Fun in Space"" and ""Strange Frontier"" while May released ""Star Fleet Project"" years before Mercury's ""Mr. Bad Guy"" was recorded.<br/><br/>Also, remember that when the band breaks up before Live Aid, that never happened. Queen released ""The Works"" in 1984 and toured all over the world to support it, with the final date just two weeks before they played that massive charity event.<br/><br/>That said, the end of the movie is amazing. The performance at Live Aid is captured perfectly, featuring the songs ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Radio Ga Ga"", ""Hammer to Fall"" and ""We Are the Champions."" I also thought that they used archival footage of Bob Geldof, but it's really Dermot Murphy. In a nice bit of caemo work, look for Brian May and Roger Taylor in this scene as they watch from the rafters.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, Singer didn't even finish the film. He often showed up late to set or disappeared for long stretches, including three straight days after the Thanksgiving break, at which point cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel took over. Singer was fired and 20th Century Fox terminated his production deal before finishing the movie with new director Dexter Fletcher, who is also directing the Elton John bio Rocketman. However, the Director's Guild assigned sole directed credit to Singer.<br/><br/>If you're seeking an examination of Mercury's refusal to come out and how he dealt with AIDS, as well as his identity as Indian-British Parsi man, this isn't that movie. This is Queen's greatest hits, an exploration of their music less than one of the truth. It's packed with plenty of audience-pleasing moments instead of personal revelations. Maybe we'll get that movie someday. This isn't it. And that's fine - I never expected it to be."

"yarayaz","8","1","1","6 January 2019"," Wonderful Homage to Queen and focus on unique Freddie - Mary relationship
","All in all, a movie that pays a great homage to Queen, the band, and all their terrific and timeless songs that will never lose their catchiness and spark. I especially loved all the heart-warming and humorous moments between the band, who truly were family to each other. Freddie was an exceptional human-being with one of the most unique vocal ranges.<br/><br/>I really think the movie focused on Freddie's (sexual) identity crisis and how he juggled it with his immense success. It all started when Mary outed him as ""gay"" instead of bisexual (which I believe she said this because of her own misconception of herself as always being the 'second choice' for someone [""I love you, but""] ). I believe that is when he started going downhill, and started having multiple lovers and living according to his label. I don't want to assume since I don't know much about AIDS as a disease, but his promiscuous sexual ""all over the place"" lifestyle could have increased his probability of contracting AIDS. If, however, him and Mary would have fully embraced each other despite the affirmation of Freddie's bisexuality, I truly believe Freddie could have had a much more stable and happy life with Mary and himself (because clearly they couldn't live without each other). It's interesting to note how ""bisexuality"" wasn't really a label at the time, but more so you were either ""gay"" or ""straight"", which I think causes confusion amongst people who can't settle for just one. Overall, labels in general are damaging and I really don't think we should be defined by them.<br/><br/>
As for the few shortcomings of the film, some scenes were not flowing between each other and it felt rushed at times. The film was a bit too long and sometimes they didn't have to focus on the performances as much as there was need to focus on the songwriting process behind some of their greatest work (with the exception of ""bohemian rhapsody""). However, all that was super exceeded by the wonderful musicality of the film and Rami Malek's undeniably brilliant portrayal of Freddie."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is supposed to be a Queen movie but it focuses on Mercury insted. It starts out of Mercury walking out his house getting ready to perform in their final concert. It goes into a flashback and in a short summary they all meet, Mercury after game goes insane, he gets AIDS, then they play.<br/><br/>The character arcs are performed perfectly for the main character and the biggest one that I saw was Mercury finding out he was bisexual. Many of the conflicts between characters were also great but the one that was I felt was unnecessary was the conflict between the first radio company and Queen. It had nothing on the story and didn't really had any purpose.<br/><br/>The main reason why I gave this an 8 was the songs, I get how you in a song about Queen you have to feature the songs. But they tried and obviously tried to cameo all the popular songs such as ""We Will Rock You"" and more.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie and I will probably rewatch this many times.

","While Bohemian Rhapsody will never match up to the excellence of Queen's music, it is entertaining, at times foot stomping, and slightly more often than not, fun.<br/><br/>The performances by the ensemble are quite fine, but they're ultimately overshadowed by the central performance by Rami Malek. I think he really found a way to find Freddie Mercury inside of him; it's an impressive performance that elevates the film so much more.<br/><br/>The story definitely glosses over a few things. It focuses a lot more on Freddie's heterosexual life rather than his homosexual qualities and coming out, which I don't necessarily agree with. There are times we feel disconnected from the writing, but the resolutions and climax make it worth it.<br/><br/>The direction... I've never been a fan of Bryan Singer, I think I'm done with him at this point. The pacing feels so uneven, the shots are at times lackluster, and the lighting just feels dreary.<br/><br/>One of the (surprisingly) best things in this film is the production design. It's the quality that helps immerse us in this time period as much as it can.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody has some redeeming qualities that help elevate its mediocre craftsmanship, the main of which is an ensemble of fine performances, lead by the fittingly brave and charismatic Rami Malek (7/10)"

His rock concerts mainly as the vocalista of the Queen's band are pucntuated by dramatic events related to his relationship with the other band members and managers and to his love and sex life. The concerts shown are magnificenrt and gorgeour indeed. It's a movie that seduces and captivates you from the first to the last scene."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","14 November 2018"," A tale of self-destructive but uniquely creative showmanship...
","Time will tell whether Bryan Singer's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" will proudly stand among the greatest biopics of its era... but it does help a lot when it's about one of the most gifted and talented artists of his generation and Freddie Mercury IS a legend, though slightly overshadowed by the pop icons of the 80's. Still; there's one thing they won't ever take from Mercury or Queen, and it stands in two words: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".<br/><br/>Yes, one song. One single song is enough to justify their place among the musical Gods. I'll never forget the first time my brother made me listen to it, I knew Queen from ""We Will Rock You"", ""We Are the Champions"" and forgive me for that, the theme of ""Highlander"". When I first heard ""Bo Rhap"", I didn't know what to expect and that feeling went all through the listening: it was both magical and bizarre, whimsical and poignant. I knew I had to listen to that song again, and I did it over and over, to the point I became obsessed. Literally.<br/><br/>Like they say in the film: everyone finds its own story in the rhapsody, it doesn't need to have a meaning. Nothing really matters, like the song says. And the biopic depicts a group of four misfits that found each other, on the top of them an exotic looking effeminate man who invented his own fashion and acted like a drama queen, using more 'darlings' than Talullah Bankhead and Cruella DeVil put together; such colorful roles are wet dreams for actors looking for a breakthrough performance.<br/><br/>I had my reservations when I first saw a picture of Rami Malek but now I think he should be a lock-up for the Oscar nomination, not that it really matters (any way the wind blows as the song says again...) He's simply unrecognizable as the legendary singer and he never plays his mannerisms as a gimmick but as a deliberate carapace of awkwardness concealing deeper wounds. I guess a modern audience can probably respond to Mercury's antics more than his own generation did but Freddie has that edge over all the Madonnas and Lady Gagas, which is that we can't doubt his sincerity.<br/><br/>He was indeed a true and complete artist, with that element of self-doubt and insecurity that made him make the wrong choices and choose a path that would cross AIDS. And that was Mercury, a man who turned everything to his advantage, who was true to himself no matter what and sometimes turned his own blessings into curses. As he says, mistakes, he's made a few... but ultimately, he was the champion of the world. Now, the question is: is the film good because it's about a popular performer and entertainer, could a Queen biopic possibly fail?<br/><br/>To put it simply, while all the other characters are slightly meant as pawns in Mercury's life, there are two stars in the film: Rami Malek who gives a performance that does justice to the legacy of Mercury and there's the music, there's no moment in the film that doesn't feature one of them. And much to my surprise there was less lip synching than I thought and the concert performances emphasized the way Malek totally embodied the soul of Mercury, his aura, his body... minus the voice. He is that good.<br/><br/>The film treats the singer's origins through a few outbursts of racial slurs (he's called ""Paki"" while he's Farsi Indian born in Zanzibar) and scenes with his family that have the tact not to get too melodramatic. We also have the evolution of his feelings and the discovery of his longly repressed homosexuality, perhaps the second most important character is Mary (Lucy Boynton) who inspired the heart-breaking ""Love of My Life"". There's the dry spell, the decadent days and of course, the come-back during the iconic Live Aid concert, maybe the peak of his career and certainly one of the images most associated to the singer.<br/><br/>The film ventures in the usual realm of musical biographies, it doesn't reinvent the wheel but why should it anyway? Who needs fancy directing when the show is driven by an eccentric and tortured soul like Mercury. He's a show on his own and I don't envision more than two or three nominations for the film, but at least the so long anticipated biopic was released and maybe it's a star-making role for Malek who looks incredibly convincing. Speaking of that, I also failed to notice Mike Meyers (whose name popped up in the credits) but I'm glad, I'm really glad the film made a subtle nod to ""Wayne's World"" because a huge part of the song's legacy is due to its re-use in 1992. Till now, who can resist banging his head at the guitar solo moment?<br/><br/>At the end of the film, many viewers were singing a few Queen hits, I was whistling ""Tonight"" on the way back home, remembering that even my daughter who's just turned five, loved to listen to the 'mama' song but were scared of the Muppet version. I think there's something unique about Queen, the way they used Rock, opera, Pop and disco sounds, their symbiosis with the audience and the self-destructive yet so creative showmanship of their lead singer. My only regret is that they didn't feature one of my favorite Mercury's songs: ""Living on my Own"" (it was begging to be used in the break-up part).<br/><br/>The film is far from being perfect, there's something obvious and maybe too linear in its storytelling, even subtly manipulative but it transcend that crooked banality just like a tooth-condition that allowed the legend to reach so many high octaves. How the film succeeds by being so 'predictable', maybe it's because like Queen's music, it just can't be pigeonholed. It's not much a biopic, not much a music movie... it's just a film about Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>And that's enough."

","The acting is great, the music is terrific and the sense of the time period is right on. But the tagline, ""Fearless Lives Forever"" made me want to learn more about what made their MUSIC groundbreaking and how fearless their creativity was. Trying to get a long song on pop radio was hard but it'd been done before Queen. The Doors' Light My Fire or the Beatles' Day In The Life come to mind.<br/><br/>I liked hearing how Brian wanted to include the audience with the anthemic We Will Rock You. Give me more of those insights to the creative process. How does someone write a song like Bohemian Rhapsody? What were his influences? How much was careful calculation or playful excess? Tell me how they made such a joyful noise."

We were family when families, for whatever reasons, could not be. This film captured that fear, confusion, separation. and simple need for love so well it brought all of that back for me. Some reviews I read before tonight made me doubt this movie; I didn't expect to be touched. Now, as then, some people just don't get it. Its not about the grnarly bits of Freddie's life; you can dig that up if you have that need. This is a respectful and caring treatment of a loved one who brought more joy than he found. It is told through his eyes but also through his family who lost him too soon.

","Overall I enjoyed the movie a lot even not being a Queen fan. Can't deny the legendary status of the band so it's almost a must see, on a big screen with good sound!
I loved the casting even though I cannot vouch for the closeness of depiction of the characters by the actors, because i did not happen to follow the real musicians. However visually i find the casting superb!
What the movie was lacking in for me is the pace and human emotions. The flow was a bit choppy, not building up enough of a story to follow, seemed more like a collection of sketches of different moments in the band's history, i blame that on the script. And even though i did find myself tearing a tad bit in like one moment, i can see potential to show way more of real life drama in the film. I used to be in a band, and my bf is in a band now, and wow, let me tell you, when 4-5 people work together creatively and try doing business too - it's WAY MORE DRAMA than we saw in this movie. Looked just way too easy peasy, with like 1 big argument which didnt even feel all that serious at all. I wanted to feel more! And my bf said there wasn't enough oomph for him, which basically wraps up what i said in a 5 letter word))"
"stormslinger","10","1","1","5 November 2018"," An Amazing Tribute to one of the greatest Artists and Bands EVER.
","Going into this movie, I was already a Queen fan. I had some reservations that the movie would focus too much on Freddie's sexuality and not enough on his creativity and musical genius. I was very pleased with the end result, as this movie was nothing short of perfect.<br/><br/>When I say it was perfect, keep in mind that some of the events were out of order. But, not so much as to de-emphasize the impact of his life/music on the story as a whole.<br/><br/>The casting of Rami Malek was dead-on! At some point, early in the movie, Rami and Freddie became one. Every mannerism, all the flamboyance and all the showmanship that Freddie was known for, was represented flawlessly. The rest of the casting was amazing, with the exception of Mike Meyers, and the film played out as I had hoped it would.<br/><br/>This was by far one of the 3 best biopics ever, Amadeus and The Doors being the other 2.

"ogmelly","6","1","1","5 November 2018"," enjoyable, fun but not epic
","Disclaimer: I am not a professional critic and my review is based on my personal point of view.<br/><br/>As a Queen and biopic fan, I was among those fans who waited months for this movie to come out. I was amazed by the trailers and somehow set a high expectation for this movie.<br/><br/>I have watched several biopics before and I am very well-thought when it comes to the accuracy and timeline of the plot. This movie is undeniably fun and enjoyable to watch with every scenes well put together with Queen's most iconic songs but it became a distraction to me when 90% of the characters are real life people but the contents are somewhat fictional.<br/><br/>Other than that, the plot is a bit rush-y. I wish they would make the story slightly raw. Everyone knows how intimate Mary Austin and Freddie Mercury's relationship was in the past, I find it disappointing that the film put aside the small detail to focus more on bigger details such as their path to fame. When Freddie told Mary Austin that he's actually a bisexual, I couldn't really connect to the actors' chemistry on screen as the film didn't fully emphasize on their relationship climate. With that being said, I was expecting to see more of the bandmates' personal life and struggles as an individual.<br/><br/>However, I was in tears during the Live Aid performance. I feel like during that very last scene was how everything comes together. The looks on every each of important people in Freddie's life gave me such an impact. The way they were seeing him reaching the peak of his career was a truly emotional and moving moment for me.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would watch this movie again. I love how the they didn't cram everything at the same time in a way that the audiences would feel as if it's too much to take in. The dramatic events were kept at minimum level sand it turns out to be a movie that you don't have to glare at your wristwatch every 10 minutes asking yourself when will this end."

It is not true that Freddy told the band or even found out about him having aids one week before live aid for starters. Other than the horrific story telling, not mentioning the lack of continuity in directorion, what saves the movie are the cast, rami did perfom very well.

"Hunter_Logan","7","1","1","4 November 2018"," A formulaic but tender, celebratory, and engaging spectacle
","Bohemian Rhapsody begins as a scattered mess but continuously settles into its footing until it reaches a third act of transcendent beauty. The script falls victim to the many musician biopic cliches that the world assumed died with the Dewey Cox Story, but sure enough, the father-son dynamics and endless stream of greatest hits origin stories are on fully display here. Of course the film does not live up to the expectations of its long gestation period, nor is it as revolutionary as a film about one of the greatest bands and singers of all time should be. But it treats its subject with great care, and when the movie finally corrects its course, it becomes an unmissable musical and cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The cinematography, editing, and costumes are all absolutely incredible, and of course, Rami Malek deserves an Oscar for his pitch perfect transformation into the legendary Freddie Mercury. This is a classic example of a film that succeeds in every manner imaginable except for its script (and also Mike Meyers' character and performance... yikes). Overall, Queen fans will be ecstatic, and the average moviegoer won't want to miss it, but cinephiles will leave the theater imagining the masterpiece that the film could have been had Peter Morgan remained its screenwriter.<br/><br/>An important final note: the film does NOT gloss over Freddie's sexuality and wild lifestyle. It is NOT a PG-13 washed down disappointment as some have called it. I have been scratching my head at these critiques all day."
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","7","1","1","4 November 2018"," Entertaining purely because its Queen...
","I didnt go into this film expecting much. Mostly, it was an excuse to listen to Queen Music. So for that aspect, great. There certainly are aspects of the film that are great and you're gonna want to rock out to. A lot of the ""concert footage"" is great. But at the same time, if I wanted to watch Queen performances I could put on youtube and watch the real thing. I totally get why one review called it Queen Wikipedia Article the movie. I didnt find it particularly deep or insightful. It felt like here some quick highlights that you already knew about. A lot of the reviews praised Rami Malek and I agree with that. Though I dont know if I would say Oscar worthy (as much as I found A Star is Born too melodramtic for my tastes Bradley Cooper definitely beats Rami out of the water). But I also thought the rest of the cast was great too. Not enough light has been shone on the rest of Queen. And props the casting director cause I felt they all looked and came across as who they were supposed to be. The one small gripe I have with it, is that the actor playing Roger (Ben Hardy) is so baby faced. Its fine for the 70s sequences, but when it comes to Live Aid and they're talking about how they're aging dinosaurs it didnt feel believable. Probably didnt help considering the other cast members were 12-15 years older than him, when in real life they were like 3-5 years apart. The only person in the cast that was kind of meh to me was Mike Meyers. It felt like Mike Meyers in a wig. You've seen it before. Although I did enjoy the scene during Live Aid where it cut to his character watching and realizing what a horrible mistake he made.<br/><br/>It wasnt all horrible, in particular I did tear up when Freddie is telling the band about how he has aids and he doesnt want anyone to feel sorry for him, and the band is trying to fight back tears. And I loved the scene with Freddie in the rain taking his life back. But there were also some moments that were a little cheesy too.<br/><br/>Overall, I didnt hate the film. I could certainly watch it again and be entertained. But I didnt think it was great piece of film. Ive seen better biopics. I've seen better music biopics."
"elicopperman","6","1","1","4 November 2018"," Not as Exuberant as the Iconic Song
","Queen remains as one of the most iconic rock bands of all time, so making a biopic about them was a no-brainer. This film in particular was actually in development since 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play Freddie Mercury himself. However, after several disagreements with Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor, the project never went into full swing until a few years later, with Rami Malek of Mr. Robot to star as Mercury. In the end, what we got is a beautiful albeit standard tribute to the band. While it has its moments of inspiration, the product doesn't really rise above being passible and highly flawed.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the biggest problem with Bohemian Rhapsody lies within its depiction of Freddie Mercury through his personal life. Mercury was a highly fascinating albeit eccentric man who spent much of his life coping with his personal stigmas, yet the movie ends up rushing past plot point after plot point so much that the most we gain out of him was that he was bisexual, he liked cats and he died from AIDS. It doesn't help that the rest of Queen aren't given much development either, as each member comes off as two dimensional with little to know about them. What could have been a unique take on the musician biopic genre ends up being as cliche as the next, complete with disapproving parents, the shoddy romantic life, the greedy manager, the band break-up and the drug addiction. Even if some of these elements are appropriately dramatic, they still come off as routine and tiresome.<br/><br/>On the plus side though, Rami Malek is fantastic as Freddie Mercury, as one can tell he truly analyzed his concert performances and videos in capturing enough charm, charisma and skill in recreating the iconic figure. In fact, the actors in general are wonderful in inhabiting their roles, especially those playing the other members of Queen. As formulaic as their relationship can be, they do manage to display a lot of witty banter and humorous rebuttals in managing their group. Even though Mary Austin is written as the typical concerned girlfriend, Lucy Boynton tries her best in making her sympathetic and she pulls it off well enough to create a decent amount of heart in the film. I can't say any of the characters are given enough dimension to be looked upon with greatness, but at least the cast knew how to deliver their performances with a lot of delightful zest.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's direction on the film can be a mixed bag at times. There are wonderfully crafted moments like the actors recreating the famous opening of the Bohemian Rhapsody music video, with negative quotes from critics being shown in contrast, and pretty much every performance and music video recreation, especially the Live Aid concert. However, other times the editing can get a little jarring and flashy up to the point where some of the performances can get a little sickening to watch. There might also be a few too many quick cuts even during scenes where characters just discuss specific details for their own good. On the other hand, the timing to the music, post production special effects and near flawless singing make up for what would otherwise be distracting choices in mashing scenes together in an exuberantly stylized manner.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of respect for Freddie Mercury and what he did for modern music displayed in the film, but Bohemian Rhapsody could have been so much better than what it became. While the production design, acting and scenes of putting together the band's famous songs are worth praising, the rushed plot and simplified depiction of Mercury's personal and romantic relationships keep the film from being anything special. I suppose if you're simply a die hard Queen fanatic and you just want to see a decent albeit imperfect tribute to the famous band, then you might have a good time. On the other hand, if you're not a fan of them or you're very passionate about the real life of Mercury, it's best to give this one a skip. Maybe someday we'll get a truly marvelous and correct bio on one of Britain's greatest bands, but right now, this will simply remain as one of Rami Malek's best performances on his resume, because that man knew how to bring the bisexual super star to life better than this flick did."
"elurffer","7","1","1","3 November 2018"," Loads of Fun, Wish It Went Further
","The first paragraph is spoiler free for anyone who doesn't want to have the movie ruined for them.<br/><br/>I found the film to be quite fun and enjoyable. Definitely something you will sing along to by yourself or with the right company.I think a lot of people that are rating the film very poorly were expecting a biopic solely on Freddie, while this movie looks at his personal life and his life with the other members in a moderate scale and focuses more on the music and its relationship with people. I would say if you want to watch a film with lots of laughs, great music and a bit of heart go watch it.<br/><br/>In some ways this film should have been two separate films: one on Queen the band and one on Freddie himself. It treads the line in a way that leaves me wanting it to lean to one side or the other. I wish it delved deeper into the band's process of creating and their evolution,or Freddie's direct impact of that music based on the things that were happening in his life. While the film covers this lightly, I wish it explored more Freddie's psyche seeing as he was a deeply private man. For example, and SPOILER: When Freddie's ex Mary has moved on with a new love interest Freddie looks to her window and turns on his lamp, a move copied earlier in the film in which he talks to her over the phone in the hopes of feeling some sort of connection to her, or to anyone she doesn't turn the lights on in the present. And there is a moment of palpable pain at his loneliness that I think if was shone more would make it easier to see where some of his most amazing songs were coming from. Obviously the music Freddie made came from very high emotions, and very low ones as well. I believe had the film decided on what the primary focus would be it would be stronger as a whole. Whether it was the band and their evolution and their sense of closeness and family, or Freddie's personal life and his mentality towards approaching his music either would have been acceptable had the film veered towards one of these paths.<br/><br/>One thing I will say though against the film are blatant historical inaccuracies for the sake of movie tension. SPOILERS: Like when in the film towards the end it is said that the band hadn't performed together for years prior to the Live Aid concert, when in fact they had toured the year before for their album The Works. They were also not on bad terms when they did part ways for Freddie to do his solo albums as the film depicts. They were burned out from touring and all agreed on a break. The made-up feuding is a big detractor for me, especially knowing how close all the members were and how much they cared for each other. Those are two things regarding actual history that was dramatized that I don't care for.<br/><br/>I have to give credit where credit is due though for the last twenty minutes of the film where they replicate Queen's performance at Live Aid. That was a marvel in itself, the cast did a fantastic job, the film crew did a great job. The audience at the theater was enjoying it as much as if the theater was Wembley itself. So major kudos to the film for covering it in all its glory. And many thanks to Marc Martell, the man who was responsible for the reconstructed singing of Freddie's voice that laid over Malek's and Freddie's own voice. Very well done."

"sweetdoxy","8","1","1","3 November 2018"," No Walk The Line but good music with an interesting, otherworldly character
","I saw a lot of similarities with Johnny Cash's story in Walk The Line. I just kept comparing those two throughout the film. Now, I like Queen's music more but I felt Walk The Line was a better film. I felt like Bohemian Rhapsody focused too much of him being a star, a diva and it was just unfimiliar and unrelatable. There wasn't the kinda human connection I had with Walk The Line eventhough the stories were similar. But the music scenes were done nicely. I felt like standing up, clapping, dancing and singing along but being from a withdrawn, reserved country I sat still not to annoy anyone, going crazy all by myself. Maybe others would have followed, who knows.
I liked the wittiness of Mercury and as I mentioned the diva parts, they were done well too but there wasn't that much of him as just a person.
Also eventhough it was said in the film that Queen wasn't just him, it was all of the members then the film really heavily focused on Mercury only. I get it, it was his story but, I felt the other members and people were just, not even playing the second fiddle, but like the 12th fiddle. I found it like moment-breaking, kinda illusion breaking when the camera was showing the people's faces reacting to the things Mercury did and said in the film. It made the other people really dependant on him and with the band members it really was like the 12th fiddle thing. Like only their opnions of the lead singer mattered and they were not people/musicians of their own. Those frames/scenes looked a bit like something out of some cheap, not so good American 90s comedies or something.
But big love to Rami Malek. I haven't really seen Mercury's interviews or anything but whether Malek did a good impersonation of him or not, he played the part fantastically.
Also, from the scene where Mercury and his lady had the gay talk onwards, my mum blubbed uncontrollably til the end. I didn't hear anyone else blowing their nose. The woman on my other side wiped her face once.
I didn't feel like crying once cause I didn't have the emotional, human connection but it was enjoyable.
Also, I haven't followed the promo for this film but I was so confused and shocked as to why Show Must Go On Wasn't played. It is SUCH a hit so... why not!?"

The story of the band fluids very quickly yes, but besides the timing of the movie, it catches every single moment of greatness of Queen. The performances, the script, the way they manage the live concerts it's pretty amazing.

","This movie was awesome!! If you let negative reviews from keyboard critics deter you from seeing this, you have allowed them to deprive you from an enjoyable experience. Rami Malek is spot on as Freddie Mercury, and the guy playing Brian May definitely looked like Brian May! This is can't miss for a true QUEEN fan. As for the folks that have never really paid much attention to the band and their music, go check out the movie. I am willing to bet that you will be a fan afterwards."

","I left the theater having a smile on my face because I was completely entertained from start to finish. You realize that we do not have bands like this anymore. You realize that these bands of the 70s & 80s were the real thing. They were musicians and entertainers and worked theirs butts off and made their OWN music. The actors portrayed the bandmates on a pretty accurate scale. You saw what made Freddie...Freddie. The climax at the end was great. This is a movie to see. It may not be a award winning film but you get your money worth."

","I don't think I have ever been to the cinema to see a film where the entire audience stands and applauds at the end. In fact it's been an age since I went to the cinema and didn't look at my watch once. But this is exactly what happened when I went to see Bohemian Rhapsody last week. It was a fast roller coaster ride with loud hair, loud personalities and loud music a-plenty. Like Queen, it was tongue-in-cheek and at times comedic, occasionally the characters appeared like Freddie's teeth, to be larger than life. But one thing it never did was disappoint. This was the best film I have seen in a long time.
Bohemian Rhapsody tells the story of the genesis of the band Queen and culminates in their monumental performance at Live Aid in 1985. This film has been beset with problems and has taken over ten years to produce. The lead role of Freddie was originally cast with Sacha Baron Cohen until artistic differences with the remaining Queen members, Brian May and Roger Taylor, led them to recast Ben Whilshaw before finally settling on Rami Malek, known for playing Elliott in the American network show, Mr Robot. It was first directed by Bryan Singer, who was eventually sacked and replaced with the brilliant Dexter Fletcher. The remaining members of Queen didn't want the film to be simply a Freddie Mercury biopic. However, Freddie Mercury was such a natural front man with a talent for showing off and performing, that it is impossible not to set him centre stage. One would have thought that with such problems the film would lack cohesion This is definitely not the case as the movie's continuity is fast-paced and much like a fairground ride, there is no time to stop and pause or get off.<br/><br/>The film sets as it frame, Queen's performance at Live Aid. It begins with Freddie Mercury nervously warming up as he waits to appear on one of the largest Worldwide stages ever. We then return to the seventies where we see the emergence of Freddie from Farrokh Bulsara, the poet and dreamer-son of Persian immigrants who is little more than a baggage handler at Heathrow, where he is the target of racism. There is the typical 'my family doesn't understand me' scene where his father sees him as a disappointment before we see Freddie joining Brian May and Roger Taylor in the band Smile and forming a relationship with the beautiful, Biba-bedecked Mary Austin. Freddie appears to be the ambitious one, pushing the band to make an album and break free from their mediocre performances in pubs and students unions.<br/><br/>As the band finally settles on its identity of Queen, we see the group horrified by the idea of lip-synching on Top of The Pops with 'Killer Queen' and watch their slow rise to success with an early tour of America. Their fame begins to grow, and we see brief glimpses of Freddie's battle with his sexuality. As much as he adores Mary, he feels strongly attracted to the thrill of casual homosexual encounters. He writes,' Love of my Life' for Mary and their relationship is far deeper than any definition. It transcends sex and shows that despite his fondness for picking up men, Freddie had an overwhelming need to love and be loved. When he becomes famous, Freddie still keeps Mary near to him.One of the most dynamic sections of the film concerns the 1975 production of Queen's third album, 'A Night At the Opera' and in particular the song Bohemian Rhapsody, which at the time was twice as long as most popular songs played on the radio. Now it is perceived as one of Queen's greatest songs, but we see the opposition Queen faced from record companies and management because it was against the norm. Enter Mike Myers as Ray Foster with the very witty joke, 'It goes on forever, six bloody minutes!"" To which Freddie retorts,'I pity your wife if you think six minutes is forever.'<br/><br/>Myers took this role as he is a huge Queen fan and the sing-a-long to Bohemian Rhapsody used in Wayne's World, led to a resurgence of Queen's hit in the nineties. However, of all the characters in the film, I found this the least convincing. Myers has a tendency towards ham acting and with his penchant for prosthetics, his character seemed out of place in a film with the right blend of seriousness and frivolity. I was relieved when Tom Hollander appeared as Queen's lawyer and eventual manager, Jim Beach, to restore the gravitas of the film.<br/><br/>As Freddie's fame ascends then so too does his recklessness and promiscuity. We see the Court of King Freddie, complete with arch villain and procurer Paul Prenter, and a cast of larger than life characters such as dwarves, transexuals and shady, self-serving characters. Freddie begins to believe his hype too much and his demise is inevitable as he descends into a wilderness of hedonism and endless partying in Munich. The message is simple but clear. In trying to discover who he is, Freddie has ostracised the only people that genuinely cared for him. We see Freddie return to Queen with his tail between his legs, desperate to atone for his sins by performing at Live Aid. In a plot twist that in reality occured much later, Freddie is diagnosed as being HIV Positive. Tragedy leads to revelation and as Freddie forces himself to live with this death sentence then his family learn to accept his homosexuality. We must never forget the impact of AIDS on the gay community. It took so many bright stars too soon from us and it is a legacy that must be taught to each new generation.<br/><br/>The film ends with Queen's spell-binding performance at Live Aid. Rami Malek used a movement coach rather than a choreographer to make his performance more genuine.It is impossible not to believe that he is Freddie Mercury with his suggestive moves and commanding presence. It is this segment of the film that is most emotionally moving, for as an audience we see the deep tragedy of a life cut short far too soon for one of our greatest showmen. My only criticism of this section is that I would have liked there to have been a merging between the film and the original performance to underline the magnitude of Queen. Yet it was impossible not to willingly spend my disbelief in order to believe that I was witnessing Queen at Live Aid. I found myself singing along and moving with the rest of the audience and when it ended, there were huge tears of emotion running down my cheeks and for once it wasn't caused by my hormones.<br/><br/>This really is a must-see move with a stellar cast, excellent direction and a fast-moving script. Brian May, played by Gwilym Lee is so real in his performance, that I wondered if the real Brian May with his love of astrophysics, hadn't somehow managed to invent a time machine to go back in time to play himself. There have been criticisms that the film, with its certificate of 12, anaesthetised the extent of Freddie's lifestyle. Yet I believe that this was handled appropriately. When we think of Freddie Mercury and Queen, it is their music and performance that is most admired. A 12 rating also enables the film to be more accessible to a new generation of Queen fans. 'Who wants to live forever?' Freddie once famously sang. Now because of this film, we get to see the real magic and legacy of Freddie Mercury and Queen. The message of the film in the tagline 'Fearless lives Forever' has never been more apt."
"ngkos","9","1","1","3 November 2018"," A story about Freddie, because it's the only one worth telling
","Let's face it, the only interesting life story out of the 4 members of the band is Freddie's and naturally, it's the only one that is told in pretty much 90% of the movie. The movie does mess up the real life events in terms of chronology, but considering that this is a movie and not a TV series, Freddie's story is too short to be told in 134 minutes.
But it's enough there to make Queen fans like me realize how much we miss Freddie and his voice, although for the latter, Marc Martel's voice does soothe our need to hear Freddie somewhat.
I am not a movie critic or a bot (feel free to check my IMDb profile which says that I've been a user for 19 years), but at the end of the day, there is only one feeling that matters when you step out of the theater and that is, did that movie entertain you? And I have to say, yes.... yes it did."
"saamon15","10","1","1","3 November 2018"," The Show Must Go On
","I saw Bohemian Rhapsody on the 24th October 2018 in the new Light Cinema in Addlestone. It was a Queen, or more accurately, Freddie biopic. Ignore some of the early reviews by the critics, they always had it in for the band, probably because they weren't invited to their famous parties. The casting was perfect: Rami Malek and Gwilym Lee were superb as Freddie and Brian May respectively. The claim that the film did not adequately show Freddie's gay side was nonsense; it was clear that Freddie was gay from the film but he only discovered this himself relatively late in his life, Mary Austin was the love of his life and his will is evidence of this but his sexual attraction was to men. Moreover, the film was about Queen and Freddie's role as its flamboyant frontman. When Freddie was alive, he did not want to be defined as a victim of aids and revealed he had the disease at the end of his life. The scene when he told the band was quite emotional. The film also depicted his Indian / Persian origins and the racism he had to put up with in the earlier part of his life. When he became a star he was roundly accepted as British. Freddie was loved for his sense of humour and this was represented in the film. The final scene was the Live Aid performance which showed Freddie and Queen in all their glory and why they were the best live band on the planet. The film was excellent. Couldn't have been better, in fact."

","When I first saw the trailer I knew I HAD to see Bohemian Rhapsody!
Rami Malek is Perfect, not sure why anyone thought Sacha Baron Cohen should've played Freddie, I'm not sure if Rami was in anything before Mr. Robot (which I enjoyed).<br/><br/>This movie dabbles at showing how Freddie came up with songs, it shows parts about his natural family that some may not have known, and it shows how ""human"" he was.
Obviously this had no input from Freddie but I truly don't think Brian May, Roger Taylor, or Jim Beach (who all had input) would let this project portray Freddie falsely, they cared for him and created the Mercury Phoenix Trust after he passed to help fight against HIV/AIDS.<br/><br/>The soundtrack throughout the movie is of course excellent,the costumes are excellent, the casting is excellent, and the storyline has moments that will make laugh & moments that you'll cry over.
I only gave it a 9 out of 10 as reportedly he was not diagnosed with HIV/AIDS until after Live Aid but Freddie was so private about his life that he may have known before that."

","I read what movie critics have to say about a film I'm interested in, but I usually don't let negative reviews keep me from watching anything. Experience has often proved me right, especially with this one. Honestly, I have zero clue what the negative criticsms were about. This movie was great. I love Queen. Ever since I was a child in the 80s, the loves of my life have been Freddie Mercury and David Bowie. Over the years, I have watched every bit of Queen footage available. I have all the albums. Their music really means something to me. They mean something to me.<br/><br/>So I had some expectations regarding this biopic.<br/><br/>This movie did not disappoint. The story wasn't your typical stylised, romanticised, clean-washed BS. It was honest, it was sober, and it came by the feels honestly. I was genuinely impressed by how no-nonsense the whole thing was set up: the characters, the themes, the plot - especially Freddie's emotional vulnerability.<br/><br/>The actors were magnificent - all of them. Everyone's praising Rami Malek to high heaven, and rightfully so (he's amazing), but can we please take a minute to gush over the Brian May clone? Like, dear Lord, he's identical to the real deal. Pure magic. A beauty.<br/><br/>When the Live Aid segment came around, I was half crying and covered in goosebumps; it was so good. So passionate and emotional and real. Like I said before, the scene was uplifting and beautiful and crazy riveting because it earned those emotions.<br/><br/>These days, I seriously suspect that some critics need to find something bad to say, no matter what. First, there were complains that Freddie was being straight-washed. Turns out that was not true. Now, the film is 'confused' about his sexuality? How? No, it's not. He had a relationship with a woman he loved, but he was predominantly gay. There is nothing confused about that, only if you don't understand sexuality is not a binary.<br/><br/>Besides, the nitpick about historic inaccuracies? Well, this isn't a documentary. It's a movie, so yes, they took liberties. Those liberties can't be all that bad, though, seeing as Brian and Roger produced the flick.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought it was a beautifully made movie with gorgeous visuals, wonderful music and amazing acting. It made me happy, and that's what movies are for. This habit nowadays to nitpick all media to death for mass entertainment is sucking the joy out of everything. If you find something you love, hold onto it, no matter what everyone else says. I'm pretty sure Freddie would approve."

"powersy86","6","9","26","25 October 2018"," Fluffy tribute that played it safe
","I was neither here nor there heading into this one earlier tonight. Not being a massive fan of the band itself, I wasn't fussed on being treated to 2hrs 15mins of all the hits, but desperately hoping for a deep look into Freddie Mercury's world that we might not have seen before, all of his off stage antics & issues that inevitably caused the break up of Queen.<br/><br/>Alas it didnt really turn out that way, this isnt to say that Rami Malek didn't do a great job as the energetic front man, he does. A quite brilliant job in fact. It just seems like they merely glided over the deeper issues at hand & skipped by them as quickly as they could. Zero risks taken, when it probably could have been so much more. With a 12A rating in the UK I probably shouldn't be surprised.<br/><br/>I've since learned that Brian May & Roger Taylor were responsible for Sacha Baron Cohen not getting the Freddie gig as he wanted to go deeper/darker & focus solely on Mercury and less so the band itself. Going in this direction would've grabbed me 10x as much, but that's just personal preference.<br/><br/>As well as Malek's excellent performance, the tracks are all there sounding absolutely superb through the big screen & the visuals for old Wembley at Live Aid were stunning!<br/><br/>Although I do feel said performance was way over cooked in the finale, running 10mins longer than it should have. A good portion of time that couldve been utilised elsewhere.<br/><br/>This was a decent enough movie for Queen fans all over, but still remains the feel good tribute movie that the 3 surviving members will be delighted with. A missed opportunity IMO."

"BlackJack_B","6","5","12","19 November 2018"," Disappointing and often boring film about Freddie Mercury.
","Queen is a guilty pleasure of mine. I'm more of a Beatles/Rolling Stones/Doors/Led Zeppelin type but Queen is one of the most entertaining groups to come down the pike. They employed many genres in their music such as glam, disco, opera, gospel, rockabilly and straight-ahead rock and were led by the often imitated, never duplicated Freddie Mercury. I was very interested in seeing Bohemian Rhapsody and, well, it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>I don't know why the producers chose to create a sanitized film about the life of Freddie. Many of us know that Freddie was a very private man who didn't grant many interviews and disliked the press infringing on his matters. Outside of his music and concerts. we know very little about him. So, they chose to use creative license to make up stuff, rearrange history and distort his life. As expected from a PG-13 film we get uninspiring dialogue, Freddie's homosexuality being trivialized (and made to be seen as harmful) and Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon relegated to being meaningless fringe characters.<br/><br/>Much of the movie, when not re-enacting concerts or recordings, is focused on Freddie's personal and emotional battle between his heterosexual love for Mary Austin and his homosexual love for Paul Prenter, who is ridiculously portrayed as a villain. His relationship with his real-life boyfriend Jim Hutton is barely acknowledged. Utter claptrap that wasn't needed and slows down the film to a crawl.<br/><br/>To be fair, the concert footage (especially Live-Aid) is superb and Rami Malek delivers a masterful performance as Mercury. He deserves a Golden Globe or Academy Award nomination as it's nothing short of brilliant. 5 of my stars go to him.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Queen, yes, you should go to the theater and see this movie just for Malek's unreal performance as Freddie but don't expect much more out of the film. It's a wasted opportunity to learn about one of the greatest showmen in rock music history."

","This film is similar to Green Book. It's actually not a ""terrible"" film in terms of filmmaking- there are some good scenes, especially the music ones, and I do think the acting is worth it. But it's not a particularly good film either, as the script is lacking in any real substance. It tries to chronicle an entire journey but doesn't hit many of its targets with any real meaning. It's shallow and all surface-based, although it's not boring.<br/><br/>But that would have been enough to critique if it wasn't for how problematic and offensive it is. The film really does try to portray anything related with his sexuality in a negative light. In one of its most offensive scenes, during the section where Freddie is acting out, there's a montage of him circling dark corridors for men and sex. The film paints everyone straight as positive and everything related to his sexuality as negative. I don't think it was intentional, but it is telling and it doesn't matter. Rami Malek really does deliver some great work, but it's a miracle he's able to with so much mediocrity and problems around him. Freddie Mercury (and Rami Malek) deserved so much better."
"carvalh_3","3","4","9","7 December 2018"," Lost opportunity!
","The moment I saw the film's title was Bohemian Rhapsody I knew it was going to be shallow. It is not the worst bio pic ever, some good points are, of course, the music and the decent
sensible way they portray Mercury's sexuality and the AIDS problematic. The band characters made a good work at lip syncing the shows, the main actor also does a good job with his performances, despite the fact you can tell he's not singing (when you lip sync you have to actually sing with your mic off, because people can tell if you are just moving your lips without air even coming in and out).<br/><br/>The entire first half of the film about the formation and early success of the band feels off. Mercury was quirky, charming and honest. However the film character was a weirdo who already spoke like a super experienced rock star from the get go, but had no charm or attractiveness, to the point of feeling a bit scary. The rest of the band were portrayed as nothing special. They pointed out repeatedly how misfit and rebel they where, but they just looked like 3 nice small town lads.<br/><br/>The second part was more of a typical children's film where there is a villain who lies and confuses the main character and makes him betray his real friends. He eventually finds out, unmasks the villain on a rainy night, and goes back to his friends for forgiveness. That's alright if they wanna play safe, but at least do it in a way where you can actually convince the audience emotionally and show some depth or uniqueness to the piece. One good thing about this part is that Rami Malek is finally on point with a believable character.<br/><br/>The way they come up with the hit songs is just so laughable. It takes away all the weight of those anthems, and turns them into Ohh let's play with the bass and Ohhh all of a sudden we have a hit riff or Yeahhh let's have some audience participation. The only song where one can feel a transcendent connection with the moment of the character is Who wants to live forever. Beautiful part.<br/><br/>Where is Bowie? Where are the naked waiters in lavish parties full of cocaine? Where is the struggle to succeed? Where is the confusion of fame gone out of control? Where are the geographical adventures? Where are the real disjunctives of life? Come on, it's the 21st century and we are still scared of showing some disturbing human rawness? That's what happens when the bio pic has to be authorised by the remaining band memebers..."
"bauersd","5","3","6","29 December 2019"," Overrated
","This movie is not a very bad movie, but it is also not good.
""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has great acting by Rami Malek and good performances by the other actors, not to forget the wonderful music of English rock band Queen. But this movie has some big issues.
First of all the editing of this film is completely trash. Good editing should be able to create a structure of storytelling and should manage narrative pace. But the structure of the first half of this movie was utterly bad, because the order of the single Scenes is absolutely exchangeable. How this won Best Editing at the Oscars??! Another problem is the weakness of the screenplay. In most of the Scenes the characters are not very well written, because of many very simple phrases. Addtionally there is an avoidance for showing deep into Mercurys sexuality and private life. So it seems, that the screenplay wants to avoid Depth of Content. Also the historical accuracy is not impressive. Some Songs were timed in the wrong year and Freddie Mercury was not Aware of his illness until 1987 (2 years after the Live Aid).
All in all I think, that the most Viewers are impressed of the great perfomance of Malek and the Music of Queen. This movie is entertaining, but it Fails to be accurate and structured. It is a very emotional and moving Picture, but there is no deeper insight into the things that really matter, making it to one of the most overrated movies of the last time.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 / 10"

"lavatch","Null","3","6","18 February 2019"," The Boy From Zanzibar
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a curious film biography, which chronicles the life of Farrokh Bulsara, who was born in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar on September 5, 1946. He was transplanted to Middlesex, England in his teens and joined the rock group Queen in 1970. Farrrokh took the stage name of Freddie Mercury. The film chronicles his turbulent life that culminated in his death in 1991 at age forty-five.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is that Mercury is simply an unlikable character. He treats his proud father with disrespect. He takes advantage of his girl friend Mary, who he calls the love of his life, yet shuns her and make outrageous demands on her. Why, for example, was she never invited to accompany him on tour? And why must she wear her wedding ring even after the couple has split? Additionally, Mercury appears to have utter contempt for his collaborators in the Queen band, three musicians who gave the kid his first break as their lead singer.<br/><br/>In any film biopic, there is the challenge of balancing the story of the artist's life with the music. Oliver Stone made an earnest attempt at a film biography of Jim Morrison in ""The Doors."" But a problem with Stone's film was that too much emphasis was placed on the concerts and recording sessions, and there was not enough depth of understanding of Morrison's life. The exact reverse was true of ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" wherein the focus was on the unpleasant personal life of a deeply troubled singer without commensurate attention given to the music.<br/><br/>Mercury was quite the showman in his concerts, and the appeal was not evident in this motion picture. Instead, the focus was the tawdry elements of his personal life. At one point, Mercury feels betrayed when Mary has found a new boyfriend and has become pregnant. The dialogue goes as follows:<br/><br/>MARY: ""I'm pregnant.""
FREDDIE: ""How could you!?""<br/><br/>The melodrama often resembled a made-for-television film on the Lifetime Channel. Indeed, one of the visual images for Mercury's home life was a large framed poster of Gloria Swanson from ""Sunset Boulevard."" In that regard, Freddie always seemed to be ""on stage"" and primping for his ""close up."" The film was unsuccessful in portraying a tortured artist, only a fragile Little Lord Fauntleroy who never grew up.<br/><br/>There is a revealing moment in the film when Jim Hutton, working in catering at one of Mercury's decadent parties, tells Mercury candidly that he might like to become his friend if and when ""you start to like yourself."" In the closing stretch of this long film, there was lame attempt to reveal a repentant Mercury, attempting to atone for the sins he committed against his friends and colleagues. But it was too little, too late to redeem this sleazy, self-loathing character in the eyes of the audience."
"hannahchadirchi","5","3","6","17 February 2019"," Entertaining as a movie, offensive as an biography
","When I first saw bohemian rapsody I did enjoy it. The second time I saw it I could only enjoy Rami Malek's performance (which was definitely worthy of the praise). The film is an insult to Queen and Freddie's legacy. It takes an interesting and explicit story of an iconic rock and roll band and its larger-than-life frontman and turns it into cookie cutter Hollywood trash. Do Brian May and Roger Taylor realise a film doesn't have to have a grade school structure? Especially not an biographical movie. Probably not, as they were too busy making sure they were portrayed as angels in the movie. Did anyone else notice Freddie and everyone else was responsible for all the 'conflict' (half of which was purely fictional) and the other band member were merely the victims of his promiscuity? Completely insulting. Other than Rami's performance the only good thing about the film is the music, which is thanks to Queen, and no credit should go to the movie for this."

","This is a not a great work of cinema like most reviews on here would have you believe. It is mediocre, at best. There is nothing in the film that is done great except for the lip syncing. Everything else is average to bad. It's a typical overly dramatized biopic with the traditional random moments of serendipity sprinkled throughout to keep the story moving along. The acting is highly overrated. Malik is unconvincing in his role any time that he has to talk in a non-singing voice and the rest of the cast is as boring as the movie is itself. The only redeemable aspect of the film is (what I'm guessing is) archive audio of Freddie Mercury and the way they interpolated it."

The whole movie in fact felt like a Queen song and it wasn't until it was over I realised that it was a movie and that Rami Malek was Playing his part. The last 20 mins are absolutely fantastic and I shed a tear( literally a drop) when Freddie plays Bohemian Rhapsody in the last 20 mins because of the fact that how much Freddie had gone through and hearing Bohemian Rhapsody being played by him made me go full on emotional by the way I am a grown man in my twenties and I was watching this movie with my friends and still I shed a tear. So in short it's a must watch for anyone who has listened to Queen"

I mean, the concert bits of the film were very entertaining, especially the Live Aid concert. That was my favorite part, by far.
I think what makes this movie not bad is Rami's performance. He looks so much like Freddie and acts so much like him it's unbelievable.
Apart from that, everything else is just messy.
They tried to fit in everything they possible could in 2 hours, when they could just leave out some parts and work better with what they had, instead of having all these messy transitions, cut-way-to-early scenes that left us waiting for more.
They didn't even bother to put brown contact lenses on Rami i-<br/><br/>Still enjoyed all of the scenes where cats appeared."

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","6","3","6","14 November 2018"," Distracting for Hardcore Queen Fans, but Not Bad
","Hardcore QUEEN fans might get frustrated, or perhaps just confused, that the movie goes from the first album's ""Keep Yourself Alive"" to ""Killer Queen,"" which is okay so far since QUEEN II was more progressive rock before their stardom... but then during the first tour of America, they're playing ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" from the latter 70's Jazz album, and that's before recording their 1975 epic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" on A Night at the Opera, skipping right past the brilliant followup A Day at the Races...<br/><br/>And then we're at a party hearing ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" from The Game before Brian May comes up with ""We Will Rock You"" from News of the World years earlier, and then back to The Game with ""Another One Bites The Dust,"" ducking under the failure of the funk-themed (and actually underrated) Hot Space album, and then playing the most famous track ""Under Pressure"" well after they supposedly broke up... which NEVER happened... And backing up to the repeated heckling of Roger Taylor's ""I'm In Love With My Car,"" one of their greatest songs, ever...<br/><br/>But that's all nitpicking, to quote Spinal Tap, and BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, as a movie, at least has the honesty to make this biopic mostly of and about lead singer Freddie Mercury, with the band on the side as opposed to Oliver Stone naming the Jim Morrison biopic THE DOORS when that band was treated as a mere afterthought... Like the other members of Queen are kind of treated here, at first following Mercury's genius like they're merely along for the ride and not equally brilliant musicians as he is a singer. And then suffering from their frontman's wild abandon into heavy partying, which happened all the time back then... What they showed of Mercury's nightlife seems no more than a college frat boy, but we're supposed to believe it was an example of over access... And that's in an era where good old fashion access is the starting point...<br/><br/>In real life, Freddie Mercury's most memorable trait, other than his signature ""gay mustache"" and the greatest voice in rock music, was his overbite. And he was simply a guy who had an overbite. But tiny actor Rami Malek's Mercury seems like a DARK CRYSTAL creature where the overbite controls every aspect of his entire being: like a mechanical ""puppet"" built from the springs of how the front teeth maneuver, speaking each word like it's a chore and in a somewhat forced manner...<br/><br/>But where it counts is on stage, and in that he does a good enough job to make RHAPSODY more of a Queen Karaoke celebration than an actual story of a ridiculously talented band who mixed progressive rock with early heavy metal, glam rock, rock and roll, rhythm and blues and wrote some genuinely brilliant songs. Along with being great songwriters, QUEEN were musician's musicians, and what made them legendary was the immense talent in each participant, something impossible to put into a two-hour movie... much less a ten minute short film...<br/><br/>In-between the blaring tunes are awkward silences leading to scenes where Mercury either sticks to his determined, musical guns (taking a risk to combine opera with rock) or as he morphs into a complete primadonna. These breaks from the music, while important since a story needs being told, feels intrusive and can be painfully contrived and melodramatic. Then the last act veers into a Disease-of-the-Week soap opera...<br/><br/>All moving away from and leading up to Queen's concert-stealing performance at LIVE AID 1985, when Mercury and Queen were still an active but not very commercial-friendly band. It wasn't that they miraculously pulled off a fantastic show than the fact that a massive audience got to see how perfect they are live. In the movie, the LIVE AID audience sang along not only to the chorus but the verses of ""Radio Ga Ga"" and ""Hammer Will Fall,"" both from The Works album that'd just come out the previous year... the same year this movie made it seem as if Queen were no longer functioning...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the film's stock villain is Mercury's gay, manipulative manager causing the ""break-up"" that has mostly to do with a solo album Mercury worked on and, in doing so, breaking the hearts of his band-mates. But someone mixed up the David Lee Roth/Van Halen story because, at this time, the members of Queen all had solo albums (Brian May's Star Fleet resides in a personal collection)...<br/><br/>It didn't take Mercury two long years to mix the album because of his drug-fueled lifestyle, or his distance from the band or lack of good musicians. The truth is, he always put Queen first, and barely had time for anything but what they were working on, together...<br/><br/>And last but not least - at least for what's another melodramatic aspect of the movie - Mercury wasn't diagnosed with AIDS until after they semi-faded into the kind of obscurity the band's thrown into earlier-on, just so the Live Aid concert finale could seem like the band's resurrection (when it was really a resurgence)...<br/><br/>And while entertaining enough as a Queen-for-Dummies tale for the masses, BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY has a hard time connecting this brilliant and timeless band with their music - especially when the music isn't playing. And yet, walking out of the theater, there's a fantastic feeling inside, knowing that music in general was once that great, once. The movie deserves some credit for giving ample credit where it's long overdue."
"rachelgallit","9","3","6","9 November 2018"," Bravo, Brava
","The movie did not have to work hard to find its feet and reach a wide audience, given the built-in following for Queen and the actors that accompanied this biography. Following the formation of the band and its rise to glory on an international stage, this film features Freddie Mercury on his Icarus-like climb to the top. The film had one major advantage: a built-in soundtrack. The movie is built around a musical group, and one widely liked, and as such had no end of songs with which to bolster the action. The sweeping operatic songs managed to reach through the screen and reach the audience in much the same way they did when originally released, and gave the film a third dimension that otherwise would have not been possible. The use of the songs both as plot points and as emotional linchpins and indicators was cleverly done and well executed. Overall, a well-done film, though one cannot account for every factual accuracy or acting choice."

"jg_1977","6","3","6","4 November 2018"," ""I can't stand the in-between parts""
","""I can't stand the in-between parts"" (paraphrased quote) is at one point said by Freddie Mercury during this film while talking about the parts of his life between performances, which on a meta-level, was also my biggest problem with the movie. Although Bohemian Rhapsody is a well-acted movie with some amazingly staged performance sequences, the story that fills the remainder of the movie could be told better. Ironically, despite having notable director issues (Bryan Singer leaving the project a few weeks before shooting ended), I thought the directing was far from the biggest issue, and rather that the script was what brought the movie down. Anthony McCarten's screenplay seems to have flipped the age old saying ""show don't tell,"" with much of the character development and important moments being described to the audience rather than shown. Considering that the general story hits quite a few familiar beats to other band/musician biopics, this lack of visual storytelling is a major detriment to the overall film. My other big issue with the story is that this movie seems like an odd mash-up of two movies. One, a dramatic and personal story about Freddie Mercury. The other an entertaining popcorn movie about how Queen came together and became what they are remembered for. In my opinion they should have chosen one of these avenues and explored it fully rather than trying to do both, as neither story arc gets the development it needs, and the final product is oddly disjointed. Despite these script issues, Bohemian Rhapsody does have some spectacular elements. Obviously the big one is Rami Malek's career-changing performance as Freddie Mercury. He not only nails the mannerisms and personality of Mercury, but also does a wonderful job at conveying the tortured soul hidden underneath the legendary performer. All of the praise that Malek has received is absolutely earned, as is his tentative Oscar nomination. Besides Malek at the center, the supporting cast does a great job as well, delivering either a dramatic performance (Gwilym Lee and Lucy Boynton in particular), or providing some needed levity and comic-relief. However, Bohemian Rhapsody isn't just well acted, from a technical-standpoint it also very well made, especially the concert scenes. The sound-mixing and camera work during the Live Aid scene is truly next level, and sets a new bar for showcasing musical performances in film. To sum up, Bohemian Rhapsody has all of the elements to be a great movie but just isn't able to balance the style and substance well enough for my taste. That being said, I think many people will thoroughly enjoy it, and any fan of Queen should see it for Malek's performance alone."
"paul-allaer","6","3","6","3 November 2018"," Rami Malek does a great Freddie Mercury, but...
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018 release; 135 min.) is a bio-pic of the British band Queen, an in particular focuses on the lead singer Freddie Mercury (RIP). As the movie opens, we see Freddie waking up and getting ready to perform on Live Aid. We then go back to ""London, 1970"". Freddie has another argument with his parents, and heads out to catch a show. Ut happens to be Smile, with Brian on guitar and Roger on drums. That very night, Smile's led singer quits, and Freddie, who gives an impromptu audition, manages to convince Brian and Roger to take him in. It's not long before John joins as well, and Freddie renames the band Queen. In a parallel story, Freddie falls for a sweet girl named Mary... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie has been in development for years and years. It ultimately was directed by Bryan Singer, best known for his with with in the X-men franchise. Here he brings 15 years in the band Queen to the big screen. Please note he was fired as director before completion of the film. Whoever made the decision to cast Rami Malek in the role of Freddie Mercury should take a big bow, as Malek is absolutely fantastic, as if Freddie Mercury has come alive again. Of course the music is top-notch. That said, there are a number of issues that bother me. First and foremost, for reasons that care incomprehensible (actually: so as to make the movie as commercially accessible as possible), this is a PG-13 movie, and hence we get a strongly filtered version of the band and of Freddie Mercury. Freddie's battle with AIDS is barerly touched upon, for one. Next, there are a number of unexplained gaffes in the movie: the movie makes it look like Queen hadn't played together in forever before doing LiveAid. That is simply untrue (the band did a long tour of Australia and Japan just months before LiveAid.) Then we see the band perform ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" on their first US tour (in 1974). Except that ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" was a hit single from Queen's 1978 album ""Jazz"", and was never played before 1978. Need I go on? As a life-long Queen fan who saw them in concert in 1978 and 1980 (arguably at the band's peak) in Belgium (where I grew up), ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" leaves me unfulfilled, I'm sorry to say. It should've been the definitive film about Freddie and the rest of Queen, but for me it's not. Thankfully Rami Malek's performance makes up for some of it.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. If you have any interest in the music of Queen and/or the person that was Freddie Mercury, I encourage you to check it out, be it in theaters, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"FFace10","6","3","6","3 November 2018"," Unmemorable Character Study
","Don't get me wrong, this is an okay movie. It has all the bits and pieces that a good movie usually has; good acting, a great soundtrack and interesting cinematography - but to me as a film goer and Queen fan, it was in the end, kind of dull and generally uninteresting.
Rami Malek playing the main character of Freddie undoubtedly does a good job of it but I personally feel as if this very complex character ends up being 2-dimensional at most; the screenwriters may be more to blame here for this: there was struggle but no unpredictable or even remotely interesting obstacle. The emotions expressed fall flat in the context of the story, and since the story is so well known from the get-go, I feel as if there could've been a deeper dive into the mind of the character we are made to watch grow on-screen.
The movie itself seems to pride itself on playing Queen songs and joking about the band being too experimental, and maybe the filmmakers should be doing exactly that, but it just ends up feeling cheap and pandering.<br/><br/>It has me split; I want to like it but however much I try I keep thinking of ways it could've been done better."

It just feels like business as usual, no challenge is appearing as one. and every time the very clunky dialogue comes to a halt, its either a montage or a cut-away to music.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel like a real biopic, with no band-members listed as producers would just have had more edge, would have explored the person Freddie Mercury was, and what he became, and in the process found a place for itself.<br/><br/>This movie just does not have that, the actors do their best, but the script and story just isn't there, every conflict is solved quickly or off screen, and then its business as usual.<br/><br/>It just feels like the musical back-catalogue of Queen becomes a crutch for pushing the movie forward, the non-Freddie bandmembers just appear flat."

I don't want to hear Bohemian Rhapsody, twice. I've got it on iTunes. I don't want to watch the Live Aid performance, it's there on YouTube. I wanted to find out what Freddie was really like, what made him tick, and I didn't get it. I got a fairly one dimensional perspective of a rock star with his life chronologically altered to suit the movie. Queen never split up. FM's aids diagnosis came nearly 2 years after Live Aid. When you've got a subject as talented and captivating as Freddie Mercury, there's no need to change the truth."

"magda-07525","6","5","13","27 October 2018"," Playing too safe...
","I absolutely loved some bits in this story but also was quite confused watching it.
First of all, Freddie was an incredible shy person offstage, with this irritatingly sweet habit of covering his mouth when laughing, he was clearly very self consciousg. I did not see the actor doing it, instead I saw a guy coming across really confident.
Another thing is that Freddie was extremely promiscuous, not sure why the film is erring on the side of caution with this... It was a part of who he was.
Both Freddie and Marry were heart broken when he decided to come clean with his sexuality. The film gives the impression like he was actually pining over her for ages, when the fact is that they maintained a successful friendship and he had his heart broken by multiple guys , so he was not romantically involved with her like forever. In fact, it was a huge emotional blow for Marry, and she didn't just move out and move on, it took her ages to become seriously involved with another guy.
The parties Freddie threw were nothing like they showed , they were unbelievably wild and excessive... the ones in this film just don't do justice to the real things.
Freddie did not meet Jim in his house. Another thing is that Freddie was not necessarily very loyal to Jim and didn't treat him very well , and poor Jim took loads of blows until Freddie finally settled down with him.
Finally, I'm not sure if Freddie actually introduced Jim to his father and if his father actually patted him on the back suddenly forgetting where they were coming from.
Dialogues are also a weak point of the film.
I love Freddie and I feel like he deserves a real , brave bohemian story of his life."

Even his body features simply do not resemble the real deal, and I was bothered throught the entire film with Rami's very distictive eyes and small body that was utterly different from Mercury. The script itself was not too bad, but alas, was superficial and often seemed like some pop propaganda packed with no.1 hits and singles from Queen, instead of allowing the viewer to really immerse with the story of Mercury as a person. I would say that most viewers will enjoy this as a musical drama film with the occasional comic relief, but fans of the band and perhaps people with higher expectations shall be quite dissapointed. A film about a remarkably interesting and great artist, managed to be so shallow, that is a talenet in itself."

","Saw this last night with a dozen folks at the premier here locally. It was really two movies with the first half being about the music and Freddie coming up and getting married and being happy and then he chose what the CDC calls ""a dangerous lifestyle"" that eventually killed him. Watching him make those terrible choices and throw away a brilliant life is painful and gross. I see that Bryan Singer directed, how appropriate. The movie is about a very talented singer who led one of the greatest rock bands in history. Sadly, his very dangerous life choices killed him and probably some of those he came into contact with. The truth of Freddie Mercury changes the meaning of Bohemian Rhapsody. Another great talent gone way too soon. The music lives on."

"ImElena","5","6","18","9 November 2018"," This film was too PG and Straight washing, Freddie was a Rock Star, it should have been a Sex Drugs n Rock'n'roll film!
","Finally watched it.. a bit dissapointed
This film was too PG and Straight washing, Freddie was a Rock Star, it should have been a Sex Drugs n Rock'n'roll film!
It's not a bad film per say but very weak in my opinion.
Visually the film was well made, loved the costumes. Some scenes very fun and well filmed.
What dissapointed me is that it seemed to lack depth and instead of focusing on Freddie's world and persona it was just compliation of cheesy scenes and basically Queen karaoke scenes by Rami Malek.
I think it should have been focused more deeply on Freddies struggles in life, sexuality, family, musical struggles and his famous crazy parties! Nothing was really shown and touched upon, barely scratched the surface.
Also Freddie was quite a controversial person and a rebel, but this film seems to be the kinda film that tries to fit in to public norms.
The film portrayed music business to be easy n jolly, as if the band didn't have any struggles at all- Hey look at me I want to sing, boom I'm a star! Of course Freddie and the band were talanted, but it ain't that easy to get big in the music industry, even if you are super talented and in reality their success didn't happen over night!
Rami Malek...well he did better than I thought, but still I don't think that was a good choice.He's a good actor, but I just didn't find him believable as Freddie. I would have preferred Sacha Baron Cohen, but he was smart enough to leave this film, after he found out film is not gonna be focused in depth on Freddie.
Overall the film to me seemed a fluffer family film for the mainstream audience that are happy to hear some jolly Queen songs and bathe in nostalgia. Feels like an easy money kind of film. To me it didn't feel like a big screen film, more something that could be shown on TV.
Igive it 5/10, mainly for the visuals, but overall dissapointed."

","""Radio Gaga"", the lead single and track from Queen's 1984 album ""The Works"" peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100. Although ""Body Language""(#11) and ""Under Pressure""(#29) both charted, the album ""Hot Space"" was not critically well-received. ""I Want to Break Free"", the follow-up single to ""Radio Ga Ga"", despite being mid-tempo ear candy to the rest of the world, the exceedingly radio-friendly song, written by bassist John Deacon, stalled at #45, the last time Queen, fronted by the late Freddie Mercury, ever came close to further cultivating their status as American radio mainstays and stateside hitmakers. The music video which accompanied ""I Want to Break Free"" made them non-grata to disc jockeys and more importantly, MTV, alike. The music industry preferred the lead singer's personal politics to remain latent. Ironically, it was drummer Roger Taylor's idea that the whole band go drag for the fateful video shoot, a parody of ""Coronation Street"", a BBC soap opera, but MTV gave ""I Want to Break Free"" little support, effectively turning this highly-successful London band into dinosaurs, a nostalgia act that could coast all the way to the bank, getting by with playing all their old hits from yesteryear. But on the other side of the Atlantic, Queen's popularity never wavered. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", directed by Bryan Singer, ends prematurely with their legendary Live Aid performance at Wembley, as if Freddy Mercury(Raim Malek), diagnosed with the HIV virus, died shortly after the world was fed in 1985. The show, however, went on for another six years. Longtime Queen fans will be distracted by the filmmaker's decision to play fast and loose with the timeline, like a Brian May guitar solo. Dramatizing the relative malaise of late-period Queen(""A Kind of Magic"" and ""The Miracle"") would have been difficult, but surely, time compression could have made allowances for their final recording sessions that resulted in the formation of ""Innuendo"", the band's swan song. Rock me, Farrokh Bulsara still had six more years of being a ""virtuoso"" and ""rock idol"" left in the tank. Why stop him now?<br/><br/>On a daily basis, Tom Hulce practiced the piano upwards to five or six hours, prep work that he diligently maintained in preparation for his career-making role as 18th century Viennese superstar Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Milos Forman's 1984 adaptation of the Paul Shaffer play ""Amadeus"". That's really him playing ""Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor"" upside down on his back. More than once, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" alludes to the 1985 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, by positioning Freddie Mercury as man of prodigious talent with a god-given ability for musical transcendence. ""Somebody to Love"" from ""A Day in the Races""(1976), anyone? And very close behind: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", a six-plus-minute quasi-opera which would become the centerpiece of Queen's fourth album ""A Night at the Opera"", makes an aural cameo when pre-fame Freddie, sharing a modest flat with Mary Austin(Lucy Boynton), his girlfriend, plays the opening notes in their bed, just like Mozart, upside down at a costume party, a flamboyant party, the same bacchanal ones that Mercury would someday throw in his mansion. It's possible, sure, that Mercury started work, as a germ of an idea, on the film's namesake prior to being signed, but since the filmmaker uses his artistic license to manipulate chronological time for maximum dramatic effect, we have our doubts. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has a musical maturity that is leaps and bounds ahead of ""Keep Yourself Alive"" and ""Doing All Right""(both from their s/t debut), songs that predate Queen and the addition of bassist John Deacon(Joseph Mazzello), when May and Roger Taylor(Ben Hardy) were still playing dive pubs as Smile. Sounding not unlike William Miller(Patrick Fugit), just before he crosses over from fan to player, in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"", Freddie, a groupie, more or less, ingratiates himself to Brian and Roger, when after a gig, he approaches them in the parking lot, flattering his future bandmates by knowing their names and something about Smile. He replaces Tim Staffel(Jack Roth), who just quit. This part of the story checks out. What doesn't check out is that they'd play ""Fat Bottomed Girls""(which wouldn't appear until 1978's ""Jazz"") on their first American tour, and suggesting that the disco-fueled ""Another One Bites the Dust"" appeared on ""Hot Space""(1982) instead of ""The Game""(1980), their best-selling album. Most egregious of all is the complete fabrication of Queen walking out on EMI, based on the flimsy and ludicrous premise that Ray Foster(Michael Myers), the label's head honcho, wanted to release ""You're My Best Friend"" instead of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as the lead single. Mercury, the genius, treats the fictional executive like a mediocrity: Antonio Salieri to his Mozart.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" got it wrong, too. Antonio Salieri(F. Murray Abraham), the court composer for Emperor Joseph II(Jeffrey Jones) was far from the patron saint of mediocrity that Milos Forman makes him out to be. The penultimate sequence in ""Amadeus"" is bogus. Salieri transcribes Mozart's ""Requiem"" as the great composer notably grows increasingly sick from overwork, burning the midnight oil until his fire goes out at first dawn's early rise. That's not the truth. As Penny Lane(Kate Hudson) would say: ""Isn't it funny? The truth just sounds different."" Mozart and Salieri weren't friends, but they certainly weren't rivals either. The truth about Freddie Mercury was that he lived with AIDS for two years prior to finishing work on ""Innuendo"" in November '90. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" misses out on the inherent drama and pathos of Mercury singing, possibly for the last time, ""The Show Must Go On"", the band's seventh and last single from their fourteenth and final album.<br/><br/>The show did go on after Live Aid, but for whatever reason, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ends with a false happy ending, a real bum note."

"robfwalter","5","3","7","4 February 2019"," No plot, no tension and too long, but oh, that final concert!
","Bohemian Rhapsody is the unthrilling account of one man's quest to sequentially join a band, become famous, write Bohemian Rhapsody, record Bohemian Rhapsody, release Bohemian Rhapsody as a single, come out of the closet and reunite with his band in time to play Live Aid before he dies of AIDS. Don't worry, I haven't given any spoilers, as the only one of these things you might not be 100% sure is going to happen if you're a casual Queen fan is the Live Aid thing, and the movie shows this happening in its first scene. As a consequence, there is no tension whatsoever in this film. Particularly difficult problems might occasionally require two scenes to overcome, but the vast majority are sorted out within the same scene they arose.<br/><br/>Sample dialogue:
Mercury: ""We're going to write a rhapsody about Bohemians.""
Record executive: ""That can't possibly be done.""
Mercury: ""We've already written it.""
Record executive: ""Well there's no way you can record it.""
Interior, recording studio.
""It's a Bo...hemian rhapsody.""<br/><br/>Fortunately, the narrative (!) part of the movie finishes with 20 minutes to go, and the finale is simply a recreation of the 1985 Live Aid set. The music is so compelling and the visuals so beautifully shot that it's almost enough to make the viewer forget the nonsense that has preceded it. But then, I'd been in my seat for over two hours by the time the Live Aid sequence started and it was very hard to understand why some of the ""Should we update our sound and write Another One Bites the Dust?"" ""Yes, let's do that,"" conversations couldn't simply have been deleted.<br/><br/>Maybe I just don't understand biopics, but to me, this movie is a mess, and not one worth persisting with (Queen's Live Aid set is available on Youtube)."

","I don't understand the hype around this movie. I was hoping that film would be made similarly to Straight Out of Compton...where you are taking through the background and progression of the group but that is not the case. The movie doesn't talk about any of Freddie's childhood, where he learned to play instruments/sing, what got him interested in music, what shaped him to be the person he is.<br/><br/>NOPE! Instead we are dropped into the night that he meets the band it just goes from there. The director spent so much time talking about his sex life that they almost forgot that he was in a band. There is no progression of how the songs were made or anything. Instead, they briefly introduce the name song and boom, its already written and perfectly performed. The best part of the film was the final scene where they perform at concert, that was pretty epic (and the only reason that I am giving this any stars).<br/><br/>Overall: Worth a watch if you have absolutely nothing else to see or do.<br/><br/>P.S.

","For a man of the intensity of Freddie Mercury, this movie seemed too mellow in its delivery.<br/><br/>The music alone is worth the entry price and the performance by Malek is the best he could have done in this situation. The movie is entertaining and will cause you goosebumps here and there specially during the performances. But the handling of the story and the characters and their relationships seems lacking in its authenticity and ends up feeling like a disjointed collage of happenings during the band's history and Mercury's personal issues. There's not an in-depth and gritty exploration of the evolution and the roller-coaster intensity of a passionate soul as that of Mercury and even less of the other band members, there are only hints of it. There's a lack of cohesiveness both in storytelling as well as in emotional grip which ultimately subtracts from the epic dimension that the story of such a mythic band deserved.<br/><br/>Overall I feel a bit disappointed about the end result but the movie is no doubt entertaining from start to finish and will delight you with the music score, it is Queen afterall."

","Born in 77, I did not discover Queen until the end of the 80s. But his songs have long reasoned in me like a little cry of freedom in some difficult moments... until today when I rediscovered in a context more precise the life of their author and the universe in which they were created. This film is interesting to understand the sweet madness of the 80s. And it is beautifully played among others by Malek. Pushed to the pinnacle of his art he has now before him a magnificent career as an actor on the international scene. What a talent ! He is incredibly fair in Mr. Robot but poignant in this compositional role of Freddie Mercury. It is also an opportunity to rediscover the hidden meaning of the lyrics, to live again coming out during the 80s, the beginning of the disease, the relative artistic madness of this era ... The success in France is real, the film was released today in theaters in Paris, a room of 550 people applauded at the end ...

I fell in love with Queen's music very quickly growing up, from their big hits to even various other songs which they never released as singles.<br/><br/>I always knew the basic back story of the band from what my Dad told me, plus various documentaries but I bever truly realised the struggles the band faced as well as how lonely Freddie was at various stages of his life. The acting is brilliant, with the band members perfectly cast, sometimes you forget these are just the actors and not the real people. Rami Malek as Freddie is mesmerising with Freddie's accent and movement so perfectly recreated. Gwilym Lee bears a frightening resemblence to Brian May in both look and his voice.<br/><br/>There are emotional moments which brought tears to my eyes but it is a great journey with comedy and Freddie being Freddie which made me laugh. My only disappointment is that it ends with Live Aid in 1985, there were still so many moments that occured after then that led to Freddie's death which I feel could have been covered but it's a fantastic film and I applaud all involved."

"manuel_medeiros","8","3","7","29 October 2018"," Amazing cinematographic experience with brilliant performances
","Disclaimer: I am huge fan of Queen and was fortunate enough to see this film in 4D.<br/><br/>To those wary about whether or not to see a movie about Queen - this is not a documentary or even a docu-drama. This is a movie about one of the most iconic bands of all time, which had probably the most chatismatic lead singer of all time. In itself, this is enough ingridients to make a good movie.<br/><br/>This film however goes beyond that in my perspective for two reasons.<br/><br/>Firstly the experience it provides. The portrayal of the concerts (especially the last one shown) truly succeed in making you feel like you are watching the concert live, and you just happen to be in the most coveted place to watch it from of all - the stage.<br/><br/>This is achieved due to very good filmaking and edits and I think it is safe to say that it is hard to pull off an experience closer to what it must have been to be there live at the time.<br/><br/>Second reason I think this movie goes a notch above what simply a good script would do for you is because of its brilliant casting and acting. Rami Malek is stellar in a very difficult role and he is able to express all the intricancies and challenges of being a bisexual global music star. But equally the roles of the remaining members of the band and long time band manager are very well portrayed.<br/><br/>Of course, I mentioned beforehand this movie was amazing for movie specially because of how much I like the band but also because I was able to view it in 4D which really adds to the experience as it makes you feel as a close-up fan or even member of Queen's entourage.<br/><br/>Really worth viewing, specially in the Cinema if you can."

"CubsandCulture","3","4","11","18 January 2019"," Utterly baffling that this is on the award circuit
","This film is a slog throughout most of its run time and the film feels like it was edited in a blender. As a story it just doesn't hang together very well and the film is not even sure what type of story it is trying to tell. Is it a rags to riches story that leads to self-destructive behavior? Is it the story of a band forming and having a falling out? Is it a the story of a bisexual man pulled in opposite directions by his heart and society? Is the story an artist kicking against convention especially his family's disapproval? The film tries to tell all those sorts of stories and it short changes all of them by doing so. Perhaps the film is trying to be like the song Bohemian Rhapsody in the mixing and matching of genres and plots. But it becomes a muddled mess that is real bore to sit through.<br/><br/>Worst the film is very much in love with Freddie Mercury the performer; the man not so much. The treatment of his bisexuality is shameful. The Paul-Freddie relationship and the subsequent AIDS material has all the hallmarks of a gay/AIDS panic film of the 80's. Add in that Paul is cast as usurper and seducer (as well as the extremely underdeveloped relationship with Jim) and the film treats bisexuality as a medical condition and moral failing. Freddie Mercury did not have queerness forced upon him. It is shameful the film does this.<br/><br/>It is also shameful that the film add ad hoc meaning to a lot of the songs. ""Another One Bites the Dust"" is not a song about men dying from AIDS. The film really forces the greatest hits into contexts they don't belong. The recreation of the songs is pretty good, and of course given they are using remastered tracks they sound great. But their narrative meaning is rendered weirdly. It just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Likewise, Rami Malek, while he give a pretty good performance, isn't quite right. He is ever so slightly not Mercury in his being and much of the film feels like a skillful impression as a result. Add in the use of the actual Mercury vocals and the very poor writing and the central character falls into something like the uncanny valley. I don't believe that voice is coming out of the guy in the movie because it isn't.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the musical sequences are polished and they are dazzling recreations of the shows. When the band is playing the film is quite good. I can only speculate that this feature is why the film has been embraced by so many. It doesn't hurt that the best sequence-Live Aid-occurs last and leaves a warm impression leaving the theater. But looking back you realize how much crap you had to sit through to get there."

","The movie about the band queen. Or should I say a queen concert with commercials in between. Following the crazy life of Freddie Mercury they should it in a way that was stereotypical and the norm. Not quite committing to the documentary or the theatrical side. They improvised and had to fill in gaps that just left the movie bland. Choosing strange areas to focus on and weird aspects to highlight.
In 2018, they highlighted the 2018 things. These days its all about the same-sex relationships and long emotional scenes. But not all movies have to have those to be good. Or the people to make them successful. Rami Malek being the 5th choice to play Mercury did a good job but didn't kill it. You still never believed that it was him or who he really was. He acted in a weird middle-ground. The music is the driving force in the movie. If the band wasn't as famous as Queen was, this movie falls flat on its face. However, because it was queen and queen music we all reminisced and enjoy the tunes. Everything else just got in the way.
So in the end queen helped to sell more concert tickets for their forever continuing tours, but the movie won't lend to award success."

"harrylosborne","6","2","4","8 April 2019"," Excellent music masking an average biopic
","Below the surface, Bohemian Rhapsody is not much more than an average amount of insight into Freddie Mercury's storied life, stretching from his start in music to the heights of stardom. A cursory search on the internet would glean as much information on Queen's history, which suggests that the band takes somewhat of a back seat to the main character (who I must admit is played very capably by Rami Malek); the real Brian May even expressed his disappointment in the fact that the storyline becomes marginalised by the music. Moreover, the story almost becomes too confused with Mercury's personal life - to me, this feels like a device to give the film some sort of dilemma, where ultimately none existed.<br/><br/>Regardless of this, Queen's starpower and Malek's performance saves this film: thumping anthems, big set pieces, and accurate musical performances make the big budget scenes really pop, particularly when reimagining Live Aid. Mercury allows the scenes to envelope you, focussing solely on the music and forgetting the interludes of storyline that almost feel required to allow the next song to be played.<br/><br/>I believe it says something when most of the other reviews of Bohemian Rhapsody focus mostly on the music - a core element to a quality film must be missing, explaining the divide between critics and casual viewers. A sense of nostalgia may even be possible with someone who grew up with Queen, but this isn't enough to elevate the entire experience to being truly special."
"typhoidbeaver","3","2","4","23 March 2019"," Hard to watch.
","Went in with an open mind and without having read any reviews. I like Malek as an actor - but his interpretation of Freddie was SO off, it was hard to watch. First off - the teeth. Whoever is responsible for ""fitting"" those should NEVER work in the industry again. They were either poorly made or misapplied - either way, it was huge distraction and made this nearly unwatchable. Malek was so clearly uncomfortable with the teeth, it seemed like he had a dry mouth problem and he was struggling to keep them in. The way he played Freddie - I imagine the actor watched some YouTube clips of old interviews and used those to develop his character. Except Freddie wasn't really his natural self in an interview situation ... he could be a bit stiff at times, sometimes shy and a bit awkward. Rami is monotone and robotic in his delivery, he lacks the vitality and hearth of Freddie's deeply intricate soul. Truly a vain and glossed-over portrayal of a complicated individual ... this film is a true tragedy and bad at every angle."

I have seen Freddie Mercury and his performances described as dionysian, and that is exactly how the movie affected me: It touched my emotions and my instincts.<br/><br/>As a teenager I was never deeply into Queen. Now, as an adult, the movie touched me deeply. The way Malek's voice was blended into Mercury's voice was brilliantly done, considering the challenge of presenting the voice of the finest singer in popular music.<br/><br/>If I could, I would give Malek three Oscars for this performance.<br/><br/>What puzzles me, are the critics reviews. This film touched me, moved me and I adored the music and loved the fine acting.<br/><br/>I suppose what we see in a movie somewhat reflects what we carry inside us, what we bring to the movie. Whether the resulting professional review is of any use to me remains a mystery.<br/><br/>Bottom line: In 9 out of 10 cases I have a diametrically opposed view of the movie than the critics.

"LogicIsEverything","Null","2","4","3 March 2019"," This is not ""Elvis has left the building"" movie; IMITATION IS NOT ACTING.
","The Oscar Best Actor Award was given to this guy, but in my humble opinion, he's actually no better than the other actors who got nominated. This whole movie if you didn't watch the real deal of Freddie on some video documentaries, maybe he's okay, but since my wife and I both had viewed those great videos showing how the real Freddie performed with his band, the Freddie in this movie simply didn't sell me at all. If you tried to tell a story about a real person, you've got at least to try your best to transform yourself into that person, not just outlook but his inner most soul. I've watched ""Vice"" and saw how Bale was completely transformed into that real person inside out, and believe me, you've got to convince me at least 90% that YOU were HIM, not just copycatting or compete in an imitation show, but just put in with a false overbite front teeth, a beard under your nose, or a long hair, a white sleeveless vest. No, performing someone who indeed existed in history, by imitation with some makeup materials was not enough, you've got to transformed yourself into that person as Freddie, giving off somewhat inexplainable CHARISMA that the real Freddie really carried on the stage and off stage life. This guy who played Freddie, not like Bale who played the VP, I didn't find any believable charisma from him. He didn't even try to put some weight to make him more alike, just his still skinny physic. So before our eyes, it just ended up like one of the Elvis look-likes.<br/><br/>What this bio story telling about Freddie in this movie also seemed to be too tidbits and not so interesting to watch. The whole movie was just a lackluster imitation of the great and so talented Freddie, by signed up three other look-alike to assemble the Queen Band was another copycatting imitation, borrowing some concert footages in the background and making these guys imitated almost every movement of that band was a very basic and primitive technique trick, the only difference between a painted scene and those footages was the latter were motion pictures. There's no big enough impact or strong enough punch in this movie, so there's not enough empathy and regret for Freddie throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>That's exactly what my wife said to me afterwards: ""It's just a mediocre feeling-less imitation movie. I'd rather watch those real Freddie concert videos time after time, again and again, not only never feel tired of his performances but will always feel blasted with energy from him. This film is like what we saw when the patient just died, a never-ending green flat line from left to right on the life monitor."""

","As a rabid fan of Queen's first three albums, I was disappointed. This film glossed over that stuff in the blink of an eye. Sure, they showed the band playing ""Keep Yourself Alive"" (from Queen I) but then sort of intimated that the album for which they sold their van and sacrificed so much to be able to record was Sheer Heart Attack. It's like Queen I and Queen II never happened. And those are my favorite Queen albums. Then they acted like Bohemian Rhapsody was the first longer-than-3-minutes track that was operatic and groundbreaking. Sorry, but Queen I & II fans already know this was done and done with tracks like ""Liar"", ""Great King Rat"", ""Father to Son"" and ""March of the Black Queen"". Bo-Rap was a rehash, pushing the envelope past artistic and bordering on kitschy. This film seems to cater to US audiences who didn't know Queen existed until Night at the Opera (which is when I stopped buying their records). And it's way too focused on Freddy when the other guys are super talented. Brian May now deserves his own movie, IMO. Sorry but 6/10 is the best I can muster."

I've seen Live Aid, and it was perfect; the little manners, the big gestures, everything was spot on.<br/><br/>And I think it was too tame; Freddie's life was not so cookie cutter, so show it.

","Freddie Mercury is such a character! As a singer he's definetely one of the top 10, as a composer he's shown to be unique and revolutionary as no-one else before, and he had such an exotic and interesting life, what a pity that it wasn't that well translated to the screen. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is far from being the best motion picture of the year, it isn't even a good film, the editing was the worst part overall, songs that diserved full treatment (such as ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") were cutted while other songs were fully displayed (and the time didn't lacked, there is simply no explaination for this choice), also the screenplay was very poor, I can't remember any quote or time I felt dragged into the play, in fact I remember times were I thought the dialog was very empty and even irritating. The film takes 30 minutes just to play music, 20 of them to recreate the ""Live Aid"" concert -which I strongly recommend you to see instead of the film montage-, and that is the biggest reason people overrate this movie, because of the sensation of being in a concert, but if that is your objective go buy a real concert of Queen (i like the 1986, live in Rio performance), but that shouldn't be the objective of a biographic play. The film tries to treat so much topics (his relationship with his dad, his friendship with Mary, Queen's stability, his sexuality) but none of them actually utilized any simbolism or metaphores, everything was explicit and felt both bland and clichÃ©, which is awfull to say while watching a (pseudo) biography of Freddie! If there is something to highlight was Rami Malek's interpretation, the excentricism and glamour of Mercury was quite well captured, the personage felt as the real man, also Gwilym Lee looks just like Brian May! But good interpretations can't save a mediocre storyline, narration, lack of deepness and melodramatic exageration. If you like musicals look at ""Cold War"", this is a far better one."

","I am a daring person and I confess what very few people seem to have the courage to confess nowadays. I never was a great fan of 'Queen' or Freddie Mercury. It may be my dislike for the disco genre and the suspicion that this rock band with incontestable talent and which has reached immense planetary success, slid too much towards this direction. It may be the fact that by the time when 'Queen' were rising and had reached the peak of their glory I was behind the Iron Curtain with all what that meant from a point of view of censorship. Anyway, it's a fact, but at least this gave me the advantage of seeing and judging 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without the prejudice or extra-enthusiasm that many of the fans seem to have in the opinions they expressed about the movie.<br/><br/>Not being too updated about the biography of Mercury and the history of the group, most of the information brought to screen by the film was new to me. As I understand there are some inaccuracies but the spirit of the band was kept true by the two veteran members of 'Queen' who are still active and who read the script and surveyed the filming. They seem to have had such an influence on the film that director Bryan Singer did not complete his work, although he is still the only one credited, and the differences of opinion with them led to Sacha Baron Cohen giving up acting in the lead role. We are left with a story of the raise, the troubles and the tragic end of a star who aimed to pierce the skies with his music, but the same ambition as well and his incapacity to control his personal life daemons led to his burning out fast after reaching the peak. The film deals mainly with the period of his ascend and culminates with what is considered today to have been the best concert Freddie Mercury and 'Queen' ever gave and one of the best in the history of pop music - their section in the Live AID concert on Wembley, on July 13, 1985.<br/><br/>What I liked: The rendition of the atmosphere and sound of the music clubs and recording studios of the 70s is very credible, close to a documentary, and I mean the positive interpretation of the term. The stories about how some of the most famous songs of the band came to life are very interesting, and I do not care too much if they are not 100% a accurate. The recreation of the band concert at the AID Life mega-show on Wembley is a masterpiece. All details are being brought to screen at perfection and the atmosphere is as electric as it was on the stadium. I have seen again the original footage on youTube, and the twenty-something minutes in the film seemed to be another version of the same event, filmed with different cameras. The soundtrack is also excellent.<br/><br/>What I liked less: I feel that Rami Malek is a miscast. He is doing great efforts to replicate the moves, the grimaces, the moods of the real Freddy Mercury but he lacks the charisma and the stage presence of the artist. The teeth prosthesis is ridiculous. All this is mixed into the melodramatic construction of the script and the effect is at some moment closer to parody than to real emotion.<br/><br/>Frankly, I believe that the producers missed a great opportunity by not succeeding to bring Sacha Baron Cohen in the cast. It would certainly have been a different film, as Cohen is known for insisting on his personal ideas in executing his roles. I am not sure that my opinion about 'Queen' and Freddy Mercury would have changed, maybe the film would have been less reverential to the factual history of the band, but certainly it could have been a more interesting movie."
"cinemawithcj","6","2","4","1 December 2018"," Bohemian Rhapsody - Cinema with CJ Review
","Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) has a sequence where the titular song is released to their original, critical reviews. Queen's song was later seen as a masterpiece, but in its initial release was only deemed ""Perfectly adequate"" by some. The latter, and probably not the former, describes the film of the same name.
Bryan Singer (or Dexter Fletcher) has created a perfectly adequate musical biopic here that doesn't do much revolutionary, but at least doesn't rob you of any time.
That is carried very much so by Rami Malek and co-stars disappearing into their roles as Freddie Mercury et al as Queen. Malek truly steals the show as the band's frontman, bringing the energy and life and mannerisms of the iconic Mercury. If there's one solid good to take from this film, it's that Malek's performance is a perfect capture.
Bohemian Rhapsody is bolstered by the fact that Queen (I would say objectively, but let's say in my opinion) have so many brilliant songs and of course that means this film gets to flaunt them all. Each song is a performance of all elements coming together and you get Queen's greatest hits translated onto the big screen. If you're gonna watch this movie at the cinema please at least splash out on the IMAX for the big screen, big sound experience.
If Bohemian Rhapsody was just a concert movie starring Queen or even just these facsimiles of Queen, it would be perfect, but the execution of this narrative biopic brings the film down a notch or two. There's always a curious case of poetic license with biopics, First Man recently has a bit of this, but Bohemian Rhapsody creates many an eyebrow raise.<br/><br/>I am by no means a Queen aficionado but I'm sure I'm not the only one doubting just how fortuitous and neat the story of Queen and Freddie Mercury is. The film saunters for the majority of it with next to no conflict and brushing past themes and issues and moments that could have done with more fleshing out. Events go by and you wonder just a little too much on whether they actually happened. Usually you don't need to bust out the fact checking like a Neil deGrasse Tyson of film, but this is a biopic with such glaring leaps of logic and license you can't switch that off.
There's just something off about cartoonishly evil characters or how people just stumble upon the music they're iconic for. The creation of the titular song felt like it was a through-line of the story until it suddenly wasn't, and that thread was full of ""this is a bit too on the nose"".
Bohemian Rhapsody has as much subtlety as Mercury's character. Very fun, well performed, nostalgic, and goddamn, that last sequence would be an all-timer if it wasn't just a shot for shot recreation with iffy special effects enhancement.
Inconsistent style over substance, it brushes past and messily tackles themes such as Mercury's sexuality and later years all for another hit Queen track.
It feels like one for fact-checking, but it also feels like Bohemian Rhapsody will forever remain Perfectly Adequate. And that's only down to the music of one great band, and one great group of actors translating that to screen."

","When you have someone as unique and talented as Freddy Mercury, an actor as interesting and capable as Rami Malek, songs as powerful as Queen songs, you have a movie right there that is impossible to screw up. But does it achieve more than just not screw up? I am not sure. There's a strong beginning. (A fitting line from the film.) There are many powerful and pognient moments. But something's amiss. At times it felt like it was out of breath. Supporting characters seemed universally flat. With a few exceptions everyone so easily agreed to everything, no matter how outrageous. That felt fake. It's a pretty good film. But it could have been better."

The only reason I did not give 10/10 is because it doesn't not fully stay true to the actual timeline in real life. HOWEVER, this movie expertly developments the characters and not only lets you in on, but engulfes you in their thoughts and surrounds you in their life. The plot is developed extremely well! But one of my favorite parts was the ending. I have NEVER felt like I was actually at a live concert event like I did with this movie! Totally felt like I was back in time. The color, sound, and energy was surreally realistic!
I highly recommend this film!!"
"djmccoul","7","2","4","18 November 2018"," Excellent casting and convincing reenactments of a legendary performer
","Rami Malek makes an excellent Freddie in appearance, build, mannerisms, and speech. From the previews alone, I felt like the only thing lacking was that Rami's face wasn't a close enough resemblance to Freddie's, but after seeing the movie, for a few particular scenes (about one-third of the time), I had to look twice since I almost thought I was looking at Freddie Mercury himself. That said, there were other times where it wasn't as convincing (perhaps two-thirds of the time). I think that mainly Freddie had a slightly larger face/jaw, and his eyes weren't as sunken as Rami's. But face out of view, Rami's back shots at the Live Aid concert reenactment were very convincing and could easily pass for Freddie's. Rami's performance for the Live aid scenes was also really very good, but if you re-watch Freddie's actual performance at Live Aid, you'll be blown away by Freddie's power, confidence, and charisma on stage-- honestly not topped by any other live performer to this day.<br/><br/>As for Rami's portrayal of Freddie's speaking voice, I thought he nailed the British accent and his other speech mannerisms. However, the false upper front teeth were slightly distracting as they seemed to slightly interfere with Rami's speech toward the beginning of the movie when he was just getting used to acting with them (assuming they shot those scenes earlier). My only other criticism would be that he spoke a bit hoarser/raspier than Freddie. Ironically, for someone who drank and smoked and who could sing with a lot of rasp when he wanted to, Freddie had a speaking voice that was normally very smooth and fluid rather than hoarse or grainy. In the end, though, I thought casting Rami as Freddie was the right choice.<br/><br/>For the singing vocals, I thought Marc Martel did an outstanding job matching Freddie's original vocal tracks that were used. Marc mentioned that he sang Freddie's parts in a way that you couldn't tell the difference between his and Freddie's, and while I was skeptical at the time at such a claim, I guess he really wasn't joking! I think I could mostly tell the difference, but to the untrained ear, it would be very difficult. The Happy Birthday song and other practice sessions, for example, were likely Marc's, while I could recognize Freddie's tracks as taken straight from his album recordings for some of the songs due to his specific performance idiosyncrasies. And the Live Aid performance used Freddie's original vocals without a doubt.<br/><br/>The casting of the other members of Queen was also mostly spot-on. At least, Brian May's double looked, sounded, and acted just like Brian May! And John Deacon's actor also looked a lot like JD, especially in the face. Roger Taylor's double was slightly less convincing, and his voice was also not as raspy/breathy as RT's, but there was still a resemblance to a younger RT. Mary Austin's character was a pretty good look-alike, and so was Jim Hutton's. I'm sure the list goes on. As I said in the title, the casting was one of the strong points of the film.<br/><br/>I liked how they included Freddie's family (parents and sister), and how they emphasized Freddie's unremitting work ethic, both of which were mostly realistic. It was also really neat to see how Freddie might have come up with his ideas for some of his songs, which they interspersed throughout. I thought the portrayal of his sexuality was also appropriately handled and objective. Unlike what Sacha would have probably done if cast, they didn't over-emphasize his gay side or downplay his love for Mary, although they didn't ignore his promiscuity either.<br/><br/>Overall, they tried their best to throw in little bits about Freddie's life that fans would catch, even though they did take some liberties, as often happens in movies. For example, Freddie's conversation with Mary about his sexuality is accurate (based on Mary's interviews), inasmuch as Freddie says he's bisexual, and Mary replies saying she thinks he's just gay. However, Freddie had likely prefaced it differently than in the movie, saying that he had something to tell her that would change their relationship forever. In another example, they cite his famous ""musical prostitute"" line, but Freddie originally said this during a 1984 interview, not during a press conference as in the movie. They throw in his line about ""four aging queens"" as another fan reference, but it was taken from his 1986 Wembley concert. In yet another example, they have Freddie's character sing his iconic ""hey-oh"" line during one of the concerts before Live Aid, although I'm fairly sure Live Aid was the first time he did that. He then did a reprise of it at his '86 Wembley concert.<br/><br/>There were also some things there were entirely fictitious. The whole Ray Foster scene with the rock thrown through his window was entirely made up. Ray Foster wasn't even a real person, although it was fun to see Mike Myers sneak in with a brief cameo. The only truth to the scene is that there were concerns about Bohemian Rhapsody's length in airing on the radio. Also, the band never had a dramatic break-up as is portrayed. The band were all burnt out at the time and they gladly decided it was time for a break. So there was never any Freddie begging back in either. The whole break up/make up bit was contrived for the film.<br/><br/>They never showed any part of the '86 Wembley concert or Rami wearing Freddie's iconic yellow jacket with white striped pants. There were a lot of things they left out that I thought would have been neat if they featured. '86 Wembley was one, and another would have been a scene where Queen got stuck in an elevator. As Freddie humorously put it, they just heard that they were the #1 band in England on the charts, and they were going to suffocate in the bloody elevator! A third thing that would have been nice to see is Freddie's foray into the opera scene with his album Barcelona. This would have tied in nicely with the earlier scene where he plays the aria from Carmen as a primer for his idea for Bohemian Rhapsody. Another thing that would have been great is if they showed Freddie's parents Jer and Bomi turn to each other while watching the Live Aid concert and one of them say, ""Freddie's done it!"" As trite as that might sound here, it was supposedly what actually happened. I recommend Peter Freestone's biography for a more accurate story of Freddie's life. Peter was Freddie's chef and personal assistant. Come to think of it, where was Peter in the movie?<br/><br/>We also never saw Freddie's health deteriorate, to the point where he actually had to have his foot amputated. We didn't follow along with his drama of following medication regimen after medication regimen, only to still see his health decline, and then deciding to stop almost all medications entirely until his death. In my opinion, including this later chapter in Freddie's life would have made for much better drama than, say, band members fighting (Were Freddie and Roger really that verbally argumentative in real life?). It would have been equally dramatic and moving to see the arc of Freddie's character from peak fitness at Live Aid to frail and emaciated near the end. It would have been the perfect opportunity to dramatically juxtapose his powerful stage life with his deteriorating personal life. They do allude to this by showing him cough up blood (whether or not that actually happened), but they could have taken this much further than they left it. Emphasizing this decadence more would have made the story much more dramatic, as a similar formula was used by Shakespeare as well as Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray. In general the screenplay was a bit lackluster, but it wasn't that much worse than I was expecting it to be before coming in to see the film. That said, my plot expectations weren't that high to begin with.<br/><br/>The editing overall could have been a bit snappier at times, as it did seem to drag and loose steam toward the middle. I know that editors may do this to creating ""breathing room"" before building to the climax, but if the story noticeably drags, then some scenes should be shortened or cut out. I think if you are going to have a two hour movie as this one was, then you should definitely edit down the slower middle scenes, either to shorten the film's overall length, or to have the chance to add more substantial drama to the end along the lines of what I mention above. In either case, the impact of the film would have been increased.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend others to see it. They definitely tried to please the fans and gave the movie a biographical feel, even though not everything was entirely or chronologically accurate. (There were numerous points throughout that left me asking, ""Did that really happen?"") While I feel there were some missed opportunities, I was pleasantly surprised by a lot of what did manage to make it into the film. As one of his big fans, it was flattering to see an entire high-budget movie made centered around Freddie Mercury as the protagonist. The cinematography and visual effects for the Live Aid climax alone were enough reason to see the movie. Also hearing Freddie's singing voice coming from behind the big screen was absolutely beautiful-- as was all of the music featured-- and was a welcome reminder of the greatness of his talent.<br/><br/>//

"javomed88","8","2","4","16 November 2018"," Fun but Inaccurate Biopic
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is not as bad as critics say, but it is not Oscar-worthy either. Many of us are aware that this film was involved in numerous unconventional production delays. Therefore, the efforts are acknowledged given that the final product is more than acceptable. Nevertheless, the main issue with this film relies in the many inaccuracies of the story, which led to an incoherent (and even offensive) narrative for those who are truly familiarised with the always-known story of the rockstar in question.<br/><br/>Biopics are highly tricky, if not, risky. There are always going to be differing versions and opinions. People who knew Queen's story in detail are naturally in discomfort with a film that rather than paying tribute to the band's lead member, focuses on turning things around in favour of the ""victims"" (i.e. the other band members). It's no surprise that the screenplay was wrecked by a still-envious band, who portrayed Mercury not only as a middle-class bloke, but also (naively) attempted to lie to the audience by showing a weak-er, almost narcissistic Mercury, who does not relate intimately to the real persona. I have to admit that it is very interesting to see how film, as a mass media mechanism, can be used for some filthy purposes such as contentious advertising, political campaigning and false storytelling (-cough-).<br/><br/>For the sake of clarity, let's just review Mercury's origin. He came from a notorious, if not relatively wealthy family. He never had to work his way up as shown in the film. More importantly, Mercury never, ever had to beg for anything (as if!). In fact, others (including the less hot band members) were the ones always begging. By the way, this includes the fictitious dispute between Mercury and the other members regarding their participation in the Live Aid Concert. Given these reasons, the critics got it right.<br/><br/>In contrast, I think that critics overreacted with the so-called straightwashing of Mercury. I believe the film balanced very well Mercury's love and sex life, without falling into the nostalgic or bizarre. Mostly everyone knows how this character played and decayed. Therefore, the film did well by focusing on the artist rather than on the gay man. We will always love Mercury, no matter straight, bisexual or gay. In this case, the public's opinion prevails.<br/><br/>In a more technical note, the film does not have many cinematic qualities. It feels more like a TV-movie rather than a film aimed for the big screen. Aside from Rami Malek's exceptional characterisation, the only other highlights are sound mixing and make-up/costume design. However, for a film of this scale, editing and cinematography appeared amateurish, if not, mediocre. Screenwriting was hacked as noted above. Directing does not go too far either, hence, the reductive feel of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was a good attempt. It is entertaining and well-acted. More importantly, it is brave and controversial (as Queen itself). Future biopics could perhaps focus more on Mercury to try to repair the inaccuracies (or lies) set by this film. A good title for a more loyal version could just be ""Freddie"" or ""Mercury"". Anyway, we all know that Queen was all about him. I went to see the film with low expectations and had a fairly good time. It was inevitable not to spot the cracks, but the Live Aid Concert at the end redeems for most of the flaws. Malek should win almost every award as he saved this film. The rest of the discrepancies will probably be discussed until box-office closure, for which I anticipate a worldwide gross of half a billion minimum.<br/><br/>Score: 7.5/10<br/><br/>FJ Medina"
"harril-586-26745","6","2","4","10 November 2018"," Queen fans will love it.
","I went to see Bohemian Rhapsody not because I am a fan of the band Queen, but because I think Rami Malek is a great actor as evidenced by his character in the Mr Robot series. His portrayal of Freddie Mercury is at times very moving, but occasionally not quite believable. He's hindered in his acting by prothsetic teeth which don't even resemble FM's protruding front ones with others crooked, and his lips seem to stick to them when he speaks giving him a speech impediment. The musical moments are presented very well and Freddie's co-members of the band are well acted. Mike Meyers was a tad over-masked (kinda like Freddie's teeth) which prevented any empathy for his character as a human being with feelings. The ensemble cast - wife, mum, dad, boyfriend, evil servant, are really good, as is the the recreation of the big gig at Wembley. In spite of this nit-picking it was a good movie."

","Are you ready? Are you ready for this?
The world's population in 1985 was well over four billion people. That same year, close to two billion people across 150 countries witnessed one of the greatest performances in the history of live music. It would also be one of the last performances by British rock band Queen, led by singer, songwriter and the greatest frontman of all time - Freddie Mercury. That was Live Aid and that's old news now. Bohemian Rhapsody serves as a biopic into the short but brilliant life of Mercury, his music, his struggles as person and the choices he had to make at a time when society wasn't so liberal. Yet no matter what you know or how much you love the sound of their music, nothing can prepare you for the final twenty minutes, or the 20 most important minutes in Mercury's life. For every Gen X or pre-millennial watching this film, this is the closest any of us will come to seeing Freddie Mercury and Queen perform on stage. Again.<br/><br/>The film begins and ends with Mercury in his iconic acid jeans and wife-beater vest at Live Aid. In between, we follow the transformation of Farrokh Bulsara from a shy baggage handler at Heathrow airport to the rock legend he would become. A brief and early segment tells us about his conservative Parsi-Indian upbringing, which ultimately serves as an important arc to the two sides of Freddie Mercury - the musical genius and the man in the closet. In retrospect, this is a very important part of Mercury's life that the film either gets right or terribly wrong. That's because the film is content in revealing Mercury's relationship with his girlfriend and then wife Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). She was everything to him and the film respects that. But when Mercury gets seductive looks from other men, we are only given a hint of his confusion that questions his sexual orientation. As it seems, Bohemian Rhapsody has little interest in Mercury's personal life with other men and nothing more than mere implication. Instead, the focus is and where it should be - the camaraderie with bandmates Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon - their love, joy, hate and heartbreak during the course of Queen's ascent into the household name it is today.<br/><br/>If Bohemian Rhapsody feels underdeveloped at times, it would be because many viewers may have been expecting a more detailed story behind Queen, the band's rapid rise to fame, and why their music continues to enjoy such longevity. While this part of the film feels patchy, with bits and pieces time stamped by years and concerts around the world, the film is really about Mercury's vision to write and produce music that was outrageous and outstanding, yet universally infectious. In the film, his lyrics and melodies come to him in epiphanies. It's a nice touch in trying to understand the brilliance behind his outrageously flamboyant stage persona, while also nodding to the fact that Mercury was known to be a shy introvert when not performing.<br/><br/>As Mercury, Rami Malek nails every scene with commanding aplomb, while struggling to cover his buck teeth with his upper lip. Like Queen, it's a meteoric performance for Malek who gathered a large fan following on TV's Mr. Robot. There are others too, Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor, Gwilym Lee as lead guitarist Brian May, and an unrecognizable Mike Myers as a record label executive who together add supporting characters aid the story. But even if the biopic doesn't add up with which, who and what came first, all credit goes to Malek for capturing and almost reveling in Mercury's dynamic and electric stage presence, yet equally childlike innocence. Ultimately, Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration of Queen's music, but with focus on Mercury as the band's creator. If that means controversies are left out, then it also leaves Mercury's brilliance and conflicts obscured in mystery. And that's the best way to remember a legend with an incredibly diverse set of octaves.
""We will rock you"", they said. They do and you better believe it. By the time you realise the end credits are rolling up, you'll find yourself hanging on the edge of your seat."

","I was rocked. Could go on and on about how the movie was a wonderful tribute to Freddie Mercury and Queen, warts and all, and was ultimately a movie about love and family but-- that would be selling ""Bohemian Rhapsody ""short.<br/><br/>What really made ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" an exceptional musical biopic was how it handled the music and the fans. It didn't just lazily roll out the ""Greatest Hits."" It showed the creation of several of their chart toppers and illustrated how the band considered the fans interest in, enjoyment of, and investment in the music at every juncture. The music was also used to show where Freddie and the band were at the specific time of release -- dramatizing everything from Freddie's sexuality to his relationship with both his family and the band, his other family. All these themes and fan-service came to a tremendous crescendo in the third act, which centered on the band's performance at 'Live Aid."" I got a bit emotional. No lie.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a loving ode to Freddie Mercury, Queen, the music, the fans. It's everything this type of movie should be. 100% worth see.<br/><br/>Notes:
Rami Malek was tremendous, like Oscar caliber. The rest of the band: Gwilym Lee (Brian May), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon), where also terrific. Ditto for the other supporting cast.<br/><br/>The movie was well directed except for a few cliche sequences used to cover the passage of time.<br/><br/>It had a very straightforward, and then... and then... plot structure, but was otherwise very cleverly written. Art times, inventive, and even funny.<br/><br/>The constraints placed on it by run-time and the Biopic genre are the only reasons I didn't give it a higher mark. Honestly could've watched a three-hour version of this movie that went more in-depth with Freddie's personal life and the bands travails. Fingers crossed for a Director's Cut."
"Klinoman","8","2","4","8 November 2018"," Powerful But Tame
","If you're a Rock/Metal ""know it all"", it might bug you for it's inaccuracies for some real time events. Now, if you're an ordinary fan, this is the right movie for you, because it gives you a big ""greatest hits"" music video. Its powerful, it has impact, and it explores Freddie's darkness, albeit incompletely and safely. That being said, there is around 40 minutes of scenes that didn't make it to the theaters, which would have increased the quality of the movie. But, it would've made the movie longer, and thats a no-no in the industry today for a blockbuster. The actors were cast well, and the performances were positive, with Malek doing the best job. So, what is wrong with the movie? Well, nothing, really. It is perfect for what it is supposed to be, a 12+ rated movie for a hard-rock band which had its greatest moments in times when everything was being exposed and experimented. How about a Black Sabbath movie? I doubt they would pacify Osbournes, him being most controversial, and Iommis, Butlers and Wards abuse of different drugs, alcohol, women, and imagery of the occult. Freddie was a big hedonist, maybe the biggest of all rock stars. You can't do that if its a 12+ movie. He is a Pop Icon, not in a musical, but in a celebrity sense, and if you give this darkness to his fan base, which are mostly interested in its extroverted side, that R rated movie you'll be making will not get far on the box office list. The critics will like it, but not so much the fans. So, I'll be on the lookout for a different movie, an R rated one, for the darker side of Mercury. Again, this movie does its job perfectly for what it is, nobody can deny it, but, I can only wonder what S. B. Cohens Freddie/Queen project would've looked like."
"coasterdude44","9","2","4","8 November 2018"," Great Success!
","The film about legendary singer and performer Freddie Mercury and his band Queen is here, which follows his life personal transformation alongside Queen from its origins in the early 70s with the formation of the band and its identity and all the events that led up to their Live Aid performance in 1985 at the peak of his musical career. The film shows the origin of Freddie Mercury as an artist and his inspiration and creation for arguably his greatest hit Bohemian Rhapsody and his drive and passion to try to innovate and create something people have never heard before, as well as the pushback he received from so many critics and record dealers, which showed the true nature of Queen of always doing it their way and knowing what the audience wants, and giving it to them.<br/><br/>The film in a lot of ways does feel like A Star Is Born with the simple origins of a worldwide celebrity with Freddie and his fearlessness to achieve and experiment. How the inspiration behind some of their greatest songs started as small ideas that anyone could have of come up with at the time like the idea of audience interaction and foot stamping which became the riff of We Will Rock You which again innovated the band and rose it higher, in a way making it a pioneer of audience interaction when Queen performed live. Any band at the time could have done what Queen did, the only difference is that only Freddie and the band were passionate and daring enough to do it. It also showed how Queen was family to him and Freddie never had the idea of being a solo performer, it was him and the band which were unbreakable.
His sexuality is also clearly portrayed in the film as well as the relationship he had with Jim Beach and later became his partner, how critics slammed Queen's innovation and people started to leech of Mercury's fame and eventually the events that lead to his diagnosis of AIDS, and instead of letting it destroy himself and Queen, transformed himself into a beacon of hope worldwide with his legendary Live Aid performance as well as the legacy he left behind for AIDS research.<br/><br/>I was sceptical at first when I saw this was being made. I have been a fan of Queen's music for a long time but I never really knew that much about the personal life of Freddie Mercury as well as the other members of the band apart from his music and sexuality. Just from the trailers it had a feeling of being rushed with a cheesy tone, not being completely faithful. After seeing it though I really do think it did everything it possibly could have done to stay true to long-time fans of Queen as well as educating people like me who still don't know that much about him as a person as well as successfully conveying and emotionally engaging biopic with near perfect casting. The film also has great cinematography, direction and is shot beautifully, as well as incredible music. It will arguably become the greatest biography film of the decade alongside The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything and is in my top 5 for the year. Definitely see it. Great success. Queen will live on forever!"

","After the drama surrounding the departure of original lead Sacha Baron Cohen being replaced by Rami Malek to the 2017 holiday firing of original director Bryan Singer being replaced by Dexter Fletcher (however DGA rules allowed Singer credit), we all wondered if this film would ever make it to screens. However after all this on-set debacles, the remaining members of the production delivered a terrific final product.<br/><br/>Chronicling the formation of Queen in 1970 to their dynamic and legendary 1985 Live Aid performance, there is no shortage of ups and downs within the narrative. There are quarrels between the band-mates and personal dilemmas for iconic front-man, Freddie Mercury, as he struggles to find his personal identity and run his band. While the film isn't entirely accurate with details of Mercury's strifes, the writers still treat the late musician with respect and care that made Freddie so beloved by his fans, friends and loved ones.<br/><br/>Before getting to the performance of lead Rami Malek, credit must first go to the supporting players who are equally important to making the film's emotional core work. From Gwilym Lee as Queen guitarist Brian May (who produced the feature along with drummer Roger Taylor) who helped write the majority of Queen's biggest hits, Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor who resents when Freddie keeps showing up late or upset when his contributions get cut but ultimately cares about the men of the band, Joe Mazello as John Deacon who is the other reserved member of the group and then there's Lucy Boynton as Freddie's long-time friend and confidante Mary Austin. Boynton does harness the compassionate side of Mary as she copes with the initial hurt of Freddie's sexuality, but embraced him regardless which led to their long-lasting friendship. However Boynton's performance is still not quite up to accuracy par as she tends to be slightly over-dramatic and sometimes comes off as a jilted girlfriend rather than someone who figured out her friend's secret and chose not to be judgmental. Still a valuable role for the British actress and one to be proud of.<br/><br/>Now to the man of the feature: Rami Malek as the legendary Freddie Mercury. From relative obscurity to landing the coveted role of Elliot Alderson on TV's ""Mr. Robot"", Malek struck the jackpot with the role of Queen's legendary front-man after the departure of Sacha Baron Cohen. Immediately making an impression as we only see glimpses of the actor in costume until we go back to the night he met his future band-mates. Malek attaches to Mercury's shyness as he approaches Brian, Roger and John but his charisma ultimately shines through as he wins the attention of the three musicians. As the film goes on, the filmmakers begin to touch on the conflict of Freddie's sexual identity especially with the world's attitude towards homosexuality in the 1970s and 1980s. While not always accurate, the writers never pass judgment and allow Malek to subtly embrace the true nature of Freddie's private life. Thanks to the charisma of Malek, we still love Freddie even when he does cause tension with his band or his family. While the actor doesn't get to display his vocal chops often, Malek captures the stage presence and essence that made Queen's live concerts so beloved and legendary.<br/><br/>The music is of course the crux of the feature. Viewers can't help but want to join in the singing (yours truly sure did) as Mercury's powerful vocals radiate through the screen. Even though he died in 1991, using the front-man's vocals helps make it seem that Freddie never left us. This also lends to massive feels as the performance sequences do such justice to the band's famous concerts and would've made Freddie Mercury proud."

"kodaman-62602","9","2","4","4 November 2018"," solitude
","Artists tend to live a bit outside of average society patterns but Freddie had a lot more going on.
He also had to search, understand, analyse, accept himself as he is. I'm totally suprised to see how lonely he was, maybe because of this search.
Fame and fortune is not bed of roses. (lyrics from We Are The Champions) This sums up his feelings I guess.<br/><br/>Apart from Freddie's battles within himself, movie tells story of band's general progress and making of some hit songs.
About cast, character choices are just fine but if it comes to lead role, all I can say is that Rami Malek deserves one real Academy Award.
Contrary to general knowledge, to play well-known persona is much more harder than fiction persona.
Because actor/actress can add/remove something to a fiction character but playing Freddie Mercury?
It must have been too much work for Malek and yes, he just did it. Even the Live Aid concert scene is just enough for award by itself.<br/><br/>Thank you all for giving us a chance to watch him, feel his vibe again through our veins.
I hope current generation Z could also appreciate his unique gift with this movie."

"mageh","8","2","4","4 November 2018"," Worth the watch
","I give it 8 out of 10. In overall, it was a good not amazing movie until the LiveAid end. This saved it from being 7. I must agree somewhat with critics: it was lacking something, however just listening to Queen music and then end it with LiveAid made it much better. The ending made the movie more meaningful in many ways. Another negative point for me, a fun of Queen who knows a bit about the band history: I think Rami is a great actor, but he doesn't look like Freddie! the eyes are different and the british accent was not natural. So i was struggling with the physical likeness of Freddie to Rami, Freddie was more attractive, sorry. But on the other hand it is also very difficult to play Freddie since Rami is still short of charisma that Freddie had. However, in LiveAid portion he still did a very good job. So, overall, it is emotional biopic, worth the watch, but could be slightly better."
"diana_9376","10","2","4","3 November 2018"," Oscar worthy
","I'm going to start this review by saying: ignore the critics, they obviously didn't see the same movie as the rest of us. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a masterpiece, both the song and the movie. The song wasn't appreciated back in the day, but it's considered one of the best songs in the world today. This also might be the case with the movie. Maybe critics don't appreciate it now, but in 20 years or so, this movie is going to be considered a timeless classic, and I'm sure they will regret it, just as they did with the song.<br/><br/>My personal opinion is that the movie should be nominated for an Oscar and it should also win. Rami Malek was just mesmerizing as Freddie Mercury. As I was watching the movie, there were moments when I just forgot it was an actor and not the real Freddie. And not because of his looks, even though the makeup department did a really great job, but Rami managed to capture Freddie's essence, his intoxicating energy and complex persona. He really made the role of Freddie Mercury his own.<br/><br/>Also, I really liked that they didn't transform the movie into those sappy, dramatic and exaggerated biographical movies. Well, it's a biographical movie, obviously, but they kept it respectful and focused more on Freddie as the great performer and entertainer that he was.<br/><br/>They integrated all the important parts of his life, just in the right amount. I loved the optimism of the movie, it makes you wanna follow your dreams and not care about anyone's opinion. Brilliant!"

After watching this movie it's truly the best one movie of 2018 and deserves oscar. The reason why people may have gave it bad review because it never got deep into Queens history or The dark stuff of band or the members sept Freddie. If you are looking for more in depth look in the band queen's life don't watch this. If your huge queen fan definitely see this. This movie really went into Freddie's life and didn't go deep enough.Also Remi Malik if you don't win a Oscar i don't know if the oscar are accurate anyway.Now stop reading my review and go see the movie.(also there really good Easter egg in the movie.Trust me it's funny.)"

"subxerogravity","9","2","4","3 November 2018"," If you love Queen, Rami Malek will bring Freddie Mercury to life.
","I loved the movie. I had been dying to see it since I herd of it. Rami Malek just looked the part so I wanted to see it for that. For the most part Bryan Singer creates a very formulated rock epic indeed, but I think that's just how a biopic about Queen would be. If the film is at all accurate about Queen then the band did not really have enough drama to make a movie about. It was so cool to see that there is a band that truly gets along like family(and they kept on playing till the end)<br/><br/>However, most of the flick is about the life of the late Freddy Mercury, the focus mostly goes through his own personal journey from the time he met the other members of the band that would become Queen, to his death.<br/><br/>Rami Malek was absolute incredible in his transformation. He made you a believer. Thank god, cause if he just looked like Mercury without anything else this movie would tank.<br/><br/>What made the film so great for me was the relationship Mercury seemed to have with the band. Like I said before, it does not seem like the band had much drama between them throughout their life span so most of the film is about four friends making music together, and that's great. The chemistry between Malek and the other actors was well received, just beautiful to watch.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a love affair with Queen cause it's a lot of their music in it performed by the actors, not really most likely, but it did look like I was watching the ultimate cover band in IMAX. As well as they acted their parts they also Semi-performed the songs well. They look really good lip syncing and if you love Queen, this will be something you want to see.<br/><br/>Fantastic, exciting, witty, overall well done. Thanks Mike Myers for the introduce in Wayne's World that made me love the music more."

It may seem strange, but I find the video available on YouTube of the actual performance to be far more compelling.<br/><br/>The movie version of the performance is accurate and technically very well done but it just seems to have no soul. I really don't think it would ever be reproducible. Some things can only be performed once."
"mitchellfleming","10","2","4","29 October 2018"," Pretty much flawless
","This film honestly blew me away. I was expecting to enjoy Bohemian Rhapsody because Queen are my favourite musical artists of all time but this was breathtaking on a scale I never imagined. The make up and costume design perfectly capture the look of both Queen and the period, with the amazing cinematography also bringing a great vibe to the movie. The sheer energy present in the scenes of Queen performing sent shivers down my spine and had me grinning from ear to ear for pretty much the entire movie, especially in the climactic Live Aid scene which is without doubt one of my favourite movie scenes of the decade. The greatest thing about this movie though is undoubtedly Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury. This is seriously one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. As a fan of Mr Robot, I was amazed by how Malek completely disappeared into the role and he never felt like he was acting, I felt like I was watching Freddie Mercury. If Malek doesn't even get nominated at the Oscars, then I will be extremely upset because this is a miraculous performance. The supporting cast are also great and while I can't think of my favourite supporting performance, Mike Myers' glorified cameo is undoubtedly a highlight of the movie. You know those performances that feel Oscar worthy even though they're only in like one scene, example being Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction. That is the best way I can describe Myers' role because he was amazing here. So yeah, overall I was blown away by Bohemian Rhapsody. I didn't think that a movie about my favourite band that I've been looking forward to for years could possibly exceed my expectations but it did. Bohemian Rhapsody is the best movie I've seen all year, it was the best cinema experience I've had in my entire life and it is a masterpiece."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.<br/><br/>Courtesy of Neville Cawas Bardoliwalla OBE"

","REVIEW - BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY<br/><br/>I have been waiting for this film for such along time, with so much controversy surrounding this it was thought that it would never be made, even with the original director leaving 2 thirds through, Dexter Fletcher has pulled it off and you are certainly in for a treat.<br/><br/>Yes a lot of the story is dropped, possibility because the other band members were executive producers (enough said) and a lot of the security of Freddie Mercury was lightly implied but never the less, Queen fan or not this is one you will enjoy, from the greed to the friendship but most of all for the amazing performances of all involved but especially the music.<br/><br/>For those of us who watched Live Aid in 1984 the end is especially amazing and moving.<br/><br/>I especially loved the in joke about Wayne's World!<br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10"

","After listening to live aid concert albums many times, I saw that the final climax of the movie was to recreate the concert scene of that year, which was ignited instantly. Although the plot in front is a bit of a running book, at the end of the concert, I listened to Queen's classic songs again. The lyrics suddenly became the annotation of Freddie's fate. There was a sense of destiny. Suddenly, there was a feeling that I had never understood these songs. I was very moved! For fans, it's worth spending a movie ticket to see a queen's concert. Although Lamy Marek's performance is a little over the top, the body movements in the concert are still lifelike, but what's more, the songs in this movie are all original songs"

","Rami Malek really throws himself into this role and I can't really fault his commitment or his determination, but there are some problems here but being a generally positive person I'll start with the good things first...<br/><br/>Firstly, Bohemian Rhapsody is very entertaining and despite its 2 hour plus running time the film is not boring and, as I've mentioned above the film does benefit from a lot of commitment and drive from Malek, but as I've said in my summary I did find this film a little problematic<br/><br/>Let me explain; Malek's acting is superb and yet I still didn't find the film to be the showstopper that many others saw it as. I mean let's be honest with ourselves how much of the singing belonged to Malek? I read in the trivia section that it was his voice amalgamated with 2 others. Oh good at least that allayed my suspicions that Malek wasn't singing all of those Queen songs.. This naturally takes away from the film when you more or less see Malek effectively mouthing to Queen's songs or hearing Freddie Mercury's vocals in the background and then passing it off as a vocal performance from Malek. To me this was a little distracting and proved a problem for me for large sections of the film.<br/><br/>Sorry but despite Malek being fairly good at mimicking Freddie, he really can't sing like him (despite the obvious attempts that were made to make him sound like he could). I thought the rest of Queen were developed a little superficially - John Deacon was pretty much sidelined and May & Taylor are barely explored either. This was a film that was produced by May & Taylor (whom you would think would be the ideal people to bankroll such a project), but sometimes too much control and influence can be turned into a negative - I think it was probably their decision to have Malek's voice morphed with other people's which I'm not entirely convinced was the right decision.<br/><br/>Still despite my reservations above I have to admit that I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody and found it to be energetic and fun and the finale at Live Aid was a blast. Yet despite a good 'acting' turn from Malek I did find 'performing' Malek to be slightly problematic and the end result is a good, but flawed film."

"adeckofcards","7","0","0","2 May 2020"," Success before man
","Considering Queen's vast, extensive, and impressive history, the prospect of making a film about the band (or about Freddie Mercury) was a given. And when this film directed by Bryan Singer finally arrives it feels, in a way, like a great wasted potential. This is because, instead of covering complex and really interesting topics in the life of Freddie Mercury, such as the excesses of fame, the discovery of his sexuality or the difficult stage of his illness, the film focuses mainly on teaching, more than anything else, the creative process of his most important songs. This, unsurprisingly, will delight fans and connoisseurs of the band, but it involves leaving aside the vocalist's more personal themes. That is why in this film success is presented before the man behind, since the latter can be much more interesting.
But despite this, a quick montage (albeit poorly directed) makes this film enjoyable, as long as you don't expect a deep or interesting deal from Freddie Mercury's personal life, but just fascinate you with his music."

","I saw this film just moments ago and I'm really dissapointed. I'm not a biggest fan of Queen in the world (this goes to my girlfriend) but I know a little. It looks like a series of short episodes linked by the band. The film is making an impression that ""Bohemian Rhapsody was their second album. What about ""Queen II"" and ""Sheer Heart Attack""? And ending it after Live Aid? Just like albums like ""A Kind of Magic"" or ""Innuendo"" never happened. The same is for their contributions to various soundtracks. Wasn't ""Flash"" or ""Highlander"" important to their careers. The concert in Barcelona was very important to Freddie and was ommited by the filmmakers. Or maybe Brian Singer wants to show us ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" part 2.
The rest of the film is OK. Actors, who played the band were great, soundtrack is quite good (maybe they should add a few of their less popular songs). But if you really want to see a good bio of a band tej ""The Doors"" by Olivier Stone. And I hope that if biography of my favourite Deep Purple will be made Brian Singer will stay out of it."

","Rami Makel plays Freddy Mercury, flamboyant front man of the rock group Queen, from the legendary band's seminal years to his early death from AIDS-related complications. The film is generally very good, with an excellent cast (especially Makel and Gwilym Lee, who plays guitarist Brian May), great music, and a nice period feel. Mercury was an astonishing stage presence, and the story of his life is fascinating, so it's beyond me why the film-makers had to make up nonsense like the band breaking up and reforming just before Live-Aid (in reality they toured just weeks before the massive charity gig) and Geldof having to be talked into allowing the band to play as a last minute addition to the schedule, or change the time-line of Mercury's AIDS diagnosis. Yes, I know that it's not a documentary, but making up facts for 'dramatic effect' diminishes the value of the film as a biography and shows a marked lack of faith in the material or the writers. I am surprised that band mates May and Roger Taylor allowed the pointless revisionism, especially as they professed to be concerned about 'Mercury's legacy'.

","You've bought the t-shirt. You've bought the album. You've bought the concert ticket. Now you can buy the film. This skimming the surface of the interpretation of this English band through this latest medium goes through the simplistic motions of a well written book; it has a beginning. A middle. And an end. But here, Bohemian Rhapsody contains all three aspects of the qualities of a well written book, too, but in its final execution it lacks true depth, true insight and true understanding of exactly how this band lived and survived within the harsh realities of the music industry itself. No secrets here.<br/><br/>Queen disbanded after their final performance together on the 9th of August 1986 (Knebworth Park, England) and officially after the sad death of their charismatic, extrovert lead singer Freddie Mercury, birth name Farrokh Bulsara (5th September 1946 - Sultanate of Zanzibar: 24 November 1991 - London, England) to HIV AIDS. Bohemian Rhapsody, with good intentions, is a fantastic film, the operative word here being ""fan"". The concern with biopics is that they can tend to be simply that, a fan-based narrative to straightforwardly not engage the pros & cons of the whatnots of said artists' but to entertain and, more importantly, to perpetuate the image, the myth, the legend and the coffers of those involved; If you make it, they will buy it. All well and good, to a point, if you understand the difference of entertainment and education; the difference between biopic and documentary.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"", written by Mr. Mercury, for the 1975 album ""A Night at the Opera"", is more than simply a track on a 70s rock album, its significance, its impact, its relevance, both musically and culturally, has connotations way beyond its six minutes of diversity and complexity, and here, with the work of Mr. Singer, has extended the image, the myth, the legend. This amusing fable, this sad tale, this exposÃ© of a casualty of abundance delves into the murky waters of human relationships; betrayal, jealousy, anger, self-worth, identity, loneliness and ego.
This is not the story of one band, this is, first & foremost, the story of its frontman, Freddie Mercury. We are to witness a fleeting glimpse, and feel, once more, a connection beyond the passing of this public figure, an empathy to his course, an empathy because of his course, like so many of his kindred spirits. We delve into his struggle with his proud parents, his bisexuality, his homosexuality, his working, and departure, within the band and ultimately his love, his soulmate, for Mary Austin (b. 1951).<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody certainly shows the sordid side of how people can become lost, not only within themselves, but as human beings, but there is also hope, reconciliation and family too that are projected along the narrative here, sending a message that amongst all that is rotten there is always love & family. This is an intriguing retrospective of contradictions interwind with both joy and tragedy of a time when four men came together and became not only kings of their profession, but an inspiration fit for a Queen."
"alexis-21-81191","9","0","0","31 July 2019"," ALMOST PERFECT - FORCED ME TO REALLY CONFRONT MY IDEAS ABOUT BIOGRAPHYS
","A roller coaster of emotions. Almost perfect in every single department. I don't recall enjoying a film so much in a very long time. This is a two hour 20 mins film but I must admit, time passed by like an asteroid. Elusive and beautiful ... Congrats to everyone involved in this production, especially Malek who puts on a hell of a performance. Absolutely majestic.
But no movie is perfect, and even though I wished this one was, it's not. The plot point during Act 1 with the fight in their managers office where they decide to flush him down the toilet is weak. No real emotion there, despite building it up, it seems like something stopped the producers. Maybe it was a call from the man himself, the producer. Really hurt the movie. They were better off paying him a compensation of sorts. Him appearing at the end, like he is, would've been ecstasy after release if it was done correctly. The acapella in Wembley is performed without the famous yellow shirt. Big historical mistake if I'm not mistaken. Diki's character is incomplete in my opinion. He's the last one to have a dig at him, since I imagine he was the least important part of the band, appearance wise. And yet, they build him up as the one who holds them together every time they were about to explode and destroy everything. So when he has a go at Freddie, it should've been a very big moment in the film, even if he quickly dismissed him right then and there. Show Freddie crying alone right after... This is my belief about Diki.
After Bob's interview where he accuses Freddie of countless sexual partners on national television, one of the members of the squad asks him why he fired him...
The doctor AIDS appointment should've been a flashback when we see Freddie contemplating about AIDS, not a subsequent scene. He didn't see an AIDS add and then learned he has AIDS. He saw the add because he knew he had AIDS. The dad character is also incomplete, leaving the final acceptance scene wanting... No fights between them. No real struggle for Freddie to overcome his father grip. At the beginning he is even disrespecting him in his own house. That makes the relation irrelevant, so they either shouldn't have included it at all, or build it in the proper manner. It was a major part of his life, and a real opportunity to make the ending so much more powerful. The mother as well, or even better the whole family, considering the first song he chooses at Live Aid. Another example of how incomplete the tension among the family was portrayed... Even the sister was irrelevant. How the f was the sister irrelevant? Finally, the last song which is played during the titles, should've been included in the film. It feels as if they sacrificed one of Queen's best songs just to avoid repetition.
Again I playback my initial point. I don't recall enjoying a film so much in a long time ..."

","Here's my super late review of Bohemian Rhapsody. As far as I've noticed if a guy's eccentric and happens to be a celebrity then Hollywood's ready to make a biopic : the wolf of Wall Street , Molly's game , Jobs and the list goes on. Despite that those movies felt inspirational , I just felt Bohemian Rhapsody didn't have that heart to it. The movie stars Rami malek as Freddie Mercury and that's an Oscar contender right there. I still felt Sacha baron Cohen the initial choice would've been much accurate , Malek was amazing it's just that Cohen would've been better. My knowledge of queen is very mainstream and even I felt that Freddie Mercury in this movie was a fusion of Jake Gyllenhaal's Lou bloom meets Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs meets Johnny depp's Ed wood. The music in this movie was great , I'm not talking about the soundtrack I'm talking about the original queen songs. And the idea how they put up the lyrics like in a music video when the song was playing was a smart idea. The final act in this movie is just really amazing. You could just feel the energy in the air . In the end Bohemian Rhapsody is not an epic but it's sure as hell entertaining with a wide array of songs to sing along to."

","This band could have been a simple boys band and they were not because they had something more powerful in their guts and they dared to put it on the stage, set it up for us, the audience who wanted to rock and roll but a music that spoke about our real world, not the real world that we suffered all along but the real world that we suffered all along carved in the stone of our victimized minds that provided us with the glyphs of ecstasy in some codex of a cosmic ritualistic calendar of eternal time. Queen was able to bring together for us the real world and the way we experienced it in our minds, to the point of us becoming mental, to the point of getting so far into the margin and so deep into the unknown that at the time, and we were in the 1970-80s we could not imagine Queen was anything else but the truth coming from ahigh, from the sky, but the sky of our own existential madness.<br/><br/>There were many other artists in those days who tried to show us the world through our own belly button windows, as Jimi Hendrix called them because our eyes only saw what we suffered and enjoyed experienced and ran after all over in our life, in this life that has no return ticket to the other side of normalcy, or fashionable normalcy, the normalcy of those who accept to be nothing but bone, flesh, and blood droppings from the nest of some god or monsters who dominates our minds so much that we cannot even go into the closest Water Closet without being accused of some onanistic crime. And if we by any chance met someone in this Water Closet we would be accused of some mental and diabolical fornication, and fornication is an understatement for these moralistic deranged people because they visualize all the things they would like to do and yet never do at all, except when they find enough courage to push the door of the local Maison Close, as they call them in French in the text, and buy from the Madame the human thing they need to do all the things they want to do that are not allowed in any ethical treatise. We all have a Marquis de Sade in our dendrites.<br/><br/>But what enthused us then? What in us made us love this music and these lyrics and the noise they caused all along their way, along our way, because we projected ourselves into them and we transferred our minds into their spiritual experience and we became the loving human animals that could really shock our parents, our friends, our relatives, if we dared to say it, to tell it, to publicize this transference activity of ours, being Freddie Mercury and his band, and getting into his clothes at first and then into his skin not to satisfy our hormonal desires with him but to engulf ourselves into the bliss of satisfying all our desires through, via, by sheer dint of Freddie Mercury himself and his band. We were becoming the ghost in the Opera of this Queen band of extra-real extra-social extra-cultural both geniuses and devils. And we finally could paint the city red, blood red mind you, ""Mama I've just killed a man,"" and finally as William Burroughs would say in ""The Soft Machine"" in over some odd 140 pages ""a young captive was tied to a stake and the priests who were translucent lobster men with wild blue eyes and shells of flexible copper, tore his s** off with white-hot copper claws to throw the writhing remnant of the emasculated boy into the brown iridescent lagoon infested with sting-ray, freshwater shark, Arequipa, candirus, water boa, crocodile, electric eel, aquatic panther and other noxious creatures,"" dreamed up by the never lying Freddie Mercury, ""which infest our minds with marginal ambitions and ritualistic symbiotic human cannibalism."" We enjoyed these visions of fatal, lethal, morbid and supremely enjoyable blissful, I mean full of bliss, orgasmic realization of our deepest impulses and fears because we were both the young captive and the Mayan priest. Were we ready to perform the self-sacrifice this Mayan priest required, take the stingray spine and pierce our penile being to offer our penial blood to the climactic discharge of our souls into the eternity of cosmic life?<br/><br/>That was Queen for us, and the film magnificently recreates this nostalgia with the necessary softening not to frighten the younger souls who may wonder why we liked such barbaric exploration of what we had deepest in our marrow and spine. The actor is of course surprisingly able to impersonate the artist who will at the end be himself in their final concert in Wimbledon or somewhere else for Bob Geldof and Midge Ure's Live Aid campaign.<br/><br/>Most of us though, would not admit that depth and brutal viciousness of our mental world that only finds its way out in a war when all is permitted on one side or the other, on all sides actually because there often are more than two, provided it is wrapped up in nationalism, patriotism, socialism or simply the revolution like today's Artificial Intelligence revolution. As Lee Harvey Oswald would say ""Have you read Karl Marx?"" and he would hand us the Manifesto of the Communist Party, as a first step towards our liberation that implies that we torture and execute all those who disagree with our revolution. ""Good Morning Vietnam"" as another actor would say in a famous film. But it is nowadays something like ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" for this Freddie Mercury who sang in all the tones and colorations possible that ""I was born to love you!"" Would you really refuse to be loved by such a Luciferian archangel? In the time of the yellow vest turned black blocks I am afraid Freddie Mercury has wasted his love on all those who came after him. He is singing in a desolate, desertic, and empty jungle of many million wild spiders in one small pot. Then it is real body language indeed, or should I say the Mayan Centipede is back again on Les Champs ElysÃ©es for Bastille Day 2019. Can you hear them singing ""What can we loot, what can we raid, what can we spoil?"" I am sure it is high time to get all these Queen's lyrics and read them as if they were a flame in the night, to follow Leonard Cohen's testament poetry book.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

I had to spend some time on Wikipedia after watching to get the facts of what really happened.<br/><br/>The basic formula was Freddie goes through some personal event, band gets together and makes up a new song, performance of new song, band gets more popular, Freddie goes through some personal stuff, band gets together to make a new song, more popular... A few twists and turns here and there but it's not much variety. What can you expect from a band since that is their life? The imitation is almost good as good as reality, just watch live Queen performances. The bassist and guitarist are spot on lookalikes. Freddie definitely has the most unique features of them all but Rami Malek captured his personality and flair during performances excellently. I've watched Mr. Robot a few times and Malek's voice doesn't seem to be dynamic enough to capture Freddie's speech as I was catching a lot of Elliott in his performance of Freddie. It would have been interesting to see how Sacha Baron Cohen would have played Freddie as he definitely looks more like Freddie to me. The live performances are entertaining and very well done. Yeah, it's lip-syncing live performances that are already out there, but still entertaining. I do wish they could have incorporated real footage of the live performances in with the acted version, because Freddie is such a larger than life performer that you just have to see him in real life.<br/><br/>Overall, being a casual fan of QUEEN, this was an entertaining way to learn more about the band and re-experience some of their greatest hits. I'll definitely be listening to them again the next few days."

","Wow! I feel mind-blown after watching the world premiere yesterday evening. I am whether a megahuge Queen fan (although I really like many of their songs), nor do I know how accurate the storytelling is (, but I suppose pretty accurate since both Brian May and Roger Taylor are co-producers of the film), but I found the movie both intoxicating and moving. I have read some of the professional reviews, and I cannot comprehend their search of documentary wisdom in this movie; this is not a documentary, but an entertaining story of one of the world's most iconic bands. And the film delivers on all aspects. (And the critics were so wrong about the song Bohemian Rhapsody upon its release).<br/><br/>As Brian May pinpointed in the interview on the red carpet, he found that the casting was excellent (I don't remember the exact word he used). But he is so right. Every major role is perfectly casted, and all the band members are brilliant. But I must emphasize Rami Malek's role as Freddie. It has Oscar written all over it. What he does, is almost beyond comparison. Chapeau for even taking on this role, and then delivering what he does. Even better, although marginally, than Michael Douglas in Behind the Candelabra. And Gwilym Lee as Brian May is also a bull's eye, but Malek really carries the production on his tiny shoulders. It was like watching our beloved Freddie all over again.<br/><br/>Many, many memorable moments, but the Live Aid performance recreated: it is one of the best scenes I have ever seen - and I have seen lots and lots of films. Chapeau for director(s) and producers and the whole team for to me delivering the best film YTD in 2018!!"

","I enterd the cinema as a person who liked Queen's music, i left in love with their songs. Rami Malek was great as Freddie Mercury, even if his excesses were filtered in order to make him more likeable. The overall structure is mediocre with the rythm that is so inconsistent and some major points of the band's history were rushed. The last 30 minutes are instead so exciting and they give a sense to what seen before. I think that the Oscars won by this movie (except the Malek's one) were not deserved and they don't have to be seen as an indication of exceptional quality, only good quality. Indeed Bohemian Rhapsody is a fine film that entertains but doesn't go beyond that and it makes you want to listen to a Queen's greatests hits album over and over!"

"Olicosmic","8","0","0","25 May 2019"," An overall fun and very memorable biopic
","I'm not gonna lie and say that I'm a huge fan of Queen, as I've never really delved that much into their discography and history. I've always liked them just fine, but I've never been crazy about them personally. With that said, just know that I didn't have any high expectations going into this movie, as this review is more so how well this works as a film rather than the accuracy of it all. Thankfully, this movie is really awesome, as it is one of the most fun musical biopics I've seen in recent years. The performances were all fantastic, the story is well written, the casting was damn near perfect, the music is fantastically recreated, the script is well written, and the overall flow of the film is great. Rami Malek really makes this film, as he was fantastic as Freddie Mercury, and the Oscar he won for this role was 150% well deserved. And while that all sounds well and good, there are a few things that keep it from reaching the heights of true amazingness. There are some scenes that can sometimes either drag on too long and others that can end before it reaches it's full potential. This doesn't happen a lot, but it can be annoying when you want to see a potential sub plot be explored more. One big example is when Freddie signs a contract for a solo record deal. The most the movie shows of this is just him telling the band about it and how he wants a break, and that's about it. On the other side of the coin, some scenes can feel unnecessarily long, such as the scene where they are trying to sing high for the song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". This never happens enough to be a big deal, but it's a bit overdrawn at times. The other thing, while not necessarily a thing against the movie as a whole, is the inaccuracies. I know I said I'm not reviewing this film for accuracies, and that still holds true, but this is still something I wanna address. For those expecting a ""based on a true story"" kind of film, this movie does not really fall into that category. Sure, there a few things that are true, but about 80% of the events that happen in this film are false, and while, at first, that may sound like a bad thing, the thing you have to keep in mind is the probability of the actual events being good for film. I can fully understand that it may be disappointing to hardcore Queen fans that most of the true events aren't in this film, but if the events were changed to make the film flow better, then so be it. I enjoyed this film for what it is, and I think it is an excellent representation of Queen. After this film, I'm actually thinking about checking their stuff out. With that said, I do recommend this film to anyone out there who's a Queen fan, as well as anyone who wants a fun and musical biopic, as this delivers on both fronts and then some. With the right mindset, this film is an overall fun and very memorable biopic that'll live on as something truly special from 2018."

","With stellar performances from Rami Malek, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joe Mazzello as Queen, musical numbers galore and an electryfing recreation of the legendary Live Aid set that makes you feel like you're in the crowd at that moment, Bohemian Rhapsody is... pretty good... and that's kinda sad...
Don't get me wrong, I love it, I have been waiting for this movie for a while now, and it did not dissapoint me... that much. Oh, God, that sounds so negative. I really loved it, I did... it's just... it's not Queen...
For me, Queen isn't just another rock band, it's THE rock band. They were, as the film puts it, experimental. They were never afraid to try something new. Listening to their music, no two songs sound the same. They might have similar styles, but not one song is like another... and that is the fundamental problem of the movie.
Even with heavy involvment from Brian May and Roger Taylor, the film feels very formulaic, very stiff, only ever shining when it comes to the song portions of it all. Are they to blame for this? It's classic rockstar-biopic affair: dude is different, joins a band who are skeptical at first, but he wins them over with his talent, nobody gives them the time of day at first, but then they get big and, years later, the dude gets tired and decides to go solo ( because of some character who has a bad influence over him ), things go haywire and he discovers how much his band means to him, they reunite and , in the end, they give out one incredible last performance that may or may not be driven by a diagnostic or a loss of some kind. Sound familiar? But it shouldn't. Because, most of what I just described, does not fit in with the puzzle that is Freddie Mercury's story ( and Queen's, for that matter ), nor did it actually happen in real life... unfortunately... here you will find more fiction than facts. Not even the songs are in right order, most of the time...
Still, even though it leaves me wanting more (and not in a good way), I cannot get past how amazing the final part of the movie is, and how much it elevates it's status...
I love it, darling."

","While this was a great year for music films big and small -- from the affecting ""<a href=""/title/tt1517451/"">A Star Is Born (2018)</a>"" to the sweetly comfortable ""<a href=""/title/tt7158430/"">Hearts Beat Loud (2018)</a>"" to the darkly raunchy music industry satire ""<a href=""/title/tt5918734/"">Stadium Anthems (2018)</a>"" -- the box office behemoth that was ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" doesn't make that short list, and this despite having truly elite biographical material to mold from. It will always be a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Let's concede that Rami Malek was able to ape Freddie Mercury to the absolute letter -- in fact his performance is in some ways made greater by its standing as the uncontested greatest attribute within an otherwise very intentionally compromised story. Because ultimately, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is not a product reflective of Queen's gritty and hard-hitting era, but instead fully embraces today's high sheen, honesty-be-damned times. And it just didn't have to be that way. Even the film's bolder aspirations are squashed by unnecessary interference from awkward depictions of untruthful shortcuts designed to placate a mass audience. Take the oft-heralded recreation of the band's legendary set at LiveAid: Indeed, so much care is taken to get that right, including the admirably un-Hollywood risk of reproducing that performance in full. Yet their set isn't actually left to play out in its consuming glory as advertised; instead, it's shamelessly intercut with goofball images of a phone bank in which LiveAid organizer Bob Geldolf glumly looks over a group of customer service reps with phones that at one moment are silent, but within seconds of Queen's set begin ringing triumphantly en masse. The sad insinuation is made that no other acts were able to solicit phone calls until Queen went on, and that once they did, viewers readily interrupted their own consumptions of the performance to desperately make 1-800-calls in real-time (!). ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is filled with many such patronizing and irresponsible creative decisions.<br/><br/>Queen's trust and estate has surely bankrolled from ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as a film, and as a catalyst for sparking renewed interest in the band's catalog and continued live performances. But in terms of legacy, the choices here feel terribly thin and short-sighted. Here's hoping that at end-of-life, the members of Queen who outlasted Mercury won't be consumed by the existential regret of having documented their band's legitimate glory with this distorted and saccharine veneer of their well-earned lives. - (Was this review of use to you?

","Queen is the kind of band I could listen too for hours without getting tired of it. One of the most famous and greatest rock bands in history, with a legacy larger than life. The question is, how well can a movie really preserve and retell a story as grand as this? Turns out it can do it just fine.<br/><br/>From listening to reviews, they seem to be split into to parts: Hating it, or loving it. But I have fallen in between that space. The hatred and bad critisim against it I find hard to understand, as it really isn't all that bad, but neither can I comprehend why people have such love for this film. Rather, I beilieve, do they have an uncondicional love for Freddie and Queen, submitting them into loving it.<br/><br/>The first 15 or 20 minutes of this movie I found quite annoying and unnecessary. Yes, it shows the backstory of how queen was formed, but that's about it. It is a series of montages that puts queen on the world map, showing the members touring and signing contracts. But it could've just as easily been cut out of the movie, given that it provides little to none information. The montages continues further in the movie, and I am not a fan of them. I personally think montages are just a way when the writers are lazy and tries to put in as much information as possible. Neither do I think they were especially well made for this film.<br/><br/>Moreover, other problems I have with this film is it's editing, and I don't really understand the reason it won an Oscar for this. The editing at times feels interrupting and clumsy, and some scenes feel almost irrelevant and some cuts are more disrupting than purposful. Furthermore, this movie felt more as a movie about Freddy Mercury than one about Queen. Sure, he is the big star, but he keeps talking about the importance of the group, not excluding anyone. The other bandmembers feel unattended and forgotten. Their backstories fall out of the picture, as well as their respective traits making them feel like very bland and flat characters. I have nothing against Freddy, I just wished more attention had been paid to the other bandmembers, because they felt left out and almost not even necessary to the plot.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, lets not forget what this movie excells in, exactly what it should excel in, providing an entertaining experience for watchers as close to the feeling of attending an acutal Queen concert. Of course nothing will eveer compare to the real thing, but it was nice to see her Majesty back up on the stage again. And lets not forget the best thing which is Rami Malek's performance. He has done great research and captured the spirit of Freddy spot on.<br/><br/>While the story feels unprocessed, and the editing is somewhat off, it still manages to deliver a sometimes funny sometimes heartbraking event. But that is due to the good performances rather than good scriptwriting, and the emotional connection might just be because it is Queen, and not any other band we're watching. It is also their music that make this movie survive. Had it been another band, I'm not sure anyone would have been bothered to sit out the whole screening.<br/><br/>The songs of Queen as well as Rami's performance makes you forget about the mistakes, which is why this movie is enjoyable. This movie is not bad, but neither is it amazing. I wanted more from it.<br/><br/>When it comes together, this movie is entertaining, but mostly due to Malek's outstanding performance, and to the brilliant music Queen had already made. The film in itself, is okay at the best, needing some extra work. As to the question if it captures the story of queen: It does it well enough."

And that's why he deserves that we look critically at the flaws of a movie depicting his life.<br/><br/>It took a lot of liberties with the timeline. The songs' vocals were altered, too, for some reason. The editing and cinematography felt flat most of the time. Only the writing session of ""We will rock you"" and the Life Aid concert stood out as memorable scenes.<br/><br/>In fact framing the movie around that event was a very clever decision. However, it went on for too long, I would rather have watched a YouTube clip of the original performance during that time.<br/><br/>A positive aspect are the performances, most notably Malek's. It's pretty spot-on as far as I can judge. But the script they had to work with was not as ambitious as it should have been.

Directed by Bryan Singer/Dexter Fletcher and written by Anthony McCarten and Peter Morgan<br/><br/>
I have to play some catch up before I have some articles for 25 Years Later. I did not see as many of the best picture nominees as I would have liked to. I did see Black Panther, Vice and Green Book. Now we are adding Bohemian Rhapsody to that list. Now Green Book won the Best Picture Oscar and in my opinion, that was very undeserved. It is the lowest of the four pictures I've seen. Bohemian Rhapsody was the best of the four.<br/><br/>Let me explain what I mean. The movie at first came out like a Wikipedia article come to life. This is an issue that has plagued biopics for ages. But the movie then slows down and we start to understand Freddy Mercury more. We also get some pieces from the other band members. Not a lot of musical biopics about a band address the other band members much but this one does. It also acknowledges how interconnected they all truly were in the creation of the music. The music is very integral to everything. I know I'm stating an obvious point of a movie about Queen. I found this to be a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Rami Malek also won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Freddy Mercury. It took some getting used to at first. He seems to be having difficulty with his teeth and speaking but it starts to flow more naturally and eventually he disappears. His performance is one of strength and hurt. A lot is said by his body language. He puts his all into those performances and he becomes Freddy Mercury on that stage and for that I agree with the Academy's choice here.<br/><br/>This movie got me a few times but mainly through the awe of the character work in bits and the music has a special place as well. The runtime flies by and the recreation of the LiveAid concert is spectacular to watch. It alone makes the movie. I give this one a B. Check it out."

You see the rise and triumph of Freddie Mercury... but it would also have been good to experience the decline and his final moments. The film needed that to finish it beautifully, rather than just stopping at the Live Aid concert. Freddie went on to do so much more after this concert, and it should have been shown. It feels like there is a sequel in the planning.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie for Queen fans.

","Finally got to watch it. Man. It really was a great movie. But not for the conventional reasons. I think Rami Malek was brilliant at moments and completely over the top at other moments. I get that Freddie Mercury was an over-the-too person, but feel like Malek over did it to add the the flame that was Mercury. Not necessary. Then those other moments. Those moments where he was performing and looking into the camera and it was as though you were looking into his soul. You felt his anguish. You felt a sense of loneliness. The pressing need to make amends. This movie transports you back to the 1980's and you feel the sense of fear of the unknown. Knowing he had AIDS and how he died...there was a cloud hanging over the movie that reminded you of the day you heard Freddie Mercury died. And at that moment you realize why this movie (actor) was nominated for the Oscar. Not to be set aside the supporting cast members who played the band members...phenomenal. They felt like a family. They felt like the brothers Freddie was supposed to have so that he could be his authentic self. Those actors did extremely well. And in all this praise...I still only gave the movie a 7. The build up took too long for me. And it ended after the Live Aid concert. I would have liked to see how the band took Freddie's death. How they rallied for him in the end. Like families do. Nonetheless. Great movie."

"raypeterson73","9","0","0","21 February 2019"," Wanted to give this a 10 Best Film of 2018
","Reason why not a 10? Cause of the history of the director. Damn, it makes me mad cause it deserves every award, I've slogged through all the other nominations for best picture and this one stands above the rest by far. So I suppose this one wins all the awards except best director which could just as well go to Spike Lee regardless of all the nasty things he has said about people or things over the years. Cause at the end of the day he didn't do anything as wrong as what Synger has done. Spike Lee merely spoke his mind, free speech, he didn't abuse any teenagers. Mercury deserves better, he deserves this telling, it was very well done. One could almost say Bryan redeems himself here, but that would really not be fair to those boys now would it? Would it be fair to Freddie either? Freddie seemed to want to clean himself up too, but it was too late sadly for him. Such a sad epic and heroic tale of a sad but incredible angelic like figure, we as a society love this stuff, it's truly the stuff of legends. Sure he was degenerate, but everyone has flaws in God's eyes. Nobody is perfect. Another modern day greek tragedy planted on the screen as legend for all of time. Mercury truly was the best performer in the best place at the right time and one could say blessed with the gift that mere mortals tell of in tales of heroism. Maybe like Robert Redford in The Natural....he was the best that ever was. This movie will have you crying your eyes out by the time it reaches the very fast end. To think you could tell this story in a mere two hours was a challenge that seemed more than impossible, this movie fulfills all it's promises and truly shows Freddie as the best that ever was without whitewashing his behavior towards others. A honest take and a more than thrilling story and movie. They simply don't make artists like they used to and they will never make another quite as great as Freddie."
"amanica-00792","4","0","0","20 February 2019"," A forgettable movie
","It wasn't what it should've been. The facts weren't accurate. And you can't do a PG13 movie about Freddie Mercury.. it needs to be R rated. It should've been more explicit. They barely smoked and there's very little sex in the movie. His whole life was based on the rock'n'roll lifestyle. Which wasn't very well portrayed in the film. His main romantic interest in the movie is Mary Austin which, again, isn't very accurate. His relationship with Jim Hutton was barely covered. The concerts scenes were too long. Don't get me wrong, I understand the movie is a tribute to Queen and that the performances were vital to the story, but they were the main focus of the movie. If I wanted to see Freddie perform, I could've watched the real him on youtube. I wanted to see his life. To feel his life. The movie showed only the surface of Freddie's existence. Because of that, I don't think people will remember this movie. Ultimately it's the director's fault for making it this way, not the actors. Each actor's performance was great. Rami Malek, Gwilym Lee, Lucy Boynton and Ben Hardy were phenomenal in it. They all looked like the real members. BUT it's a forgettable, inaccurate movie. It felt very amateur."

People might think it's because he looks like Freddie, sings like Freddie or even talks like Freddie -but it's none of those - it's because he acts this part with so much feeling you begin to think he is Freddie.

The storytelling was pretty good, although there was never any suspense or really sensitive moments, not even concerning Freddie's diagnosis.<br/><br/>What I missed was first of all a more in-depth view of the initial struggle before the band broke through into stardom. After Freddie met the other guys and made one gig, the story leaps past all that and suddenly they are wanted by EMI. I also thought it was a pity that the movie ended right after the Live Aid show, so we never got to see Freddie succumb to his illness.

"cheeky_wee_monkey","Null","0","0","22 January 2019"," An enjoyable watch, but at what price the truth?
","This is my first review for IMDB, which is a website I use a lot, but I've never bothered to create an account as I don't bother much with writing reviews and such, however as I watched Bohemian Rhapsody two days ago now, and I've found myself in a bad mood since then, I felt the need to register and voice my opinion, so here goes with my tuppence worth:<br/><br/>Firstly, purely as a movie I enjoyed this film - Rami Malek made a first class Freddie, he got the master's mannerisms down to a tee, really a superb performance. The guy who played Bryan May I thought was good, too, as is a lot of the movie - it's a good watch, if it was just a fictionalised movie - but it's not, it's as close to an official movie biography as ever there will be, not only endorsed by, but produced by Bryan May and Roger Taylor - two of the still living three members of the band who - out of everyone else on the whole planet - are clearly best placed to tell this tale. That's where this movie fails, and it fails miserably.
So much of this movie is fictionalised - SO much of it - that any viewer who is actually interested in the true story of a man who was indisputably one of greatest musicians of the 20th. century has to take what they see in this film with a pinch of salt. Now, I understand that in terms of making a film - the time constraints of fitting someone's life story into a couple of hours of celluloid creates limitations, important points have to be skipped, other points maybe have to be condensed or re-arranged in a manner which still allows for an emotional experience for the audience - sure, I understand that, but what I absolutely fail to understand with this movie is why the truth of certain aspects of the man's life - aspects which meant a lot to and had an effect on many, many other people's lives have been so blatantly re-arranged in this movie.
What do I mean? Well, rather than getting OCD and writing a ten page essay on this (this movie really did annoy me), perhaps if I could just illustrate two major examples here: In the movie it shows Freddie as being somewhat disillusioned with his life in the band, saying to the other members he wants a break from his band life before he relocates to Munich to record a solo LP which doesn't work out for him in the way he would have wanted, then there's the run up to the Live Aid concert going on in the background (That 20 minute performance of Queen perhaps being amongst the best recorded performance of any live musical act ever), and the movie uses this as the crescendo to which it builds up to. So, you see Freddie coming in the the record company to meet the other band members who according to the movie he's not even spoken with for a period of perhaps years (the movie doesn't specify much of a time line at this part), and they're not happy with him because of his past decision to take a break, and at this meeting they decide to get back together and do the Live Aid gig - this is absolute nonsense, The true history is that Live Aid took place on the 13th. of July 1985, and Queen as a band finished the last date of a tour promoting their album The Works on the 15h of May that same year and they had been touring on and off since September the previous year - so those checkable facts in mind, I can find absolutely no reason why that episode in the bands history would need to be fictionalised to such an extent to suit the medium of film. What super-dooper annoys me, however, is when in the time line of the movie they have Freddie confiding to his other band members that not only has he contracted HIV, but essentially he's dying. In the movie they show this super-sensitive event as having taken place during the band's rehearsals for Live Aid, but - as far a my understanding of this matter goes - and I'm only going by what I've read, you'll have to ask Bryan, Roger or John to confirm this one - this didn't actually happen until 1989. Sorry, can you give me a minute to get a cigarette, I'm annoyed... back in a moment ...( back again ... inhale, puff! - this one's for you, Freddie.) Right, then, see when people say that they can remember where they were when they heard that JFK got shot, well I wasn't born then, but for my generation, a similar thing might be said about the attack on the World Trade Centre, and although, technically such an event as one man's passing pales into insignificance with such a world changing event that caused the deaths of so many people, I can remember with detail where I was when I heard that Freddie Mercury had died. I went to visit my girlfriend at her flat and she was crying, ""What's wrong?"" I asked her, ""Freddie's dead,"" she replied. I remember laughing in a consoling sense at first, maybe even a bit condescending now I look back at it, as if to say ""it's alright, he's someone we never knew,"" but then we spoke about it, and I thought about it more myself and then we sat down and cried a bit together. It was actually a monumental event in my life, and to so many other people, not only was this showman par exellence no longer with us, but it was the first time that this disease had taken the life of someone who, through their music and seeing them on TV I had grown up with - sure, I was aware of Rock Hudson's passing, but with respect to the memory of Mr. Hudson, he was just a name to me, Freddie Mercury, well, he was Freddie Mercury, there has been and there will be no other, and that event brought so much publicity to the dangers of the HIV virus on a global scale, and I can say for a fact that it affected me personally as a young man in taking cautions in my adult relations. In short, some aspects of the fictionalisation which takes place in this movie may be forgiven in terms of the considerations of making a successful movie - but this fact, for many reasons, in no way shape or form should it have been altered.<br/><br/>Reading the current details about this movie, it was clearly financially successful, having a budget of between $40-50M , it currently shows to have grossed nearly 3/4 of a billion dollars worldwide - a testament perhaps not to the movie itself, but to the enduring popularity of Professor Mercury, but being financially successful is just one thing, at what price do you value the truth?<br/><br/>To conclude, Professor May - you're a gentleman and a scholar and I love your music, Roger you're a top-swordsman and a top drummer, but if ever I meet either of you in real life, after the initial formalities of saying hello have taken place, you are without doubt going to find yourself on the receiving end of my thoughts concerning this travesty of a biopic that you produced, and why? Why is this movie important enough to actually feel genuinely annoyed about? Because this movie will shape the thoughts of how the majority of people view the life of Freddie Mercury. Not so many people read books these days, and the books that are written, particularly biographies of famous people are often written by fans who sensationalise the details and look at the facts not impartially but from their own perspective, or they're written to make money, cash in on the death of a celebrity, and if that was the case here, then this movie could sort of ( and I stress ""sort of"") be forgiven for some of it's inaccuracies, but the fact that it's produced by two of only three people in the world who could tell the true tale of Freddie's life (as they knew it) and yet they green-lighted an alteration of the true tale to the extent that this movie demonstrates. Nope. Utterly Unacceptable.<br/><br/>Saying that, if you're at a loose end on movie night then it's a good watch, just don't go taking any notes to quote to the Queen fan club later."

Otherwise they would not have been able to match up the lip-syncing so well.

","This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.
Ok so they might have skewed the timeline on certain events to suit the movie, but in the end who cares. It wasn't a documentary, it was a film. Most who would have seen the film know all about Queen and also Freddy Mercury and what happened in his life, this was more a celebration of that a charismatic and talented person he was.
Rami Malek I'd not seen much of before, but his portrayal of the greatest front man of all time in Freddy was seriously fantastic. Totally did it justice.
The movie is all about apexing to Queen's performance at Live Aid to close the film, a 20 minute scene which they absolutely nailed.
The guys who played the rest of the band were fantasic, especially Gwilym Lee, who played Brian May, he was the spitting image of Brian.
All in all, if you want another dour documentary which focuses too much on Freddy's aids battle, this ain't for you. If you want a film which celebrates the genius that was Freddy Mercury and Queen, have a good sing along and walk out with tears of joy, watch this film.

","I don't know a lot of people who haven't heard of the ""Queen"" and know even less who don't like them, so I was not surprised when the theatres, which usually have tons of vacant places, were besieged by the horde of overly eager lovers of cinema. And it really means a lot.<br/><br/>Many talks of the film being just another biopic were trying to cool down the hype, however, just from the first minutes of the movie I could feel the drive and the fast pace that has helped to put the juiciest bits into 2 hours of quality reel. I cannot debate on whether all or even anything was true there but I am definitely sure that after watching it my love to the ""Queen"" grew even bigger.<br/><br/>All the actors were brilliant. Before going to the best part I would like to say that my jaw dropped when I've learnt that Ray Foster was played by Mike Myers. Anyhow, the band was depicted unbelievably good and the cherry on the top of the pie was Rami Malek. Of course, the teeth and the mustache were bigger, but a good resemblance in my opinion can be only achieved by spoofing the target, which was done so perfectly that the real Freddie in the end was looking fake.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that the outcome was even better than I've expected after the first peek at the trailer, and I was expecting a lot."

"eduardo_fernandes_17","7","0","0","12 November 2018"," It's a good movie, I was afraid it would be much worse, but it could have been a lot better...
","The film as a whole is very superficial and ""happy"", there is no real sense of adversity at any time. It changes a lot of things from reality too, namely Freddie's relationship with Mary (whom he left the mansion and much of his fortune) and with that ""pseudo manager"" Paul, that ""misleads"" him.
The movie is very episodic and jumps from one event to another without a solid thread, it seems like a kind of medley in which you're listening to a great song and then suddenly it is already another.
The creation of the different iconic songs is not explored in depth, most of them are just referenced to. At one point we hear Under Pressure but David Bowie is not even mentioned in the movie... They speak of the Killer Queen which was the hit that made them famous but we never see them playing/singing the song let alone creating it.
But for me the worst of the movie is the option to end in Live Aid and not on Freddie's death, yes it was probably the band's top moment but they did so many extraordinary things after Live Aid and before Freddie died. Especially the Highlander soundtrack in which includes Who Wants to Live Forever or the fact that the album Made in Heaven was released immediately after Freddie's death and he recorded it precisely for that purpose.
The Queen also played God Save the Queen on the Queen's birthday for years on end and in the movie they never even meet her.
Then there is the question of Freddie's sexuality and extravagance that is very diluted by making only a very light allusion to it, for example there are drugs at parties but there are no people doing drugs.
As for the actors, the performances are all good and the band members are identical. (Brian May's actor has to be a clone!!) Rami Malek does an extraordinary role (never Oscar worthy as some claim, but very good) and is the best part of the movie, following the songs of course.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, I was afraid it would be much worse, but it could have been a lot better, too."
"blazhrovat","7","0","0","12 November 2018"," Really good!
","The movie is definitely a must see for queen fans who want to know a little bit about the background of the band, and of course for those who come looking for nostalgia.<br/><br/>The good: Rami Malek does a fantastic acting job, I think he portrayed Freddie extremely well, the music is (obviously) great and Marc Martel (I can tell they used him for the movie) also did a great job imitating Freddie. The movie is really entertaining to watch, it does not feel like a 2hour+ film. I liked that they included lesser known things like Freddie's obsession with his cats and also their way of handling the whole aids thing was very well put together. It had emotional impact and that part of the film depicting his struggle was in my opinion the best part of the entire thing.<br/><br/>The bad: well for one, you can always tell where they used a green screen, idk if it was a budget issue but some shots were really awkward, especially at the live aid scene. The movie focuses too much on the love side of things and even gets some things wrong for the sake of hollywood storytelling, which is dead obvious. I wished they'd show more of his struggle toward the end of his days instead of doing this massive timeskip at the end. I guess here it's just that they went for an entertaining movie, not a documentary, but still, when the ending credits came in I immediately went ""wait they're ending here? This is like...half the story"". The struggle with being gay in the 70s is not explored at all, they made it seem like even freddie didn't know what he wanted, the movie also avoids a lot of complexity for the sake of making a simple, entertaining movie, but I guess that is also just because of the film's purpose.<br/><br/>All in all, I know a lot of background on queen and for me, the movie was lackluster in a few aspects, I would've preferred a more documentary approach, but since it's a movie that's just meant to be a lighthearted celebration of a legend, it does it's job very well and fulfills its purpose. For nostalgic and entertainment purposes, this movie delivers perfectly. Go see it either way, it's really enjoyable, but for those who are more....hardcore fans, you'll probably rate the movie around the same as I did. It's amazing for what it is, but in terms of biopics, the hollywood generic-ness just...waters it down and it's just maybe...above average."
"BellaMae96","9","0","0","12 November 2018"," A must-see film
","Such a captivating and moving film in which Queen's music isn't the only thing magical.<br/><br/>The film truly captures the tortured genius of Freddie Mercury. His aspirations, artistry, fears and loneliness are portrayed beautifully by Rami Malek.
In response to reviewers criticising the lack of content of Freddie Mercury's sexual lifestyle - saying it makes it feel less believable - that's absolute nonsense. The film addresses his homosexuality in a more subtle and respective manner. Therefore, it wasn't really omitted and we glimpse him battling his personal demons during his romantic relationship with Mary.<br/><br/>There were so many goosebumps moments and the most notable was the Queen set during the Live Aid concert. Malek's ability to perfect Freddie's mannerisms and body movements was great to watch. That final 20-30mins of the had some heart wrenching moments and that kiss he blew to his mother left me in pieces.<br/><br/>The one criticism I do have is there is a slight sense of unfulfillment. The main issue is that it never really appears to be about Queen. I would've preferred to have seen the true story of how the band got together and even the upbringings of each individual band member. I also think it should've been set out more like either ""Ray"" or ""What's love got to do with it""."

Either they happened earlier or later or, some will say, not at all. But this is always true for bio-pics. We get an explanation of how Queen was formed. Exactly true? No, the truth is way too complicated for a movie. We learn about Freddie's background, his family, especially his father.<br/><br/>Saying Freddie had AIDS should not be a spoiler.

We care about the music.<br/><br/>There is a lot more to know about Queen and Freddie Mercury, but this is a darn good introduction and more honest than most movie bio-pics."

"pbbeara","7","0","0","10 November 2018"," Rami Malek and cast give legendary performance as a legendary band
","I went and saw this movie with my mom yesterday. I grew up listening to Queen, seeing as both my parents are huge fans. Throughout the movie, my mom kept whispering to me, ""These actors look so much like the real people,"" and ""Rami Malek becomes Freddy Mercury."" She and I were both very impressed with the performances given by the main cast, this is casting done right! Not only did the actors all look like their real life counterparts, they really nailed the personalities and mannerisms of said counterparts. I might not have been around during Queen's glory days, and Freddy Mercury had already passed away before I was born, but Queen is one of my favorite bands and as a singer myself, Freddy Mercury is one of my idols. I always research my favorite bands, that includes Queen. And the only reason why I didn't give this film a 10 out of 10 rating is because of the many historical inaccuracies. The timeline was all jumbled up, and there were a lot of things that weren't brought up in the film at all that should of been, (one example would be Queen's collaboration with David Bowie to create the legendary song Under Pressure, not to mention the fact that Freddy's friendship with Bowie went back all the way to the 60s). An example of a historical inaccuracy in this film, is that it leads the viewer to think that Freddy Mercury found out he had aids in 1985, it even has a scene where he tells the band that he is HIV positive during rehearsals for Live Aid, in real life it's believed Mercury wasn't aware he was HIV positive until about 1987, and he didn't really tell anyone until it got to a point where he couldn't explain away his condition or hide his symptoms anymore. I absolutely loved this film, aside from the inaccuracies, I feel that this film was incredibly successful. The performances by the cast are what made this film so successful in my opinion, especially Rami Malek, whom definitely deserves an oscar nomination for his portrayal of Mercury."
"MarianaPinto24","8","0","0","10 November 2018"," EXTRAORDINARILY NICE!
","I don't even know where to start...Well, maybe from the beginning. I remember being a little girl and listening to this CDs my parents seemed to like very much and without even realizing it I fell in love with Queen's songs at a very young age...
I love and admire Freddie Mercury and the band and I was so excited about this movie that I was already expecting it to disappoint me, but not at all! How could it be possible with such a tremendous soundtrack, right? Despite the fact I personally shiver with all of them, everybody loves at least one of the Queen's masterpieces because they are so versatile. I think they cover a lot of genres and somehow create their own, that's why they're so ""universal"". It's unbelievable how every songs they created are so great and powerful, especially the ones written by Mercury, he's a genius! If I could only listen to one single band for the rest of my life it would certainly be Queen and if I had to choose one music to play on repeat forever It would probably be ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".
And now about the movie:
The special 21st Century Fox intro is enough to understand that the next 130 minutes will be worth it. In my opinion the cast and the whole team did a great job recreating these legends that will LIVE FOREVER in our hearts!
Of course they didn't tell us everything about Freddie Mercury, that would take a lot more than 2 hours. This movie is NOT a documentary, can anybody find critics some biographical movie to love? ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" tell us Fred's impressive life story, crossing of course the amazing path of Queen, and yes, it has some mistakes, but I believe the major goal is to keep you entertained and you will be! Although I did truly enjoy the final part more, all the scenes have something special and will catch your attention.
Be prepared to get a little, if not a lot, emotional at the incredible part when Mercury finds out he has AIDS. No spoiler alert needed, because if you know a little bit about his story you already knew this ""King"" died because of this virus. However, this scene is so well done and thought that it will be as touching as if you were finding out for the first time!
I'm sure I will watch this again, maybe even more than once, and probably make my children watch it with me in honor of their grandparents and as my personal tribute to Queen.
In fact, the reason why I don't give it a 9 is because the merit for the lyrics and songs goes to the band, and that's what make the movie so good and I also believe they could do even better with the HUGE inspiration that Queen's story is!"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","8","0","0","5 November 2018"," Good reflection of one of British-pop's greatest icons.
","This is a good take on Freddie Mercury's life as the leading man of Queen. It's a good bio-pic that's accompanied by some truly classic songs that millions of people have come to know and love deep in their soul. This movie has had it fair share of problems relating to Bryan Singer's coming-and-going from the project and the whole dilemma of trying to preserve Freddie's legacy as one of rock's greatest icons that ever lived to bless the world with such talent. This film is a showcase of Queen's legacy as a band and Freddie's one as one of pop's pioneering LGBT musicians.<br/><br/>This film is like 'The Greatest Showman' in that it serves to be a modern reminder that cinema can be all about self-contained entertainment that honors history and shows how the past parallels with the present in many respects; and I prefer Bohemian Rhapsody to 'Showman' personally. This is about one of my favourite bands of all time and the film's more a character study into how Freddie's flamboyant nature changed the lives of Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a rock-solid film that deserves to be seen at the movies; by any and all ardent Queen fans out there."

","Review - Bohemian Rhapsody (big Queen fan here).<br/><br/>A chronicle of the life and times of Queen and in particular Freddy Mercury.<br/><br/>First of all Rami Malek is outstanding and amazing in the lead role. Sure to be nominated for an Oscar and in with a huge show. Not only does he look like him, he delivers an emotionally powerful performance. The other members of the band are very well played and it feels like Queen.<br/><br/>The film covers formation in the early 70s right up until Live Aid in 1985.<br/><br/>There are moments of lighthearted laughter and comedy to heartache as we cruise through time knowing where it leads eventually.<br/><br/>If I was to criticize any area it would be that it skirts around the edges of Freddy's personal life without going to the depths it could but that may be due to Freddy's private nature or the director wanted to keep up the entertainment value.<br/><br/>The original music is intertwined flawlessly into the films cinematography and it truly captures the imagination of Queen.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is loads of fun, the music is obviously fantastic but tempered with some sadness at a life lost from Aids too young. As far as performers go there are not too many better than Freddy!! I wonder what he would have done had he lived past 45?<br/><br/>Loved every minute even the 150 minute running time. Don't let that stop you.<br/><br/>Last 20 minutes is incredible as we get to see the Live Aid concert and how amazing the performance is even though Freddy is very ill. You don't see many cinema crowds applaude but it happened after this scene!!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>A must see!!"
"shibolleth","9","0","0","5 November 2018"," Not perfect, but still good ...
","Well, the film certainly isn't perfect. Of course, there was poetic licence (yes, especially when it comes to the chronology) in the film and the surviving members of the band probably did influence the story but, still, everything important about Freddy is in there, maybe not in right measure, but still all right. Sugar coated? Not really sure, there are dark tones, they just don't prevail. Heterosexual relation overshadows homosexual one? Nope, everything is clearly stated in the film. Of course, somebody believes that Freddy's transgressions would make better film. Why? I mean, if there are some transgressions that could have been ascribed to him, he made them a mainstream affair and less transgressive. After seeing video for 'I want to break free' I myself thought in 1980s that homosexuality has finally gone mainstream. No big deal about it, it's not 1950s. And now, few decades later somebody needs to see something provocative about Freddy in the film that is mostly celebrating him? Freddy's homosexuality and queerness has been shown to the audience of 21st century as a mainstream affair, something what those things mostly are nowadays. And, as for Sacha Baron Cohen, I think he would be good Freddy too. But I don't see how being better than Malek would be the real thing here. Baron's (hypothetical) portrayal would only be different and probably worthy of attention in its own terms. Just like Malek's is. I hope we'll get that one too someday ..."

","Bohemian Rhapsody: You don't have to be a Queen fan to appreciate this warts and all memoir of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek in a storming performance) and Queen (covering the period 1970 to 1985). Bookended by the 1985 Live aid Concert we see how throughout his life Freddie had to deal with taunts of Paki from his days as a baggage handler at Heathrow to his first appearance with Queen to the tale telling by his sacked personal manager Paul Prenter (played by the aptly named Allen Leech). The development of Queen's unique musical style is well captured and how a move away from it caused fractures within the band. While Mercury was the showman, the roles played by May (Gwilym Lee), Taylor (Ben Hardy) and especially the non-flamboyant Deacon (John Mazzello) in the writing and arranging of their songs is outlined in amusing sequences, very much synergy at play.<br/><br/>Mercury's relationship with Mary Austin ( Lucy Boynton) is central to the film, even though they ceased to be a couple after Freddie explored his bisexual nature and took male partners, their friendship continued until his death. With fame came the vampiric hangers-on and chief among these was Prenter. How all of this led to the temporary break up of Queen is in the film. But the Music! Oh the Music! See and hear how Bohemian Rhapsody was put together along with other Queen classics. The film ends with a re-enactment of Queen's twenty minute set at Live Aid.<br/><br/>This wonderful musical biopic is brought to us with Bryan Singer at the helm as Director but the efforts of Writer Anthony McCarten, Cinematographer Newton Sigel and Editor John Ottman are crucial to it's success. 9/10."

Fans have reviewed far better, and it's no surprise to see it doing so well on IMDb and box offices worldwide.<br/><br/>Rami Malek is, quite simply, phenomenal. He fully commits to the role and, although it's not actually him doing all the singing, he certainly makes us believe he is. Such a physical performance. Bad year for Bradley Cooper - he's got one hell of a competitor for the Best Actor Oscar next year.<br/><br/>I've no idea just how accurate this was.

","If you want a critics opinion on this film, wait for Christ Stuckmann to post his, as he surely will. Or watch Jeremy Jahns' vid on this movie, who has apx the same level skills, though I put Stuckmann a tsd higher up there.<br/><br/>I mention this because I think most of the critics who watched this are retards who are never happy. They wanted this film to ""expose"" Mercury, but the truth is he was really private and the filmmakers respect this, but it isn't hollow as some say, Rami Malek IS Mercury in this film, and truly shines. He shows enough depth, emotion and flamboyance to sell himself as Mercury. Same for Gwilym Lee, who is frighteningly similar to Brian May. The rest of the cast is fine, but many are truly wasted, especially John Deacon, who in reality was ""the secret weapon"" for queen, and made some of their biggest hits. He has one scene where he has some importance, but nothing else. I understand that since May and Taylor were some heavy influencers for this movie, so I advice them to grow a pair and respect Deacon, as well if there is a reboot for this movie in the future, as there is with everything these days. ( I'm joking)<br/><br/>
But, back to Malek, as he is m a g n i f i c a n t as he lip synchs, sings and acts like Mercury, especially during the amazing beat-per-beat recreation of Live Aid. I got Soo much chills watching this. And his is definitely the strongest part of this movie, and deserves every award he can get. His true performance and the musical recreations of their music, elevates this to one of the better movies of the year I have seen, followed by MI Fallout and the traumatizing Hereditary. Go watch it, as it will mostly satisfy you, except if you want a tad more character depth or a better John Deacon, then you'll probably leave a little dissatisfied<br/><br/>But I have one gripe surrounding this movie, and it isn't the movie. Its that people hate it for ""straight-washing"" Freddie, which I say f**k off to those. I mean, sure, it's a part of what made him famous and important, but it wasn't HIM alone, which is what people seem to think. He had a genuine relationship with Mary, and it was the true one he had in his life. I don't mean to offend LGBTQ people here, and if I did, I understand why you would be, but Mercury and you are more than your sexuality, and this movie showed this. It shouldnt be a reason to judge a person or a film, for that matter, so please don't consider those proper criticism but rather whiny children who are never happy.
Thank you."

While many key points were covered, and obviously not all points it moved so fast, at times I lost track.<br/><br/>Giving credit where credit is due , with a late replacement of the director and having to do post production, Dexter Fletcher pulled together a solid film.

I have the privilege to say that I was at Live Aid and the scenes and music are flawless. It was surreal sitting there almost reliving the experience of Queen from the stage looking down, I was looking for myself!! I was broken at the end tho and it took a full 10 minutes before I could get up and leave the cinema. All of the actors portrayed the legends that are Queen so exactly that, as others have said I forgot it wasn't them. The only thing that was bitter sweet was the scene where Freddie tells the boys he has Aids. This didn't happen for another two years but I suppose they had to mark his illness in some way an then finish with Live Aid. Brilliant film, but I will have to leave it a while before I watch it again, my heart can't take it. Made me realise how much the world misses our Freddie... our King of Misfits. ðŸ’”ðŸ’”"

There were a few plot devices repeated which irked me but nothing that broke the experience. The story of Freddie Mercury is an interesting one. The movie is shot well and the acting from Rami Malek is unbelievable. He plays a very convincing lead role. The rest of the cast was outshined in my eyes by Malek's performance but it didn't wear on the movie for me. I saw this in Dolby Digital Premium Format. This is the best way to see the movie (or IMAX, pending your preference). This film deserves to be seen in a premium audio format.

This one was different, probably because Queen were a large part of my growing up, and his death was untimely, and shocking. I watched, having heard how good Rami Maleks performance was, but i was also happily amazed at the visual and vocal similarity of Brian Mays portrayal.
The film touched upon freddies Shenanigans, and it didnt need to dwell on them. The flamboyant parties, the drugs, the sexual references were all there, and it didnt need to make a large issue out of them. Just seeing them in passing was enough to understand.

Its just like a roller coaster. It starts with buildup and it gets released in a magnificent way then it ends on a sad note. The roller coaster has ended but you think back on how good that roller coaster was. Bohemian Rhapsody is absolutely brilliant despite the uncomfortable gay parts. it will go down in history as again, one of the greatest films ever produced and directed."
"lawrencekaneshiro","4","3","9","14 March 2019"," What's all the Hoopla About?
","Bohemian Rhapsody, just another formula movie. Yes, this film is a telling of a historical character, Freddie Mercury and the rock band Queen. Of the two musical type movies (Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star is Born) nominated for this year's Oscars, my vote would have gone to A Star is Born. Not that BR is a bad film, it is not. It's just that the musical performances by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in A Star is Born were originally performed by the actors.<br/><br/>I grew up in the Queen era and it was nice to hear all this ""old time"" rock and roll music again. Queen's compositions were very innovative and ahead of their time. Not a lot was known about Freddie Mercury and Queen. Yes, there were rumors and news stories in tabloids floated around. In the years before the Internet and social media rumors were just that, rumors. But in today's world, if it's not on Facebook or Instagram, it's not true.<br/><br/>Nothing against Mr. Melik. He is a fine actor and I can imagine the difficulty in playing such a demanding role. Not to say that Mr. Melik is not deserving of his Best Actor Oscar, I feel that Christian Bale's performance in ""Vice"" was just as complex and demanding. Both roles are based on iconic figures from history. And both actors did a convincing job.<br/><br/>Now the movie. As previously mentioned, the music was right on. It was difficult to tell if the soundtrack was re-dubbed by new artists or the original music from Queen. Although Melik did some of his own vocals, a lot of the concert vocals were dubbed by a new unknown artist. I am certain his name will be well known by now.<br/><br/>In the end, if you are looking to see all eight nominated films, by all means, watch BR along with Best Picture ""Green Book"". For me, it would be a tie between ""Vice"" and ""Black Panther"", then ""Green Book"" ""A Star is Born"" ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ""BlackkKlansman"" and ""Roma"". As for ""The Favourite"" it is really not my cup of tea."

","This movie really is highly overrated. The film is very slow, dialogues are implausible and boring, the characters remain caricatural (except for May and Beach), the camera work is simple and unimaginative and the direction is weak and uninspiring. But yes, the music, the music of Queen is of course great. But yes, the music, the music of Queen, we knew that already. The music of Queen is the only good thing, and the music and the music alone deserves a 10. But it would be unpalatable if this film won any Oscar."

"davidgreifer","8","3","9","29 November 2018"," So so
","It seems that Rami Malek did a good job. However, he spoke a little funny around the teeth that he wore in the movie. He is not a good look alike for Freddy. Freddy was very handsome. Malek is not. I was disappointed to learn that he lip synced the vocals. In comparing Bohemian Rhapsody to the movie Ray, Jamie Foxx actually played the piano and sang. He did get piano lessons from Ray Charles and that helped. Rami did not have that opportunity or he might have done a better job. The film was a short but good attempt at depicting a tragic life. It glanced over Freddy's love affairs with a glib approach that had a fatal ending. It showed Freddy at home but not his entertaining his ""guests"". Good attempt but it does fall short of its potential."

Malek has nothing to do with portraying one of the greatest figures in the history of rock and roll. Freddy was not always behaving like a spoiled girl. He could look, act and speak also manly, an aspect that Malek fails to show. There were better documentaries made more than 20 years ago far better than this movie.

God only knows how that happened. Anyway, don't get me wrong, it's a good film. It's definitely entertaining but my problem is I sometimes ask myself, would it be just as good without the incredible music? Probably not. It follows all the music biopic tropes bit by bit. The star starts off humble and likeable, but slowly turns to drugs and alcohol, he has a wee outburst and his friends stop liking him. Then he redeems himself and has a nice time.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is just how safe it is. Freddie was a sex, drug and alcohol addict, and we get one F word?! What?! This guy was the edgiest man going, back then. I also found there to be no emotional depth. They try to make you feel sad for Freddie when he goes off on his solo career and the rest of the band dislike him for it. But when you remember that in the real word that both Brian May and Roger Taylor released solo albums before Freddie, it takes away all emotional meaning.<br/><br/>This feels just like another biopic that features queen music.<br/><br/>It's a watchable film and you'll get a fair amount of enjoyment out of it, but after seeing a biopic done right in Rocketman, I dont see myself going back to this one any time soon"

Go watch Freddy Mercury interviews. He doesn't look nor sound anything like him. Mercury occasionally cover his upper teeth with his upper lips when he talks. Malek didn't even reproduce this obvious habit. Malek was just being Malek. And people were talking about how amazing that they got correct number of cups on top of piano at Live Aid.

Not a bad movie, it was indeed a good experience (Queen's songs can certainly improve the quality of almost everything).
At any part of the movie i felt connected with the events, seems like it lacks emotion and conviction, and all major plots are solved too fast (A plot can be solved in seconds and yet be believable, but is not the case).
Brian, Deacon and Roger really convinces on screen, Mary was great, but Freddie not, althought Malek doing a good job (the script and direction really can trap some actings).

I realize that it was probably true, but why did they have to show Freddie talking on a public pay phone making eye contact with a truck driver going into a public restroom in slow motion? To emphasis his homosexual nature? Ok, I get it, but I didn't need to see that. Or asking his girlfriend to move next door and turn the light on when she was there to show she was thinking of him? Weird, but not much of a story line. Or showing his many cats in the house all the time? Freddie's overly flamboyant attitude? Freddie's lackluster appreciation of the producer, who was great, but portrayed in the movie as an asshole. Where was Brian May playing great guitar and the fabulous Roger Taylor who sang a lot of the high parts? I would have rather seen concert footage of the real band.

I should be honest that i was a bit disappointed. As a fan i have read everything about the band and been a part of the journey, but ( no spoilers) they kind of twist the truth to make it more dramatic. That works fine for me for some historic novels/epics, games made into movies etc. etc., but for a legend that lived in the times that we did, to touch the history leaves you disappointed.<br/><br/>Acting was good, but i would say not Oscar worthy. Rami malik does a good job playing Queen but more than anything it was just him probably just showing off how uncanny the resemblance is.

","I don't waste my time with critics and that's why I watch movie without being influenced and without any expectations. But there is such a hype about this movie that I am afraid my expectations might have been to high. What I saw was a superficial movie about a man we all got to know by attending live concerts, watching documentaries about and with him, listening to his music, reading books and stories about him etc etc. But I missed him in this movie. I never saw him anywhere. I am sorry but it is NOT enough to have a similar haircut as he had or a similar moustache. And it is certainly NOT enough to put those horrible teeth in one actors mouth. One can see that Rami Malek doesn't feel comfortable with these enormous things in his mouth. He looked like a beaver. Yes, Freddie had big teeth but to him it was a part of him, for Rami it obviously was like an alien eliment in his mouth. The only moments when I spotted Freddie here and then were the scenes on stage, especially the last bit on Live Aid. I loved that they showed the deep love, care and loyality of Freddie and Mary. And that we saw a bit of his relationship with Jim Hutton. But I don't remember any mentioning of Peter Straker. His obessive time in Munich was a little sideswipe in the movie but was the time when he outlived his sexuality to the fullest. The movie is full of the outstanding music of Queen and I enjoyed that but sorry: I can listen to their music whenever I want and don't need to go to the cinema for that. This movie entertaines 80% with the music of Queen. The rest is devoted to Freddie, his band colleagues, his family, his friends, his lovers, his outcoming - everything. And I think this is way too few. Also the last years when he worked and worked and wrote songs like ""who wants to live forever"" and ""the show must go on"" which were a testament, a statement, a message - no mentioning of it. Huge gap of his life. How disappointing. But then it is all about expecations. I thought this movie was devoted to Freddies life but instead it is like a ongoing concert with the greatest hits and bits and bites of his life inbetween. If someone is interested in his life, I'd highly recommend on the many documentaries coz there you'll see more of him and his spirit. Rami Malek tried but Freddie was too unique, too special with too big shoes for him to fill. Long story short: watch a documentary, watch the interviews on youtube, listen to Freddie and what he had to say and listen to his music. This music doesn't dignify his legacy."

","I'm probably swimming against the stream, but I felt this was an average movie; and this is coming from a big Queen fan. I've seen better performances from several other biographical movies in the past that portrayed the life of a music star. One quick example is ""The Doors "", about the life of Jim Morrison. Another is ""Sid and Nancy"" , about the life of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols. I did enjoy all the musical performances, but I was not blown away by the individual actors, with exception of the one playing Freddie, who I thought played him quiet well. I also felt the movie inaccurately portrayed Freddie as being near death from AIDS during his monumental performance at Live Aid, which was far from the truth , as he lived for another 6 years after 1985.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's absolutely worth watching, if you a Queen Fan, but far from a masterpiece."

Let's get one thing straight; this is not a good movie. I give it 6/10 because it had all the right ingredients to be a good movie, and for the most part it was, but it chose to gloss over crucial details that I've now come to learn and that causes the movie to fall short.<br/><br/>I had no interest in Queen prior to watching this movie. I knew of their hits because, let's be real here, who doesn't? But I had no idea who the band was or what their history was like until I'd seen this movie, and keeping that in mind, for no longer than a second did I believe anything happening on screen. The rest of the band is painted with the lightest of brushes. Their every word and action makes it seem as though Freddie was this egotistical rockstar who threw them back and forth with his escapades and they were silent little lambs who were subject to his poor choices, and I didn't buy it for a second. After looking up the band and doing very, very, very little research I was able to see through all the tales the movie tries to spin. Dates are changed, lies are told and important details glossed over in favour of the mess of a meal the director serves to us, and by the end of the movie it felt more like a work of fantasy than a biography.<br/><br/>This movie's saving grace comes in the form of a scene stealing Rami Malek. His performance is electric. With a longer than two hour running time, there wasn't a single moment that I found myself bored watching Rami channel this flamboyant rock god bravura. Without him, this entire movie is nothing but a supercut of superficial moments in a great bands history.<br/><br/>I wouldn't watch this movie again, but I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it because, if nothing else, it's extremely entertaining.

Their live performed lacked excitement and looked really staged on this film. So many factual inaccuracies but hey I guess you could ignore them if you didn't know a lot about them.

There was no excess, no subjective shots, no geist of the time - I would have like to see the encounter between Mercury and Bowie for ""Under Pressure"", for exemple, but the movie kinda existed in a conventional vaccuum. It was also a bit long, and binary in moralistic colours.<br/><br/>There were however some strokes of genius like Myers' reacting in a very different way to a particular song he did act differently to some decades ago.

"jadepietro","7","2","5","7 November 2018"," Good Music, Great Performance, but Unnecessary Gay Shaming
","GRADE: B-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: The only Queen in this sanitized but entertaining biography of Freddy Mercury is the band itself. So much for the true story of a bisexual icon.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Bohemian Rhapsody avoids the facts in its retelling of gay icon, Freddy Mercury, and his band Queen. Rather than depict his sex and drug crazed world which included his bisexuality and addiction to cocaine, it purports to tell his biography well within its PG-13 rating in a strictly sanitized way. The film plays fast and loose with the facts and the time lines don't quite gel. Director Bryan Singer focuses on the band and its early years to stardom (1970 to 1985) with only hints of the tragic consequences that will affect the group. (Mr. Mercury died of AIDS in 1991, one day after he announced to his fans that he contracted this fatal disease. The film never gets to that era choosing rather to go out on a high note, Queen's LIVE AID concert in 1979. The usual title card summaries his and the band's final years.)<br/><br/>All of Queen's music is there, with its glitz and hard rock glam, as is the star turn by its lead singer, acted to perfection by Rami Malek (More on this actor's performance later.). The film vividly captures that rock era and creates concert footage that emulates the band and its theatricality. But the script by Anthony McCarten is unfortunate. It is conventional storytelling of an unconventional subject that tries to cover too much as it covets one cliche after the next.<br/><br/>Typically seen, as in most musical film biographies, are the group's rise from obscurity, their early successes, band fall-out due to too much fame and fortune, relationships undone, etc. In fact, the only new creative detour, and it's not a good one, is the subtle gay shaming that occurs throughout the movie. Most gay characters are depicted as villainous or amoral stereotypes. The film purposely downplays Mr. Mercury's interest in same sex relationships, except for his male love interest who is introduced at the tail end of the film. This may be more accepting to a majority of audience members, but it is a dishonest and unnecessary approach to Mr. Mercury's life.<br/><br/>Instead, the film emphasizes his healthy heterosexual ""the love of his life"", his wife, Mary Austin (well played by Lucy Boynton). While this relationship lasted a long time and ended due to his infidelity, the film celebrates their passion while almost completely avoiding his sexual identity.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is generally well acted with fine supporting turns by Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joe Mazzello as the bandmates. An unrecognizable Mike Myers. Aidan Gillen, and Allen Leech round out the cast. But for this film to work, a central performance that captures Freddy Mercury's stage persona must be literally center stage. And Bohemian Rhapsody has that at its core in Mr. Malek's terrific portrayal. With an overbite large enough to chew up any scenery, Mr. Malek wisely shows some restraint in his backstory, filling in the many gaps in an overstuffed script that enjoys contrivance over realism. He shows the singer's conceit very well and addresses his vulnerability with his scenes with family members. The actor saves the strutting for his lip-synched imitation of the lead singer on stage and is very convincing, especially in an exciting conclusion of a 12 minute Queen concert in which my movie audience instinctively sang along.<br/><br/>If only the filmmakers of Bohemian Rhapsody followed their movie's own tagline: Fearless Lives Forever than hide behind a cardboard cutout of a musical legend who deserved a more honest and accurate treatment. They assembled a strong cast but let them and their film bite the dust."

They managed to make ""Queen"" seem very vanilla and formulaic during any part that didn't include singing until roughly the last 20 minutes of the film (which did its best to try and redeem the previous 2 hours).

","I loved the movie, but I don't think they should call it a movie about Queen when it was mostly about Freddie Mercury.

I remember that I looked at my watch half way through the movie to see how much time I had left to enjoy the movie because I wanted more and I still want more. I laugh and I cried, but mostly I just sat with a smile enjoying the movie.
I think that Freddie would be honored if he would be able to watch the movie and I think he would like that it's about his music and not his death.
I also think Rami was amazing! I never saw the guy playing the hacker Elliot in Mr. Robot dancing around in Freddies outfits and make it look beliaveble. Rami is a brilliant actor and a perfect Freddie, every move and word in the movie was so thought through. All the hand gestures, covering the overbite with his lips, walking, talking were so believeble.
I think that Rami Malek got an Oscar nomination coming his way."

Queen have been my favorite band ever since i was a child. I was lucky enough to see them but with Adam Lambert ( who makes a fabulous replacement but NEVER Freddie) . After hearing they were doing this film , i felt a little mixed. As can anyone really play Freddie Mercury? How ever when the trailor dropped , i knew i had to see it ! Rami does a superb job of being Freddie. I can not believe the likeness of all the actors to a young Queen. All cast were really believable. It was full of love , laughter , sadness and truth.

The cast is incredible-the actors who play Freddie Mercury and Brian May are so convincing that there's moments you forget they're actors and not the actual performers.
Freddie's story is a tragic one, one that I remember all too well from the time, but seeing it played out on screen gives it an even more desperately sad edge.<br/><br/>Building the film up to Queens epic Live Aid performance was genius-it's an event in time that nobody will ever forget, and one that put Queen firmly back at the top before Freddie's untimely passing.<br/><br/>All in all, a true cinematic masterpiece.

","I went to see this film with some trepidation following several qualified reviews in the press and the BBC's Film Review. I came away wondering whether the reviewers saw the same film as me. The acting was excellent. The music, of course, was brilliant and the ending superbly handled. Some critics slated the film for not going deep enough into Mercury's hedonistic lifestyle. It was covered, but not to voyeuristic excess which, if it had been, I think would have spoiled the film.<br/><br/>Excellent performances all round, especially the main characters.

","I have so much to say about this movie. They did a great job to cover so much in such a short space of time. To get the reason why I dropped one star off the rating out there quickly - I would have loved to see more intricate detail around why each song was made but hey, that is me being an avid and picky Queen fan wanting too much, and all of that can be found elsewhere anyway.<br/><br/>This biopic gives an incredible insight into the many different dynamics of the band - from the highs and lows of song writing and politics, to the intricate relationships held between each member. Rami Malek had a big, big challenge ahead of him and whilst he will no doubt have his critics, as everyone does, he should be proud for absolutely smashing Freddie Mercury's mannerisms and stage presence. The only people who know what Freddie was really like off stage were those around him, and if Malek has done a good enough job for Brian May and Roger Taylor, then it's more than a good enough job for me!<br/><br/>I grew up listening to Queen from my mother's influence and it gave me goosebumps throughout to watch how each song was created and performed, and if anyone can say a bad thing against the recreation of the Live Aid '85 performance, they're a crook.<br/><br/>What a fantastic whirlwind of a story beautifully portrayed by each and every individual involved in the film, all of whom should be proud."

","The first time I went to see Bohemian Rhapsody I did so as a critical Queen fan knowing that some things weren't 100% as things actually happened (chronologically, and factual elements that were stretched). Then I went again to see the film without being bothered about these inaccuracies, because at the end of the day, what matters is revelling in the eclectic music and live performances (especially Live Aid), and the 4 members of Queen that make up one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Some people (in particular critics) are bemoaning the fact that it doesn't show the dark and seedy side of Queen. True, but that wasn't the makers' intention. If you want to know about this then there are plenty of sources to find out those details. This is a celebration of Queen's music interwoven with the highs and lows of the band. Again, complaints have been made about it being the 'run-of-the-mill' biopic. But, in all honesty, 90% of all rock bands go through the same thing. It's inevitable in this kind of business: struggling for success, finding success, keeping on to that success, and being tempted and falling into sex, drugs, alcoholism, loneliness, and struggling to maintain some sort of privacy in a very public world. If you watch the film with these things in mind then you will succumb to the wonder and incredible talent of these four individuals (of which Freddie was very much the driving force). So, was it all worth it? Yes, it was a worthwhile experience. It was worth it. Go, see this film and just know: it's guaranteed to blow your mind."

But a Brian May film as well. Each Band member gets a fair amount of screan time to prove their worth. It also address the struggle of Murcury with his sexuality and deals with the subject, with great respect and fairness. Freddie Murcury is not meant to look like the hero in this Movie. He is presents truthfully, acts like an arrogant kid and sometimes leaves the audience questioning if he is a good guy. However, all is set straight at the end, during the last 20 minutes of the movie, where they recreate Live Aid. You wouldn't think they would be able to pull off.

"FilmAddictJenn","9","2","5","28 October 2018"," Phenomenal Performances
","Bohemian Rhapsody would be a great film if it was fictional, however, being a bio-pic based on a true story about one of the most talented singers and groups in music history made it an amazing film, and what made it a stand out film was the performances, both acting and musically.<br/><br/>Any zealots and critics out there who say this isn't an entirely accurate historical depiction of events, should remember that this is a bio-pic, not a documentary, so not all Queen or Freddie Mercury songs, music, events or incidents are included. Instead this film, with some artistic licence, highlights the rise to legendary status of the group, and in particular Freddie Mercury, to the epic Live Aid performance, a live performance possibly never to be surpassed by any other.<br/><br/>No-one in the film couldn't have been cast better, the actors portraying Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon made me soon forget they were acting. However, Remi Malek, whose resemblance to and accurate portrayal of Freddie's looks, mannerisms, characteristics, and voice was superb, and is a testament to his ability as an actor and performer, worthy of an oscar in my view.<br/><br/>Of course, you shouldn't forget the make-up artists, costume and designers, and so many more that went into making sure this film paid proper homage to this phenomenal group and lead singer, so much so that I found myself transported into their world, becoming emotionally immersed in the highs and lows, successes and frustrations, needing several tissues as a result.<br/><br/>I felt privileged to learn about Mary, the love of Freddie's life, a pure, beautiful and gentle love; and saddened to see the dark, devious love that surrounded him too, and I was moved to tears about how it took Freddie so long to really accept himself for who he truly was, the struggle he went through, and his relationship with his family too.<br/><br/>Maybe the story will mean more to those of us lucky enough to have been around when Freddie was alive. I am gutted that I never got to see Queen perform live with Freddie Mercury, but so thrilled I have at least seen Queen live with Adam Lambert.<br/><br/>On a broader, more philosophical note, I'm sure everyone who watched the film would agree that it was horrifying to watch when Freddie was called 'Paki' or vilified and hounded for his sexuality. I was reminded me how far most people have come in their attitudes since then. However, I can't help but think, if certain people had their way about immigration in the UK, then Freddie's family might not have been able to escape persecution and come to England, therefore, Freddie wouldn't have been who he was, Queen would never have existed, and the world would have been devoid of their creativity and talent. Their music and talent surpassed those artificial barriers. I can't help but wonder what all UK Queen fans would think about that."

Also, I thought they would tell more about his life, and give some insight - they do not.<br/><br/>The biggest reason for the failure is Academy Award winner Rami Malek. The truth is he's light-years away both from the greatness of Freddie and any kind of resemblance to his persona. Malek is only capable of hysterical blank stares with occasional weasel smirks, depriving Freddie Mercury of all of his irony, thoughtfulness, sweetness, energy, and grandeur. Malek's performance is the epitome of overrated and overblown.<br/><br/>On a positive note, listening to a dozen of Queen hits played loudly at the cinema is something really great."
"jerrycoliver","6","3","10","19 January 2019"," Just another band bio-pic
","I love movies based on real life bands, but this one's just pretty typical.<br/><br/>""The Doors"" was fantastic because it explored the good and the bad of Jim Morrison. Anytime you tell a story you need to explore the faults of the protagonist and really dig into them in order to have a compelling story. Another great example was ""Walk the Line.""<br/><br/>""The Runaways"" was horrible. Joan Jett was one of the producers so it's no surprise the character Joan Jett was flawless in every way, she was just a victim the whole time. ""Straight Outta Compton"" should have been an examination of a group of truly talented and unique rappers, again it was produced by Dr. Dre and Ice Cube and no surprise, the characters of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre were flawless people who were victims the whole time. This just isn't compelling story-telling.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" breaks from the recent band biopics (like, ""the Runaways"" and ""Straight outta Compton"") where the main character does have genuine faults and though they're not explored in a gritty way, they are present and that's more compelling. However, the surviving members of the band are flawless (No surprise, they're producers on the film), and they seem too present throughout the movie. It seems to all be about the band and not as much about the culutural significance of Freddie Mercury who ended up becoming a hugely significant icon.<br/><br/>I'm not a champion for gay-rights or AIDS victims. It's just not a cause I've been interested in doing volunteer work for, however, Mercury and the impact of the disease (especially during this time period) is a far more powerful and important story to tell than the band ""Queen"". I'm not suggesting making ""Philadelphia"" with the best soundtrack ever, but I don't think this movie is as grand and as important as Freddie Mercury would have wanted it to be.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a pretty lower-mid level production without much imagination in the directing. I think it needed to take more chances. (That's not a knock on the director, sometimes the studio is at fault for this.) There's nothing ""bad"" or ""wrong"" with the film, but there's nothing that stands out. There's no moment when the hair stands up on the back of your neck, when it should. When Queen took the stage in real life, it was electric and it happened every time.<br/><br/>The acting is good. I think Rami is a tremendously talented actor and I'm very thankful he got this opportunity to show off his talents in a lead role on the big screen.<br/><br/>Hopefully, there's another film that really dives into Freddie's life and can truly give a glimpse into the seediness of the scene during the 80's and show the horrors of the AIDS virus (and ultimately show Freddie forcing the conversations of both and how important it was.)<br/><br/>If you own a Queen album, you pretty much have to watch this movie."
"torrascotia","5","3","10","21 November 2018"," Deceptively Average.
","There are far too many Queen fans who have over-rated this movie but its easy to see why.
This is a very basic/average movie which is lifted by the musical scenes.
Despite the content and story, this is a very bland and strangely unemotional paint by the numbers story of a rock band, the way they would like you to think of them.
There is barely a mis-step on the bands journey from small venues to first album and then sell out shows. Surely it wasnt that easy? Because its certainly not believable.
The movie is structured in way it shows you a bland story section then a live music number and repeat till the end.
The live musical scenes are done well however this detracts from the actual story telling and emotional content which falls quite flat. Also too much story time is wasted on how certain songs were written. It seems like each band member wanted to show that they wrote a song in the Queen canon as if this actually mattered for the story. So much seems to have been missed story-wise in the 2 hour running time and this is where a huge chuck of the movie is wasted.
The reason I say the very high ratings are deceptive is because the only moment which packs any punch is the last act which is very well done.
The problem is that it leave you wondering why this was the only section of the movie which engaging and worth the fee. Its also why we have so many reviews which are so high is because this is the last part you experience.
For me the 8 and even 10 ratings are reserved for movies which have better content than a decent last twenty minutes.
The critics were correct, this is a flawed movie, its just that it ends on a high and some people cant see past this cheap trick."

","I was very excited for this film as a fan of Queen and was dismayed by its poor critical reception. I went in believing I would find something to love but before long I could see this movie falling apart. Its all in the pacing. The movie chronicles Freddie Mercury and Queens rise to fame and the drama behind the scened but the movie itself cant decide what it wants to focus on. The movie spent more time showing the making and release of its titular song than it did introducing us to Freddie, the band, his girlfriend and their success. Everything happens so fast I found it impossible to care about any one aspect. Performances were solid all around but I couldn't care about any one person because aside from Freddie the movie gives us such little time to get to know them. Freddie himself is pretty unlikable and I feel no closer understanding of him then I did before. The film shows us what he is but never tries to tell us why he is. Overall the movie can be enjoyable especially in its line up of Queen hits but the movie in between the music is a limp, generic mess with little substance."
"magda-07525","6","3","10","27 October 2018"," Missing the edge
","Not sure how to feel about the production. The are some bits I absolutely love in this film, however, it's also visibly flawed. I don't feel it really does justice to Freddie. Freddie was an extremely shy person offstage, here he comes across incredibly confident from the beginning. He also had this irritatingly sweet habit of covering his mouth when laughing which is totally ignored by the actor.
He was also incredibly promiscuous, what is merely hinted in the story. Obviously, both Freddie and Marry had their hearts broken when Freddie decided to face his sexuality but they maintained the friendship and Freddie embarked on many relationships and took lots of emotional blows from a multiple guys he was in love with, in this film however it looks like he was forever not over Marry , who basically moved out and moved on. The fact was, she never stopped loving him , and it took her ages to build up a new life and become emotionally involved with another guy.
And the last thing... The parties Freddie threw were ... excessive and wild beyond imagination, nothing like it was actually shown.
Also, Freddie didn't meet Jim in his house, Freddie was not super faithful to him, did but test him that well, somewhat Jim stuck around to the very end with him.
I'm not sure about Freddie's parents, was he really do open about his relationship in front of his parents at some point? Did his dad really go beyond his beliefs and culture to pay him on the back when/if he found out?
Very nice editing but dialogues at some points just truly horrible.
All in all, it's a bit of a disappointment, such a great artist like Freddie deserves something less conventional, less careful and more bohemian-like film story."
"mirkobozic","5","3","11","6 November 2018"," What goes around at the Blue Oyster, comes back at the Bohemian Rhapsody
","Freddie Mercury is one of those that simply provoke a reaction, you just can't be indifferent to Queen. This movie proves why that's the case- the music, the charisma, the comraderie with the others from the band (Brian May was also brilliantly portrayed). As far as biopics go, Bohemian Rhapsody hit the nail on the head, the band's chemistry is credibly transferred to the big screen, and Malek really was the perfect lead choice. But. Mercury's charisma went far beyond the music, he was a flamboyant and emotionally expressive guy who flaunted his sexuality as an important part of his image. This is where the film begins to turn sour. His life-long close relationship with Mary Austin isn't delivered very credibly, perhaps because one is constantly distracted by the fake theeth and the horrible accent, and I had a hard time believing there was any real chemistry between the two if judged by the movie only. And then, even worse, Mercury the Queen, whose over-the-top sexuality is reduced to a walking clichÃ©: a curious peek at a truck driver (really?!) outside a public loo (imagine parents explaining to their kids what ""cottaging"" is) and a scene or two depicting a leather-clad Sodoma and Gomorrah in a gay club, comically resembling the Blue Oyster from Police Academy. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is far from homophobic, but its problem is a stereotypical depiction of 1980's gay scene that borders on offensive. Fortunately, the end with the Live Aid gig is a masterpiece, and touchingly, we see both Mary Austin and Tim Hutton standing next to each other, bringing the story to full circle as two equally important people in Mercury's life."

"paul2001sw-1","4","2","6","16 March 2019"," Played 'Live Aid', then died
","Musical biographies often make for pretty poor films, even when the musician themselves has happened to have lived an interesting life. The coincidence of personal drama and creativity is often a loose one; attempting to forge a narrative, a certain sort of movie almost always take refuge in a ludicrous cathartic scene where the protagonist writes their love song while hurting from a break-up etc. etc. etc. 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the story of Queen, struggles even more because as an authorized project, it attempts to give some credit to every band member, which dampens its attempts to show their squabbling. In addition, it chooses a positive narrative, focusing not on lead singer Freddie Mercury's tragically early death but rather on Queen's triumphant performance, when it might have been thought they were over the hill, at the legendary 'Live Aid' concert a few years earlier. Comedian Spike Milligan used to quip that his obituary would read ""Wrote the Goon Show, then died"". Whatever you think of Queen, the band had a long string of imaginative hits, but watching this film, you might feel you could sum up Mercury's life as ""Played Live Aid, then died"". While many have focused on Rami Malek's performance in bringing Mercury to life, I struggled to avoid being distracted by the frankly painful screenplay. The one redeeming feature here is Queen's music, used liberally throughout but welcome nonetheless."

","Really disappointed in this film. I expected many moments and did enjoy hearing old songs. Especially the song alongs at concerts. But the last 20 minutes was then at Live AID- did that define the group? Much of this was slow paced, predictable and repetitive. There were many plot lines left ... did he go after the trucker in the bathroom? Why did his wife stay with him? How did his HIV status impact his band relationships? During this time (1985) I volunteered for AIDS Walk LA and NYC and people would hear AIDS and fear contamination and immediately freak out. So the scene when he tells his band mates about his HIV status (they hugged) was totally inconsistent with the reality I saw first hand. Rami Malej looked the part but was not worthy of the Oscar win - his character was not so complicated. Sadly I wasted time viewing this - thankfully someone else purchased it and loaded it to us.

"whippan","5","2","6","25 February 2019"," Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)
","Following Queen's historic rise from a London-based college-band to stadium-filling Rock royalty, Bohemian Rhapsody is a glossy re-telling of the band's major milestones and works. Audiences get to witness the genesis of fan-favorite anthems such as We Will Rock You and Another One Bites the Dust yet are rarely afforded a true and honest glimpse behind the curtain. Lead-singer Freddie Mercury, fully embodied here by actor Rami Malek, lived a life of countless interesting stories, yet the film settles for highlighting each of them instead of fully-examining any (Freddie's loneliness, sexuality, or ultimate battle with AIDS) in-depth. In fact, the film is almost completely devoid of an actual story, exemplifying the pitfalls of a plot-over-story approach to filmmaking.<br/><br/>The music, on the other hand, an amalgamation of Malek's, Mercury's, and Marc Matel's (a Mercury impersonator) voice hits all of the right notes. And speaking of hitting the right notes, Bohemian Rhapsody contains a rare Mike Myers sighting (behind a wall of makeup, no less!). Yet ultimately, Bohemian Rhapsody is nothing more than a crowd-pleasing music video - entertaining to watch while great music is being played but lacking any substance to become the preferred listening method."

","I saw this film much later than I should have, I guess. True to form, when a movie gets too much hype and praise early on, I tend to set my expectations too high. Such is the case here. I felt like it was an okay biopic but it felt oddly undecided about how it wanted to play out. For such a long run time, I felt like lots of the important parts were rushed and, while the music is iconic, as we all know, I felt like it overpowered the story and played a bigger role than the story itself. Maybe I'm just off here, but I don't see the acclaim. It's a basic story with great supporting acting but Rami Malek annoyed me to no end. Perhaps I should go back and look at Freddie Mercury more, but I couldn't get past him, which kept me from connecting. I'm sure I'm alone in this opinion and I can appreciate that. I will say the emotional peaks of the film were the highlights for me. The end concert sequence dragged on and on for me and I feel like they just added length to the movie when we already know the music. I would love to have seen his relationship blossom in more detail. That just popped up out of nowhere and it seemed like they didn't care to explore it, more so leaving it as an afterthought. The movie just didn't live up to the hype it received and I do not at all think this is even a best picture nominee."
"paulashis","5","2","6","9 January 2019"," Disappointed, as I expected a movie about Queen
","Being a 70's rock fan I was very much excited about this film. I badly wanted a movie which shows the reality of being a successful band. I wanted to see how band dies when it reaches its peak.
But sadly Bohemian Rhapsody was more a Mercury film rather than a Queen film. We see more of personal struggles of Freddie than the struggles of the band as a whole. Another thing that saddens me is although it contains milestone songs of Queen it misses one masterpiece, Innuendo, the song that clearly expresses the experience of Freddie after he was diagnosed.
Well, I found some good things about this movie:
1. The ending was great
2. It has shown quite accurately how a band goes through writing a song
3. And the conflict of creativity and music industries.<br/><br/>but at the end I feel unsatisfied."
"dakjets","6","2","6","11 December 2018"," Tries to hard to grasp too much
","It's hard to make good biographically movies. Especially on famous people like Freddie Mercury. An icon, one of the greatest pop singers ever. With a copious career. This movie is well-liked by many, but I did not fall for it. I think the movie tries to embrace too much. Is it about Mercury? About Queen? Mercurys career? Or the privacy of Mercury? A bit of everything, it seemed. There are good roles performances by the main role-holder, especially I think he is good at the last part of the film.
But after reading several (admittedly unauthorized) biographies by Freddie Mercury, I think the movie does not seem to give any good insight into who he was private, his relationship with other and sexual orientation. The movie takes light of who he was private and unable to go into the depths of life he lived. It is too smooth for me. Mayby to make it more acceptable for a big audience? His career and the story of Queen is well presented here. But quitting the movie with the entire sequence of the band during LIVE AID becomes strange. Then I'll rather see the performance of the real band on youtube."
"jacksonrogers-69099","5","2","6","6 December 2018"," Yes queen is amazing but...
","This is an extremely barebones biopic that frankly does nothing to shake up the most tired and overdone genre in Hollywood, the music is great because queen is great and I understand how that may shade someone's opinion of the film but ultimately it is extremely average. Yes Rami Malik is good as mercury, yes the live aid recreation was stunning, but it still falls into the same old tropes as every other biopic. I think a model that should be adapted more is the Steve Jobs biopic by Aaron Sorkin, it is a series of vignettes where we are shown in concentration the exact character of the person in question, at least it was different and interesting whereas this was frankly boring. If you've got a Spotify account just stick to that, because frankly you would get just as much out it as going to see this movie."
"steffnaru","5","2","6","4 December 2018"," An untruthful, lazy and superficial biopic.
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a huge pastiche, solved by relying on generalizations, schematizations and stereotypes. The central point of the film is that of a sense of belonging.
Freddie Mercury's life in Bohemian Rhapsody is marked by the desire to belong to something or someone, the desire to make peace with a sexual identity that deprived him of the affections as he wished them and that of reconciling with a family that didn't approve him. The band represents the good environment from which Fred decides to detach himself, pursuing more sinister ( because that's how they're portrayed in the film ) companies, being attracted by bad acquaintances. Vague homophic vibes. In the film all the possible faults imaginable, all the worst of the worst is focused on a character, Paul Prenter, lover and manager of Freddie. The reliability of the truthfulness of the events is doomed by the very first scenes of the picture, where a young student of Asian descent has just met a band whose leader decided to leave, and is suddenly taken on board for an adventure. In, say, 5 minutes of screen time. Oh, and John Deacon's audition for the band never took place, you just have to assume. Pretty rude. From this moment on the movie is a mish mash of lies which serve the big screen.
Each actor seems to have said their jokes without the others present, so much so that the conversations are unrelated and distant. Malek's impressive performance can do very little to save the film. There are premonitions of events that we know will occur, moments of great revelations in the obvious rain and there is also the scene where someone tells Queen that their most successful song ( which also gives the title to the film) will not please anyone. In a long chain of accounts, it seems that the only salvation and the only balance in the life of the singer were his workmates and Mary Austin.
The only positive side of the film is the story of the relationship between the band and the public. The concerts around the world, the performance at Live Aid, the thrilling crowds, Bohemian Rhapsody manages to evoke the power of music to unite, convey and bring together different people. The only decent scene is the last one, featuring a full lenght rendition of the legendary Live Aid perfomance. Still a technical exercise, but at least the only honest and not over the top moment of the film.
Because the rest of this biopic just seems to distribute blame and virtue, to sentence who is to blame and who to exalt for the genius and the death of Freddie Mercury.
For sure, the genius of Mercury deserved something deeper and more articulate, and so did we."

That part was spot on. However, I couldn't stop thinking how much he looked and sounded like Mick Jagger for the first 3/4 of the movie. During that time I was also distracted by him struggling with his mouthpiece & exaggerated overbite (WAY more than the real Freddie). He just looked uncomfortable and it showed.<br/><br/>The acting was ok and it would have been really cool to show them practicing a little more on the earlier songs but overall it was a good movie with GREAT musical performances and I thought the actor who played Brian May was brilliant.<br/><br/>The best rockumentary style movie for me is still The Doors.<br/><br/>BR: 7.5/10"

","Went to see Bohemian Rhapsody last night and the best thing I can say about it is WOW, amazing!! The worst thing I can say about it is also WOW, it's amazing!!
Now don't get me wrong this won't be to everyone's tastes and if you don't like Queen then you're not gonna enjoy it really because it is all about them and nothing else (obviously).
But if, like me, you love Queen, you love Freddie Mercury and their music then you'll love it! It's not a documentary, there's been plenty of them done. It doesn't go in depth into the life of Freddie or the other band members and nor should it, those things have been done already. What this is is a celebration of the life and work of one of the greatest bands and greatest performer of all time. Rami Malek is sensational as Freddie, pulling off his mannerisms and movements so well (makes me glad that Sacha barren a Cohen turned it down, he wouldn't have been good enough imo) that you can tell this is a role he loved playing. It starts off with you wondering if he could play such an epic OTT character, but by the end he just is Freddie.
The music is, well, amazing, as the songs of Queen are. The songs they chose were all well placed in the film and added to that sense of nostalgia and fun that embodied the band and that the film makers were obviously going for.
It does showcase around Freddie for the most part and to me that's only right, he was the flamboyance of the band and what made them so incredibly appealing. Starting from his early days in England and finishing with their world class performance at live aid.
This film for me had me engrossed, enraptured and above all entertained. I found myself singing quietly along to the songs, nodding my head to the music and caught up in the emotions of it all. It does give a rose tinted view of Queen and Freddie for the most part, but I don't mind that at all, as said previously, I don't want to see another fly on the wall documentary, I wanted to see a happier version of a figure and band that I love and this works so well. Also there's a really funny part with Mike Myers and what his character says about bohemian rhapsody, but you should watch it to see what I mean ðŸ˜‰.
The only disappointing thing about the movie was it""s ending. i believe they could have delved into the his final days a little bit. they could have also shown his pale body which was a result of him not taking his proper medication which was evident in his video song of "" these are the days of our lives "".
All in all a bloody good watch and one that I will be definitely going to see again!!"

","This review is written as a journalist, but biased may be seen due to the fact That queen heavily influenced my life emotionally through their music. Three eyes will be used those of a music lover, movie go-er, and Queen fan.<br/><br/>Queen Fan - Even though I know a decent amount about the band there were a few nuggets that impressed me. They slowed the tempo of some songs to fit the mood of the scene. Reconizable difference when the actual music vs the gallant attempt by Rami Malik & Ben Hardy. Each principle had the look of who they were portraying down pat. I wish it went into the behind the scenes about ""made in heaven"" the final album more. Leaving the theater I felt even closer to my musical influences.<br/><br/>Music Lover - Hard to do, but imagine if the universe or what ever deity you believe in did not put Farrokh Bulsara, Brian May, Roger Taylor, & John Deacon together? To that point if you are oblivious as to who Queen are; this rockumentry is an educational must. We all watch VH-1's Behind the Music to see if the creational ideology is what actually what ends up on vinyl. You will understand my last sentence more when you see the film. You definitely see that the bands writings were impacted by their lives together and individually.<br/><br/>Movie Go-er - Honestly I have never seen this type of production in cinema before. I watched Band of Brothers on the tele, as well as from the earth to the moon. Don't go into this movie blind; listen to their music, read up a little on the members of the band, it will make for a more enjoyable view with less questions.<br/><br/>Over all any history buff, fan of the Genius series, rock & roll fanatic go, see this with your own eyes!

"JamesHitchcock","9","2","6","9 November 2018"," Zoroastrianism in the Rock World
","During my teenage years in the seventies and eighties, I was part of a group at my school which consciously embraced the values of Classical music, and of high culture in general, partly as a protest against what we perceived as the inanity and shallowness of contemporary youth culture. Despite this, I still have a soft spot for some of the rock bands of the era, including ELO, The Eagles and Queen, a group whose songs combined a thrilling sense of excitement with the recognition of the importance of melody to any musical composition in any genre. And how could any Classical lover not admire a band who called one of their albums ""A Night at the Opera"" and their best-known single ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". That could be a title straight out of Dvorak! (Although, of course, the adjective was chosen to reflect the group's bohemian lifestyle).<br/><br/>One of the strengths of Queen was that all four band members, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon were creative talents who contributed to writing the group's music as well as performing it, but the best known of the four was undoubtedly Mercury, the flamboyant lead singer. He had an unusual background for British rock star, having been born with the name Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar, then a British protectorate, to a family of Indian Zoroastrian descent. The family were forced to flee Zanzibar when a revolution broke out in 1963. The film tells the story of the formation of Queen in the early seventies and of their rise to success, culminating with a re-creation of their ""Live Aid"" performance at Wembley Stadium in 1985., concentrating on Mercury and his personal life.<br/><br/>Mercury is today remembered as a gay icon, but in the seventies he was widely (although wrongly) assumed to be a heterosexual who adopted the camp and flamboyant dress and mannerisms associated with homosexuality as part of his stage persona, a pose to make him appear cool and rebellious; it was known that he had an attractive blonde girlfriend, Mary Austin. The truth, of course, was that he had a long struggle to come to terms with his sexuality; according to the film when he tried to tell Mary that he thought he was bisexual, she replied ""No, Freddie, I think you're gay"". Even after he had accepted his homosexuality, Mary remained an important figure in his life. The film also deals with two of Mercury's gay relationships, with his personal manager Paul Prenter and with Jim Hutton, his partner during the latter part of his life.<br/><br/>The film is dominated by Queen's music- May and Taylor served as executive music producers- and we get to hear all their classics, including the likes of ""Radio Gaga"", ""Rocket Man"", ""We Will Rock you"" and, of course, the title track itself. It is worth pointing out that when it was first recorded ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was not popular with record executives, who regarded it as too long to release as a single, and with rock critics, most of whom regarded it as pretentious and incomprehensible and gave it negative or lukewarm reviews. It was, however, hugely popular with the record-buying public and became one of the band's biggest hits.<br/><br/>I suspect that the same thing is likely to happen to the film with which the song shares its name. Many critical reviews have been negative or lukewarm, especially over alleged biographical inaccuracies, yet I believe it has the potential to be a big hit. It has a superb central performance from Rami Malek in the central role, not only capturing the on-stage exuberance which made Mercury such a charismatic performer but also the turmoil and anguish which marked his life off stage. (His relationship with Prenter would appear to have been particularly fraught, and when it ended Prenter betrayed him by giving a ""kiss-and-tell"" interview). Some of the supporting cast have a similar ability to convey the essence of their characters, especially Gwilym Lee who has Brian May off to a T. May, a scientist by training, would appear from the film to have been the calm, rational one of the group, often acting as peacemaker between Mercury- just as mercurial as his stage name might imply- and the other members of the band and its entourage.<br/><br/>The rock trivia merchants may cavil at some of the details, but to me this was a fine film, even though it suffered from production difficulties. (Director Bryan Singer was sacked towards the end of filming and replaced by Dexter Fletcher although Singer retains sole director credit in line with DGA rules which only allow one director to be credited per film. A good thing Powell and Pressburger never heard of those). It captures all the raw excitement which so impressed me forty years ago and led to Queen providing some of the very few rock albums in my record collection. It also provides a moving portrait of Mercury, a man who faced his fatal illness and tragically early death with great courage. His may have been an unusual background for a rock star, but he lived his life in line with his family's Zoroastrian ideals of moral choices. 9/10"
"larry-ellis","8","2","6","9 November 2018"," Better than the average rock biopic
","After reading critics reviews, I went into this movie not expecting much.<br/><br/>As was the case with the band and its music, the movie is something the critics will mostly hate and the public will mostly love.<br/><br/>The movie has its faults. And Malek is too small and not good looking enough to play Mercury. At times he looks ridiculous in his prosthetic teeth, as if he's struggling to just to keep them from springing out of his mouth.<br/><br/>But the movie is entertaining and moving. The actors are very good in their roles, especially Malek in a compelling and tragic performance. And Gwilym Lee to my eyes is almost an identical twin to Brian May and his guitar performance is convincing.<br/><br/>But, as one critic put it, the final 15 minutes of the film is alone worth the price of admission. The bulk of Queen's Live-Aid performance is re-created here in astonishing, electrifying detail. Malek channels Mercury's charisma, stage presence, and ability to completely connect with the crowd. It's a spellbinding and emotional experience to be totally immersed in this concert in a way that has you feeling as if your standing right on the stage.<br/><br/>There are a few places where this movie could have been better, but those are all a distant memory when this jaw-dropping concert spectacle begins. Surely there are a few Oscar categories where these glorious minutes deserve recognition. If not, maybe, just maybe, they need to create a new category."
"timpattinsess","Null","2","6","8 November 2018"," Entertaining, but.
","I watched Bohemian Rhapsody yesterday and although it was very entertaining, I couldn't help but feel somewhat uncomfortable by some of the liberties the filmmakers took with the real story. But let's start with the positives.<br/><br/>The film brings back to the forefront one of the most legendary bands of all time, including a few of the most talented musicians to have existed. Their music, although not always well-received at the time, is pure magic. I thought Rami Malek did an excellent job conveying Freddie's onstage persona and following the script while at least trying to add some emotional and character complexity when the text was not helpful.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is obviously incredible, but I can't imagine they could do anything to mess that up given that it's purely Queen. I also feel that they captured the feeling of the 70s and 80s quite well and the aerial shot of Wembley Stadium that goes all the way to a close-up of Freddie was stellar.<br/><br/>However, the film takes a few liberties that I didn't feel were warranted. Admittedly, I don't expect a film biopic to be 100% faithful to the real story both because that usually wouldn't work as a feature film due to time restraints and because it's rather uncommon that a life follows a traditional three-act story arc. But my concern is that they created the drama with the friction between the band out of thin air, when Freddie's life - which the filmmakers chose to focus on - had enough complexity anyway. I feel like they stayed away from capturing the true brilliance of Freddie, instead turning him into a caricature of a diva who's always late for recording sessions and who is so unprofessional that he drives away all the people that are close to him. Also, apparently Freddie was gay - if only he knew at the time. Freddie's sexuality as described by those closest to him was much more fluid. And on top of that, having Mary, one of his closest people during his life, not only questioning but essentially telling him that he is gay when he had come out as bisexual, is perpetrating stereotypes regarding bisexual people just being confused homosexuals, besides being factually inaccurate.<br/><br/>Moreover, vilifying Paul Prenter, another victim of the AIDS epidemic and hence certain not to complain about it, just felt wrong. Prenter's actions were at times indeed questionable, to say the least, such as outing Freddie in a tabloid, but he never got a manager fired or keep Live Aid a secret from Freddie.<br/><br/>And that's what the problem of the film was for me. The depiction of Freddie's life, between the alleged break-up of Queen - which never actually happened - all members pursued some solo ventures and some of them before Freddie - up until Freddie receiving an AIDS diagnosis, was what I would expect from a traditional drama of a fictional band. It feels that we were getting a sugar-coated, Hollywood-formulated version of Freddie's sexuality with a healthy dose of a diva attitude and unfounded susceptibility that would be more easily palatable by the average viewer. I believe that's why this film is popular with the masses. It was made by people who prioritised profit over accurately portraying Freddie, for people who wanted to find out more about him as long as it's not too gay. And this is exactly where the irony lies. Even though it's not evident in the film, most fans actually ignored his sexuality and they were happy to admire his flamboyant persona while at the same time rejecting and stereotyping LGBT communities. Almost 30 years after his death, we still fail to acknowledge his real sexuality and are happy to enjoy a movie that shields us from it by selectively ignoring parts of it.<br/><br/>Having said that, I can still justify some of the liberties and inaccuracies of the film. Even though Freddie had never actually introduced Jim Hutton to his parents as his boyfriend and the character of Ray Foster was made up to represent the pressures from the record companies, it did kind of make sense to include these for the purpose of the film and at the very least they didn't alter his legacy.<br/><br/>Despite all of this misplaced drama, the film was indeed very entertaining and the acting was pretty good in general. People who love the music of Queen will enjoy this film and it's also a good starting point for someone who was not familiar with Queen to be introduced and hopefully to delve into their music, career and brilliance after watching it in order to begin to grasp the ambition, mastery and complexity of Freddie Mercury and of Queen."

It's worth it for his performance alone, but I walked out of the screening just wishing it could have been what I'd been dreaming it would be for the last few years. The music of Queen was epic and this movie should have tried to at least keep up with that sense of grandeur and magic, but it just couldn't quite do it.<br/><br/>Worth a watch, just don't go in with hopes too high, and maybe you'll enjoy it more than me."

","The biopic of British rock band, Queen and the lead, Freddie Mercury could have gone down as one of the greatest biopics but unfortunately it didn't give justice on the remarkable yet fascinating biography of its legendary rock band, especially its incandescent frontman, Freddie Mercury. Screenwriters Peter Morgan and Anthony McCarten, who's responsible for its remarkable and in-depth screenplays such as The Queen (2006), Frost/Nixon (2008), The Theory of Everything (2014), and Darkest Hour (2017), somehow had crafted a flawed and sanitized biopic screenplay that could have further explored an in-depth look on Freddie Mercury's character and biographical aspects particularly his relationships and homosexuality as well his AIDS diagnosis and death but ultimately fails miserably to convey it, and not to mention historical inaccuracies that bogs down the film itself. Even Bryan Singer's direction also falls flat in a uninspiring and clumsy way, considering the behind-the-scenes drama that could have single-handedly bring the film down, and some members of the cast (with exception of Rami Malek and Mike Myers) have also given an unmemorable and uninteresting performances. Even the pacing and editing are also sloppy and inconsistent. Still, the final product of the film also ended up creating a disservice on the legacy of the band and Mercury, himself.<br/><br/>On the brighter side, Rami Malek who was born to play Freddie Mercury truly transforms with a remarkable makeup as well the mustache, and nails it along with the mannerisms with an superb, electrifying, and magnetic performance with gravitas and bravado in which he redeems and elevate the film from its generic banality. Despite a limited screen-time, Mike Myers also makes an hilarious yet giggly cameo which highlighted the film's quality. Furthermore, the film has given a remarkable homage and celebration of Queen's iconic music and has done a wonderful work on recreating the dazzling Live Aid sequence especially the finale.<br/><br/>Despite the film's flaws and misconceptions, this is still worth enjoyable and watching for everyone; be as it might be, whether you're a die-hard Queen fan or not as it will rock everyone with hearts and inspiration.<br/><br/>As one quote from Queen to state it: ""the show must go on""."

How factual accurate it is I cannot say - problems due to their cros-dressing in the I Want to Break Free video - yes, but no mention of their massive mis-step by playing at Sun City ! And excesses in band parties, and real insight into Freddie's troubled personal life are just skimmed across. But for me, who grew up as Queen conquered the world in the 70s, it's not really an issue, as it was always about the music and the band's performance. So as a biopic it may be lacking, but in capturing the joy and thrill as they brought their music to the world it is a resounding success, which as made repeatedly clear throughout the film, is what the man at the heart of it all wanted. So a great tribute to Freddie."

","In the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", the mortal dust that falls into it is not star-studded, but in a flash of glory, it engraved the most beautiful soundtrack and sang the world.<br/><br/>When you are immersed in the pain of real events and cannot extricate yourself, the virtualized comfort of the movie and the compensation for the injured heart are simply a waste of money. The love and loyalty of the Queen is the starting point of the chasers' dreams and the beginning of the nightmare of some people, but the reality is cruel. No matter how you compare and restore, everything that has passed is the most memorable past and tolerance. The memories and enthusiasm of too many people, like the slaughter of the jab, disillusioned the beautiful.<br/><br/>However, the film ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" did its best to complete the beautiful shots, using the form of a feature film to create a semi-documentary look. Reduction is the best tribute. Bit by bit, nostalgia, it seems to be reproducible. Those indescribable subtleties, happy hearts, bitter glasses of wine, the support of friends, the love's hundreds of thousands of times, the feelings Choices, gender lingering, thinking in the works, historical lenses, they form a life in minutes, even if they can't be pieced together again, they can still be re-engraved in their hearts because they miss and don't want to let go of each A memory is a precious thought.<br/><br/>I have never been a queen enthusiast, for the sake of completeness, I simply read some information. When I watched the movie, I experienced more, but when I turned the biography, I was more moved. In reality, the characters that are alive are more flesh and blood, more moving. The Freddie Mercury in the film is quite charming, but this charm has a stronger sense of interpretation, a good casting ability, and a high degree of completion of the role, but the gap between the overlap of the characters is a bit large. After all, the real Freddie Mercury In my opinion, I am actually more handsome and have a stronger sense of whites. Lamy MacRae does n't know why it always makes me feel more mulatto, or because of the treatment of hair. In terms of time and feelings, it is a bit strange, but of course, the performance is still best.<br/><br/>For me, the best movie in the whole movie is actually guitarist Dr. Mei.<br/><br/>But watching movies in China still feels hurt. Although the film was introduced, various classic shots were cut out by Kaka. I kept watching in the cinema after watching the whole scene, and I dared not take a sip of water, but in the end I found that a few classic shots were directly cancelled. For example, the section where Freddie Mercury told his companions that he was infected with AIDS, and the section where Freddie Mercury kissed Jim who met him. It wasn't until a long, long time ago, that I glimpsed in the moving world, and I realized that there was such a beautiful moment to start memorizing. If not, I thought the two people in the movie didn't have much intersection at all, so Freddie Mercury was invited as a memento at the end of the film, and Jim Going to the concert scene is a bit inexplicable. In such an important series of movie clips, the classics are always deleted. It is also a feeling of helplessness.<br/><br/>In other words, is it that the same-sex stories are always bruised by harsh conditions?<br/><br/>After a long time, many stories don't remember, but some pictures and pleasant melodies will always stay in your heart.<br/><br/>Many of the goodnesses sent by heaven come to wander the world, morning or night, fulfill their own duties, leave a legend, and return home. Perhaps the earth uses these inscriptions to mark the scale of the civilization. One day they will become legends."

The movie stops with the death of Freddie. It's also not explained what happend with his solo album(s).<br/><br/>The fun for me was that a comedian, Kenney Everett (also death die AIDS I think) I followed close back then is also in it and he was also so recognisable played by the actor.<br/><br/>Clocking in way over 2 hours the flick is over before you knew it and it's the songs that are still standing that will take you by the throat.

Bohemian Rhapsody is exactly that kind of biographical work that you envy to be Freddie Mercury and you pity his loneliness because it is simply a person's life who lived a moderately short life with fame and glory that you would never want or you would, accepting to die at his age to live that splendid life.

","I would like to start off by saying that I am not particularly drawn to biopics so I was a little hesitant going into 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually enjoyed this two and a half hour biopic of Freddy Mercury's flamboyant and somewhat troubled life. Considering that it took 10 years to make this stunner, I think they did an amazing job.<br/><br/>As a lover of all things Rock 'n Roll, Queen has always been a staple in my household growing up, however, I never understood why people were so drawn to Freddy and his fellow band members until I watched 'Bohemian Rhapsody.' I now understand why he was such an amazing performer and why people could not help but love him.<br/><br/>To start off, I would like to take a moment to congratulate director Brian Singer on his choice of cast members. The acting was flawless and very captivating. Rami Malek in particular, was astounding in his role as Freddy Mercury. He was able to mimic Freddy's unique and often ostentatious on-stage movements flawlessly and was able to bring Freddy's struggle with his sexuality to life, showing just enough emotion to draw the audience in. This was nothing short of an stellar performance.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the editing of the final product was expertly done and even though Rami Malek was lip syncing his way through this performance, the editing of these scenes was flawless. So much so that anyone who doesn't know Mercury's unique voice will think Malek was singing all of those parts so well done to the editing team on making it look real.<br/><br/>Moreover, the themes portrayed in the film, that of sexual orientation, music and aids were all brilliantly executed and the film gave a great overview of the man that was Freddy Mercury. As I watched him unfold on the screen, I felt myself overcome with emotion and empathy for it was his inner struggles that made him the amazing performer that he was and it is films like 'Bohemian Rhapsody' that help fans understand the blood, sweat and tears that goes into a rock 'n roll record or any other record for that matter.<br/><br/>If you love rock 'n roll music then this biopic is definitely the one for you and even if you are not such a fan, I highly suggest you give this one a go. It was absolutely beautiful in every way and I look forward to more from this outstanding director."
"CalGirl1982","10","1","2","29 November 2019"," Thank you, Rami Malek, for doing justice to and celebrating the shining jewel that was Freddie Mercury
","Every now and then a person comes along who seems indisputably destined from birth to fulfill a certain role in life or to fill the niche that they eventually end up occupying. Freddie Mercury was a perfect exemplification of this phenomenon. Try and think for a moment of anyone else who has ever come close to his matchless blend of flamboyance; charisma; infectious and compelling stage presence and ability to command and hold an audience of hundreds of thousands of fans completely entranced and in the palm of his hand; and what can be considered an almost divinely conferred talent, not only coming to life in his remarkably beautiful voice, songwriting and instrumention, but also in his uncanny ability to create new avenues of poetic expression and eclectic musical mixes and arrangements which rendered his bandmates and other artists perplexed and oblivious, but which will go down in history as truly classical. To attempt to deliver a performance which is a portrayal measuring the depiction of such a person with 100% accuracy is not only undeniably daunting, but in fact, impossible. In this fascinating and enthralling biopic, however, the actor chosen for this task, Rami Malek, comes as close as one possibly can in delivering a performance which celebrates and pays tribute to Freddie with what I would characterize with a score of 99%. I deduct 1% for the ""certain something"" that people with Mercury's talent possess and which just could never be replicated. The entire film will keep you glued to the screen without interruption, from the beginnings of his career to his historical performance at Live Aid in 1985. Rami does a remarkable job in what is a true embodiment of the person that Freddie Mercury was, not only of his talents but also of his character and persona - someone who possessed a great generosity, a huge heart and tenderness, but who was also a man who had many demons, inner conflicts and was, above all, profoundly lonely. He tried so hard to use every means he could muster to mask his disappointments and emptiness by presenting a facade of confidence, dominance and bravado, but irony being what it is, the adoration of millions of fans and the rewards of untold fame and monetary fortune just do not comfort you after the party is over, the fans, hangers-on, and sycophants go home and when you are once again inevitably alone. Rami Malek seems to have an almost mystical ability to convey the darkest empty spaces which Freddie dealt with daily. His Academy Award was well deserved, as he is one of a handful of performers who can transform a portrayal into an embodiment, and which, in my opinion, defines what true acting ability is supposed to be. The crowning glory of this flawless film is his turn as Freddie at Live Aid, where he delivers a re-enactment of what has been unanimously voted the ""greatest rock performance in history"" - 20 minutes into which Freddie packs more than any other performer could in 2 hours, and which, I believe, you would have to search far and wide to find an actor who could even approach the job that Rami Malek does in paying tribute to it."
"davideo-2","9","1","2","27 November 2019"," Stirring musical biopic, accessible to Queen fans or not
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>As a young man whose family emigrated from Tasmania, living in 1970s England, Freddie Mercury (Remi Malek) struggled to find his place in society, or get any kind of acceptance. But he had a magnifying persona that couldn't be shaken off, and was destined for greatness. Together with fellow musicians Brian May (Gwilym Lee), John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy), he formed Queen, a rock band that would set the benchmark for others to follow. Defying convention, Mercury and his band enjoyed fantastic success that has resonated to this day, even whilst his personal life descended into anarchy and despair, before his tragic early death from AIDs.<br/><br/>As a member of the 'millennial' generation (but just barely!), it's a sad fact that most of the bands and music that set the standard for what was to follow, and have stood the test of time today, were about before my time, and so I couldn't experience first hand the massive cultural impact they had when they first emerged. It's sadly the truth that most of what we've experienced was gathering the crumbs from under the table of what went before. I've always been aware of Queen, and never disliked any of their music, but they were never able to play a big part of my formative years. But this stirring biopic from Bryan Singer (mostly known for making X-Men films!) magnifies their musical genius and innovation into something that makes everything else feel redundant.<br/><br/>It's telling that it all feels like less of a biopic of Queen the band, than of Freddie Mercury the individual, with May et al only getting brief screen time in the background. It was his life, and all too soon death, that gave Queen that magnifying allure, in a time before twenty four hour celebrity culture (and STD awareness only just breaking through.) Despite his obviously wild excesses, it's commendable of Singer that he's managed to portray them in a restrained way, giving the film a more encompassing 12 certificate. And all the more good that Malek's lead performance is so mesmerising, drawing you in like a magnet.<br/><br/>Geniuses cure medicines, invent devices, and write ground-breaking music, and Freddie Mercury was definitely one such tortured soul who did just that. If you weren't able to grow up with Queen, then this incredible dramatization of their lives will at least give you the experience. ****"

I also thought Rami Malek was pretty faultless as Mercury - I wasn't too familiar with him before this film but I was impressed.<br/><br/>A film about Freddie Mercury and Queen was long overdue and I thought 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lived up to expectations.

"ThatGuyReviews","5","1","2","14 October 2019"," Mercury, and Malek, Deserved Better
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a mess of a film that disrespects its inspiration and comes off as a cheap attempt to draw Academy attention. The average movie-goer will be disappointed by a bland and one-note story that creates a cheap narrative out of an interesting life story and fans of Mercury will be even more frustrated by egregious inaccuracies that serve to only lessen the impact this film could potentially have had.
Bohemian Rhapsody follows the rise of the world-famous rock band Queen, leading up to their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Specifically, the movie focuses in on Freddie Mercury and his relationships. This ends up coming off as insincere, however, given the extreme liberties taken with the reality of this complex man, instead reducing him to a character. Even on a cinematic level, it feels as though everything was thrown at the wall just to see what would stick. Weirdly experimental shots seem to only attempt to draw praise for being ""creative"" while serving no legitimate purpose. The piss-poor sequencing and editing added to the jumpiness of these scenes. Some of this can also be blamed on the tasteless set design that does nothing to place the audience in the world of Queen nor the time period, save for a short section set on a farm (that was entirely made up). Thankfully, the costume design is not quite so boring, but does, at times, come off as unnatural, especially with the appearance of an unrecognizable Mike Myers cameo that is a bit too much of an on-the-nose reference to Wayne's World.
Its glaring faults aside, Bohemian Rhapsody is not a complete failure by any means. Most of the shots still look good enough, if overly dramatic; the performances are a tour de force of choreography, though often put to the side to continue the infuriating plot; and the acting was quite good all around, aside from a disgustingly overacted Mary Austing by Lucy Boyntown (though this may simply be due to a horrid script). However, the real saving grace of this film is Rami Malek. Despite all the drama surrounding the behind-the-scenes of the production, Malek is able to pull off the impossible and save this movie from a truly negative impact. Malek is not acting like Freddie Mercury, he completely embodies the person and all of his mannerisms. It is spine-chilling to see all the effort put into flawlessly recapturing the magic of his stage presence. Still, this is not enough to correct for every mistake made on every other level of production. Bohemian Rhapsody comes off as a stale, uninspired of a man with an amazing story, sidelining a band with an equal amount of potential to be drawn on. The unfortunate reality though, is that Queen will never receive the depiction they really deserve without the talent of Malek as Mercury.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody Letter Grade: D+"

"samwillpearce","7","1","2","7 October 2019"," A wonderful tribute to Queen and Freddie Mercury
","Going in to see ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" I had no idea what to expect. On one hand, critics gave it mixed reviews at best. On the other, it earned $51 million during opening weekend (according to Deadline) and received 8.4 stars on IMDb. Whatever I expected, I most certainly did not anticipate turning up to the theater only to find literally every single seat sold out in the entire theater except one. And I saw it four days after it came out!
There's no denying ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has nearly become a cultural phenomenon, despite barely being out a month. From giving new life to the classic Queen hits to fueling people's fascination with the enigmatic legend that was Freddie Mercury, this film was a long time coming (and rightly so!) But did it live up to the hype? Sort of. The film was incredibly strong in some parts, weak in others.
The main issues lie with the beginning of the film, the pacing and the film's focus. At the start of the film, rather than a slow start gradually introducing us to Freddie and the rest of the band in kind, we are immediately launched into Freddie joining the band and producing hits with them; they release their smash-hit ""Killer Queen"" less than 15 minutes into the film. This issue ties into the focus of the film: is this a movie about Freddie? Or the origins about Queen? Is it about their journey to the top of the charts? Or is it about the band members' personal struggles? This issue could have been fixed one of two ways: either focusing a lot more on the band as a whole at the beginnings of their career, or cutting the opening entirely, merely introducing us to the band after they have already become famous. This would have clarified the themes a lot more and made it feel less convoluted.
In addition, the pacing is difficult to keep up with. As I mentioned, the movie starts at lightning speed, taking Queen from a college band to an international hit-maker within a matter of minutes. Around the halfway mark however, the movie slows to a near halt, examining Freddie's personal life in great detail and at great length. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated a deeper, more introspective take on Freddie, but this once again made the film confusing and muddied the director's intentions.
There was, however, a great deal the film did right. Most outstanding was Rami Malek's at times charming, at times perplexingly weird, yet altogether captivating performance as the incomparable lead singer of Queen. He gives the character his all, bringing charisma, quirks, and above all a real humanity that every actor aspires to bring to his or her character.
In addition, the look of the film was exquisite: the color, the costumes, the sets, the unique camera techniques all perfectly complimented the mood. Not only did the look excellently capture the 70s/80s nostalgia the film was so clearly aiming for, it also highlighted the confusion, the glory, the frustration and the triumphs so common in the lives of these rockstars. It really put the audience in the minds of Queen; it brought dimension, depth and genuine empathy from the audience.
One of the most notably good aspects of the movie: it's funny. It's so funny. This film has no pretense of being some jaw-dropping, epic, greatest-movie-of-all-time drama; it perfectly balances its more poignant moments with jokes that had the entire theater roaring with laughter.
All in all, ""Bohemian Rhapsody's"" comedy, its music and its endearing portrayals keep the film an entertaining audience pleaser through and through despite its flaws.
The overall best thing about the movie, however: the hair. Absolutely brilliant."

I'm not old enough to have lived through the rise of Queen but this movie gave me an insight into just how truly special and once in a lifetime this band were. The end sequence of Live Aid did seem a very easy way to fill 20 minutes of screen time but it was captured perfectly and just allowed me to immerse myself into the music and appreciate the showmanship of arguably the best performer in music history."

","Perhaps I expected too much but I was very disappointed. The script was hackneyed and very cliched and I thought this didn't help the actors at all, also the story didn't flow. I didn't really feel that you got to know any of the characters, they were very much cardboard cut-outs. The music was great but then we knew that anyway, for me it was the only good thing about the entire movie. Sorry, I hate giving bad reviews."

","I'm a huge fan of Queen and Freddie Mercury was such a legend, his loss was a tragedy to the whole music industry, so I was so looking forward to this film, but for me it falled flat. The music, of course, was the only saving grace and the clip at the end of the film with Freddie singing 'don't stop me now' was the best part. The actors looked like a badly scripted tribute band, Rami Malik's teeth dominated his face and just annoyed me. Brian May's part was just boring, the story was uninteresting and lacked depth and drama, so disappointing."

","I actively liked most band-related movies with Beatles, Floyd, Doors and many more.<br/><br/>This one just failed to move me. The actors play great and resemble the original members alright. The clips certainly rock. But the story is meh either as documentary or simple storytelling.<br/><br/>I suggest to rather watch the Queen Wembley concert or Hungarian Rabsody or the clip collections, many exist, instead of this."
"nikolay-golubev","5","1","2","20 July 2019"," Plain plot, lots of factual errors
","I started asking myself ""who's the audience of this movie?"" since first half an hour of watching. I've got no answer yet, after watching it completely. The movie doesn't tell neither the story of Queen, nor the story of Freddie Mercury. It's very vague, everything goes smoothly, and there's no real story of the band to remember. On the other hand, the movie has too many factual errors for any Queen fan to watch it without crying out ""whaaaat?"" every now and then. Nor is it a biopic, as it's rather a caricature of Freddie Mercury, which becomes especially visible during ending credits, when real footage of Freddie is shown. And obviously, it's not a strong movie to marvel, as the plot is quite plain, and none of the acting is convincing.
So, if you want to watch Queen in action and listen to their music, watch their live videos or Greatest Flix. And I don't see any other reason to watch the movie. 5 stars only because it's Queen's music, an attempt to tell a story of the great band, and it's not outright awful."
"kerri_75","10","1","2","9 July 2019"," Why this movie succeeded... the music & Rami!
","Here are some very common criticisms about this movie that I want to address:<br/><br/>1) Facts/timelines being altered and Freddie's sexuality being ""sanitized"", whitewashed"", ""watered down"", etc: Not everyone cares that facts weren't exactly facts. This isn't a documentary! And not everyone wants or needs to see Freddie snorting coke and having sex to know he was wild. We know his history. This movie was a celebration of the music.<br/><br/>2) ""The lip syncing Rami Malek"": If people care to do research about these things, they'll know that Rami didn't lip sync. He sang every day and Freddie's voice was mixed with his in post-production.<br/><br/>3) I find it hilarious that people have criticized the size of Rami's fake teeth in the movie and call it a caricature of Freddie. Honestly...where have they been? Did they ever look at the real Freddie in video or pictures? He had both massive teeth and a massive overbite. You could see the full size of them when he smiled fully, which didn't happen often because of how self conscious he was. Rami actually had a larger set of teeth initially that were closer to Freddie's real size but he couldn't get comfortable with how big they were so they downsized them. By criticizing Rami's fake teeth they are criticizing Freddie's real teeth. They were a unique trait of his and something he decided to not change about himself, and they had to be honoured in the movie in the most true-to-life way possible.<br/><br/>4) The biopic cliches such as humble beginnings, rise to fame, struggles with drugs/alcohol/sex, band breaking up, seeing the error of their ways, redemption: The fact is that because of fame, excessive amounts of money, and rising egos, a lot of these cliches depicted in biopics are actually the real struggles that people in the music business go through. It's not as far-fetched of a concept that people think it is just for the sake of a Hollywood story. And other than some inaccuracies shown like Freddie breaking up the band, everything else that fell into the cliche categories was pretty much true for Queen and Freddie. They even said themselves that Live Aid was the performance that re-solidified them as a group because at that point they didn't know if they had a future together and were on the verge of breaking up.<br/><br/>5) Some people think this movie is overrated and don't understand why people like it so much... Overrated..? Really? It started getting hate when the trailer dropped in spring of 2018. Then when the movie came out it got dumped on even more, which continued right through awards season, and then when Rocketman came out it got yet another dumping. The fact that it won 4 Oscars, made a lot of money at the box office and has a very good IMDb rating makes it a classic case of the underdog coming out on top. Much like the song Bohemian Rhapsody, it survived the hate and has almost been a kind of Phoenix rising from the ashes...getting beaten down over and over but still managing to conquer the odds and become a hit. That is why you should never underestimate the underdog and allow yourself to fall victim to the critics opinions, which by the way, are NOT gospel. People need to form their own opinions of movies and not let the critics sway them so easily.<br/><br/>Now..the reason this movie has been such a success is because it was as if Rami Malek brought Freddie back from the dead! That coupled with the exhilarating music and performance scenes (especially the outstanding Live Aid scene) brought on a certain ethereal quality that inevitably captured so many people's hearts and made them cheer on the resurgence of the greatest rock band, and the greatest frontman, of all time. Watching this movie makes you feel like you're in a time machine!<br/><br/>6) Many people can't believe the movie won 4 Oscars. It shouldn't be hard to understand:<br/><br/>Best Actor: this one's obvious. Rami was on fire!<br/><br/>Sound Editing/Sound Mixing: also obvious. Music movies always have an advantage when it comes to awards season.<br/><br/>Film Editing: the one that has been criticized to an absurd amount and been made into a huge joke everywhere online because of one very poorly edited scene and because everyone has bonded over the idea that that scene is representative of the entire editing process. The reason the movie won this is because of the Live Aid scene. Watch comparison videos on YouTube of the real Live Aid vs. this one and it's clear as day why it deserved to win. Not to mention all of the performance scenes were edited really well with lots of fast cuts to provide energy to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I adore this movie! Rami was brilliant and it was fun and lively, with a killer soundtrack! The Live Aid sequence especially blew me away. I've never seen a real life event replicated so perfectly and in such intricate detail. I wish people would realize how unfairly harsh they've been on the movie. It brought back Queen's music for all the generations and was a great, uplifting celebration of the band and Freddie! I don't know why they were expecting something else..."

","I really enjoyed everything about this movie, great acting, awesome music, decent storyline. I came to the theater thinking this would be a boring documentary or mockumentary, but I left the movie thinking about Queen and Freddie Mercury.
I felt I was actually watching Freddie Mercury, Rami had everything down to a tee.
The other actors were believable too, I almost didnt recognize Mike Myers.
Overall this movie was nothing less then epic. I do feel however they could of left some of the gay themes out , and focused more on the music."
"telavivid","5","1","2","1 April 2019"," It's okay
","It's a good movie with a very good cast, the music is obviously great. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first big role for Rami Malek and he carries it (although for the first half hour, I couldn't help but think that's just Rami Malek with a wig). The reason why I'm giving the movie only 5/10 is because as far as the script goes, it doesn't give me anything more than a Wikipedia article. Being an artist usually means maintaining a certain image, but making a movie about artists' lives - at least for me - promises a more in-depth look of their personal battles, evolution, relationships etc. Here, everything you see, you already know. So, the film felt like a long music video intertwined with scenes, marking well-known moments of their professional career highlights and a little bit of personal moments (nothing you don't know). The director and the scriptwriters could have achieved much more with a run time of 2 hours."

Of course I believe that these people who criticized, their criticism was not about the film and if it was going to be good enough for the Freddie Mercury understand? good in my opinion was a magnificent work is not clear 100% truthful because it is not documentary is a movie. I believe the director did an incredible job, now let's talk about Rami Malek! what about that boy. a boy who appeared in Unseen Twilight appears playing the greatest star on earth. incredible performance of Rami Malek. Many, many memorable moments, but the Live Aid performance recreated: it is one of the best scenes I have ever seen - and I have seen lots and lots of films.

"VanillaHammer","5","1","2","23 March 2019"," Entertaining Biopic which changes the truth for entertainment value
","As far as movies go this is entertaining enough, it's just a shame they chose to make a lot of the stories up. Queen and Freddie Mercury had entertaining enough adventures without having to make characters up just so they can get a pop culture reference in (Mike Myers). It also wasn't necessary to change how the band was formed, how they went on hiatus, or how Freddie met his last partner (just to name a few). The really surprising part is that Brian May and Roger Taylor played a big role in the storyline and were happy to change it, which says something about their need to keep the band relevant since Mercury's death."

In fact I'm convinced Brian May played himself (extraordinary what hair dye & a bit of makeup can do!) And they made my day by leaving out of 'Hammer to Fall' the line I hate more than any other - ""Just surrender and it won't hurt at all.""

","My wife and I watched this in March 2019 at home on BluRay from our public library. I watched it again in January 2020. Picture and sound are first rate.<br/><br/>This movie almost swept the film awards season, winning many of them and just missing ""Best Picture"" Oscar. But Malek did get the Oscar for his performance.<br/><br/>Back when they were most popular I never recall paying any particular attention to the rock group ""Queen"" but as a music lover have long been aware of their name. And of course the lead singer Freddie Mercury, without him in particular this would have been a very forgettable band.<br/><br/>Rami Malek, who shares similar ancestry, plays Freddie Mercury who in real life died at 45 of complications from AIDS. Malek was fitted with prosthetic teeth and given more width to his nose to more resemble Mercury. Malek sings, to provide realism, but all the singing we hear in the movie is Mercury's voice, the credits simplay say ""Queen"" for each song.<br/><br/>Overall a brilliant biopic of a very complicated musician and singer who was determined to entertain and to live his life the way he wanted.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the various extras on the disc, particularly how they developed a new technique to simulate a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the live aid concert in 1985. Basically using individual images of real people, ""extras"" dressed in various garb and performing various motions, then via computer building all those individual moving images into blocks that when complete looked authentically like a large crowd."
"foxhound-37781","9","1","2","13 March 2019"," Truly brilliant portrayal of a truly brilliant man
","I wasn't a Queen fan that much initially. As a guitar player and a music fan myself I found Bohemian Rhapsody to be just too complicated as a song when I'd listen to it because of how many different little bits and pieces it seems to go into....<br/><br/>Well my appreciation for that song has increased ten fold after seeing this film as well as watching Queens 1986 concert live at wembley.<br/><br/>As others have stated, Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddie is a truly oscar worthy performance... from his long hair to his horrendous buck teeth to his ""mr fancy pants"" british accent, Malek does Freddie justice from start to finish. I was most surprised to see Joseph Mozzello taking on the role of the bass player, John Deacon . that's right little Tim Murphy from Jurassic Park is all grown up and playing one of the most pivotal bass players in rock history. He's a spitten image on screen of the real John Deacon from the mid 80's as is the three others. Gwilym Lee's portrayal of Bryan May is sensational and if I was the real Bryan May I would be so proud of this man for not only looking like me, but for behaving and preforming like me.<br/><br/>The later parts of the film shows the bands troubles they faced and their tensions at working together in the lead up to the 1985 wave aid concert. The partying and sex and drugs are shown to be all factors that led to Queens complications as well as Freddie announcing to his band-mates of his aids diagnosis.<br/><br/>The finale of the film is basically the 1985 wave aid performance in which all the songs in their set are disappointingly cut short.... Malek sings like Freddie and Moves like Freddie throughout this entire finale and it serves the entire film justice. BR is a wonderful portrayal of one of the worlds most important bands. It is a shame Sacha Baron Cohen couldn't have played Freddie like originally planned because the Oscar could have easily been his...."
"mbald-93738","8","1","2","13 March 2019"," CAN, ANYBODY!..... Tell me why so many critics slammed this?
","Just watched this for the first time last night with many different viewpoints told to me going in, from and epic masterpiece to basic ""no one to star"" formula shlock. but after the long awaited viewing I must ask: Why all the hate. Granted there where some historical aspects of the film that it could have benefited from, such as Freddie's famous use of cursing to the crowds in concerts, and the fact the band never split up and reunited at the Live-AID Concert. The fact that history in some movies has somewhat artistic license behind it is okay but the fact the movie does this alot can add to a lot of frustrations to some viewer, a.k.a. critics. However, I don't understand the bashing of its historical inaccuracies when films such as The Social Network get praised beyond belief and has ton of events that never happened in real life. So note to critics, learn double standards. If there was anything truly negative to say about the movie is that at the beginning the Freddie meets the members and his future, ""wife"", does feel extremely rushed and not thought out well, however it is saved by AMAZING performances by the ensemble and Rami Malek (who is the scene stealer every second he's in). Overall it was a fair look into the life of arguably the world's greatest musical artist(s) of all time.

","Felt like I had to share my thoughts after seeing the movie. I read some bad critics before that almost kept me from going, but I'm glad I did.
I didn't really know a lot about Queen or Freddie except for some of their hits and the fact that he was gay and died because of HIV. This film was a pleasure to watch and I feel I got to know Freddie a lot better.
I can understand some of the critics: the writing is kind of unnatural and the dialogue too rehearsed. For example at some point the band members get into an argument until all of a sudden someone breaks up the fight by playing this perfect cool riff he just invented and BOOM there's the next hit song and everything's forgotten. I doubt it ever really went like that. The characters also stay very shallow except for Freddie, who I think this film is all about in the end.
If you want a more realistic view, I'm sure there are a lot of nice documentaries.
But to me all of this seemed more like an effective stylistic choice to keep the story moving and make it enjoyable and not too heavy or boring.
So I really enjoyed this movie. It's funny, it's sad, it's learnful, Rami Malek does an incredible job. Seeing Freddie come alive to the music like that was so inspiring and uplifting. And the climax towards the end is so satisfying.
If you like the music, go see it!"

But this film taught me so much more.<br/><br/>It was an incredible story to watch how Queen was formed and their beginnings, how they developed their music and style. Freddie's relationship with the band members and with his manager/lover.
How Freddie was driven by Paul to leave Queen to make solo albums, but becomes trapped in a life of drugs, alcohol and orgies that Paul creates around him - it seemed Paul was drunk on Feddie's success and fame and dragged Freddie down with him<br/><br/>I liked the reunion of the band and thier reaction to Feddie's revelation that he has AIDS, but also his inspiring decision to keep performing as he was born to do, keep writing songs and making albums (that we still love today)<br/><br/>Rami Malek's performance was incredible and he deserves every accolade he received for this film."

","This is a wonderful film It's like you watching one of the queen's live performances as if Mercury soul transmigrated into Malik's body, I mean if Freddie himself see this film he will be confused because Malik wore Freddie's character with its nuances. Rami deserves an oscar for his astonishing work he didn't have much of acting experience on big screens, yet he delivered unparalleled rendering and pulled off a ripper it is been the best performance of this year in my opinion, definitely an oscar worthy. Queen fans will have high expectations of this film they will not be disappointed because this is a superb movie. It's onerous to span years of legend's life in a couple of minutes it's not a perfect biopic, but it's thoroughly compelling and simply one of the greatest revelations there is. You will not regret seeing it He made him seem like an incredibly lovely guy I didn't know much about Freddie I heard some of his famous songs but no more.

This movie has put them in a different light all together!! how they wrote all their songs not just Freddie Mercury but how they put their songs together and on a shoe string. It showed how talented Freddie Mercury was and his love for music, expression and art. He was so flamboyant.....I love him!! how the world has lost such a great man. it was also nice to see his relationship with Mary too who was a big part of his life. Rami sure did his homework on Freddie Mercury as I've since watched interviews and performances by Freddie and Rami has his mannerisms spot on!!! his expressions his stances everything he was brilliant!!! love this movie so much"

","This movie is very insightful to how our parents (the millennials) were, and what their ideas and perspective of what was the ""ideal"" man. It's very weird and awkward to see that this is what men of that time (our parents) thought was what was ideal in a relationship and in society. It kinda takes me a back on why they thought this way, and why they hate on our generation so much, when their generation was so hateful and close minded.<br/><br/>I don't understand why they would hate on our generation for being more open, accepting, and caring of one anther in a social way, when their germination was all about peace, love, and respect (the Lennon movement). It's so annoying to hear my parent's talk about how their generation was so peaceful and advocate on ensuring equality was the social consensus, but can't even see that we're (the millennial) are completely in that social reality, and they are completely criticizing our culture when our culture is completely the same as their's just in a the advanced progressive way. What's more annoying and quite honestly heinous, is that they refuse to acknowledge that our generation is more progressive and more advocates for peace and equality for all, and associate our generation and our generation's culture as reckless, uncooperative, too liberal, and uncultured when we are the epitome of USA culture. I just feel our parents (baby boomers) are completely delusional, and are hating on us (the millennials) because they don't have a sense of identity and they are envious of us because we know who we are as a generation and a community (germination; millennials).
Our generation (the millennials) were given a unique quality and title (the millennials), and our generation is completely associated with peace and equality. Rather... our parents being completely associated with war and destruction. Hence their generation title (Baby boomers). Their generations name is well suited for who they are and what they contribute to society - destroy their children (baby) and world through war(boomers). They are the epitome of screwing it up for the rest for the world and the children of the world that are going to have to be responsible for the mess they messed up and for the consequences for their inability to be peaceful and civil with each other. Then they don't acknowledge that they are the reason why the world is in such a threatened state, when the reality of the world's state is because of their generation's activity, and blame it on the millennials for being ""uncultured"" and ""reckless"" and ""misguided"" when the guidance of us - the millennials - is suppose to be the responsibility of our parents (the baby boomers), and instead, we had to guide ourselves, with the help and unity of our generations community (the millennials). We went against our parent's will and ""morals"" and ""values"" (remember who's who), because we knew that our parent's where going to run us into the ground (literally; kill us), if we listened to them, and just competently followed each other, by uniting together as one generation (millennials) and starting the new trend and social reality for our generation and the generations to come. We established the reality for ourselves, not our parents because that was their culture (war), which was Do (get there; wherever it is that were going) or Die (subject ourselves to the same reality as our parents - war).<br/><br/>There's more to be said, but less space to be provided. And quite honestly, there's no need to even digress or elaborate because the baby boomer's will never be the reason why this world is saved. You can never change who you are. The state of the safety and flourishing of the world will be the millennials, and the demise, which we all know how that will play out (war), will be because of our parents (baby boomers/GI).<br/><br/>The millennials are the all or nothing generation, and the baby boomers are, be happy with what you have. We can't do that as a millennial because our generation has nothing. It's either we get it all, or have nothing at all."

","I had the pleasure of seeing Queen live when I was a teenager in the late 70s here in Vancouver. I was a big fan, as were most of my friends. I still know the words to the songs and I think I practically wore out my vinyl copy of Night at the Opera from playing it so much. I'm pretty sure I drove my parents crazy playing Bohemian Rhapsody, which I sang along to at the top of my voice while locked away in my room. Ah, good times!<br/><br/>While I was watching this movie, I was worried that I was going to be disappointed and that this was going to be nothing more than a high class MOW. But, thanks to the absolutely amazing performance of Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, a terrific supporting cast and some crisp dialogue and really great film and sound editing, the movie turned itself around, and by the time we reached the impeccable recreation on the Live Aid concert at the end, I was in tears, a very, very rare thing for me.<br/><br/>Although I don't think it will the best picture Oscar (that will go to Roma), I'm sure that Malek will take home best actor honours."

","I'm a huge Queen fan but let's face it, this is certainly not a great film. However, Rami Malek is a revelation as he transforms himself into one of the great performers of all time. He becomes Freddie Mercury. If there's a better male performance from this year's crop of Oscar contenders I haven't seen it. Ergo there's the rub. Who is Rami Malek and is he capable of ever scaling these acting heights again?<br/><br/>The Academy has erred before and given the Statuette to performers who never again came close to the caliber of their Oscar winning performances. We know Viggo, Bradley and Christian have done it before and will do it again. Rami could be a one hit wonder. I guess we'll all have to wait and see."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is a well-written Wikipedia article with a fantastic soundtrack. As it jumps from moment to moment in Queen's history, there doesn't really seem to be anything tying the scenes together. And the drama that finally comes in at the end is almost completely manufactured. I also went back and forth on Rami Malek's performance being good or it being an SNL impression. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie, if only because it was like listening to a greatest hits album."

Nevertheless, the movie was all and all enjoyable from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>Even if the Queen members had issues working with Sacha and vice versa, Sacha was the ONE and he would've done an epic tribute, if he simply put his creative comic brilliance on the shelf for this one. In short, everyone involved should've had been professionals and solved their differences in the end. It's a shame it didn't go that way."
"Semisonic","7","1","2","16 February 2019"," A film Freddie would have liked
","My acquaintance with Queen was in the mid-90's, when I was in middle school, it became my first real music passion and still has a tender spot in my heart. So forgive me if I'm a little biased...<br/><br/>Still, I think Bohemian Rhapsody is a film Freddie really deserves. Not a massive and monumentally serious biopic, with lots of interviews with the band members, friends, relatives and whatnot. But a true ""live fast, die young"" flick. One in which it doesn't matter how closely the actors look to their real-life prototypes, how correctly the plot follows the truth of the story and how blatantly it uses the archive sound instead of making some of its own.<br/><br/>This is not about Queen. Queen is four people, and we'd need way more time to look into their lives and their heads to make it substantial, and such substance, in addition to the remaining trio's old and gaunt faces, would be just boring, if not miserable. And Queen was never like that.<br/><br/>So this is a hymn to Freddie himself. Not to the pop culture icon he's become in our eyes, but to the person he's been offstage. The vulnerable and sensitive, but nonetheless flamboyant and daring and believing that punching a hole in the sky was his true and only purpose. Even if half of the events of this film are pure fiction, even if all of it's invented just to give us a taste of what it could possibly have been, that divine flame we could feel within that person is still genuine enough to justify the whole endeavor.<br/><br/>...In that almost academic and definitely too prudent Queen story I read as a kid, they said Freddie could've possibly lived longer - if only he resorted to serious treatment, pressure chambers and so on. But that would mean stomping on the way he lived - and turning into a house-dwelling fungus, just to survive some more. So he decided to burn out but remain who he was, until he wasn't. In that sense, putting the last period in this story right after Live Aid, without six more years and two more albums, follows the same way Freddie would've respected. Not waiting for the last flame to die out but to go with a bang. So that we don't cry that it's over, but that we smile that it happened.<br/><br/>And for all that happened, Freddie and the rest of the guys, I thank you all."
"CryptoGuy","3","1","2","16 February 2019"," The Queen is the Soundtrack
","Aside from the performances, which were wonderful, and the soundtrack, this film is a jumbled mess. Starting with a horrendous script, filled with questionable directing and mediocre cinematography, finally rounding out with some of the worst editing since Taken 3. Big ups to the editors for trying to save the film, no thanks to Singer, but ultimately it only compounded the garbage. Frankly, Malek deserves a nomination just for having to wade through that nightmare. Queen fans will like it for the soundtrack, as well will those unfamiliar with the band. However, this film will not stand the test of time."

","It is clear to us that the biopics usually take their licenses to tell the stories, but what they did with this film is ridiculous, and it is an insult to ANY FAN of Queen. I understand that a millennial who knows absolutely nothing about the band or the history that surrounds it can take this production seriously, but from there to nominate it for an Oscar ... this speaks very well of how devalued these prizes are.<br/><br/>The only thing that can be rescued from this disaster is the performance of Rami Malek, who at times is brilliant, and the dedication that put part of the production in moving the compositional experience of many of the most famous songs of the band, managing to recreate scenes that thrill even those who are not having a good time being witnesses of this fable that is far from approaching the true history of one of the emblematic rock groups of the second half of the 20th century."

"ollie1939-97-957994","3","1","2","23 January 2019"," A disappointing biopic, undeserving of Freddie Mercury's extraordinary talent
","Honestly, I'm sure most people who read this review have probably seen the film by now. It's made huge box office results, split critics but loved by audiences, as evidenced by its (current) place on the IMDB top 250. It recently got Oscar nominations and Golden Globe wins, showing that this review is not going to stop people from seeing it. However, it's frankly underwhelming, far below the standards set by the larger than life band. That's not to say there aren't positives about the film:
1)- Rami Malek is fantastic as the lead part. Despite being a huge fan of his work in 'The Pacific' and 'Mr Robot', I was unsure about how well he would do as Freddie Mercury. However, he truly knocked it out of the park with this one. He makes the frontman seem far more complex and interesting than the film's script ever does.
2)- The Live Aid sequence is great (although it does suffer from some rather dodgy CGI crowd scenes). It gets every little nuance of the performance down to the tee and reminds you how Freddie Mercury and Queen were like no other band ever.
3) Obviously, the soundtrack is fantastic. Honestly, I think Queen's music is likely the reason why this film scored so highly on IMDB. A great soundtrack can cloud people's judgements about a film, since those songs will stay in the hearts and minds of people for years to come.<br/><br/>The big problem that the film suffers from is the script. There's just nothing particularly interesting about it, considering its exceptional star. The first 40 minutes of the film is easily the worst aspect of the film. We never know why or how Freddie became a singer or how he became such a great singer. He and the band hardly seem to struggle at all before they get signed by a manager and become a mega-success. It seems more like a Wikipedia summary rather than a full-fledged, structured script, that features a horrendously embarrassing cameo from Mike Myers ( with the most unsubtle in-joke ever featured in a film).<br/><br/>Freddie's relationships with the other characters are also incredibly weak. Despite the controversy beforehand, I can't say I took too much of an issue with how they deal with Freddie's sexuality. However, it does seem a little odd that Freddie's biggest relationship with his female partner Mary. Whilst it does feature more of Freddie's sexuality later in the film, it does seem strange that he never really has an impactful relationship with anyone other than Mary. Even still, her character is so weak that we never really get a sense of what she meant to Freddie. One minute, they're in love and the next minute, Freddie admits his sexuality and leaves her. It's rather odd that the film didn't attempt to expand on this.
Furthermore, I felt sorry for John Deacon (not a producer on the film) , considering Brian May and Roger Taylor (both producers) seem to get most of the credit for the band's success. They get the most screen time in the film besides Freddie, most likely due to their involvement with the film's production. Mind you, all the characters are pretty two-dimensional besides Freddie. I wouldn't have been able to distinguish any of the band member's if it wasn't for their already well-known status (and their wigs). Take away Queen's music and you get a cookie-cutter portrayal of a man struggling with his fame. Nobody would even be talking about this film if they hadn't licenced the music from Queen. It honestly reminded me a lot of Clint Eastwood's 'Jersey Boys' in terms of how the film was structured. It's just one event after another. They make hits without ease, with some melodramatic squabbling thrown in. Like that film, I never understood why Freddie falls out with the band. One minute, they're getting along and making hits and the next, he decides to leave them.
I didn't hate this film. I was singing along to all of Queen's songs and the band has certainly dominated my Spotify listening since watching it. The film just never arises above what could've been a fantastic movie. Queen deserved better than this!"
"jljacobi","7","1","2","18 January 2019"," Very good, but spotty flow
","If you like Queen, and with their iconic rock anthems, just about everyone does, you'll like the movie. The acting is top-notch, and Malek nails the conflicted Freddy.<br/><br/>That said, I personally would've like a bit more about the early days of the band. The movie synopsizes those years and events in favor of Freddy's admittedly more interesting story, but the result is that the rest of the band members seem relatively two-dimensional.<br/><br/>I suppose my real complaint is that while this is indeed really a biopic of Freddy Mercury, it's just a little bit too much so. It's dead-on in portraying his conflicts with his gay lifestyle and the lifestyle itself, but overboard with it. There's way more than is required to make the point.<br/><br/>It's a very good movie but a slightly shorter cut would make it even better. Just an opinion. You feel good at the end, regardless of Freddy's doomed circumstances, a tricky bit, so that's a plus.<br/><br/>Worth watching."

The cast seemed great both in talent and especially appearance. The cinematography was fun. The story of Freddie is interesting. Particularly the segment where he fails as a solo artist because he doesn't have the support and criticism of his bandmates.<br/><br/>Most of the story seemed pretty accurate, although I was able to spot a few continuity errors. They showed the band playing a song off the Jazz album in a concert prior to A Night at the Opera which came first. I'm pretty sure the rest of the band didn't know about Freddie's diagnosis prior to their Africa Aide concert. Although It seems true that Freddie himself knew about his condition and he told his bandmates something similar to what we see in the film prior to telling the media about having HIV.<br/><br/>I felt about 10 minutes could have been shaved off the runtime too.

The real high point of the film is defiantly Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury, he is spot on with every action and word, I didn't see an actor I saw Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>However, the film is cliched, especially in the first act where it had me cringing at some points. But the only true downside to the film is that it could of benefited more from having an R rating. We hear about the things Freddie Mercury does, yet we don't see them. I believe it would have been more impactful if we had seen the things Freddie regrets not heard about them.<br/><br/>Restricted by its restrictions, but a great watch from start to finish.<br/><br/>8/10"
"lie_horcrux","8","1","2","15 November 2018"," I got to know Queen ever since i watched this and turned out I love their songs!
","I didn't really know Queen before, I heard the band name and know 1 song (Love of My Life). I heard of Freddie Mercury name but never know anything about him at all. It's because i was not born yet on Queen's prime time and i was just 2 yo when Freddie Mercury died. So anyway, after watching this movie, i got curious about the band and i am reading a lot of articles, i am watching youtube about the band and of course about Freddie Mercury. I am become fascinated by them, how wonderful and awesome they are. And even though I'm not rock kinda person, surprisingly I love their songs. My favourite right now are Don't stop me now and Radio Ga Ga.
I can't comment on whether Rami Malek perfectly represented Freddie or not and I don't see it as crucial thing for me. The important point for me are I got to know the awesome band Queen and their then frontman Freddie Mercury, and I got to know their awesome songs and really enjoying it right now.
So thank you for making this movie."
"judeknicks","8","1","2","15 November 2018"," Electrifying & Dazzling, with some cheese
","Music biopics are arguably more entertaining than documentaries since they tell a (largely) true story about the subject matter while following a cinematic movie formula. However, this happens to be the biggest weakness for them, as history is often rewritten and edited for the sake of dramatic effect. Since this review is overall positive, I will begin with the negatives by addressing historical inaccuracies as one of the films biggest weakness. For Bohemian Rhapsody, the same issue occurred during the writing of the script, which made many of the dramatic elements seem overacted and unnecessary. Many moments of Freddie's real life are implemented into the story to add tension and drama to the relationship among the band members when in actuality there was not nearly the same level of tension. The film is being heavily criticized by liberals for being demeaning towards the LGBTQ, where really the issue I have is that it often portrays Mercury as the cause of all the band's problems just for dramatic effect. While largely paying homage to the legend, many parts of the film make him look like the stereotypical asshole diva superstar that was not the complete truth. I will not further describe which scenes are historically inaccurate, but I will leave a link to a page that will gladly do so, if you dare.<br/><br/>Another aspect of weakness that I found with the film was the dramatic ""cheese"", moments added to add drama to make the film more like a film. To me, these attempts to make the biopic more cinematic came across as, to quote Childish Gambino, ""unnecessary"". Even with the largely amazing performance from Rami Malek (more on him later), there were moments where his dramatic acting fell short and the scene came across as almost laughable. While I do have more to say on his performance and the performances of the other cast members, I do not believe that Malek deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>With that said, the film also seemed to rush through the rise of Queen as a band and their ascent to fame. It takes a matter of twenty minutes or so for the band to go from starting off to signing with John Reid (Aiden Gillen, did good), which was a big deal since Reid was the manager for Sir Elton John. Many biopics follow suit with this as well; Straight Outta Compton, still the best biopic ever, had the rap group's rise and breakup happen within the first half of the movie, which left room for other aspects of the lives involved with the band members. Bohemian Rhapsody wasn't able to use this formula the best way nor did the movie suffer as a whole, but I certainly would've liked to see more scenes centering on the band's rise. Overall, the film ""needed"" to add drama and fake history to add to the cinematic effect and fill in the runtime. While these aspects may have hurt Bohemian Rhapsody from being truly amazing, the music and performances were amazing.<br/><br/>I must bestow praise to all those involved with camerawork, film editing, and set designers for their amazing artistic input that brought the movie to life. Every music biopic that I have seen has made me appreciate the music and the artist(s) more. I have felt a connection with these films that have made them worth investing time into over and over again. All previous biopics, however, pale in comparison to the magic of Queen that Bohemian Rhapsody brought to life with such realism. The settings, costumes, and perfect recreation of the band's performances allowed this film to emerge from its weaknesses to become a truly enjoyable experience. It also set this film apart from other biopics by adding a unique style and flair that exemplifies what Queen as a band embraced back in the day. It'll send chills through your spine and maybe inspire you to become the next great music artist, because God knows we need much help fixing music (except rap).<br/><br/>The performances by the cast members themselves were amazing across the board, from the band members of Queen to the supporting characters of the story. The highlights were Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury (obviously), who prevails through some bad moments by nailing all the movements and mannerisms of Mr. Mercury. The live performance scenes in particular were perfectly executed, as the lip-syncing and Mercury theatrics would make you believe that Rami was Freddie himself. I was also impressed with Gwilym Lee's excellent turn as guitarist Brian May, achieving the perfect recreation of May from accent to acting according to the scene's tone and objective. One more performance I would like to highlight was Lucy Boynton as Mary Austin, who I believe brought the most emotional complexion among the cast, being able to properly add drama to an otherwise lighthearted film.<br/><br/>Even though I highlighted the recreation of the setting and band performances already, I must write a separate paragraph to highlight the final scene of the film. That would be the re-enactment of Queen's legendary Live-Aid performance at Wembley Stadium in 1985. I have already pronounced it personally as one of the greatest movie scenes of all time, because it perfectly recreates the excitement, energy, and spectrum of the band's performance that they gave many years ago. I felt that I was apart of that crowd and that Rami Malek was in fact Freddie Mercury while being inspiring. When a film can do that to your emotions, it is a truly well-crafted work of art. Call me melodramatic, but I am somewhat of a Mercury-level diva myself.<br/><br/>As with all films, Bohemian Rhapsody is not without flaws; there are moments of overly-dramatic elements, and some of the actual history has been rewritten to add to this effect. These flaws should only be in a made-for-TV movie on Lifetime Network, but certainly not the film's positive qualities. Bolstered by the set design, amazing cinematography, editing, and cast performances, the film is certainly an achievement for music biopics. It brings one of the greatest songwriters and vocalists to life, and gives audiences a movie centered on a band who made music for the people. Critics can say what they want, but ask the fans of rock and they'll place Queen among the greatest acts of all time. The film brought them to life in astounding fashion, and has allowed to world to gain a greater appreciation for art that we may never encounter again.<br/><br/>Overall, I would bestow this film an 8/10, which translates to being worth your $12.
I have already seen this film twice in a span of three days, so it may be worth buying on Blu-Ray eventually."
"nwebner","6","1","2","13 November 2018"," A movie for movie-goers, not for Queen fans
","Bohemian Rhapsody failed in many respects to reflect the accomplishments, the fame, the torment that went through the band and through the life of Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>It failed to entertain us with the music of Queen, giving us just short clips until the end. It failed to show the true Freddie: shy, retiring, an admitted introvert, and the extent of his drug and alcohol use. It glossed over the number of his male partners, and the sickness of his AIDS.<br/><br/>The movie inadequately explained his unremitting, dying even, love for Mary Austin. The movie suggested that they married, but they did not. Freddie said she was his common law wife. He wrote ""Love of My Life"" for her, but it was not included in the movie. She was with him to the end.<br/><br/>There were many factual errors in the movie, which is to be expected in a bio-pic. But two stood out for me: The movie suggested that Freddie was first diagnosed with AIDS and told the band shortly before the Live Aid concert. Not true on both accounts. The movie also recorded that Freddie fired his manager for suggesting he might leave the band to sing solo. However, Freddie made two solo albums and several solo singles.<br/><br/>Many interesting sidelights to Queen were omitted from the movie. When DJ Kenny Everett ""mistakenly"" played (36 times) an unreleased Bohemian Rhapsody"", the phones lit up from fans wanting a copy. Freddie also performed with a ballet troop and recorded an operatic album with a Spanish soprano. He took Princess Diana to a gay bar. Queen's performance at Live Aid is credited pushing response from contributors to a reported Â£150 million.<br/><br/>However, the movie's interpretation of the Live Aid concert was fairly good. The actors even wore clothes identical to Queen right down to the Freddie's belt. But the movie cut at least half off of the actual performance, leaving me wishing for more. (""Freddie"" of the movie omitted Freddie's use of the mic as a phallic symbol and his sexual strutting throughout the performance.)<br/><br/>So much more could have been done with the movie. Freddie's last recording, ""These are the Days of Our Lives"", and the evening Live Aid duo ""Is This the World We Created"" would have made a nice overlay on the screen credits. Regardless of the hype on the movie title, we never heard more than a minute or two of the six minute anthem."
"Dan1863Sickles","7","1","2","12 November 2018"," The Natural, Coming Straight Out of Zanzibar
","The inspiring story of rock star Freddy Mercury comes to life on the big screen, but the way it comes to life is fairly predictable. It's less like RAY or WALK THE LINE and more like STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, or even the old Robert Redford baseball classic, THE NATURAL.<br/><br/>Freddy is a Natural, just like Roy Hobbs. You see he was born with extra teeth so that he has a superhuman vocal range. He's never shown watching earlier rock stars and learning from them -- he just shows up one day with his bat Wonderboy, (I mean with his magic teeth) and suddenly the last place New York Knights -- I mean, the college band Smile -- are on their way to the World Series!<br/><br/>In the Natural Roy Hobbs has two girlfriends. One is kind and good and always dresses in white. The other one is mean and selfish and always wears black. Freddy Mercury has two boyfriends in this movie -- one is mean and the other one is good. And you don't even need color coded outfits to tell them apart! The only question is whether Freddy will choose the right one in time. But most audience members will figure it out without the endless scenes at home. And frankly, watching Freddy feed his cats gets really, really boring.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I loved the way the other members of Queen got credit for writing many of the bands greatest hit songs. I loved how they worked together as a band. I loved the subtle message of tolerance, not just for the LGBT community but for middle eastern culture and religion. I loved all the scenes with Freddy's father and Freddy's patience and determination in going his own way in a new culture. (The way he says so quietly, ""it's Freddy now, father."") I loved how the fantastic live performances told the story, and how the ending is just as exciting as the finale of the Natural. Freddy comes through with the bases loaded, hitting a home run in spite of serious health problems -- just like Roy Hobbs at the end of the Natural.<br/><br/>I just wish they could have created a new kind of story for a new kind of legend."
"sisternuni","8","1","2","11 November 2018"," Good attempt.
","Yes, I liked the movie a lot. I will say my husband enjoyed it a lot more though. I'm the bigger Queen fan so I was more picky about the details and found many irksome. While Mr. Malek does a decent job, it's not what I would have hoped for, but I feel that's due to the direction of the movie where it gets bogged down with some unneeded storylines. There are parts that are rushed into the end of the film for whatever reason and that seems a bit crazy. The chronology is all wrong. Of course, the best part is there Live Aid concert. I only wish the movie had more of this in it."
"sweidman-28016","7","1","2","10 November 2018"," Disappointed But Still Enjoyabe
","Bohemian Rhapsody Review:<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is the story of Freddie Mercury and how Queen became one of the most popular bands. I saw this a week ago and wasn't super excited but thrilled to see it. I love Queen so I thought this would be a nice entertaining movie that people were saying could get nominated for some Academy Awards (even though it hadn't been viewed yet at the time). I liked the movie but was disappointed that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It was a very entertaining movie with great songs but it failed to wow me. People think this movie is amazing and critics gave it a 61% on Rotten Tomatoes (just on the verge of a rotten score). I feel like critics were a little harsh on it and audiences were over rating it. I think the movie would've been much better if they fixed the first act of the movie. It couldn't decide what it wanted to be and there were unnecessary and slow scenes during that. After that 35ish minutes it got better. Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury was a perfect fit. He could get a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. Probably not an Academy Award nomination though. I also really liked Lucy Boynton as Mary Austin. I haven't seen her in many things but I really liked her. One thing is that there wasn't much said about their relationship but it was just there. I would've liked some development there. The songs were great. Everybody in the theater was enjoying them. The story was good although I would've liked to learn more about the others in the band. It didn't really go in depth with them but mostly with Freddie. Also there were too many time skips at the beginning where we learned basically nothing that happened in that time and I wouldn't liked to know what happened. It was also a little long and some scenes could've been taken out. The humor throughout the story worked well. It was a pretty good script. The editing was fantastic, especially when the make the song Bohemian Rhapsody. I won't say what they did but it was something great that I've never seen. The concert scenes, the Live Aid concert in particular, were great. It felt like an actual concert. Overall I would recommend this movie to lovers of Queen. Yes it was an enjoyable film but it had its flaws. It'll be a movie people will think will be snubbed at the Oscars but if it deserves an Oscar I would say editing. Go see it if you have time and want to have an enjoyable time.<br/><br/>My Grade: B"
"ditersaraz","7","1","2","9 November 2018"," A lovely Movie, but
","This movie was a'ight. You learn a lot of things from biopics. For example, I didn't know that Freddie Mercury was born in the multiplayer map from Halo 2 Zanzibar. I didn't even know it was POSSIBLE for a human being to be born in a video game, let alone a video game that was released over four decades after he was born. Maybe, like his last name, it suggests why Queen's music is so good. It's out of this world."

","I rarely do two things -- write a movie review, and rate a movie 10 stars here at IMDb. But I'm doing both for ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" When I left the theater my chest hurt as if I'd been at an actual rock concert, and there's not a thing I would change about the film. It's fast-paced so the 2+ hour run time goes quickly, and the acting, editing, costumes, and especially music are all perfect.<br/><br/>Critics don't seem to like this picture much; I think they were expecting a documentary. Or maybe they just like being critical. Theater-goers seem to love it -- at the showing I attended, most of the time you could have heard a pin drop in the crowded theater. I also heard people crying in spots. If you're not singing or humming Queen songs when you leave, check your pulse to see if you're alive. Simply the best movie of the year."

","""Now we're four misfits who don't belong together, we're playing for the other misfits. They're the outcasts, right at the back of the room. We're pretty sure they don't belong either. We belong to them."" Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek)<br/><br/>
This is a ""Champion"" musical biopic, a fine companion film this year to A Star is Born. The difference is more of Queen's music and less of the private anguishes of Star. Queen never before looked this regal with Freddie's gyrations and their music reminding us how much we loved the big songs, like those of ABBA, whose Mama Mia franchise made me hope also for a sequel to this stellar Queen musical.<br/><br/>Like the song Rhapsody, this film might have instilled doubts that it could have endured the long take (6 min for the song, over 2 hours for the film). Yet, Freddie stays vigorously, infusing each scene with the energy of memorably operatic rock. When Queen invites its rock-concert audience to sing along with We Will Rock You, there's little the cinema audience can do other than raise its arms and sing.<br/><br/>A disappointment of this estimable musical is the little time it gives to the other three Queen members, who are usually relegated to reaction shots. But, of course, the film and memories of the rock band are dominated by Freddie, who, like Mick, knew instinctively how to please an audience while he remained the epicenter of the action.<br/><br/>The downward arc of this romantic tragedy begins when Freddie admits to his band that he has AIDS. Once that point has been reached, director Bryan Singer lets us linger on the possibilities without Freddie's informing everyone. It's not a maudlin time, but a celebration of the time Freddie haws left.<br/><br/>When the band reconvenes, after Freddie's trying to go it alone, the Live Aid concert for Africa, 1985, proves a confirmation that, in the lineup of such greats as The Rolling Stones, Queen is every bit royalty. The re-creation of the concert is masterful.<br/><br/>Five years later Freddie is dead.<br/><br/>Without melancholy, and probably leaving many dark moments unaccounted for, Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration of one of the great rock bands of the 20th century, and one of its gifted musical artists, Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>This musical docudrama will rock you."

Also, instead of showing all Live Aid (which was incredibly realistic (especially Radio Ga Ga moves)) they could give some attention to other events, like creating Under Pressure with Bowie or Freddie's and Montserrat's duet.

Sure one could definitely raise questions around accuracy and some of the story threads are not quite as tight as could be expected from a perfectly delivered movie.

","Before I saw this movie I read some mixed reviews and after seeing it, i can't understand why. I felt there were solid performances all the way around and Malek definitely did his homework on Mr. Mercury. The ending scene in which they chose certain songs at the Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium was spot on and I'm sure Brian May made sure of that. No one in the crowd knew at that time that Freddie was dying of aids but if you ever saw the live performance, Freddie sang his heart out with such emotion, it was heart breaking. The man was a magnificent singer and performer and i was fortunate enough to have seen him live in 1980 at Madison Square Garden , in New York. I remember during a song, some idiot in the crowd throwing a beer bottle that narrowly missed his head. Freddie's response? ""This is what I love about New York!!!""... That's just the type of guy he was and they'll never be another like him. If your a Queen fan, go watch the movie, if you not, you will be after you watch it."
"tm-sheehan","8","1","2","5 November 2018"," Great Nostalgia and Great performance -
","Ami Malek is sensational playing Freddie Mercury in this biopic . The singing is dubbed with a combination of Mercury's own voice and Canadian singer Marc Martel and the first scene they filmed was The famous 1985 Live Aid .Concert which opens and closes the movie.
What is between the opening and closing scenes is the story of an incredible talent matched with an incredible ego that isolated Freddie Mercury at times from those that truly cared for him and supported him.
If it's a true assessment of Mercury's true character and I've no reason to believe it's not he made some terrible judgments as far as his friends associates and his career were concerned but that's perhaps the price of his genius?
I read this was a very difficult film shoot with the director Bryan Singer being fired due to artistic differences with Rami Malek, thank goodness the original choice for the role Sacha Baron Cohen didn't get to play Freddie Mercury.
Rami Malek surely will get a nomination for Best Actor Oscar next year and probably will never get a role as good as this again . I must say the dentures to replicate Freddie Mercury's jaw line I felt were too extreme and took a bit of getting used to but I thought the same about Nicole Kidman's prosthetic nose in The Hours and she won an Oscar for that or some unkind people say she won by a nose.
Apparently as well as watching hours of Freddie Mercury's stage movements and choreography Rami Malek also was advised by his movement coach to study Liza Minnelli in Cabaret as well as Jimi Hendrix , David Bowie and Aretha Franklin all these performers inspired Freddie Mercury's performances and it certainly is evident in the movie.
I didn't come to really appreciate Queen and their brilliance till later in life long after Freddie Mercury had died of AIDS but his story to anyone who lived through that terrible plague and I'm one of them remembers the friends , loved ones and talented performers from all branches of the Arts who's lives were snuffed out prematurely.
I couldn't help thinking that if there had been a Live Aid concert for HIV AIDS similar to the World Famine concert in 1985 how many lives may have been spared ? Alas Ronald Reagan was President till 1989 and his Administration was not interested and apathetic in helping find a cure or even providing relief for AIDS patients until it realised the enormity of the plague and that it infected and involved the whole of humanity ."

","Back in the late 70's or there about, I heard Bohemian Rhapsody on radio. It must have been playing on a rock station and it affected me more than any ""ROCK N ROLL"" song had up until then. I clearly remember mentioning it to my older sisters friends all trendy Rock people who were very quick at correcting me to the fact that this song and group ""QUEEN"" was in no way shape or form ROCK MUSIC. For years after, having now heard more from this ""NON ROCK BAND"" , I was convinced that the snobbery of ROCK PEOPLE was and still is to this day, a people full of BS.
Queen is and always will be the most stunning intricate musically ambitious band ever and tomorrow I will be seeing this film. Hope it meets my expectations.
TOMORROW IS HERE.
In short the film is Stunning. My only criticism is a scene of an elaborate fancy dress party that bored me. Other than that I loved it. Malek became Freddie. I had no idea he was ever in love with a woman although platonic.We all had close girl friends back in the day . They were called ""FRUIT FLIES"". straight girls that liked the company of Gay Men. She was not portrayed as one here.
The opening shot of the LIVE AID Concert is one for the books. Mind Blowing. What can be done today in special effects is truly remarkable.
My personal theory as to the cool low critical reviews is there was not enough queer content for the ""progressive ""straight critics. They needed more gay sleeze and gay degenerate sex to feel liberal. As a gay man I call it guilt Patronising."

The story of how Queen rose to fame is an entertaining one. I found myself both laughing and crying throughout this movie.<br/><br/>Rami Malek deserves an Oscar for his performance. He is nothing short of extraordinary.<br/><br/>So even if your not a huge fan of Queen go see it anyway because I guarantee you will be once the movie is over.

"stevendbeard","8","1","2","4 November 2018"," Really Captures Freddie, Both In Looks & Mannerisms
","I saw ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", starring Rami Malek-Mr. Robot_tv, the Night at the Museum movies; Lucy Boynton-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, Law & Order:UK_tv; Gwilym Lee-Jamestown_tv, Midsomer Murders_tv and Ben Hardy-Only the Brave, X-Men:Apocalypse.
This is the story of the rock group Queen-the title of the movie is from one of their most famous songs-and Brian May is a producer. The film covers how Freddie Mercury meets and joins the group and then leads up to their Live Aid concert in 1985-FYI: Freddie Mercury died of complications of AIDS in 1991. Rami plays Freddie and he really captures Freddie, both in looks and his mannerisms. I wasn't sure if Rami was actually doing the singing-it looked like he was-but I read that they used a mixture of 3 voices; Marc Martel, Freddie Mercury and Rami Malek. Lucy plays Rami's girlfriend, Gwilym plays Brian May and Ben portrays Roger Taylor. There is a nice cameo from Mike Myers-you probably will not catch it because of his make-up, but listen for his voice. The performances really look and sound good, so if you are a Queen fan, you should enjoy the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for suggestive material, drug content and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.
I am a Queen fan-I was lucky enough to have seen them in concert, in fact I took my soon to be wife-so I might be biased, but I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"brendan-hemens","10","1","2","4 November 2018"," Critics have it wrong...
","...just like their first reviews of Bohemian Rhapsody the song. We enjoyed the movie immensely - it seems to move too quickly at first, but then we didn't realize how many hits they had right off the bat. It does settle into an emotionally engrossing story, with sooooo many hits woven in. The acting is superb, the story challenging, and the ending was as awesome as it was true."

"flicklover","9","1","2","4 November 2018"," Like Queen's music, rousing and heartfelt.
","I have to say that when I read about the problems involved in the making of this film I feared that it would be a mess. I was wrong. I am not the biggest Queen fan but as a Rock fan I recognize that they were a very unique sounding band, rarely formalaic. Also, Freddy Mercury is one of the best rock performers ever.<br/><br/>The film is not unique in that it presents the start and rise of the band. What I loved was that it was about the MUSIC!!! The movie does focus o. Freddie and the already known parts of his life. His partying, homosexuality, drug use etc
I do feel that the decision was made that they wanted a PG-13 rating so the film doesn't go for graphic depictions of Freddie's antics. But I do think that the film presents him as a man that was very confident and at the same time yearning to be accepted. Especially by his father. It presents his loving relationship with Mary Austin in a very sweet way. Even though he was a homosexual, she was the love of his life. It also presents a very honest portrait of his last relationship with a man named Jim. Many critics are complaining that the film is to superficial, that doesn't go deeper into who Freddie Mercury was. I disagree. I think that the point is that his contribution to the world was his and Queen's music. So many movies like this focus on the drugs, sex and the downfall of bands and artists. A film that comes to mind is The Doors. That film was great but its approach was different. Very ethereal but also never really showed Jim Morrison as a real human being.Oliver Stone and Val Kilmer showed him as a horrible drunk egomaniac with that despised everyone. Even though I like that film, it is a real downer. This film as directed by Brian Singer is a rousing and entertaining look at a legendary band and performer. We all know that he tragically died of AIDS but the film ends with Queen's incredible performance at Live-Aid. It is one of if not the greatest recreation of a real music event that I have ever seen. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Just like Queen's music never really got the respect of music critics, this film is not getting the reviews it deserves. Even if you are not a big Queen fan, this film is worth seeing because of the joy of music that it shows!"

"queenofrock66","9","1","2","4 November 2018"," Magnificent tribute to legendary genius
","I'm not going to fuss over some of the historical inaccuracies as the overall film is a trimphant tribute to a creative, innovative and visionary band that has NO peers that come close to the sheer genius, spearheaded by Freddie Mercury<br/><br/>His portrayal by Rami Malek as multifaceted, lonely and full of equal parts bravado and vulnerability speaks volumes of his craft as an actor.<br/><br/>The nuanced details of the onscreen Brian May is also fabulous...and this is really how I would sum up the movie...as Freddie would say, ""it's fabulous daaaarling!"""

"grantscharoff","10","1","2","4 November 2018"," Between Night and Day
","I was born in 1976. That year ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was the number one hit. And the next album ""A Day at the Races"" was coming out following ""A Night at the Opera"". These albums have been around literally my entire life. Of course, I got aware of Queen later - in 1984, when I was 8, with ""Radio Ga Ga"" and ""I Want to Break Free"".<br/><br/>I remember the day when Freddie died. I was 15 then. I was in a hurry for school, under the shower in the morning when I heard it on the radio. I was shocked! Now 27 years later... compared to the 18 years of active life of the band with Freddie, I realise what a tremendous loss Freddie's death brought to music. I can only imagine what could have Freddie and Queen come up with for these 27 years more...<br/><br/>An extraordinary band - well-educated people, very smart and intelligent, extremely talented in music - this is the movie they deserved to be made. A great movie about a great world class superstar band - a movie that will last in time exactly as the band did. (I hope it wins a few Oscars).<br/><br/>I have all Queen albums, I've seen them live on a concert (post-Freddie unfortunately), I've seen the musical ""We Will Rock You"" twice - the first time Brian May showed up... and I hope this movie inspires Roger Taylor and Brian May to write one more album! Please, guys, do it. And even if the movie changes John Deacon's mind and brings him back to the band - it would be one last great tribute to the legacy of Queen and Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>The wonderful thing is - so much greatness is left out of the movie... I understand that. Queen are bigger than a movie, they are larger than life.<br/><br/>Thank you, boys, for the Show, that's been around my entire life! And I'm sure It will go on forever!"

"Don_VinoRosso","8","1","2","4 November 2018"," Better than its Metascore
","The film might not be a historically accurate Biography about Queen, nor can any of it ever really resemble the real energy of a Queen's live performance, but it's great and worth watching. Malek gives his best to portray Mercury who clearly is the person in the centre of the movie. The other actors also make a good job, even if they get not nearly as much screentime, but how could they-the film is 134min long and this is just enough to focus on Mercury-so I might have liked to see a TV series of it to make it more accurate and more fulfilling for the hardcore Queen fans. Yet still, I think the biggest achievement of this movie and it's actors is making you feel Freddy's emotional journey as well as the fascinating and amazing music. So don't waste too much time on Wikipedia learning Queens biography but buy a ticket, take your seat and the movie ""will rock you""."

"Benslie","9","1","2","3 November 2018"," It's a pretty good biopic.
","First of all Rami Malek did a fantastic job as Freddie. He deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as the lead singer. He brought real depth to him like he made him seem like an average person that everybody can relate to. Some people can even relate to his struggles that he goes through during the movie. The film also showed you not just the ups of the group but also the downs. Not a lot of biopics will do that and I'm really glad this one did. I also really liked how the film made it seem like you're a fly on the wall during the events. It took you into their process of making the famous songs that we all know and love to this day. One thing that I want to know is how much time and effort went into making the costumes in this film? Cause all costumes looked like the ones they wore in real life. If they don't win for best costumes then I'll be really upset. Now, this film only had a few issues for me. For example, in a few scenes, the pacing was off. They rushed through a bunch of different things that were kind of important to the plot or at least so we can better understand how the songs were created and the main relationship. But I can understand cutting some scenes short seeing how the film is already 2 hours and 15 minutes long. This is just me being nit-picky here but I also wish there more songs in the film. In the end, Bohemian Rhapsody is a pretty good film for people who are fans of Queen, heard of them, or who just want to see a good biopic movie."

"Emmet_L_Brown","10","1","2","3 November 2018"," The waiting was not in vain...
","I was waiting for this movie since I saw the first trailer, many months ago. I grew up listening to Queen, and the first record I recall hearing was Queen Greatest Hits, when I visited relatives once in a while, we had no turntable at home back then.<br/><br/>Fast forward to my teenage years, I vividly remember watching Revenge of the Nerds and having goosebumps while listening to We Are The Champions, in the end, boy this tune still has the same effect on me nowadays.<br/><br/>Other notable Queen moments include Who Wants to Live Forever, Don't Stop me Now and of course Bohemian Rhapsody (and the famous Wayne's World scene) plus many other songs I become to appreciate over the years. My biggest regret, not being old enough to have seen them live.<br/><br/>So, after watching Bohemian Rhapsody, titles (and tears) rolling, I was sitting there, in awe, flabbergasted, thinking ""Blimey, what the hell have I just seen?""
Yes, it has some inaccuracies here and there, but don't let them distract you from the artistic value, the big picture (pun intended) shown to the audiences. A great tribute to a great band, a great lead singer and an emotional journey.<br/><br/>Go watch it, is a keeper, one of those movies you have to see once (or many times) in your life...<br/><br/>The Show Must Go On!<br/><br/>10/10"

I was born in the late 80's and I've always told people I was born in the wrong era. This movie just confirmed that, the whole way through I was just in awe of what an amazing, beautifully talented band Queen were. Freddy was such a performer and watching this, I had goosebumps but also I couldn't stop thinking about how bone chillingly exciting it would have been to see them live. For anyone that managed to, I hope you hold onto those memories for the rest of your lives also, I am very jealous."

What a performance, truly amazing. RIP Freddy"
"Piipz","10","1","2","3 November 2018"," What just happened
","Im close to 40, so I guess I have the right to say I've been a true fan for a long time. When Queen+Adam Lambert performed, I really did not want to go there. It felt wrong without Freddie. So I went to see the movie with mixed feelings. Like how can somebody possibly even try to play Freddie, it should be impossible. Ok, yes, i bet the actual singing in this movie wasn't done by Rami...but.... oh my god was I wrong! I cried numerous times during this movie and I couldn't actually talk for a while after I left the theatre. I was speechless. I have never ever felt that way watching ANY movie. So if you are a true Queen fan, don't be afraid. This movie is worth it. I don't know if it is the best movie i've ever seen, but no other movie has ever made such a huge impression to me. By the way, real May and Taylor can be seen in that movie. Can't tell you when, would be a spoiler. But when I saw them, I started crying again. I'm a grown man. I never cry. Except this time."

","I'm a huge Queen music fan, though I was never interested in their lives so much. Still, I was looking forward to this. Unfortunately, it was a letdown.<br/><br/>Firstly, it tells us nothing about the characters. It doesn't help that they skip one whole year after the characters meet... what happened in that time??<br/><br/>We never learn anything about the band or Mary as people. The film makes the mistake of tell, don't show (as opposed to ""show, don't tell"").<br/><br/>They mention that Brian May is an astrophysicist... twice. But we learn nothing about the man. Roger Taylor's a lady's man apparently (we're told three times). Who was Mary before she met Freddie? We know nothing.<br/><br/>Of course, you could argue that it's supposed to be Freddie's show. Okay, but I just couldn't see Rami as Freddie... it was like a celebrity impersonation... very superficial. Acting with his eyes most of the time.<br/><br/>Also, silly cameos like Mike Myers saying something about kids in cars banging their heads to the song (yeah, I get it!) just took me out of the picture.<br/><br/>I also didn't like how they gave Freddie AIDS before Live Aid when pretty much everyone knows it was much later.<br/><br/>Overall it came off like a made-for-TV biopic. Very by-the-numbers and not telling us anything we didn't already know."
"DJWinston","4","2","7","13 January 2019"," ""The Canonization of Queen""
","That should have been the title of this fawning homage to the other band members of Queen. Apparently the three of them were saintlier than Mother Teresa with the patience and understanding and good will of all the saints put together. And newsflash, touring rock bands in the 1980s did not behave like the heavenly host.<br/><br/>Could have been a layered and fascinating movie about actual human beings, but instead we get this self-righteous claptrap of someone's idealized version of what went on. I suspect even Freddie would have been embarrassed by this band ""bio""."
"mnconlon","5","2","7","7 January 2019"," This didn't really live up to expectations
","There have been way too many 10 out of 10's which seems a little to generous. It was nice hear all the queen songs and you get a bit if creative license from the writers on queens history but if it ignores reality then it ignores the potential. It always felt when watching this that queens success needed a bit more struggle along the way to feel more earned but it felt more like a glittzy memory of the writer instead of as honest reflection if what is necessary to give a good true story of every happened. I would have liked to have seen more truth and less fan fiction."
"jmryan-31637","6","2","7","28 November 2018"," A solid movie, an untrue biopic, and a mediocre drama
","Let's get the obvious out of the way, Freddie Mercury and Queen were great. Almost all of their music is classic, and they are forever rock legends. This movie did have a strange and possibly daunting task of representing such a unique man on the screen, and it did pull it off thanks to decent writing and a great performance by Rami Malek. With that out of the way, on to the actual review.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody has a lot going for it. The final Live Aid scene is fantastic, both the music and the performance. Rami Malek shines and the music is very moving. The music throughout the movie conveys the emotion of the characters fantastically (probably because it was written by them) and they do a very good job with Freddie. His character has to balance upon a razor. Move one way, and he becomes a comical gay stereotype. Move the other, and you may lose what was great about Mercury. I'll say it again, Rami Malek made this role successful.<br/><br/>There is much that stands out for this movie, but the catch is that as with many biopics, a good amount of what stands out can be attributed to what happened in real life. In my opinion, the filmaking itself is only decent. There is nothing wrong with it. The lighting, sound design, production, and everything else is alright, but there isn't much in my memory that stands out as above and beyond or incredibly creative. There is the shot near the beginning when Freddie walks out on stage with his arms outstretched, and even that isn't what I would consider to be fantastic. The mediocre production isn't my biggest gripe with this movie however, that would be it's identity.<br/><br/>I can't understand whether this movie really wants to be a biopic or a drama. Yes, movies can be both, but there is a difference in which you put first. This movie changes many facts in favor of a compelling story. Some changes I understand, such as Freddie revealing his AIDs before Live Aid, even through in real life he was diagnosed years after. This compresses time and allows the movie to end on a moving scene that truly captures Freddy Mercury. Other changes only exist to create drama. The band never had a true break up as they did in the movie, and making solo albums was never a huge deal, other members of the band did it first. These take it from a biopic to a drama. However, I don't necessarily have a problem with this. It's alright for a movie to sacrifice truth in favor for a compelling story. A good example is The Social Network, a fantastic movie, not so much a true-to-life biopic. The movie sacrifices truth and non-bias for a fantastic story and characterization. The Social Network isn't about Facebook, it's about someone's need to succeed and what that costs him, and it's done beautifully. Bohemian Rhapsody is simply a mediocre drama. Besides the music and performances taken from real life, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's not bad, just average as far as averages go.<br/><br/>This movie is never a bad movie, but strays from the truth in order to create drama, and said drama is simply average. However, it is very fun for any Queen fans, and I will never be opposed to giving this movie another watch."
"zuniga_hernan","9","2","7","20 November 2018"," A flawed film and performance that will sweep you off your feet
","13th of July 1985, you have probably read the cliche many times by now, but the reality is that it is true. That day will stay with me forever.<br/><br/>I was just a kid of 14th who barely spoke English and I spent the whole day glued to the TV watching the performance like just about half of the planet.
It is be difficult to convey through generations how truly special that concert was, specially in this era where everything is instantaneously available to everyone. That was not the case then. And then came Queen, or rather, Freddie Mercury - I knew and liked them but I had not seen them live. That was it for me, again, forever. I would not call myself a Queen fanatic but obviously I like them<br/><br/>I approached the film with a bit of anxiety and I came out with mixed feelings. However even 3 day later I cannot take it out of my head, to the point that I need to write about it. Let me be straight.<br/><br/>It is an average film that runs superficially through the life and tribulations of the group and Freddie's and ends with a cut down version of the concert.<br/><br/>It is also a far-from-perfect representation of who Freddie was, with little of his charisma and his ""joie de vivre"". Just look in Youtube, there is enough material on him and people talking about him to realise how that guy did not need a costume or a crown to magnetise you and everyone else and how as someone puts it -""if he wanted you, he would have you"". Freddie did not magnetise you because he could do anything on stage, he could do anything because he magnetised you and everyone else along the way.<br/><br/>And yet Malek's performance is astonishingly good, because let's not forget, there is no one like Freddie - and I doubt there will be. He brings part of him, not all of him and at times almost makes you forget.<br/><br/>And the film builds up to an astonishing moment and captures the essence of that moment so accurately that is impossible to shake off. Of course you can see the whole thing in Youtube but, hey much closer if you are in a cinema, or even better in an IMAX.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie, well, it is helpful background to understand the character and, in the end this is just a movie not a documentary (even if the concert is fairly accurate) and takes tons of liberties, but, at least in my opinion, it achieves what is set to do, it entertains and it tells the story, or the essence of it sufficiently well.<br/><br/>Last part, I promise, I have read that this is only for fans. Well, of course, it plays with nostalgia but I essentially disagree. I challenge any newby not to be moved by the concert just like i was in 1985 - it does not matter if you watch the real thing before or not. And if this film gets anyone interested on Freddie believe me the closer you get, the more fascinated you will be.<br/><br/>Summary: Far from perfect film and far from perfect representation, but please do not forget how wonderfully multilayered Freddie was and do not forget that this is a 2h15mins film. Let the story guide you and I very much doubt you will be disappointed.
I give it a 9 - not because it is consistently brilliant but because just some parts are completely off the chart (pretty much like Queen music) and I average out"
"sabariraam","5","2","7","16 November 2018"," Just not up to the level
","First of all to expect a movie to be equal to a legend's music level is quite harsh , yet even when the movie had so much to give through it's music and story it quite didn't make it to the level to get the excitement and screams out of you . I wasn't born in the times of Queens and with all the music ive heard of them , even with that they could have done more . There are many moments of pure goosebumps but yet they don't last long untill they break with a scene which will lead you down . None of the songs even the title was not given the time to make the audience feel it . It was just broken . But still the movie has a lot to give with it's story and about the band .

"MovieSoup","7","2","7","27 October 2018"," The Movember Blockbuster of the year!!
","This is probably one of my favourite films of the year and while far from a perfect movie I do have no major problems with it. Yes there are some things which I will get into but all in all It's good and If you like Queen go see it. OK! There! I've done a short outline for you guys; if you are too impatient to read the rest at least you know my thoughts now go away.<br/><br/>I like Queen as any sane person does and I found this movie to be a realistic, although a little overdramatic, portrayal of their ups and downs culminating in their Live Aid performance. The film did not focus on Mercury too much and instead looked at the band as a whole. I thought this was a good choice as many other documentaries about Queen usually focus on Mercury and that's it.
This was clearly a choice that Brian May and Roger Taylor, who produced the film, made to show the band as a collaborative effort. You really get the feeling that all the members of the band were great songwriters in their own way. The film does explore Mercury's sexuality problems and touches on his home life as well which I thought was a little rushed and not in depth as it should be. I think the main focus here is the band relationship and not the individuals.<br/><br/>For the most part all the scenes do seem genuine and flow very well in the narrative. There are, however, a few moments brought straight out of shlock Hollywood films and that is something I wasn't too impressed with. For instance there's a scene with Bohemian Rhapsody being made that is a bit corny. This is not a major critique however and isn't a spoiling moment.<br/><br/>The performance by Rami Malik as Fred is just wonderful and so realistic at times that I felt completely amerced in the movie. I loved Malik in MR. ROBOT and here he does a stella job bringing a beloved icon to life. The other members of the band were played well by their respective actors. Gwilym Lee was great as Brian May and I did also love the guy who played John Deacon as well.<br/><br/>The draw of the movie will be the music and getting to know the stories behind some famous songs by Queen like ""Another one bites the dust"" and ""love of my life"". All the songs featured were sung by Malik as well which is very impressive and he himself does a great cover of Mercury.<br/><br/>I loved the music in this and thought that It was interesting how some of the time it is integrated into scenes of the bands life whilst other times it is sung onstage by Malik himself. This gives the feeling that the music is the most integral part of the story which, for a film about a band, is essential.<br/><br/>As said I have no problems with this film and it is definitely a great watch with an emotional tread of friendship running through the story. I would recommend this film to anyone, you don't have to love Queen to see it......but it helps."
"sbweightman","7","2","7","26 October 2018"," A great performance, but not a great biopic.
","There's a lot of great elements in this film - the music, the performances, the acting, and the creativity and showmanship of Queen and Freddie Mercury is spectacular. It's entertaining throughout and held my interest as I learnt some new and interesting facts behind their biggest hits. However, as a biopic, it's not so great, as it skips over a lot of the other albums and the story ends at the Live Aid performance. It also doesn't really say or show you anything new about Freddie's life or the other members of Queen."
"monkey_munden","7","2","7","26 October 2018"," Great acting but.....
","If you've never seen any Queen documentaries then this film will not disappoint, the performances are fantastic, the sets superb - I get it, there is only a certain amount of information that can be squeezed in to a film, but with all of the documentaries and books 'out there' it is clear that poetic license was used by the barrow full.<br/><br/>The timelines are out all over the place, the majority of which have been documented, but another one is the splitting of royalties four ways no matter who created the song. In the film we see this occurring before Live Aid, however this agreement only saw the light of day on 'the miracle' album, with most songs on A Kind of Magic (all except One Vision) being credited to their individual creator.<br/><br/>This all said, it is still a great film that leaves you with the general jist of what happened over that 15 year period."
"tymon_tm","5","2","8","12 February 2019"," Wikipedia note turned into a movie
","While there's probably no single rock or pop star, whose life and career isn't entertaining and very ""movie-ish"", creators of Bohemian Rhapsody made the ipossible - they took an icon and turned the story of his (their) success into a shallow, complaisant film. It lacks credibility, grip, depth and 'cojones' to show anything even remotely controversial or 'dark'.<br/><br/>Why? The answer is simple with this one - May&co, the rest of Queen, acted as producers on ""BR"" - instead of getting deep in order to explore this great potential of band's rise and Mercury's life, they basically made a puff piece about themselves.<br/><br/>Cast isn't great as well, Malek's a bit bizarre and over the top with his prominent jaw (it really looks bad and artificial), the rest is as shallow and forgetable as - that's right - a wiki note.<br/><br/>Good movie for a sunday evening, but if nothing more."
"cordenw","5","2","8","13 December 2018"," are you kucking fidding me?
","Let's face it , Queen's music was (and is) fantastic and Freddy Mercury's voice was astounding.
Any film about them is bound to be a spellbinding musical experience and just to find a guy with Rami Malek's moves is a wonder of its own.( Although I'm suspicious as to whether it's his voice they use!)<br/><br/>Such a pity then that the storyline is a little waxen and the acting very wooden.
Rami does not a bad job of playing Freddy but Lucy Boynton is just terrible and the guy from Downton Abbey isn't too far behind (he should go back to being a chauffeur).<br/><br/>It's like the script was written by a 10 year old and the most unwittingly hilarious line is when Freddy says
""I think I'm bisexual""..
No! Say it ain't so...
nobody's noticed until now?<br/><br/>Even his dumb girlfriend didn't cotton on? There he is prancing and preening around like he's a founding member of the LBGTQ movement and she didn't notice? Come on, you lazy- assed scriptwriters!<br/><br/>
In fact all of the bit parts give the impression of someone being corralled on the street and asked to take on the role.Hence the movie outside of the electrifying songs comes across dull and cheap...... sorta like dress rehearsal before the proper guys come in.<br/><br/>The only redemption is the absolutely overwhelming quality of their music coming through unspoiled. You cannot help but gasp at the range of the voice and the talent of the musicians.
For me it was worth the ten bucks just for that, but I wouldn't recommend it very highly to other moviegoers<br/><br/>update Jan6

"surfertides","4","1","3","4 May 2019"," Is this the real life? Hardly...mostly fantasy.
","How it won four Oscars baffles me - made me watch it again to see if I was missing something but I ended up disliking it even more.<br/><br/>Queen was a superstar band with barely any roadblocks, or at least that's how the movie portrayed them. They lost their singer, Freddie comes to the rescue after working a day at the airport and listening to his dad give him advice (which seems so forced I can't help but wonder if they've never even met each other before this scene), and then they all become rock gods. Oh look, the mic's not coming off the stand, but it's okay because everything Freddie touches turns to gold. From that point on, the film just gets worse.<br/><br/>There's no character development at all - we see Freddie loves rock n' roll, disagrees with his dad, and has a family of foreigners (in America). Then suddenly he happens to catch the band while they're moping around the van, and lo and behold, their singer just quit. I don't know if this is actually what happened but if that's the case, Freddie got very lucky - and even so, there's still no struggle, no great conflict.<br/><br/>How to make a bland biopic:<br/><br/>Step 1: Regular part-time job guy reveals hidden talent, gets discovered
Step 2: Regular guy is new, but he's good, and everyone loves him
Step 3: They all get famous and there's a montage of them getting famous
Step 4: They are flawless and perfect and know so much more than the music professionals and radio broadcasters
Step 5: The love interest randomly introduced in the beginning has a falling out
Step 6: Suddenly time passes and conflicts arise
Step 7: But then they all make up and have one last great big show together that blows everyone's socks off.<br/><br/>It's boring.<br/><br/>The romance has zero chemistry.<br/><br/>I think that has mostly to do with Rami's acting. I highly disagree with his Oscar win - I thought he was robotic, had a hard time showing inner turmoil, he was flamboyant in a sanctimonious way, not a likable way. Sometimes he was downright creepy. As if something was off about him. You can't have a character get everything he wanted and then have him be a genius only to treat everyone else like garbage. It doesn't matter if you're brown, black, white - being a minority and/or in poverty and then suddenly making it big doesn't give you a free pass to be annoyingly pretentious. Sometimes a movie does this on purpose in order to convey how naive a character can be - but not here, because it seems that everybody loves Freddie unconditionally. Are we supposed to be rooting against him? Are we supposed to be happy when his life falls apart? I don't think so, so why do I feel that way...?<br/><br/>Every time he opened his mouth there was something poetic flying out and it took away from the realism. You mean to tell me Freddie Mercury was such a genius that every sentence he spoke could have been a line in a song? ""You're a fruit fly..."" F*ck off. Not everything's a metaphor and not everyone besides the band is an idiot. Example:<br/><br/>""Six Bloody Minutes"". Ray Foster: ""It goes on forever, six bloody minutes.""
Freddie Mercury: ""I pity your wife if you think six minutes is forever.""<br/><br/>Me: That's hilarious...*rolls eyes* You really got him good. I was waiting for the laugh track (in the rock biopic).<br/><br/>There are two conflicts that Freddie has to deal with: Homosexuality and AIDS.<br/><br/>""I have it. I have AIDS."" Okay... Maybe it's a matter of packing too much into the story, but that execution was horrible. Maybe they wanted Freddie to blow past it and get on with his final days. Fine, but this was clearly a significant moment in his timeline, and they just plow right on through to the next scene.<br/><br/>They tackle homosexuality in a similar fashion. Freddie's girlfriend deduces it, Freddie looks like he's heard it for the first time, interviewers barrage him with questions about it...there's nothing groundbreaking. The film is saying, ""He's gay and that's a struggle for him but at the same time he's proud of it, and don't really worry about it because he's also in a band and he's got a family, and another family, and a sleazy guy wants to make money off him, and he's sick, and a thousand other agendas we're trying to push here so just forget about all that...next scene!"" It's just too much with no substance.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Freddie. The rest of the band are portrayed as lackeys with occasionally good ideas. I didn't like that.<br/><br/>The ""villain"" was predictable. Sleazy guy wants to make money off of talented guy and split up the family. It's as cliche as it can get. I think I saw the same thing in a Disney channel movie ten years ago. ""Is Freddie there?"" ""Not right now, he's working."" We saw him do all but hide in the corner and twist his mustache.<br/><br/>Editing was pretty well-done during the montages, transition scenes, but then you have scenes like when the band first meets their manager, and there's a jump-cut every half-second, sometimes unnecessarily to people who aren't even in the conversation (Manager talks to Freddie, jumps to Brian, Freddie answers him, jumps to John. Um...what?). Not exactly Oscar-worthy in my opinion.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the film. But I do hate the reviews. 10 stars? You're telling me this was perfection in your eyes? Maybe I'm just hard to please...But the plot is excruciating, the message is bizarre (when you're a bad-ass rock and roll band, the one thing that matters is...family? What?) and the writing is confusing and bloated.<br/><br/>Also, Freddie did mad amounts of cocaine while he was working.

","I really enjoyed every second of this movie, it is a great story and they did their best to present it that way.

(Stage performance was on point) If you look at any of his interviews and old videos you will see that he was much more masculine than that, so i think they went too far with his ""gayness"" in some aspects to say it like that."
"mellerhannich","6","1","3","9 March 2019"," Truth and Reality
","This film review concerns two films: Der Junge muss an die frische Luft by Caroline Link and Bohemian Rhapsody by Bryan Singer. I watched both during one week and they both deal with biographies of individuals with whose art and talent I grew up and which I have always highly valued since I was young: Hape Kerkeling and Freddie Mercury - funny to see these names together, some people would say they are not playing in the same league, but for me, in a way, they are. Writing this I am aware that both were homosexual men and the films also discuss these issues (to anticipate: in a very different way). However, as both are such dissimilar personalities having a totally different background, this has neither been the reason for my admiration nor the intention of watching the films or reviewing them together. Indeed, I did not even know this detail when I was young as both have ""outed"" themselves as gay only later and unintentionally.<br/><br/>Der Junge muss an die frische Luft from 2018 tells the story of the early childhood of the successful German comedian, Hans Peter (or Hape) Kerkeling, following his and sharing the title of his autobiographical novel. It is directed by Caroline Link, who already won an Oscar for her film Nirgendwo in Afrika in 2003. The young Kerkeling-boy is performed by Julius Weckauf, his mother by Luise Mayer. Also, the well-known German actors Joachim Król, Hedi Kriegeskotte and Maren Kroymann play roles as members of Kerkelings family.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody was also released in 2018 and presented itself as a mixture between documentary and drama, reflecting the life and rise of Freddie Mercury and the band, Queen from the middle of the seventies up until Mercurys death in 1991. It is directed by Bryan Singer. If I remember correctly, he wasn't able to finish the film, because of arguments on set, but direction of the last scenes were taken over by another director, David Fletcher. Rami Malek plays Freddie Mercury. His ""love of my life"", Mary Austin was performed by Lucy Boynton. It is also stars Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello as members of the band Queen. Only Gwilym Lee, performing as the guitar-player Bryan May, I know from his role as Inspector Banaby´s assistant.<br/><br/>Body
""Der Junge muss an die frische Luft""
The action takes place in the town Recklinghausen in the Ruhr area in Western Germany, where Hape Kerkeling was born. He is seven years old, when the story begins, and the age of ten at the end of the film. In between, we are introduced to his huge family with a lot of uncles, aunts and cousins and four wonderful grandparents, which uses every opportunity to meet each other, have parties, laugh together, sing and caress and admire the young already very funny Hans Peter. He performs in private circles, using his roles as princesses and the lady-in-a-half-trick, famous singers and performers of his childhood. His homosexuality is not specifically mentioned, but sometimes the film shows him looking at magazines with male models wearing underwear in the fashion of the seventies, or his loving grandmother asking people to shut the mouth when they complained about him wearing female carnival costumes. We see him moving with his parents to another residence, which included a new school and new neighbors. He is aware that he won't be able to impress his classmates with physical elegance and power as he has been clumsy and stout. Instead he uses his charm and cleverness and even exaggerates his clumsiness. We often see his absent father and his loving and beautiful mom going deeper and deeper into illness and depression, laughing only when seeing her son singing or performing, and at the end, committing suicide. After his mother´s death his grandparents take over his care. The film audience was not even able to stop crying because of the mothers very sad death, when seeing Hape and his grandparents preparing carefully for the visit of a lady from the child-protective-service. This scene is so funny, Hape directing the performance and role of each member of the small on set, that started with crying, but this time ended because of laughter. The film did end with a scene showing a performance of a banal school play. Hape only got the small role of a neighbor, arguing with a soccer-playing boy, but he was able to interpret and perform this one-minute-role in such a funny and extrovert way that he got all the laughter and applause for his own sake.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody""
Bohemian Rhapsody tells the story of the band Queen's forming, their first successes in clubs and bars, Freddies conservative Parsis family, the meeting of Freddie and his female love, Mary and the rise of the band from the moment of discovery by professional agents. Some of the most famous songs were performed including back stories to their writing and production. This especially concerns the story of writing, producing and releasing the eponymous title of the film, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". According to the film, it had been rejected by EMI-Records at first, and then became the basis of the more then 20 years of success of the Band Queen. The film depicted how Freddie Mercury found out that he was bi-sexual and his first homosexual contacts. However, even the introduction into the Munich gay and leather fetish scene is only delicately hinted at, which in my eyes was somewhat ridiculous. The film then showed Mercury´s personality changing into a selfish person, manipulated by one of his agents, which ends in the separation of the band. In a dramatic matter they meet each other once again, rejoin, being told that Freddie suffers from AIDS. Finally, they perform at the famous Live-Aid-concert at Wembley Stadium in 1985.<br/><br/>Conclusion
I was very impressed by the acting skills of the young actor, who played Hape Kerkeling. How can a seven year old boy act in such a precise, professional and confident way and at the same time remain a relaxed child? Also Rami Malek did a tremendous job. However, I did miss the ""real"" Freddie Mercury the whole time. The other actors are great in both films. I especially liked the actor starring Brian May. I have seen Brian May several times in TV and Gwilym Lee did his best to render the guitarist's attitude and behaviour perfectly.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed about ""Der Junge muss an die frische Luft"" is the authenticity of the story. It is not important, if everything actually happened in the manner the film has shown it. But it is a true story, a story about a wonderful boy and his wonderful and at the same time tragic family. You know at the end of this film, that this ten year old will find his way and spread his talents.<br/><br/>And this authenticity I saw in ""Der Junge muss an die frische Luft"" I didn´t find in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Is it closer to a documentary? Yes, because the scenes at the Live-Aid-Concert are perfectly covered - I know that as I watched the concert when I was 15 years old and have never forgotten Queen´s amazing performance. Is it a drama? Yes, Queen never separated, Freddie did not tell anybody about his AIDS infection before 1987. Additionally, his performances with David Bowie and Montserrat Cabellé were not once mentioned in the film.<br/><br/>When I saw the film Amadeus by Milos Forman thirty years before, I knew, that it did not tell the true and exact story of Mozart´s life. However, it was a true film about a genius. Bohemian Rhapsody is a loosely-based story about a genius and at times, an inadequate drama about a singer/songwriter. Only the music will survive - but it's the music of Queen, not of Brian Singer."

I mean, this movie was cartoonish and inaccurate and not especially good. But I could not take my eyes away from it. It never should have garnered awards nominations, but it I can still see why everyone flocked to theaters for it. When I think of 2018 musicals, I will think of ""A Star Is Born.""

"heldriver","4","1","3","29 January 2019"," Fails as an honest biography, feels like glamourized Disney version
","What a waste of time this movie was!
Every single scene is a fökking cliché and all the conversations are painfully artificial.
Spoilers below (hint, Freddy dies!!)
Example: Everyone except bassplayer (nobody ever knows their names) and Freddy; ""I hate disco music!"" Band starts fighting. Bassplayer sits down and starts playing this stupid disco bassline. Fight brakes up. Everyone says ""wow that's actually pretty cool"". Everyone hugs.
The guys playing Brian and Freddy are really spot on, but it's like the producers spent all the casting money there, and the dude playing Rogger looks like he's 15 throughout the movie.
And why the fökk did the director think anyone wanted to watch a complete remake of their Live Aid concert? I can watch the original on youtube. And then the movie just ends, on a high note of course, not going into what could have been interesting details of how Freddy fought aids and of course unfortunately lost that battle. And the beginning is just as absent as the ending, with Freddy walking up to the band saying he likes them, the band saying they just lost their singer 75 seconds before (how convenient) and Freddy bursting out in song with the rest of the band harmonizing out in the middle of a parking lot. WTF is this?? A Disney musical?? And less than 15 minutes in the band is already touring the US. What about telling people parts of the story that they don't know already?
And WTF is up with Mike Myers as a comic relieve? I can see the events leading up to that unfolding: Movie Producer: ""Sorry Mike, but no, we can't do another Austin Powers with you in some crazy makeup doing silly British accents, but we'll find you a role in something else"". Producer calls his assistant: ""What movies are we shooting right now? Only Bohemian Rhapsody you say? Well that will have to do! Mike, how would you like to play an eccentric record label boss?"" Mike: ""Only if I can do my bonkers British accent!""

","When someone says the name ""Freddie Mercury"", people shuts up and pays attention. The man earned an immortal legacy on Rock & Roll, music as a whole history for himself, turning him one of pop culture's household names. His extravagance, his courage building his art and especially his powerful voice, have made his name a cultural treasure. There is no doubt, Mr. Fahrenheit is an absolute must when going through the history of entertainment. With that said, there was no question about how lucrative could be to make a biopic of this man, knowing Hollywood's usual M.O. So, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is the answer to the great area of opportunity that represents the story of Queen. Did the producers of this film fulfilled this great responsibility? Let' just say it is complicated...<br/><br/>I am an absolute Rock & Roll music fan in almost any of its presentations and sub genres. With that said, people that can say the same about themselves have to agree with me when I say that Queen is a must, being one of the greatest rock bands ever. Because of that, I eventually ran across the legacy of Freddie, Roger, Brian and John when I was very young. As expected, Freddie was the one that attracted my attention the most: His performances, his songwriting skills and his overall bravery playing the role of the ""Stage Mercury"" invited me to admire him ever since I was 12. That feeling made me want to know more and more. So I watched a whole lot of documentaries and read some books about Queens quest to success and international recognition. It is for this reason that the day I went to the cinema to see ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", I did it with a deep enthusiasm, but also with the hope that the pieces would fall into place in terms of historical accuracy. I left there with mixed feelings: On the one hand singing to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now, song that marks the conclusion of the film. But on the other wanting to say a thing or two to the writers and adapters of the story for having taken so many licenses.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody struggles with the difficulty of making a quality biopic. The concepts of the introduction, the climax and the ending are understood and compressed, turning this story into a well-founded film leaving the facts aside. The screen shows an inspiring story about a young prodigy who uses his talents to manifest the transgression that is born in response to the limitations that his family background, place of origin, sexual orientation and even his appearance impose. The film portrays in a moving way the passage of a group of musicians to world stardom, and the debauchery that fame implies, sentencing our protagonist to death, who still manages to conclude the film through a masterful and epic live performance. His conflicts, his humanity, his qualities and such quirky things that make up his personality are just some of the attributes that this admirable character shows. And, as if that wasn't enough, almost all the characters are very well developed, giving us an antagonist that, in my opinion, is good for its potential to cause a feeling of hatred in the viewer, represented by the figure of the controversial Paul Prenter. So, what is the problem? In many parts of the film the studied spectator begins to question himself if what he is seeing is actually the story of Queen that he paid to see, or at least something very similar happened to me.<br/><br/>It seems that this production had at hand all the key moments in Queen's career, such as their first meeting, Freddie's relationship with Mary Austin, the tours, Live Aid and the day Freddie discovers he has AIDS (only to mention a few examples) and completely arbitrarily modified and revolved to give the viewer a story that is endearing and inspiring, but not what actually happened. I would even dare to say that, to be a story largely invented and based on an event that did not happen how it is portrayed, has a script quite conservative and even common, relying in some funny and one or two remarkable phrases that are usually said for Freddie by Rami Malek. Even the title of the film falls into a common place and the desire to attract people to see the film before the real interest to portray the life of ""The Great Pretender"". It is a clear sign of the seriousness of the sin that is giving the Hollywood treatment in an excessive way to a movie based on real events. I do not know, maybe I had very high expectations. But, speaking of a biopic dedicated to Freddie Mercury, can you blame me?<br/><br/>However, there is a positive use of the soundtrack, which is composed of many of the greatest hits of the British band, filling the viewer with nostalgia and emotion, even if they make the same big mistake that I have already described: Not respecting the timeline. However, it is a guarantee: very few people will be able to leave this film without singing or humming some Queen melody. Against my first doubts about the cast of the film when it was revealed, Rami Malek does a splendid job portraying the legendary Queen frontman. For those who tell me: ""He needs to get more in role and go full method on this one"" I can only say: Buddy, do you really who is the person that Rami personifies in this movie? If there is an artist difficult to interpret in a biographical film, that is Freddie Mercury. And in my humble opinion, Malek gave us a performance worthy of our expectations and even more. It all comes down to the words that Brian May and Roger Taylor dedicated to him when he saw the movie: ""Freddie would be proud"". If something really stands out in this film, it's the casting job. Very good performances.<br/><br/>Summing it up, I think it's an enjoyable movie, but it falls short of the expectation that those almost ten years of production generated in me. And, for those history junkies like me who read the original story before watching a biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody is a complete disappointment. Even when portraying this artist, I think that the writers could be much bolder by presenting the duality between the Freddie of the stage and the real man. I think that, in an effort to make this film suitable for almost everyone, great sacrifices were made as to what led Freddie to a premature end. And no, I'm not talking about explicit sex scenes, but a more powerful vision towards that world in which Mercury was involved, which was more like a response to years of repression and an ideal that it sought to fulfill in an attempt to extrapolate the Freddie of the stage towards his everyday life. I think that the star is captured correctly, but not the man behind it, which implies omitting many of his duels, the consequences of his precarious way of life and, in essence, what turned Freddie Mercury into an icon. I still hope that this great story can motivate a true cinematographic masterpiece, as brave and transgressive as Freddie himself, but we'll have to keep waiting ..."

","Very good movie in all: absolutely loved the directing, great job with the cameras and the ""timing"" of the movie and the types of scenes, all very well done to provide us with a very entertaining movie. The actor was amazing, Mary was quite well too for a kind of part that is hardly ever well played and the rest of the band did very well actually.
On the bad side, there was waaaay too much cliché lines, catchphrases and things you would expect to see in a lame romantic comedy (""I don't look back, only forward"" ; ""We believe in each other"" ; ""I want you out of my life"" ; ""I need you"", etc etc etc): they went way too far with it especially with Freddie's lines, more than half were clichés and it really diminishes the realistic character of the (biographical) movie. Second, I think that the way they told the story of Mary going to Munchen and tallimg to him for 2 minutes and then he suddenly changes all his life was quite far-fetched... They should have explored it more and make it more understandable.
All in all, very good movie, an absolute delight to see, even if you're not a devote Queen's fan"
"joshuagesilva","6","1","3","10 December 2018"," Yeah, it was fine...
","My love for Queen will not affect my overall thoughts about this film.<br/><br/>This was a pretty solid and a very well directed film. It does certainly captures who and what Queen is, with a MAGNIFICENT, OUTSTANDING portrayal of Freddie Mercury by Rami Malek. I like the way they portrayed Freddie in his private life and I think the script serves him justice, since the movie revolves around him. This movie is dazzling, inspiring and heartwarming.<br/><br/>So why don't I love it like everyone else does? This movie is 2hrs 14mins, and with Freddie being the main focus for this runtime, some parts dragged and some were just merely fanservice for Queen fans (which I dont mind ;) ). I just thought there were many missed opportunities they could have done, like dipping into Brian, Roger and John's private lives more. And there many parts in the beginning where it felt rushed, not only that but this movie follows the EXACT SAME structure of a very typical biopic.<br/><br/>I certainly DO NOT hate this film, it was fine. But that's what makes this film disappointing for me. It's just... fine. But I know for sure people will LOVE this movie."
"derk144","Null","1","3","8 December 2018"," A sweeping chronicle of the rise of Freddie Mercury & Queen.
","I've been excited for this film before the first trailer was shown and it didn't disappoint me. Much like Queen's discography, it plays all the big hits from their history. But since all of them were such big hits it leaves little time for the linear notes. And while they do gloss over certain things in Mercury's life and stray a bit from the historical truth at times, this film ultimately gives an entertaining portrayal of the dynamic history of Queen. The performances are where this film really shines. Rami Malek is electric as Freddie Mercury, with the most precision in replicating his mannerisms and presence. But I'm just as impressed by the rest of the cast, especially the other band members & Freddie's family. Seeing the interactions between the band mates while performing or while working in the studio were my favorite parts. To watch them work and fight with each other to create the songs that we all love is a lot of fun and I hope is close to how those decisions were actually made. The opening sequence shows us exactly where our story is headed and there isn't a better place for us to stop than with Queen back on top."
"meab","6","1","3","2 December 2018"," A mediocre disapontment, sorry friends.
","This movie treid to convince me that being gay and having AIDS in the 70's was no big deal and I hate it for that.<br/><br/>The story was lacking and left too much unsaid. The main character and his relations went unexplored. What was the deal with his dad? Why was he so upset? What kind of emotional ties did Freddie try and mend with him in the end?<br/><br/>Furthermore we have the whole ordeal with his gayness and his illness. These two thing, being gay and having AIDS, were MAJOR in the 70's/ 80's and people were horrofied of both. The general public wasn't too aware of what AIDS was and for a while people actually thoght that it was airborne. Yet, we really don't get to see much stigma about it, not from the bandmembers, or his family, not from anyone. There isn't even a casual conversation where we get to see the perspective of the public. Nothing. Now, in regards to his homosexuallity it's handled a little better, we get to see some stigma and it is acknowledged that being gay is a controversial thing, but yet I feel like we see too litte. It is simply stated that ""being gay is hard"" like they literally just say it. For example when he comes out to his current fiance, she just says ""you're going to have a hard life"", they could have shown us that. Or, when they relase their Break Free music video, Freddie says that ""people hate ME for it, becasue I'M the queer one"" but agian, we never get to see that. We just hear it and that removes so much power from the medium of film. They're suppose to SHOW US, if all they use to further information is dialogue, I dare say it's a weak movie.<br/><br/>
One last main thing, that is a bit more subjective, is the fact that the movie wasn't verry pretty. By the looks of it, I expected a beautifully filmed masterpice, but I felt like the imagery didn't quite cut it. There was one scene, the one in the hospital, that I truly lovet. It was a gorgeus scene and that was what I wanted the rest of the movie to be, alas the movie did not fulfill my wants. The rest of the movie was very mediocre.<br/><br/>Now, lastly, the only thing I can posetively say I LOVED about this movie, the muscial prefomances. Oh my goodness, it sent shivers dowm my spine every time. They were powerful and I feel like they accuratley portrayed the power of music on people and how it brings them together. How overwhelming and emotional a live musical preformance can be. Those scenes felt genuin and real. Sadly I don't know if I can 100% atribute that to the movie itself, since it essential was a recorded concert, and it's the CONCERT, the actual preformance, that creates those feelings. But I will give the movie that since, in the end, the director played with angles and showed us the audince, showed their emotions.<br/><br/>I expected a movie that would tug at my heartstrings because it's the story of a man with a tragic life, but it simply left me feeling disapointed and unsatisfied. But hey, at least they didn't use narration :)<br/><br/>(NOTE: Due to the hype and high ratings, I expected more from this movie. Had I not heard about it, or seen any ratings, I might have taken it for something else and not been so harsh. But I also feel like a movie with 8,1 on IMDB and an audience score of 91% on rotten tomatoes should deliver more than this.)"

","Growing up with Queen was exciting, watching this movie and the scripted development of the band, the songwriting, and the story of Freddie pales my memories.

"ymandayawon","7","1","3","18 November 2018"," Is this the real life? Or is it just fantasy?
","Bohemian Rhapsody is directed by Bryan Singer (and later Dexter Fletcher) and stars Rami Malek, Ben Hardy, Gwilym Lee, Jospeh Mazzello and others and tells the story of Freddie Mercury (played by Malek) and how the iconic band Queen came into popularity while also exploring his own sexuality.<br/><br/>Like most people who watched it, I'm also a Queen fan. In a factual context, you can see all the historical inaccuracies put into the film in order to make the pacing flow better and to make it more accessible to mainstream audiences. As a fan, it's easy to nitpick all these details but new audiences wouldn't notice.<br/><br/>The performances are great, especially by Rami Malek. The impersonation of the vocalist doesn't make you see him as Rami Malek acting. You can actually see Freddie Mercury in his performance. From the gestures to the mannerism, to the body movement, it's all so convincing. Lee as Brian May is also great, along with Hardy as Roger Taylor and Mazzello as John Deacon. You can't really judge a biopic based from character development but you have to also make these real life characters be like human beings, and not just about characters doing stuff because that's what history stated. This film achieved at understanding and fleshing out these characters, even Lucy Boynton as Mary Austin, Freddie's past lover, although in a more fictional direction.<br/><br/>The musical sequences are great. They really did a great job at putting the nostalgia in the big screen but aside from those sequences, the editing of some scenes in the film are a bit jarring. Multiple cuts are used in one scene, and to the other, failing to make that scene emotional and compelling. But some audiences wouldn't really notice that. And I also notice the use of sudden song numbers in some scenes. I know what they're going for in those scenes but it's not as effective as it intended to be. They're just put out there for the sake of us singing along to that song.<br/><br/>The Live Aid performance is probably the best scene of the entire film. The level of detail and the performances of each actor are so accurate, you feel like you're watching the real concert. The actor's dedication paid off, and you can really feel the respect for the band, despite some creative liberties used.<br/><br/>I love this film. Even though it's not the perfect movie, it's the perfect Queen movie for old and new fans alike. Malek's performance is Oscar-worthy, although I would love it if they went deeper into Freddie's story, but it's still a good film.<br/><br/>-Yman Dayawon"
"hunter-friesen","6","1","3","12 November 2018"," Queen biopic is an entertaining mess
","Making a biopic about Freddie Mercury and Queen is a truly difficult task for anyone to accomplish. Trying to condense the life of the greatest lead singer of all time into a feature-length film is next to impossible. Attempting this feat is Bryan Singer's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which unsurprisingly isn't able to do justice to its subject matter. Still, the film makes up for what it lacks by containing great musical performances and a mesmerizing performance by Rami Malek as Freddie.<br/><br/>Singer has never been good with emotions throughout his career and that clearly shows here. He desperately struggles to deal with the more human scenes and the difficult relationships Freddie had with many of his closest friends and family. Most scenes feel hokey as they try every shameless tactic to get the audience to care.<br/><br/>The film also uses a straightforward method of telling the story. The plot basically boils down to a glorified Wikipedia article that tracks the history of the band from start to finish. By the end, everything that is learned feels like surface details that could easily have been explored more.<br/><br/>Singer may not be an emotional filmmaker, but what he does have going for him is his ability to be a showman. The many different concert scenes are a treat to watch as they playback some of the band's greatest hits. Eventually, it all culminates to the famous Live Aid performance that blows away all expectations. The film beat for beat recreates the historic moment and makes you feel like part of the electric crowd.<br/><br/>Penned by Anthony McCarten, the script for ""Bohemian"" fails quite badly at various points.<br/><br/>The most apparent problem is the truly atrocious dialogue that ruins many moments that are supposed to be heartfelt. Any scene with Mary and Freddie immediately becomes a sappy mess and dashes away any hope of connection to the characters and their relationship.<br/><br/>It can also be said that the script fails to defend the film's 134-minute runtime as it never dives deep enough into Mercury's troubled life. Background details are given about his upbringing and the strained relationship he had with his parents. However, these elements are treated with minor important and don't make an impact on Freddie as a character.<br/><br/>On a brief note, there is a small subplot with Mike Myers cameoing as a record producer who objects to the band's unconventional ways. Myers comes off as a cartoon and the whole storyline reeked of desperation to get a slight laugh out of the meta-joke.<br/><br/>Lastly, Freddie's sexuality is briefly touched on and with very little detail that it never truly feels that important even though it became a defining part of his image by the end of his career. The script never gives an explanation for why and how Freddie is gay, just the fact that he is. His sexuality becomes the main storyline by the end of the film, but by then it's too little too late.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury always seemed like the type of person who would be impossible to properly portray on screen. Rami Malek defies that logic and delivers a pitch-perfect performance. Apart from the singing voice, Malek recreates the mannerisms and overall presence of Mercury down to the letter. He brings a kind of contagious energy that lights up the screen every time he grabs the mic, giving us the sense of what it might have been like to be in front of Mercury as he performed.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do an alright job, but really none of them matter compared to Malek. Lucy Boynton is pretty good as Mary Austin, Freddie's wife at one point and lifelong friend. Boynton does what she can with the terrible dialogue and tries to salvage each scene she shares with Malek.<br/><br/>Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello play the rest of the band. Each of them is average and just kind of float around in the background as Freddie takes center stage.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" isn't a good film when put together as it fails to be a serviceable biopic about the band and its larger than life lead singer. However, the film is still a very fun time that delivers when it comes to musical thrills and will have you banging your head and listening to Queen for weeks after."

"ArchilArjevanidze","7","1","3","8 November 2018"," Is this the real life? or is it just fantasy?
","I enjoyed watching this film, especially behind the scenes of music creation, also loved the way relationship between group members was presented. But It bugs me that most of the events were disconnected from actual reality, for example meeting with his wife, or his late boyfriend Jim, plus scene which was supposed to be emotional, where members find out about Freddies illness, is also pushed in just for the sake of the plot. This kind of stuff ruins the expereince, yeah it's nice to see recreation of Live Aid concert, but knowing that crucial moments in Freddie's life that you saw on the screen, aren't actually accurate, is pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>also I'm not happy with the way they chose to end the film, I think missing out on the story behind ""The Show Must Go On"" and last days of his life is a bad decision, it might have been more emotional."
"vermeeranneloes","7","1","3","8 November 2018"," Both solid and lacking
","""The film is a painting, not a photograph"", said Brian May of Queen about the movie. If you're someone who doesn't really care for the historical accuracy and wants a fun film with banging music and great casting this will be great. I personally had a lovely time in that regard, but also found that it skirted around some grittier things I felt would make the film feel less formulaic. I had goosebumps in the theater for the musical performances (as they use original audio of the band), but will likely not seek this movie out again."

"AudioFileZ","8","1","3","8 November 2018"," Malek's Performance Alone Is Truly Amazing. This Will Propel The Queen Legacy.
","I couldn't help thinking watching Bohemian Rhapsody that movies about bands are generally boring and for the dyed in the wool fans. Bohemian Rhapsody was anything but. The sole reason for than as well as the movie is the singularly unique Freddie Mercury. Watching the film I easily could believe Rami Malek was Freddie Mercury. That's a huge win. However the movie kind of drags the viewer down by keying on Mercury's inner identiy crisis and how it made him a tortured and lonely man. I think there is so much more to cover so we see Mercury as being over the top in everything and not just a amazingly talented sad soul. I have to think he rode the tiger in everyway and he had many heights besides just his chart-topping world success as lead singer of Queen. Sure some of it was off-putting for the average person, but it was who he was and he wasn't just a superstar floundering around off stage.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't try to cover all you might want to know about Mercury, but it does give us the Cliff Notes of how he and his bandmates began. The begining, while compact, gets the message across that here was a once in a generation talent, not unlike the earlier Elvis, that was so talented as complete entertainer things happened fast. Against this backdrop of furious success was Mercury's early years of not exactly fitting in at school, a very brittle relationship with his father, and his wobbly orientation with the opposite sex. This was a kind of crucible from which Freddie needed the audience and a kind of unconditional acceptance. It was a very real addiction and we all know addictions have plenty of pitfalls. And, for a moment Freddie did seek a degree of normalcy. Mercury did experience joy becoming engaged to a beautiful woman. Remember though Mercury has some inner turmoil as to how he processes relationships with the opposite sex. Eventually his relationship disolves romantically when he realizes he is at least bi-sexual (probably his own lie to keep from admitting he was outright gay). As all of this is occurring his fame and wealth is ever increasing. Instead of being overjoyed by success, plus freed by his coming to terms with his sexuality, it seems to begin a protracted period of lunacy and knowing loneliness. Calling Queen his family helped to insulate him from the crouching tiger, for a while.<br/><br/>That's the setup and then the movie really gets sad. You might think Mercury rarely enjoyed himself while taking ever more risky behaviors. I must believe we purposely don't see how high Freddie rode prior to his decline in health. By most reports he was indulging boundlessly, chasing ever more crazy highs. While we hardly see this we do get it that the resulting aftermath was close to a mental breakdown resulting in a protracted hiatus of Queen as a band. True, Queen never broke up, but they broke down due to Freddie's increasing problems. Malek made Mercury live again, so much so it was scary to watch all the known mannerisms..<br/><br/>This movie is quite technically excellent. All of the actors bring the band Queen back to life as we might have seen them at the various times of their career. The singing must be Freddie as it as real as anything you've ever heard. The lip-syncing and band playing is such that you suspend belief as Queen with Mercury once more lives.. The ending has a sort of amazing vindication with real joy. So why is Bohemian Rhapsody more than good, utimately sad, and full of holes as to so much of Freddie Mercury's happy times? Because the bottom line is overwhelmingly sad that such a talent was tormented, lonely, and gone so soon. This may not be the movie everyone wanted, but it's the story we see could logically end as it did. It would be impossible to get such a colorful character wholly so we get what makes sense of the journey of Queen through the amazing character of Freddie Mercury. I believe it achieves what May and Taylor wanted us to see and it will most definitely reach a broad audience who won't be repulsed by things that may well be left to the imagination, but will preserve the greatness that Mercury was so very responsible for. It will, again, revive their musical legacy even propelling yet another generation of fans. As such a movie definitely worth going to see."
"elisatrompetto","8","1","3","7 November 2018"," Definitely worth a watch
","Found the casting brilliant - Rami Malek did an amazing job as Freddie Mercury - couldn't fault him. Found the story line well put together - entertaining and really heartfelt, so (based on the documentaries of queen) think it was pretty accurate.
Only gripe for me was there were a few very cheesy scenes esp at the beginning, which could have had a bit more humour added.
And the sound quality for some of the songs wasn't as good as it could have been - esp at the end - I wanted to feel rocked out at the end, and somehow felt they pulled back.
That said, definitely recommend watching - even with the gripes, Rami Malek was just captivating, as was Freddie Mercury irl."
"FilmLiquet","8","1","3","7 November 2018"," Film Liquet on Bohemian Rhapsody
","Bohemian Rhapsody, the name speaks for itself. You already know about what and who it'll be. The film is not a documentary, it is a tribute to Queen and their music, an entertaining story of one of the world's most iconic bands, featuring set of events leading to a legendary Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London and it does its job perfectly.<br/><br/>Despite the fact, that the film looks like a yet another generic music band movie, it can completely stand on its own because it is a Queen band movie. Being made under original cast members(Brian May and Roger Taylor) supervision it shows us a glimpse of their relationship in the group and with Freddie himself, being portrayed by Rami Malek. He is one of the main reasons why the movie works, he is the perfect cast for the role. Even Brian May pointed out that the cast for everybody in the movie couldn't be more perfect. An outstanding performance by Rami portrayed not only an extraordinary persona Freddie showed on stage, but also showed how much alive and vulnerable he was in real life.<br/><br/>The cast, the performance, the costumes, the music, it has all of it. There is nothing more a Queen fan can ask for. Even if you are not fan, you will still enjoy the film and feel all the energy put into it. Dealing with life issues and struggling with showing the world who you really are was a big part of Freddies life and when the film shows it, you really start believing that if he made it, you can do it too."
"georgiebeech","10","1","3","7 November 2018"," The difference between the audience and critic reviews says it all.
","Heart-breaking and hilarious in all the right places. Something I was worried about was the dynamic between the band since the critics went in so hard on it, but they got the snarky Brit humour absolutely down. Rami Malek was absolutely incredible. I don't think I'd ever be able to see anyone as Freddie Mercury except...well Freddie Mercury but I genuinely felt as though I was a fly on the wall rather than watching a scripted scene, the same with most of the characters. F the critics. It's obvious they went into the film hung up on Bryan Singer and didn't want to give it a chance. Some of the critiques make wonder how they got their jobs in the first place. ""It's like a Wikipedia entry!!"" even though it's a biopic and has to follow the events of real life. ""It isn't accurate!!!"" even though it's two hours long even with parts cut out. They apparently didn't do justice to Freddie's illness and sexuality which is absolute garbage when he himself didn't want to be known as the LGBT poster boy for AIDS, and yet that's exactly what they're criticising the film for. I didn't know how they were going to approach such a heavy topic when the film was actually quite fun and light-hearted for the most part, but they did it perfectly. I was SOBBING for a solid 10 minutes before they got to the Live Aid scene and I'm not even a diehard Queen fan.
Favourite moments-
<ul><li>I'm in Love With My Car</li><li>Freddie's family scenes</li><li>The Wayne's World references</li><li>The cats in general.</li><li>Adam Lambert's cameo even though I didn't recognise him at first</li></ul><br/><br/>TL;DR - Critics severely underestimated how much the general public love Queen and Freddie Mercury"

The only sad thing for me was seeing a great rock band descend into pop music There is a lot of humour and most importantly, the studio and live scenes seem real.

"kennprop","9","1","3","7 November 2018"," Really this movie was vg
","When Freddy Mercury came along my music days were pretty much over. I guess he was a major star mid seventies on? I did remember his songs, but did not know who sang them. Given this, I thought BR was a very good movie. Lots of good music, a sad story, ending in an early death from aids. He was a tremendous vital personality and like many celebrities over did the lifestyle. Of course the gay community didnt know enuf about the disease in the pre 80's to take precautions. He was probably conflicted about his sexuality somewhat.That was a transition era.
I have not been to the movies in years because the recent productions have pretty much been crap. We decided to see BR while waiting for the election results to roll on in the US midterms. The previews of coming attractions before this movie were almost laughably bad. So the trend continues. !!!! A couple of Q band members were around to help recreate the situations. I have no idea how realistic this movie was, how egocentric FM was, or if he even had a career when Queen broke up. It seemed like he went back because he realized he needed them . Without them he was lost ?? He was a tremendous innovative performer as were his bandmates.
His performance, I watched the real one on youtube, at LiveAid was top notch.
The actors in this movie were well casted. They are almost dead ringers for his real band members. FMs lookalike Malek? seems perfect as far as FMS stage antics .The crowd scenes at the concerts seemd rather muddy and are probably CG created. I really dont see anything else one can criticize about this flic. Both my wife and I enjoyed it alot."

","This was a great movie, but as the movie said when creating the song Bohemian Rhapsody you need to add more body and heart. I think it failed in sharing how the magic of each song was created, this way it would not have been a movie about Freddie Mercury but about Queen. It also did not actually show the real story of how Queen started. The final minutes of the movie was virtually dead on with the Live AID 1985 performance. If you were one of us lucky ones to be young in 80's, the Live AID scene of the audience really touched on how we all got together around the world for a good cause (something you just don't see nowadays). Worth watching ...hopefully some of our youth today will watch this and inspire them to create real MUSIC once again. Queen was talent, Queen was the youth, Queen was Inspiring, Queen was limitless."

","Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 film based on Freddie Mercury and on how Queen was formed as well as the lead up to Live Aid 1985. Rami plays the lead who started off working as a cabin baggage attendant in Heathrow airport who lives with his parents and his sister . He spots a band called Smile and the lead singer quits the band so Freddie asks could he be in the band and the rest is history. He changes his name to Freddie Mercury,as well as changing the band's name to Queen,getting to fall in love with a woman before it's later revealed his bisexual and falls for a man named Paul before he ends up with Jim. Of course there's conflict later on with Queen over Freddie's stardom.<br/><br/>Overall the film was very good. Rami Malek was excellent as Freddie Mercury I was shocked by how he looked like him along with the guy who played Brian May. The music was good and the overall story was excellent. I never knew that Freddie was a Pakistan and was half Indian as I never knew about Freddie's background only he was the lead singer of Queen and died of Aids in 1991(27 years ago).<br/><br/>Despite the fact I preferred A Star Is Born but I still found this film very good noneoftheless.<br/><br/>

"Clusium","9","1","3","4 November 2018"," Excellent Biopic About The Life Of Freddie Mercury & His Bandmates!!!!
","Story begins with him as a teenager,working as baggage handler at Heathrow Airport. We next move to his home life, where his strict Zoroastrian father criticizes his teenage, rebellious behaviour as not keeping in line with ""Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds (Zoroastrian code of conduct),"" when he chooses to go off to the local bar. At the bar, he watches a really talented group of musicians playing music, & decides to meet them all later, to share his own ideas. However, when he does this, it turns out that the band's singer had just up & quit on them. So, he does an impromptu audition for them, & immediately, becomes their star singer. Not long after, he encourages the new group to forego singing in bars, & instead make an album. When they protest, that this would be an expensive thing to do, he gets them to sell some of their stuff, & then go for it.<br/><br/>They go to the USA, & meet up with some lawyers, to broker their record deal. One of them happens to be named 'Jim Beach,' so Mercury renames him ""Miami Beach.'
Actually, I overlook one important detail here: Mercury's original name was ""Farokh Bulsara, however, he legally changes his name to 'Freddie Mercury,' thus further angering his strict traditional father!!!<br/><br/>The movie also details Mercury's great loves, including with a young woman named Mary Austin, whom he had been engaged to.<br/><br/>Although it does touch on him contracting AIDS, it ends (& in fact, begins) on a high note with him & the band performing at 'Live Aid.' He makes his peace with his father, when he explains that by doing this charity concert, he is fulfilling the ""Good thoughts, good words, & good deeds,"" of the Zoroastrian faith."

","Bohemian Rhapsody was a fun and energetic biopic. Rami Malek, who played Freddie Mercury, was impeccable as him. Freddie and the band were wonderfully acted and portrayed throughout the entire film. Now, of course, with a biopic there has to be a few things cut out, edited or even exaggerated to fit a 2 hour movie... but some things should've been touched on more than others and a few parts of his life weren't there when they should've been. Overall, though, Bohemian Rhapsody is a slightly bumpy but fun ride with fantastic scenes and insights on the life of Queen and Freddie."

"mountaingal1978","10","1","3","3 November 2018"," A showstopping film!!!
","Having read some negative critic reviews, I almost skipped this movie. So glad I didn't. This is the best biopic movie I've ever seen and will now be on my top ten movie list. Every aspect of the film from casting to acting to directing is great. The writer and the director managed to provoke emotion from Malek without exploiting Mercury's sexuality or his illness. By not focusing on Mercury's gayness, the audience is able to witness how his flamboyance made him the show-stopping performer that he was. So, go watch. Revel in the music. Marvel at his showmanship. Experience his humanity."

"FlickChick82","8","1","3","2 November 2018"," Full of emotions
","Beautiful, starting from performances by all of the actors, directing, script, editing, cinematography...behind their music, which will live forever, there was a man looking for a place to call a home, a family of his own, acceptance, unconditional love, honesty, loyalty, escape from loneliness and don't we all look and search for this...only few of us are lucky enough to find it...I'm glad he had finally found it, even for a short period of time and sometimes it's all one needs. A movie also approached a touchy subject of homosexuality with sophistication and utmost respect. I am thrilled to see how much we have evolved as a society since those days. I couldn't stop crying while watching emotionally charged scenes and I love how nothing was over the top or cliched. The ending is as it should be, taking each viewer down the memory lane for those who had been there and for those who hadn't at the Live Aid, which performance is so masterfully recreated, one feels as a member of that audience right there on the Wembley stadium, clapping along while singing some of their biggest hits."

","I didn't discover Queen and Freddie Mercury until I was in my sixties. One rainy day I happened upon the 2-hour BBC Queen documentary. I was an instant fanatic: I bought all the albums and all the concert DVD's and all the music video compilations and watched all the youtube videos, I read all the biographies. Freddie Mercury had become my hero.
I admired Roger and Brian's ambition to capture Queen's story in a movie, but I thought there's no way anybody can play Freddie Mercury. Well, I saw the movie today and I'm here to tell you, Remi Malek did it! The smallest gestures, the vulnerableness and the bravado, the stage movements ... he WAS Freddie Mercury come to life. Like many others have said, I felt like I was watching the actual band at many points. Thank you to everyone involved for making this astonishing movie."

","Queen's story is amazing on it's own. The movie shows how Freddie as an outsider boy became a phenomenon and how the band members were so talented making Queen the best band ever. It look like a documentary but in a funnier way and of course this can't be disappointing cause it shows all their way to the absolute fame.
The casting was very good, for me it was like seeing Brian, Freddie , Roger and John being young playing in the band. I have to say that Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon was stunning ! Even the facial expressions were exactly the same!
Rami did an amazing job on his moves during the concert scene it was just like seeing Freddie singing and moving on the stage...<br/><br/>One thing that disappointed me was that the movie had some scenes that were not correct historically. But these were mistakes that only die hard (almost stalker) Queen fans could recognise. Also I really wanted to see a lil bit more of Freddie after the Live Aid concert..."

Sorry but Rami doesn't look or act like Freddie. You put big teeth in him and said heeey look it's Freddie--NOPE. Those weird eyes totally destroy any look you were going for and the movements during concerts are just not there.(Like that little shuffle Freddie did) Needed to be a half hour shorter maybe more.

So coming from someone who isn't a hard-core Queen fan to everyone, you'll love this movie."
"sealswheels","10","1","3","1 November 2018"," A fantastic film and fitting tribute to Freddie Mercury and Queen
","Despite being a Queen fan and seeing them live at Wembley a year after Live Aid, I was initially put off of going after listening to the film review on 5 Live. However, my daughter persuaded us to go after seeing it and giving it rave reviews. After watching the film I really wonder what criteria these people use to rate a film as I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. The film is entertaining, moving ( I have not cried so much in a cinema for a very long time ), funny and informative. The acting is fantastic and you forget at some points that you are watching actors rather than the real band. The recreation of the Live Aid concert is truly stunning and took me right back to watching the real thing all those years ago. If you like Queen you will love this film and even if you missed them first time round give this film a go. Congratulations to everyone involved on creating a real masterpiece !"
"superbmov","8","1","3","1 November 2018"," Biopic that was worth while
","This film is created for Queen fans and one decade of waiting is finally over. I am amazed because this film has achieved one of its most important goals, that is to make you feel like you are on Live at the Wembley concert. The direction of the film sometimes has problems and time-line issues, non the less it captures the basic story of Queen's history. It makes up some stories and characters a something that I didn't like but everything was wrapped nicely in the end.<br/><br/>Rami Malek did an amazing portraying Freddie and he is the soul character that makes this film go forward. I expected more stuff about other Queen members but weakest of the bunch was definitely John Deacon.
He had so little to do that sometimes to me he felt like an background character.
That is something that I would change, but I guess that story had to be wrapped in around two hours so it is forgiven.<br/><br/>Overall it is great film but sadly not perfect as I wanted it to be. Queen, as a band they were always together and seeing that their story interpreted a bit different makes me feel unsatisfied kinda. But at the end of the film my hearth was beating fast and I was happy that I was able to see the film, recreation of some key moments is amazing like an Live Aid concert. Bottom line it is great but not perfect biopic. When I think about it, it really doesn't have to be! We all(fans) have our interpretation and when fans are satisfied that is most important thing. Bottom line I love the film and it will probably become even better over time.<br/><br/>Pluses:
+ Makes you feel like you are on the Queen concert
+ Recreates some key story elements very well
+ Rami Malek as Freddie
+ Sound design is very good
+ Character development
+ Every chapter of the film is distinctive by design(70s,80s etc...).<br/><br/>Minuses:
<ul><li>Time-line inaccuracy</li><li>Liberations in storytelling</li></ul>"
"paulmccormack","10","1","3","1 November 2018"," Incredible!

"MrDHWong","9","1","3","1 November 2018"," A solid and well-told biography of the famous singer brought to life by a spectacular performance from Malek
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic about the life of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Starring Mr. Robot's Rami Malek in the lead role, it is a solid and well-told biography of the famous singer brought to life by a spectacular performance from Malek.<br/><br/>In 1970, young Pakistani British Farrokh ""Freddie"" Bulsara (Rami Malek) aspires to be a successful singer/songwriter. One day, Freddie approaches the band ""Smile"" after their lead singer quits and asks to replace him. Despite their reservations, the band recruits Freddie and begin to start performing with him across various pubs and colleges in London. One year later, the band has become world famous after Freddie decides to change the group's name to ""Queen"" and his own name to ""Freddie Mercury"".<br/><br/>Energetic and touching at times, Bohemian Rhapsody does a superb job of showcasing how one extremely talented yet imperfect man helped transform a small London band into one of the hugest and best-selling rock groups in history. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie is simply flawless, even more so than what Sacha Baron Cohen could have ever been. Malek perfectly embodies and emits just the right amount of swagger and flamboyance Freddie was best known for beyond simply physically resembling him. There were even times where he indistinguishable from the real man. The music, as to be expected, was amazing, and being a longtime fan of Queen, I had to resist the urge to sing out loud in a cinema full of people. The film's depiction of the band's 1985 LIVE AID performance at Wembley Stadium is so realistic one would swear they were actually in the audience. While some purists may complain that the film follows the typical biopic formula and does little to derive from it, I feel that this does not diminish the overall entertainment quality too much and I recommend filmgoers see it on their own terms and decide for themselves.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"
"linda_carmignani","10","1","3","1 November 2018"," They are STILL the Champions!
","I've been an hardcore fan of Queen since I was 15 years old and for more than 10 years I've been waiting for a movie about them. Finally, Bohemian Rhapsody came out and it just BLEW my mind. The cast did a magnificent job, especially the actors playing Freddie, Roger, John and Brian: they didn't just play their characters, they BECAME them. Watching the movie you can feel the love and the respect they all have for the people they're portraying, as well for their music and personal histories. I've already seen this movie twice but I know I will go back to cinema again and again because Bohemian Rhapsody is an incredible and touching tribute to the world's greatest rock band and frontman and it is just like a Queen song: it's a hit. I do hope with all my heart it will get the recognition and the awards it deserves (mr. Rami Malek, I'm talking about you).
The final sequence at Live Aid made me feel like I was truly there, in the middle of that huge crowd, singing along with everyone. It just made me cry so much because one of my biggest regrets is that I've never seen the original band perform live (I was born after Freddie's death) and with this wonderful, incredible movie I finally had a hint of what it might have felt seeing Freddie sing and control the crowd the way he did. Bohemian Rhapsody just proves that Queen music is more alive than ever and that, after all these years, they are still the champions. Loved every second."

"michael_balsdon","8","1","3","1 November 2018"," A Fun Nostalgia Trip
","Overall the film manages to be a slightly interesting look into the career of Queen and an excellent love letter to their music and the film reminds old and new fans of the band of the unique and enthusiastic nature of a Queen performance.<br/><br/>The film seeks to glorify the career of Queen and the hit songs that they created rather than offer an in depth study into the lives of the band members. That being said, a focus on Freddie Mercury takes centre stage but even then the look into the ""dark side"" of his life is minor and the film instead touches on his sexuality and his family relationship.<br/><br/>The films look into the origins of songs like We Will Rock You and Another One Bites the Dust as well as the titular Bohemian Rhapsody give the non-diehard fans of Queen interesting new information.<br/><br/>The numerous montages of the bands many tours and the lengthy recreation of their famous Live Aid performance are the highlights of the film as these serve to show the audience the amazing performer that was Mercury as Rami Malek perfectly captures the energy and enthusiasm of Mercury as he manoeuvres himself across the screen and stage."

","Update Dec 2018: Saw it again in the theater. Better the second time! Thank you Queen!<br/><br/>If you are a Queen fan, you will LOVE this movie. I really think the critic reviews are pretty harsh (...""somebody better put you back into your place!"").<br/><br/>This movie is about Queen the band with a heavy emphasis on Freddie of course, but really about the band. I have been hearing that people are upset there wasn't more of an in-depth LGBTQ political statement about Freddie Mercury being gay and his AIDS experience. For me, this movie certainly is not that. There was a very raw and real sense of Freddie's early inability to be direct about the fact that he was gay and his heartbreaking relationship with Mary. It portrays how devastatingly lonely Freddie must have been dealing with his sexuality, being surrounded by people with dark intentions and the feeling of never really belonging.<br/><br/>I laughed (some very funny moments), cried (heartbreaking moments) and felt the pure elation you feel when you hear their music. The Live Aid performance alone will leave you feeling completely enraptured and uplifted. If you are my age and saw it all live in 1985 (!!) - your memory goosebumps will be right back there with you all over again.<br/><br/>Of course there are elements that are not 100% accurate (the timing of Freddie's disclosure to the band about his having AIDS), a lot of material glossed over (it would be *impossible* to cover this in 2 hours) and Rami looks so much like Mick Jagger in the earlier parts of Freddie's career it's a bit distracting -- but I say it again, the MOVIE WILL ROCK YOU! I loved it, loved it, loved it.<br/><br/>To the critics and cynics out there, Freddie/Queen have this to say to you:<br/><br/>""So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters

Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

"rainerlindheim","8","1","3","29 October 2018"," Brilliant tinges of Spinal Tap here and there
","I think everything in the good reviews I've read here have said it all, but I'd like to add that I loved the little Spinal Tap-esque moments that are very subtle here and there (and I wont spoiler on any of them, but all bands love (and can identify with ) Spinal Tap, Im sure Brian May and Roger Taylor are no different) Any band will tell you that touring isnt all as glamorous as its made up to be and doing mundane things or keeping mundane interests while on the road are what is normal! The film was made to be funny, in the spirit of Freddie himself, he came accross to me anyway as a happy go lucky fun guy...and the director and Brian and Roger have mastered this."
"Ingrouille181","8","1","3","29 October 2018"," Another great bio-pic, worthy of Mercury himself
","I feel like this film should have been called Mercury or Queen, or something else like that; Bohemian Rhapsody is their magnum opus so it fits I guess.<br/><br/>I wish I had seen this movie in a sold out cinema, cause there are so many moments in this film where the whole audience would erupt into song. I loved this film. Even though Sacha Baron Cohen would have been great as Freddy Mercury, I feel like he would have felt too much like Bruno in the role, so I'm glad we have Rami Malek instead, who straight up owns the role. I buy him completely as Freddy Mercury, great performance. The actors, sets, directing and the music are all top notch. The ending LiveAid concert is up there now with my top film moments of all time. So much energy and emotion.<br/><br/>The film is of course based on Freddy Mercury, the lead singer of Queen, and his early years with the other members of the band, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor, leading up to their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert<br/><br/>Rami Malek brings so much life to the role of Freddy. The movie doesn't strive away from the darker side of Freddy's personal life, such as his relationship with Mary Austin and his strained family life, along with him coming to terms with his sexuality. It was all very well handled. Even though there are historical inaccuracies throughout, you're able to look past them as everything else is so perfect. Another amazing thing is how every concert and performance is very well re-created, and Rami Malek sells every performance. At no point was I checking my watch, which is amazing since the film is over 2 hours long. I loved every second of it, something I haven't said about many films that came out this year.<br/><br/>Give it a see while you can."

Goosebumps laughter tears- all true!
I am a Queen fan and It was a must see for me, but I still feel emotional about it and I saw it opening night on Friday-
The cast especially Rami Malek was excellent and had Freddie's mannerisms off to a tee!
Brian May actor looked more like him than the real one- uncanny!
As everyone has said -ignore the critics they were just obviously disappointed there was no gay porn. We aren't idiots it was plainly Inferred and sensitively portrayed-because it wasn't needed!
Freddie was a real person with the same insecurities we all have gay or not. His life and Queens journey was stuff of legend and as for Live Aid, any one who saw it the first time like I did will remember the electric atmosphere and the emotion was unbelievable!
Well done to the cast and crew
Deserves many accolades

","A time is revisited from a long, long while ago. It was a time when concert goers harmonized with bands using cigarette lighters and not cell phones. A time when Michael Jackson was climbing the charts, when records were played on turntables, and bands came-up with their own acoustic sounds the good-old natural way. And a time when Bob Geldof rallied together the world's leading artists to save Africa from poverty with a little thing called ""Live Aid.""<br/><br/>20th Century Fox's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" takes place in 1970 London where a young Farrokh Bulsara, who would soon by known to the world as Freddie Mercury was discovering who he was as an artist. This is his story. The story of the making of ""Freddie Mercury."" The opening scene is a flash foward as it tells it all as Mercury walks down a long hallway adorned in a robe stepping past his many cats as they eat from their dishes. Exit into a transition of Mercury entering a vast stage surrounded by millions of fans as one of many of ""Queens"" hits plays in the background...""find me somebody to love.""<br/><br/>That lyric, ""somebody to love"" is the core of 'Rhapsody's showing the story of Mercury's anguish throughout his career. The film focuses on the inevitable fate of a larger-than-life vocalist and mega star's loneliness, and constant beating-off of vultures' who are out to get whatever they can out of him for their own benefit. Ultimately, it's Mercury's quest to find true love is the center of this story. It's a love story and rock story all wrapped into one. Mercury's love to perform, which ironically directly limits his abiity to find personal love and fulfillment even after meeting his soul-mate, Mary Austin (perfectly portrayed by Lucy Boynton) who is a constant in Freddie's life throughout the ups and downs.<br/><br/>Fans will get to see what went into the making of some of their favorite popular ""Queen"" hits. But, more importantly, possibly Queen's most well-known song and title of the movie ""Boheminan Raphsody."" Movie goers will see the humorous making-of story of what went into creating that six-minute masterpiece and their record label's reaction. By-the-way, Mike Meyer's comes through with a stellar disguised cameo as record producer Ray Foster.<br/><br/>The film also showed how ""Queen"" (once called ""Just Smile"") was the first band to involve audience participation which the band expanded upon with songs like ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We are the Champions."" These songs were specically created for just that - for fans to be involved with their songs. ""Queen"" loved their fans and their fans showed it back.<br/><br/>Hollywood Junket caught an early full two-and-a-half hour screening (the film's current length is 2 hr 14 min) that treated ""Queen"" fans to a full set in the last scene which started with the song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", then ""We are the Champions"", followed by ""Radio Gaga."" Yes, that's the ""Radio Gaga"" that living icon Lady Gaga coined her name from.<br/><br/>The film celebrates Mercury's flamboyant persona and fashion. The film shows a Mercury that was always unapologetically Freddie Mercury. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" tastefully depicts his sexuality and sexual encounters. Most importantly, it embraces Mercury as an artist and as a person. Also, wonderfully played band members were: Gwilym Lee as Brian May, Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor, Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon.<br/><br/>American actor Rami Malek, who is best known from ""Mr. Robot"", does a beautiful job at becoming Freddie Mercury. Post production would have helped in the way of giving us those brooding dark Freddie Mercury eyes and an older, aged Mercury in the film's final scene. Other than that, this is a stand-out piece that ""Queen"" fans should be thrilled with."

","Being a Queen fan, I liked the movie. I think Rami didn't really got to the real Freddie, but no-one would do better. The movie's clearly for a broad audience of non-Queen fans, a generation of potential new Queen fans. For them, it's a great introduction to the greatness of Freddie, Queen and their music.
It's clear that Brian and Roger carefully watched and produced the filming. And I mean that as a compliment. They wanted to honour Freddie, give some short of general impression of how the band came together, worked and evolved. Some parts are dramatized a bit (the split?), others were completely left out, and they managed to 'generalize' large, complex parts in the bands history.
I give a 10 out of 10 mark. I liked the movie a lot, I'd give it an 8, but the Live Aid ending is overwhelming, so hey, 10 it is!"

"slugermanuk","9","1","3","28 October 2018"," Live Magic On Screen
","This movie needs to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system. It's an engaging two hours plus and culminates with an unbelievable re-creation of four of the six songs from the band's Live Aid set in 1985. The film faithfully captures the feel of the 70s and early 80s. The songs of course are top rate, and If the film is ever in danger of flagging, up comes another fantastic song, more often than not followed by the live performance: check out 'We Will Rock You' at Madison Square Garden. Having seen the group many times, rest assured, the live sequences are spot on. Rami Malek gives a stunning performance as Freddie and although at the beginning the famous teeth seem a bit too big than they were in real life, when the trademark moustache appears halfway through the movie it seems to be less of an issue. Gwilym Lee in particular looks and sounds uncannily like Brian May and there's strong support from all of the cast. I would single out Allen Leech as Paul Prenter - a long way from Downton Abbey....., and Lucy Boynton as the 'Love of my Life'. Plus there's a gem of a turn from Mike Myers as an EMI executive. Look out for the quip about performing rock songs in cars.<br/><br/>Yes, the dialogue is a bit cheesy in places but I suspect it's actually quite realistic as seldom do I recall a band being more focused or having more self-belief - because ""that's Queen"".... which is probably exactly right. For the majority of the movie the dialogue works fine: if you're looking for Oscar-winning screenplays look elsewhere, that's not what this movie is about. No doubt Queen purists will spot several inaccuracies, e.g. Fat Bottomed Girls - great song at the wrong time; and Freddie probably had no moustache when We Will Rock You was recorded. Overall though this doesn't detract from the experience of the film, and if you want textbook accuracy, go see a documentary. Note - the one major inaccuracy was Mercury's announcement of his AIDS diagnosis before the Live Aid concert, which was not the case in reality, but probably justified dramatically in view of the scene which follows.<br/><br/>The gay aspect is certainly neither ignored nor whitewashed. Particularly impressive were the choroegraphed scenes (presumably based on the Mineshaft in New York) during during 'Another One Bites The Dust' interspersed with the live performance; the creation of which smash song is a highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>However it's the last 20 minutes at Live Aid which really caps the movie and must be one of the most thrilling sequences committed to film. Every move the band makes is exactly as it happened - see the existing recordings of the actual event. That scene is worth the price of the admission alone.<br/><br/>Ignore the critics: as Freddie would have said - ""they're talking out of here"" (pointing behind him), and go and enjoy a little bit of live magic on the screen."

They had said this about the movie Venom which turned out to be way better than what the critics have said.<br/><br/>If you have seen the movie A star is born then you will definitely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody has shown to be an emotional rollercoaster ride with it playing with your emotions as you watch the band come together then to them performing on stage.<br/><br/>With the use of the popular hits and anthems any person will be able to recognise the tunes and sing along while the characters perform.<br/><br/>The movie shows the life of Freddie Mercury and his sexuality as well as the life of the band members, people are able to find out new information about the band that they didn't know original from the movie.<br/><br/>There are some small Easter eggs in the movie for the Queen fan, that has references to other performances as well as movies that their songs have been played in.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a great movie from a fans view and the general public view.

","I've used IMDB for years but I've never written a review. This film inspired me to write my first.<br/><br/>After years of false dawns the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody finally arrived and I've got to say I was blown away.<br/><br/>Starting from their very beginnings with Brian May and Roger Taylor in Smile and culminating in their jaw dropping appearance at Wembley as part of Live Aid in 1985 it was a triumph from start to finish.<br/><br/>The cast is so well chosen - May and Deacon look and sound like the actual band members to the point it's unerring - but the performance of Malek as Freddie stands out head and shoulders above them all.<br/><br/>Punches are not pulled as Freddie is portrayed as a man conflicted about his sexuality, his love of Mary and his descent into alcohol, drugs and multiple hook ups. Plus of course the devastating news that he's HIV positive.<br/><br/>Mixed into this perfectly are the live performances and great music (I am a huge fan).<br/><br/>The Live Aid performance at the end is fantastic. Absolutely jaw dropping as old Wembley is recreated using a huge stage and CGI.<br/><br/>Go and see this film!"
"rocknrelics","9","1","3","27 October 2018"," Great fun, but completely inaccurate!
","Was both hugely entertained and moved, and if Rami Malek doesn't get an award for his performance, there's no justice. However, the chronology is all over the place, why was Freddie singing 'Fat Bottomed Girls' whilst dressed in an outfit he'd have worn in 1974, four years before 'Fat Bottomed Girls' was released? Why was there a presentation disc for 'Dark Side of the Moon' on an ordinary EMI label?? Why was their first tour of the USA with Mott the Hoople not mentioned? There are lots(and I mean lots!) of instances like this throughout the film where things are just plain wrong, and they did annoy me, but I went to be entertained and I was, and also shed a few more tears than I expected to. Recommended without hesitation, just ignore the chronology of events!"

","Me and the missus are both big Queen fans and have been looking forward to seeing this for a long time.

He's absolutely brilliant. Of course there are inaccuracies, it's inevitable. If you want accurate, you watch a documentary. If you're a Queen fan and want entertaining, see this.

"MovieNinjaGuy","9","1","3","25 October 2018"," Stunning musical recreations and a beautiful tribute to Freddie Mercury
","Loved the movie.
It is funny, moving and just epic in places where it needs to be and feels quite British in parts too.<br/><br/>Rami Malek and the rest of the cast carry the film and story perfectly. Malek easily deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>As someone who knows a bit about Mercury and Queen I can obviously see straight away that certain parts of Mercury's life are romanticised and not everything happened exactly this way. But I feel they used the ""tools"" in Mercury's life perfectly to create a story that had a beginning, middle and end and sees Freddie in a sort of hero's journey situation which works really well.<br/><br/>Movies have to be done that way for dramatic effect (See Titanic).<br/><br/>There is perhaps one scene (band are having dinner at Freddies' parents home) where the editing and flow of conversation looked a bit clumsy (when Freddie gets an important phone call). But other than that every scene had relevance and was done well in my opinion.<br/><br/>I can't understand for the life of me what critics wanted to see. But I get the impression their desires come across as a bit creepy and perverted from what I've seen them mostly complain about. As if they wanted to see Mercury being humiliated for a large part of the movie or something. I'm not sure how that would have worked along the feel good music. Furthermore I always think the gossip was exaggerated with Mercury. Someone who was this prolific in the studio and on stage I just don't think had the time to do everything he was ever accused off and to the extent that tabloids wrote about him. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Regardless this movie is about Mercury the performer, not Mercury ""only the homosexual"". What critics seem to want is some type of character study that is only based on sexual activities. Nasty! Furthermore the movie actually shows Mercury's reaction to that type of thought and shines the light into the opposite direction. As if to say: ""Not so funny then, is it?"" Interesting thus also that critics who read Bohemian Rhapsody the song wrong, are doing the same with Bohemian Rhapsody the movie. The irony is quite incredible.<br/><br/>Regardless, critics' reactions seem to be so polarising these days. They seemingly ALL enjoyed The Last Jedi and almost ALL hated this? I don't get it and I think a lot of brown nosing and swapping of brown paper bags is going on, especially with strong Disney brands.<br/><br/>What we are left with instead (and I am glad about) is a stunning tribute to Mercury made with much love, fun and great little nods to details for those in the know (Live Aid volume etc).<br/><br/>The Live Aid sequence is astonishingly well recreated to say the least and something I've never seen done in a musical movie. Biopics of artists are usually quite terrible and fluff over musical performances or you see very little. Not so here.<br/><br/>Perfect sound and visuals. It really looked like the old Wembley was rebuilt for this movie and everyone at Live Aid invited back somehow.<br/><br/>It was fun hearing Queen play around with the 20th Century Fox logo music too.<br/><br/>Utterly compelling and fantastically well executed.<br/><br/>Highly Recommend!"
"grahame_jenkins","9","1","3","25 October 2018"," A stand out experience
","It has been a long time since I was utterly absorbed in a film.........those 3 or 4 occasions in your life when you come away from the cinema flooded with emotions and thoughts and a euphoria. This was one of those moments. Freddie has to be one of the most testing roles for an actor to play, complex, iconic, loved. Rami did a superb job when he could have so easily made a right bollocks of it. The 'supporting' cast were excellent too. All too often with period pieces you get the impression that they are shoving set decoration at you to try and make you believe you are in the 60's or 70's or whenever. This film had a much subtler approach, but you still came away with a real feel for the time. Music - fantastic as you would expect......it's Queen after all - however I loved how they crafted the performances so they didn't sound like karaoke night at the local pub! My one real issue was with the unrealistic filmed crowd shots at Wembley - the front row close-ups of the audience and the press photographer box just sucked.......it was almost as if they had grabbed a few people from the production crew and shoved them in while they were standing idle, to avoid casting realistic concert goers. But that was a minor gripe in what was a wonderfully moving and evocative film the memory of which I will treasure for may years."

"marc-cheyne","5","2","10","11 December 2018"," TV movie
","As a fan of both Rami Malek (from Mr. Robot) and Freddie Mercury, I'd been looking forward to this movie for months. Sadly, I was disappointed. Rami puts in a decent performance, but fails to capture Freddie's sharp tongue - as seen his Freddie's interviews.<br/><br/>There really isn't much substance to the movie - it feels like a TV movie. It shows little of Freddie's life before Queen, beside 5 minutes of his work as a baggage hander at Heathrow Airport, and his traditional homelife. I was hoping to see something of his childhood in Zanzibar and schooling in post-Empire India.<br/><br/>Instead, the movie begins with Freddie replacing Smile's lead singer, persuading them to cut an album and change their name to Queen, and then they're a success! Then the bulk of the movie is a slow montage of Queen's hit songs and world tours, against the underwhelming back story of Freddie's marriage (of convenience) failing.<br/><br/>The movie fails to detail the licentious German gay scene that Freddie embraced with abandon during his solo career. The movie culminates with Queen's reunion and Live Aid performance, framed as the highlight of their career.<br/><br/>And there the story ends - omitting Freddie's final years, as he showed great courage in continuing to produce great songs while his illness ravaged him - in the full glare of the worldwide media. Freddie just put on a little make-up and a smile and soldiered on, until the end. The movie should have ended at Freddie's deathbed. Surrounded by his family and friends, and hundreds of fans holding vigil outside the hospital.<br/><br/>This movie is worth watching if you're a Rami or a Freddie fan, but I'd recommend watching the documentary 'Freddie, the Great Pretender' if you want to watch a very moving depiction of Freddie Mercury."

","I'm very disappointed by the way movie portrays Freddie - like he was an angel. A few things are on my mind: Mary saying, ""Oh, Freddie, you are gay."" but we never see, not in a single shot that she is not satisfied with the life they have. They have sex, she is happy, smiling, cheerful after all that, goes to work like she is the happiest person in the world. And boom, Freddie, you are gay. The director obviously skipped to show that part, to tell us what situations led her to say something like that, 'cause all we, the spectators, know is they have a perfect life.
Second, Freddie was gay - okay, no sex scenes, not even kissing scenes (except for just one tiny kiss, which was, by the way, so short that I cannot even remember who kissed him), the language Freddie used in his life was not angelic as well. No drugs, no this, no that - this movie resembles all Russian movies about LGBT characters (or some other tricky topic), where they exclude all profanity language, all ""vulgar or pervert scenes"", leaving us watch like a fairy tale for kids.
The musical performance is great throughout the whole movie, and Rami Malek did a really great job; however, if I want to watch Queen performing Live Aid 1985, I will certainly visit YT and enjoy the REAL performance, not the copy of it, no matter how great it is."

Also, the more I learned about the real story of the band Queen afterwards, the more I realized just how much this movie changed from the real story. So much so that it feels less like creative liberties were taken and more like history was being revised. That bothers me.

"SnoopyStyle","7","1","4","2 September 2019"," needs some darker scenes
","It's a biopic of the popular band Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury. It starts in 1970 London. Freddie Bulsara (Rami Malek) is a baggage handler at Heathrow. He joins Roger Taylor and Brian May after they lose their lead singer. They add bassist John Deacon. Freddie changes his name to Freddie Mercury and marries girlfriend Mary Austin. The band signs with manager John Reid and becomes a world wide success. Freddie has an affair with Paul Prenter and comes out to Mary. It's a troubled life journey culminating to the celebrated Live Aid concert in 1985.<br/><br/>The most important aspect of this biopic is Rami Malek's performance. For the most part, it is very good. If I choose to be snarky, I would say the teeth did half the job. While I think he has the essence of the role, his musical performances fall short in terms of power. In the end, all I know about Freddie Mercury is through his music videos and Malek needs to turn the dial to 11. Malek does fill up the role with humanity. One gets the sense of his confidence which seems to be a mask for his insecurities and his sexuality. He is a man of many dimensions and Malek is able to match his charisma. It's a very good performance.<br/><br/>If there are flaws, the movie is pulling some of its punches back. I'm not pushing for a gay orgy scene but his homosexuality is held back for presumably the audience. If not that, then there could be more done with his drug use. I rarely call for montages but this case calls for it. It could go dark with a montage of his drug use. By going darker, his climb back to the light would be more exhilarating. As for exhilarations, I expected more from the Live Aid performance. I remember watching some of the concert back in the day but not for long stretches. The movie tries to make it something epic especially with the donations. I can't speak to that but it goes a little too far. It pushes too hard. I would eliminate the phone bank scenes. Overall, this movie is compelling. The band and its music is epic. The performances are good. It's a pretty good musical biopic."

"DarthVoorhees","5","1","4","28 March 2019"," 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a great bad movie. Queen is brought to life in an entertaining clunker of a bio-pic
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a victim of it's genre which is a very specific genre. It is an Oscar bait bio-pic designed with the same beats to get the same responses. At it's most base storytelling level 'Bohemian Rhapsody' could have really been about any rock and roller singer with it's rags to riches to redemption rinse and repeat storyline. This can be both frustrating for a viewer and immensely entertaining. Maybe I'm coming from it from a cynical point of view but I had a good time with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' as it is entertaining in a bad clunky way. The whole thing is a carefully manipulated as it seems as if every single line of dialogue is exposition for an audience the filmmakers not only assumes knows nothing about Queen but also cannot follow this story without plot points being blatantly pointed out. They actually have the gall to include a scene where Freddy Mercury watches a television report that explain the symptoms of AIDS to us...<br/><br/>It works despite it's self as Remi Malek is outstanding in the title role and makes the film immensely watchable. The film tries to do too much. If the last act about preparing for Live Aid had been expanded into a feature length film I think we wouldn't have fallen into the cliche traps I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>The chief draw to the picture is the music of Queen which is still is electric years later. I wonder how much of the film's staging works just because the music is so good. It would be legitimately interesting to recut the film with the iconic Queen music replaced with drivel. I honestly don't know if it would be salvageable. For what it's worth I liked Malek and I loved the music and I laughed at the bio pic formula. It isn't intelligent or deep storytelling but seeing this fictionalized Queen put together their hits after strumming a few chords in a jam session will put a grin on your face."

","I know very little about Queen so I'm not fussed about the 'inaccuracies in timelines'. I'm just a little disturbed that Freddie Mercury is portrayed as a completely self-obsessed, selfish, self-destructive person while the other 3 band members literally stand by for the first half of the movie smirking / giving hammy reaction shots. We get it, the casting director did a good job of picking actors who look a lot like the band members (except Mercury himself, which is a pity, but Malek tries super hard to embody him). Anyway, this film gave me a better appreciation for their music experimentation and passion for creativity, and that I can respect."

","A brief history of musical band Queen.<br/><br/>What can audience expect from a movie about legendary music band Queen directed by notorious Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, Valkyrie, X-Men universe movies) by screenplay written by Anthony McCarten who gained recognition and fame for his latest works of The Theory of Everything and Darkest Hour? Without no doubt a high quality product.<br/><br/>And what do we have in reality?
Non-dynamic, non-drama, unemotional and non-expressive story consisting of a series of individual fragments, spinning around the person of Freddie Mercury. It is absolutely not clear what goal the authors of the film set themselves, but they created it as if with tied hands. Either because of the responsibility hanging over them, or because of the fear of putting Mercury in the wrong light.<br/><br/>The biggest drawbacks of the film are the script and the lack of realism.
Acting of Rami Malek (Mr. Robot, Papillon) is highly overrated. The main character is not disclosed, although there is no Malek guilt in it.<br/><br/>It is worth noting the visual similarity of the film characters with their real life prototypes. The similarity is really amazing. Here the filmmakers have tried their best.
Pleasant impressions while watching the movie causes the acting of Lucy Boynton (Murder on the Orient Express, Apostle) in the role of Mary Austin, a Freddy's friend. Her acting is sincere and causes the proper emotions in the viewer. Aidan Gillen (Game of Thrones, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) and Tom Hollander (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Valkyrie, About Time) are on their places too.<br/><br/>Speaking of cinematography, the film has beautiful close-ups and accents on the details. High-quality montage and warm colors harmoniously complement each other. Scenes of live performances filmed at high level and create for the viewer the effect of presence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Bohemian Rhapsody turned out as a family movie on a non-family friendly topic. Neither emotional, non intellectual.
I wish someday we could see a movie about Queen starring Sacha Baron Cohen in the spirit of The Doors by Oliver Stone."

","Were all the members of Queen and everyone in their orbit really that self-centered and angry all the time?

How was this nominated for best picture? A boring puff piece that fails to build empathy or connection with the characters."
"bhcoopa","4","1","4","26 February 2019"," Misleadingly titled ""Bohemian Rhapsody;"" should've been ""Mercury.""
","I'm a guitarist and a huge fan of Queen. I took my mom to see them when I was 19 because they are part of what truly defines classic rock to me. It's classical. Anyone from the 60s who made timeless epic ballads of rock was classically trained, including everyone in Queens band.<br/><br/>This movie is called Bohemian Rhapsody after what is surely their most successful song. However, the movie should have just been called Mercury, because it wasn't about anyone else. Freddie Mercury is the vehicle in this movie for which we get to be exposed Queen, but we don't learn anything at all about the band mates and their personal lives who, as reinforced by the movie, played just as big of a role in making the music and the performance as Freddie Mercury did. The movie doesn't explore how the band mates really meet. Just how Freddie Mercury comes to know Brian May and Roger Taylor. Never mind that Brian May was both an Astrophysicist and voted the 7th greatest guitarist of all time, 2 fields feats that require enormous dedication and attention to detail, yet the movie only lightly touches on his capabilities as a musician.<br/><br/>Overall, everything about this movie is larger than life. I thought the acting and shooting of the movie were superb. But it wasn't a movie about Queen, it was a movie about Freddy Mercury, and while the man is likely to be one of the most influential figures of all time, giving him such a stature of omnipotence really shortchanges the movie. The story does somewhat touch on the fact that Mercury needs queen and Queen needs Mercury, but it doesn't feel like it.<br/><br/>This would be like making a movie called ""Stairway"" and us only seeing the life of Robert Plant and attrinuting all of Led Zeppelin's success to him, and not to the other classically trained musicians in his band Bonham, Paige, or Simon. I put off watching this movie for fear that it wouldn't give a wholistic look at Queen in favor of ""giving the 'fans'"" what they want, not genuine lovers of Rock and it's history.<br/><br/>At 23, this movie should really appeal to me, but as a musician, it does not. How could you make a movie and not have the musicianship of the entire band at the forefront of this film? It was a let down for me."

","I am struggling to understand why the film has received such good reviews, as apart from the soundtrack, the film was very bland.<br/><br/>Malek is like a spitting image style caricature of Freddie Mercury, and does not have the physical stature to play the great man. The supporting cast (Myers aside) are television actors at best - and that shows.<br/><br/>When you get to the ""story"" it is very weak, and almost entirely made up. Such as Mercury splitting the band (Queen released several albums during the alleged split up), timing of releases, how they apparently got added to Live Aid at the last minute, when Mercury finds out he has aids. The list goes on!<br/><br/>The music is incredible, and was the only reason that I sat through the entire film.<br/><br/>I can see why Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Whishaw decided against filming this poor interpretation of Mercury and Queen."

","Just to begin with: Bryan Singer's depiction of Freddie Mercury and Queen's concerts are absolutely brilliant in terms of their direction and editing. The cinematography of the film is also excellent and it is overall a very polished effort. As was Rami Malek's performance.<br/><br/>What I really and truly missed in this film was authenticity. Especially with regards to the writing which seemed almost superficial and afraid of spoiling a perfect image of a perfect rock band. Perhaps this goes in line with the massive advertisement of the film and that it needs to be politically correct in most ways.<br/><br/>To sum up I think the direction is excellent but the tight Hollywood-esque writing really suffers from flaws in terms of conveying true emotion and authenticity.<br/><br/>I saw this screening very close to seeing and experiencing Bradley Cooper's ""A Star Is Born"", which I hugely preferred due to its down-to-earth direction and writing as well as some very unpolished and vulnerable performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>Nonetheless I can recommend this film to any fan of Queen, as it gives some interesting perspectives on the life of Freddie Mercury."

"Maz-hell","7","1","4","16 November 2018"," A biographic picture that forgot the biographic part
","This is a really great movie. I have a few problems and I want to write about them before you vote me unhelpful.<br/><br/>First of all: It sells itself as a biopic. It definitely isn't. This movie considers that you already know a lot about Queen. The characters are never introduced for starters. Most of the characters just come and go and you have little idea what is going on until a lot later. Most of them won't be remembered by name. You'll recall them as ""The bighaired one"" or ""the beach one"" or ""the one that dared question Freddy"" but you'll never give them a name. Dates? Pfft. Forget about them. At most you'll get a couple of years. Reasonings? not here. Sequences of events? Try again.<br/><br/>Even though the acting was incredibly powerfull and so good you could actually believe Freddy resurrected for this movie... It was not enough. It lacks focus. The movie can't decide if it want to talk about Freddies life, The band's life, or any of the personal lives of anyone... It tries to spread too much, so even though the acting was indredible it just feels dispersed.<br/><br/>The ending was out of these world. It was obviously edited and reconstructed by a computer, but you could only want to have been there. It was marvelous. I sang, I cried, I loved it. Too bad it was the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>In short: A movie that has no focus for almost 2 hours, shamelessly selling at queen's fans and will concentrate and give you every feeling possible at the end, but not enough to be memorable. Would probably not watch it again, but I would not mind to."
"cranium889","5","1","4","13 November 2018"," So-So movie with a MINDBLOWINGLY AMAZING CLIMAX
","BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY's spot on recreation of Queen's legendary Live Aid performance is so sensational, so amazing, so epic, that it brought tears to my eyes...<br/><br/>...shame that it's attached to the end of a barely ok Netflix movie.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is as much about Queen as Rock Star is about Judas Priest. You could easily rebrand this movie, as-is, as Rock Star 2 and no one would bat an eye.<br/><br/>The Good: Rami Malik absolutely NAILS Freddy. His walk, his mannerisms, his attitude, his emotional spiral, its perfect. He truly gave an exceptional performance.<br/><br/>The Bad: He was the only actor given anything to do!!! Everyone else is stale, one-dimensional characters that are provided no development whatsoever. The main cast (except freddie) are glorified extras in the made-for-tv Freddie Mercury story.
Yeah, made-for-tv. The story is completely sanitized, so young audiences can watch it...but they wont learn anything about Queen! It could've at least told the true story surrounding the band's Live Aid performance ( Bob Geldolf announcing the band's appearance without their knowledge, their playing a 20 minute set when they were only allotted 15, the fact that they were supposed to be opening for Bob and, instead, stole the whole show out of spite), but nope. And instead of showing Freddie's struggle, being a homsexual at a time when homosexuality was demonized, the movie itself aaallmmmooossst demonizes homosexuality.
Besides being a biopic that's as true as A Million Little Pieces, is the movie good? Its generic montage after generic montage of blasé concert footage and goofball recording sessions, where one character has a story arc, while all the rest are cardboard cutouts. Its entertaining, but not great.<br/><br/>Still...that final 20 minutes is so mindblowingly, punch a hole in the sky phenomenal, that you forgive the rest of the movie and even a few other movies.

There is a nice balance between Freddie's private and intimate moments from his life and performances with the band.

"johnplocar","7","1","4","7 November 2018"," The story of the legendarily praised band Queen and its lead singer Freddy Mercury... which seems to be relatively generic.
","I just want to make things clear before I get into my review that I like the band Queen, I like Freddie Mercury's work, and I thought that this movie was fine. But that's just it, it's just fine and doesn't go any further than just being 'okay'. The reason I am saying this from the start is because I'm probably going to be speaking about mostly the negatives. I don't believe that this is necessarily a bad film, I just think it has a lot of squandered potential.<br/><br/>Now onto the bashing...just a joke...sort of.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is the story about Freddie Mercury and his band Queen. Starting out at the when the band gets together through Freddie Mercury's sexual exploration and drug years, to the bitter end of the legend Mercury himself. And that is basically it, which is kind of my problem with the film. It is pretty much a 'bullet point' biopic. What I mean by that is that the story seems to be nothing more than making sure to hit on all of the major historical points for this band and Freddie's life. That's it. There's no overarching story line really, nor much focus on character depth or chemistry.<br/><br/>The plot is simply -<br/><br/>Step 1: Band meets and gets together.<br/><br/>Step 2: Band writes first hit .<br/><br/>Step 3: Band records first album.<br/><br/>Step 4: Freddie gets married.<br/><br/>Step 5: Queen music tour montage.<br/><br/>Step 6: Freddie starts figuring out he's gay.<br/><br/>Step 7: Queen music tour montage.<br/><br/>Step 8: Queen fights and writes a new hit song.<br/><br/>Step 9: Queen music tour montage.<br/><br/>Step 10: Queen fights and writes Bohemian Rhapsody.<br/><br/>Step 11: Queen music tour montage.<br/><br/>Step 12: Freddie realizes he's gay and he breaks up with his wife.<br/><br/>Step 13: Queen music tour montage.<br/><br/>Step 14: Queen breaks up.<br/><br/>Step 15: Freddie becomes self-destructive with sex and drugs.<br/><br/>Step 16: Queen gets back together.<br/><br/>Step 17: Queen performs on stage for the last 20 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/>Now this is decent material to work with in a script, but without enough character development or a story that feels like it truly links everything together it just comes across as 'things just happening'. Now, I want to emphasize again that I don't think that this is bad, but it does make the film feel generic. However, in my opinion, the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen should really be anything except generic.<br/><br/>To get into character, there's no specific character that's technically bad but I feel like I don't really get good enough insight into who these people really are. Freddie Mercury is eccentric, gay, and is good at performing...that's all I got out of a nearly two and a half hour movie. His wife was...definitely a woman. The band mates of Queen...could have been doctors and engineers. Paul is...evil. Yeah, I'm trying and I'm drawing a blank for everyone. Which is probably one of the biggest sins that a biopic can commit, not giving your audience enough understanding of your characters who actually exist.<br/><br/>Anyways, if I want to watch a recent biopic about a band that also dealt with a character that contracts AIDs, I would rather go with ""Straight Outta Compton"". Or another biopic that handled the character arc of discovering one's sexuality in the 1970s and 1980s, ""Battle of the Sexes"" was also another film that did a better job with those themes. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" kind of fumbles where those other two found a good balance of story, character and hitting all of the bullet points too.<br/><br/>To get into the positives though, this is a very stylish film. The cinematography and editing is really solid, I mean it. It is superbly gorgeous, through and through. Probably one of the best looking films I've seen all year. The acting on everyone's part was also all very good, especially from Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury who did a fantastic job. He was honestly a major reason that the movie held my interest for as long as it did. Running at about two hours and fifteen minutes, without Malek's performance, I would have been more irritated by the film and its faults. Towards the beginning of the film, I will admit that I did find the fake teeth that they put in his mouth to be distracting and somewhat silly. I know that Mercury's teeth were also very prominent, but they at least seem more natural with his face while with Malek it looks like his mouth is just fighting against the prosthetic rather than working with it. After a while though I got used to it, plus it looked slightly more natural once it got to Freddie's mustache years. And my final positive would be the final act, it's probably the best part of the film. I think the reason for that is because it finally feels like it has focus and the music segments are more emotionally ramped up.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that the film is okay even with all its problems. I'd say that if you catch this on television or Netflix then this will be perfectly fine where you can occasionally pause to take a break or have parts play in the background. Especially since I think that fifteen minutes or so probably could have been cut from the movie to make it a bit tighter, so if the movie loses your attention for a few minutes here and there I don't think it'll be so bad at home. It's a beautifully shot film, edited well, acted at the best of everyone's capabilities; it just lacks in story and character."
"bobbsaunders","8","1","4","6 November 2018"," Hugely Entertaining and Moving - but not a great movie.
","This title seems self contradictory, but although this movie is deeply flawed, I overall loved it. It is very moving and I was genuinely tearing up in the last 10 minutes. Rami Malek is the main reason, with his extraordinary performance that isn't just an impersonation, it provides insights into the darkness and lonliness that drove Freddie to such heights. Lets not also forget that this was largley directed by Brian Singer, a director well skilled in eliciting emotional responses (Silver Lining Playbook). Shure, he departed before finishing it due to creative clashes with Queen, but his skill is on display in many parts of thus movie. If you haven't seen it yet then be prepared for a very hokey first half that gets progressively better throughout. The second half is what makes the movie. Go see it, its fine entertianment."

","Yes, yes, Queen was a very cool band. But this movie is a paint-by-the-numbers of their story. It hints at things, but never really scratches much below the surface. It seems more energy was spent on period-accurate costumes and set dressing, which it does really well, but it also makes May, Taylor and Deacon look like cartoon characters, not single scene of who they were or how they dealt with their challenges or successes. I mean how did John Deacon even join the band? Ultimately I did enjoy it, and I guess it's more Freddy's story, but i was hoping for more insights and substance."
"mattwiddowson","8","1","4","3 November 2018"," A flawed spectacle
","This film has moments of stunning brilliance and moments of almost embarrassing slapdash shoddiness often following each other closely. I'm not really a Queen fan so I can't really comment on the story or the veracity of the portrayal of Mercury's life, so all I can do is offer my opinion on a film.
Two elements carry this film - Rami Malek's dazzlingly captivating performance and the music itself. Malek's portrayal of Mercury is reason alone to see this movie. The final twenty minutes of music give the audience a rush of fast paced musical excitement and is, in the true meaning of the word, awesome (and remember, I'm not really an admirer of Queen so their fans will bloody love it).
That said, the film feels rushed and, at times awkwardly didactic - an introduction to Queen from the perspective of the producers ('Look audience, I wrote this song, look look!). While Malek's acting is sublime, the supporting band members are protrayed as 2D and rather dull. May, Deacon and Taylor are flat characters - at best laddish and played for warmhearted laughs, at worst simply boring. I'm sure there is much more to the real life surviving Queens than this.
For all the talk of this being a film about Queen, it ended up as a film about Mercury and some nice blokes he hung around with in the studio.
At times, the script was poor and the dialogue felt forced as if the film makers had to elbow in utterances that form part of the Queen cannon without any concern about how they would come across on screen. This gives the overriding feel of: 'this happened, then this happened, then this happened...' with die hard fans expected to smile knowingly at each famous quote.
You should see this film though. Really you should. For all its clunky dialogue, often flat supporting cast and bitty storytelling, it is a spectacle."
"fabianaguileragutierrez","6","1","4","3 November 2018"," Don't believe the hype. Still good though.
","First of all, this movie delivers, there's no doubt in that. Acting is on point (Malek steals the show right away), visually is alright, and the script is pretty tight.<br/><br/>But... What the hell went wrong in the editing room? Like, you've got a decent amount of exquisite raw footage ready to be mixed and you screw it like that? Really? Pacing is just plain awful. Unnecessary cuts here and there are just painful. And that ending was just... no. This ain't it chief.<br/><br/>So to wrap this up; This should have been a masterpiece, but they decided to make an amalgam of weird pacing and bad editing that sums up an enjoyable light-hearted collage about Freddy Mercury and the boys. 7/10"

"manders_steve","7","1","4","28 October 2018"," An uplifting behind the scenes look at Queen
","I really enjoyed this re-creation of Queen and Freddie Mercury, which provided unexpected insights. It balanced music performance, Farrokh Bulsara's family life, the up and downs of professional musician's lives, their managers and the challenges of maintaining relationships really well, and mostly deserved its 2 hour 15 minutes running time.<br/><br/>II'm a child of the mid 1950s, remain a regularly performing amateur musician, and I've found Queen's music entertaining, interesting, technically competent and full of substantial themes. This film focuses on the 1980s and music and issues of that era, and if you don't have interest or appreciation of those issues, you may find the film slow or irrelevant. I felt the first third could have been tightened without losing the narrative.<br/><br/>The visual presentation is terrific and took me back to that era. I recall watching the 1985 Live Aid for Africa concert on a little TV of that time, and the film recalled all the buoyant positive emotion of that spectacle.<br/><br/>The casting is terrific, and no one stood out to me as inadequate. Rami Malek looks and sounds like Freddie Mercury - a tribute to the casting and the dozens of musical and technical coaches listed on the credits. Plus, and probably more importantly, Rami's hard work over months if not a year or two.<br/><br/>The screening structure and dialogue writing are top notch, and both contribute to some really funny moments and overall believability. As Myth Busters Adam and Jamie might say, ""It's plausible"".<br/><br/>If you recall Queen and the music from that era fondly, I expect you'll love it. Otherwise, there's a fair bit to think about in its treatment of gender relationships, sexual preferences and current issues. But it's primarily a band film, and your enjoyment might be similar to your affection for this band's music.<br/><br/>I've rated it 7 considering a broader audience. Queen aficionados will doubtless rate it higher."

"wfjohnston14","6","1","6","20 November 2018"," See it because of Rami Malek
","I left the theater with lots of mixed emotions. The story is trying to do a lot of things and still manages to make things feel too long. However, I could not take my eyes off of Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddie Mercury, and of course, the music was great. The musical performances are well done so for that reason along with Malek, it's a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>The plot tries to do too much. It starts as a crash course of how Queen came to be. It takes songs that we are all very familiar with and goes in depth a little on the creation of the song. Freddie's life is sprinkled a little here and a little there but the main story is Queen. Then things shift once Freddie's true sexuality enters the picture and that takes full steam. The music aspect dies off and we watch Freddie change. By the end of the film, both roads come at a crossroads, a conclusion where we get to see Queen's infamous Live Aide performance. The film is not terrible at both stories but would've been a lot more effective if it chose one to stick with. Either do a Freddie Mercury biopic or on the chemistry of Queen.<br/><br/>The music numbers are well done, a big part to Rami Malek. He doesn't hold back in his performance letting it all out. He does so when off stage too, making him really engrossing, and we hang on through the rough portions. Outside of his performance, the only one that stood out was Mike Myers, just because I hadn't seen him in a while and he was hidden well with his makeup. It wasn't until he talked that I realized it was him. The rest of the performances were solid because the cast looked like they were having fun, but none stood out like Rami.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that I feel like felt more like a disappointment because of the hype. That was partially due to me having higher bars but it is entertaining. Rami Malek will certainly be in the Oscar race but I will think about how this film could've been better, especially pertaining to music related films from this year and recent years such as A Star is Born, La La Land, and The Greatest Showman."

With all the options available to us with Queen's music, the filmmakers missed the bus. I found my foot tapping on one occasion. It caused me to look around to see if anyone was moved beyond me. If they were, they disguised it well.<br/><br/>I am a huge Queen fan. This movie spends a lot of time showing how the band wanted to involve their audience, but in the finish, the movie audience did not step across that threshold.<br/><br/>The good? Mike Myers as a record exec with a punchline hat tip to Wayne's World. The actors... pretty much all of them were terrific. I think they overdid Freddie's teeth and video comparisons bear this out. The music. Even though I was not dragged in beyond a foot tap, I still love the music.<br/><br/>The bad?
Haywire timelines. Diagnosing AIDS a year or two early? A snippet of an onstage performance of Fat Bottomed Girls years early? Freddie reconnecting with the male the love of his life after the diagnosis.
A tour bus or two rolling down a highway and the names of cities emblazoned across the screen to show their world success. Come on!
Freddie watching a male trucker with come hither eyes who heads into a gas station men's room? Ugh!<br/><br/>I think people will be inclined to overrate this movie because of the music.

","In an age where political correctness (hypersensitivity, prejudice and divisiveness) is the norm, it's difficult to capture a time like the 70 which was liberated and open minded. This movie didn't do the 70s much justice. However, the live aid concert was superbly recreated with the electrical atmosphere.
Despite the high praise for Malek, he wasn't quite the Freddie I saw and remembered. Freddie was full of passion and sometimes described as hyperactive. This Freddie was subdued all the time, there was no spark, no fire in Malek's performance.
I also struggled to feel a deep connection with any of the characters. It was like watching them through a window rather than engaging them.
Despite that, the story was very enjoyable and helped us appreciate the balance and bonds within the band.
There are also several obvious errors (eg. His family called him Freddie from a young age).
If you like Queen, this is surely worth watching. It made me miss the data where people were liberated and open minded. Damn mainstream media has messed so much up in recent years."

"bock_g","6","1","7","7 December 2018"," Is this real life or is it just fantasy? Caught in the landslide of biopicnosis
","As an average Queen admirer who watches the epic Live Aid performance on repeat and listens to the Greatest Hits album (both part 1 and 2) as a daily routine, my expectations were relatively high when I watched the trailer. Those expectations lowered once I peeked at some of the reviews and audience responses. I live in Japan, where Queen has arguably their most loyal fan base (that should've been mentioned in the film); and are still showing the film in big theaters. I watched the film today, with moderately low expectations, and I walked out of the theater asking myself the opening lines of the eponymous song. Honestly, I felt pretty mixed about this film. The production value was undoubtedly high: all the sets (particularly the Live Aid set) were pretty accurate. Rami Malek's detailed performance of the legendary singer was quite good and so was the other supporting cast (particularly the other band members). Listening to the band's greatest hits in the theater was comforting, but I would have enjoyed it more if the filmmakers used the actor's voices, at least during the live sequences. The most disappointing aspect was the overall narrative botched by all the historical inaccuracies. While I'm not against biopics that take some liberties with the truth for an effective dramatic narrative; this is quite disrespectful to Freddie Mercury and to the band. The two most glaring liberties this film took was Queen breaking up only to reform for the climactic Live Aid performance and the portrayal of Freddie's homosexuality. Although Live Aid was seen in real life as sort of a comeback for Queen as rock gods, I thought the idea of having the band in the film go through the clichÃ©d breaking up-to-come back again plot was cheap. Personally, the climax should've been the recording sessions of Innuendo-that's a touching story of a tight knit band. In regards to the portrayal of Freddie's homosexuality, I understand it's a difficult issue to tackle since very few people knew who he really was in his private life. However, the film portrays Freddie as guilt-ridden and somewhat forced into it by Paul Prenter, his Judas (in real life as well)-that's pretty offensive. What's more disappointing is how both Brian May and Roger Taylor as well as Jim Beach served as producers for this film-which also means that they had authority over the story and facts. It is ironic how May and Taylor fired Sacha Baron Cohen because they felt the biopic should be more about the band rather than Freddie-yet the majority of this film is Freddie. All I can assume is they either didn't know Freddie well enough, or they simply couldn't care less about the facts and were concerned about finishing this project in time. Overall, this film is like listening to The Greatest Hits, but with no appreciation and respect to Queen."

Actually this movie could have been directed by Disney. This movie failed on so many levels, including massive distortions of well known facts that it is almost depressing to watch. Besides all the distortions which include the revelation of his diagnose just prior to the Live Aid performance, the band is characterized as angels sent to earth. There is not a single point in the movie that focus on the chemistry between the elements, and everything is reported on a very superficial level, that is actually sickening to watch after a while.
The shots feel loose, and not connected at all, focusing just on some key events that are both distorted and close to the actual thing.<br/><br/>For those that know the Biopic of Jim Morrison ""The Doors"", let me saw that that's what a Biopic should be like. Admittedly, being a bit far from perfect, a movie from the 90s actually trumps this one completely, and in every single aspect. In the end, it's not even about the lack of explicit or let's say, a more deeper look in to the wild side. It is the craft itself that failed completely. From poor dialog to the plastic cast, from the bad writing to the loose direction.<br/><br/>I fail to completely understand all those high scores in here, but I guess they are; a) people that actually never saw a lot of movies in their life, and; b) not true Queen fans.

","What do you get when you write a movie about perhaps one of the most enigmatic, flamboyant, front men in rock history, but keep it clean for a PG-13 rating? You get this film, an entertaining, enjoyable movie that plays it safe and skirts the more dark elements.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury was notorious for his sexual relationships, his indulgence, his drug use, his diva behavior that made him truly a pain in the rear end to deal with in the later years. Yet, in this movie, all of that is touched on with kid gloves and we get Freddie, the PG-13 version, with some of these traits, but only to the degree that it moves the film forward. We don't dive deep into his darkest days, and we get none of the edge surrounding his choices during this time.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the rest of the members of Queen are merely props to highlight Mercury it seems. We know little about them, and they seem interchangeable parts, which, for a band as successful and popular as they still are even post Mercury, strikes me as odd. Supposedly, Roger Taylor and Brian May were very particular how their characters were portrayed in the film and as producers, edited out many of the less flattering traits each of them possessed. Why? The best bio films show all the warts and unflattering elements. Here, the keep the darkest parts of Mercury's life under wraps and give their own characters no color.<br/><br/>The truth is played with loosely all throughout the movie. Stuff is left out, events happen differently than how they truly happened, the timeline is not followed in a particular way. Also, for a band known for being extremely competitive during songwriting sessions (Queen was known as The Police before The Police when it came to this), this is only glossed over at best.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an average movie.

"joshteggert","6","0","1","6 August 2019"," An extraordinary story indeed, but told only adequately; 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is ultimately a muddled yet magnificent showcase.
","After 10 years of production hell, the Freddie Mercury biopic finally struts onto the big screen. Dissecting the fascinating yet heartbreaking life of Queen's front man - played astonishingly well by the brilliant Rami Malek - Bohemian Rhapsody looks at the decade-or-so leading up to the band's breathtaking performance at Live Aid in 1985. Though the way in which this extraordinary story is told is not as satisfying as one could have hoped.<br/><br/>Initial concerns for the film concentrated around the idea that the story was to focus more on the other band members, as if to steal the spotlight from Freddie's infamous struggle. This is not entirely the case with the finished film. What we see rather is a fairly loose attempt to get close to Freddie, one that always feels a little distracted.<br/><br/>For example, the band's vexations with Freddie's exuberant lifestyle are shoehorned into the film through changing the time that Queen released material. This is just frustratingly silly; there are several ways writers Anthony McCarten and Peter Morgan could have illustrated this, but it seems as if the need to represent the other bandmates took unnecessary precedence in parts.<br/><br/>Yet despite issues with storytelling, Rami Malek single-handedly elevates Bo Rhap to a level worthy of a Freddie Mercury biopic. He puts on a simply flawless performance as 'The Great Pretender' (credit to Jan Sewell and her team in make-up for such a convincing transformation), providing us with that ""touch of the heavens"" that Freddie promised.<br/><br/>His co-stars all support him fantastically; Lucy Boynton works well as Freddie's life-long friend Mary Austin. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello as Brian, Roger and John respectively provide spot on portrayals of their roles in the band. But it is Malek who ties the film together. Whatever is happening, Malek makes it endearing; every positive emotion the film bestows on the viewer, Malek's performance plays a huge part implementing them.<br/><br/>Bohemian Rhapsody's pace, though, is patchy. At one point it's hurtling through the early years of Queen at a 'Don't Stop Me Now' pace, then slows down completely in an effort to try and understand Freddie's daily conflicts. Sadly, the points where natural emotions are trying to be conveyed is where the film is at its weakest. It never feels as if the filmmakers are giving it their everything to really connect with the story at hand; it's like the stage fright of filmmaking.<br/><br/>And that truly is a massive disappointment, because everything else is spectacular. Yes, it's overcooked in parts, admittedly it over-dramatises certain events in an attempt to provoke a stronger response, but isn't that what Queen were all about? The fancy lights, the flamboyant displays, organised chaos left, right and centre; it is what it is, and what it is, is Queen.<br/><br/>The mind-blowing recreation of Queen's Live Aid performance alone is enough reason to see this film on the big screen. It really will send shivers down spines. The film isn't as emotionally stimulating as the 2016 documentary The Freddie Mercury Story: Who Wants to Live Forever?, but that's not to say it doesn't pack a punch as powerful as Freddie's iconic stance.<br/><br/>An extraordinary story indeed, but told only adequately; Bohemian Rhapsody is ultimately a muddled yet magnificent showcase."
"richarddillomes","7","0","2","5 August 2019"," I'll juts be here waiting for a standalone Freddie Mercury biopic.
","Bohemian Rhapsody is the title of a song of one of the world's biggest band in the world, Queen, and now the title of their biopic starring Rami Malek as the lead singer Freddie Mercury. While I'm sure we've heard of the band and their songs, for someone like me who grew up around Pop music, I know some of their songs but nothing about the band altogether so I was looking forward to watching this. The same way I only know of Elton John via the Lion King soundtrack, it would be interesting to see 'Rocketman' this year, directed by Dexter Fletcher who took over for Bryan Singer for this film when the latter was fired by the studio for being unprofessional. This may partly explain why Singer wasn't nominated for Best Director, although it could also be because the movie in my opinion failed to capture the larger-than-life figure that was Freddie Mercury.<br/><br/>As far as biopics go, Bohemian Rhapsody followed the formula very well, showing us their humble beginnings, their rise to fame, personal struggles, failures and eventual redemption culminating in their legendary performance for LIVE AID in 1985. Rami Malek was marvelous portraying the flamboyant lead singer, right off the bat when you see him a few minutes in as he goes onstage, even with his back to the camera but he was already conveying so much and you can say that is what acting is. There's a clip in Youtube showing a side-by-side comparison of Queen's LIVE AID performance and the adaptation in the movie and some sequences will give you chills for it's striking resemblance. As for his chances to win the Oscar? Slim to none, first because there were some parts in their famous performance where he seemed conscious and trying hard, second, he is playing a gay character and third, he is of Egyptian descent so it will depend on how diverse the voting committee is otherwise Rami will have to be content that he gave justice to the role and will be the benchmark of future Freddie Mercury adaptations. The rest of the cast were solid, especially Gwilym Lee who looks uncannily like Brian May.<br/><br/>When I said earlier that the film failed to honestly portray Freddie Mercury, it is based on the fact that they took way too many liberties in their adaptation, mostly in favor of the living members who had control of what goes in and what doesn't. While in good faith they deemed this necessary, it is biased towards their point of view and might not be what actually happened. Especially in scenes where only Freddie was involved, who was known to be a very private person so most of the input for him was only based on secondhand accounts and might not really be what Freddie would've done in the situation. They had to balance out his over-the-top persona with how they want the band to be known by the new generation and how they want to be remembered by the older one. That's not necessarily bad per se, but in turn they contained what we know of Mercury to so little that you leave the movie feeling deprived, but piqued enough to Google, Youtube and Spotify them. So while this may not win for Best Picture, it's a win that they got a good movie out all things considered."
"junshiwilda","7","0","1","18 July 2019"," 👍 (Oscars 2019 review # 5) Good movie that could have been a masterpiece.
","Bohemian Rhapsody is perhaps the audience favorite among the Best Picture nominees along with Green Book. It has a 8.0 IMDb rating and a 86% audience score on RT. The general audience have loved this film and almost everyone whom I talked to had a great experience. However, despite being one of the audience favorites in the whole Oscar race Bohemian Rhapsody is perhaps one of the controversial picks in the history of Oscars. It is clear from the 61% RT score that critics didn't really love this movie all that much. If you read individual critical reviews many say that this movie carved of all the edges just to make a passable PG13 movie. Though I don't agree with the critics all that much, I will say believe the critics for this one.<br/><br/>As this is a positive review the positives obviously outweigh the negatives. Many say Rami Malek was excellent in his role as Freddie Mercury and yes I totally agree. Though I was not familiar with Malek's previous works, he indeed is a solid carbon copy of Freddie Mercury. He delivers the kind of performance that will never be forgotten and with his charisma he just makes you want to just sing along. He truly did deserve all the praise he received and though I personally liked Christian Bale's performance more I do not have any complaints at all on Rami winning Best Actor. The movie was well paced over all and the performance sequences were all fantastic. To me the Live Aid performance sequence was absolutely phenomenal. The movie ends in a bang and I was just knocked out by how brilliant the whole sequence was. It made me want to clap and shout bravo when the credits started rolling. I can imagine myself buying this movie on blue ray and that is largely because of the fantastic performance by Rami Malek and the phenomenal stage performances.<br/><br/>The big problem I have with this movie is similar to the critics. Though I wasn't very familiar with the history of Queen I did know that Freddie Mercury was a very troubled man with many issues in life. I was very surprised by how this film touched very lightly on the singer's troubles and just went on ignoring them. Count me in as one of the people who didn't have a problem with all the historical inaccuracies, but I was a bit frustrated by how shallow this film decided to be by very lightly diving into the man's troubled life. Despite all the amazing performances and phenomenal stage sequences I was frustrated by how much potential it threw away for just being ""Family friendly"". First man, a movie I did have very mixed feelings about became inappropriately dark because of how the film dived into the regrets of the character of Neil Armstrong. I personally think they could have wrote the script in a similar manner to First man diving into the character of Freddie Mercury because unlike First man, this is a source material that is perfect for the script template used in First man. Yes I do believe this is a solid movie but I am frustrated to see how though they were easily able to make a great movie they chose to make a passable family entertainment movie. It is kind of like seeing a hiker close to the mountain top but deciding to stop 2/3rds away from the top.<br/><br/>Overall this is a movie I can understand why it is a audience favorite. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest you see it in the theaters or somewhere with a great sound system. Trust me, the performance by Rami Malek and the phenomenal Live Aid sequence will ""Rock"" you. I rate this a 7/10 and yes this is a solid thumbs up. Though this is a very good movie it is a bit shallow film."
"TheOneManBoxOffice","6","0","1","15 July 2019"," A decent flick with good intentions, but like many other Hollywood biopics, it takes too many liberties.
","Though I was born in 1990, I grew up listening to classic rock since childhood. Queen is also one of my favorite bands alongside Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. A movie centering around Queen's legendary frontman, the late, great Freddie Mercury, was something I have been interested in seeing. After finally viewing the picture on HBO, my feelings on it were quite mixed.<br/><br/>It's true that biopics are in fact hard to make, especially ones based on someone as iconic as Freddie. One thing I knew right off the bat as a moviegoer going in is that this isn't some independent film that would dig deep into the nitty gritty with Freddie's personal life and the band itself in a more accurate fashion. This is a Hollywood picture through and through, so there's bound to be inaccuracies and fictionalized events, and after doing some quick research online post-movie, this film directed by Bryan Singer definitely has that. Even Brian May, Queen's lead guitarist and the film's music co-producer said that much of it was pure dramatization.<br/><br/>For example, Queen didn't leave EMI early in their career, nor were there any reported disagreements or quarrels between them and EMI's CEO, or any window smashing for that matter. Another was that the conflicts between Freddie and his bandmates also didn't get to the point where they split up from one another for a time (they never did, and no, Live Aid wasn't a reunion). In the end, it's not surprising that both critics and some audiences weren't afraid to call out the pure fiction the film depicts, especially Queen loyalists. I'm also not going to note how the studio deliberately went the safer route in addressing Freddie's sexual lifestyle, 'cause everyone else has said it already.<br/><br/>But, if one were able to put all that aside, like I did, one could still see this as just a decent picture in its own right. It has some pretty good casting, especially with the band members like Rami Malek as Freddie, Guilym Lee as Brian, Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor (drummer), and Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon (bassist). The use of Queen songs in the soundtrack is obviously appropriate, with a few additions from other artists (i.e. MC Hammer's ""Can't Touch This"" for some strange reason). However, aside from the numerous historical inaccuracies spanning from how the band started to the supposed split up, the film has a bad habit of being rather melodramatic to the point where it just drags on for too long.<br/><br/>There's not really much to say about the movie other than it's your standard Hollywood biopic on a musical icon that we sadly lost to the AIDS virus, but is still considered a musical legend and a rock god to this day. I'd say give it a watch if you want to give it a chance or see what the fuss is about, but if you really want to know the true story of Freddie Mercury's life and the history of Queen in film form, your best bet is to watch a documentary."
"susenet","7","0","2","15 July 2019"," Overpraised music biopic
","This film probably works best for people who do not remember Freddie Mercury. If you have seen his dynamic performances and felt his charisma, then perhaps you, like I, will be constantly comparing Rami Malek and find his lack of similarity to Mercury to be a glaring problem. Freddie Mercury was not conventionally handsome, but my lord, he sure was attractive. He lit up the stage and you didn't really notice physical flaws (except maybe that overbite).<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me, Malek gives a fine performance, but he lacks the undefinable ""it"" quality that made Mercury a magnetic force that could not be denied. There is also the problem of some moments when you can hear speech problems caused by the prosthetic teeth he wears to simulate Mercury's unusual dentition. Freddie's teeth were quite unusual but they gave him no speech impairment.<br/><br/>There is a long sequence of Queen doing a live performance at Live Aid. Malek's version of this is a pale imitation of the real thing for me. He accurately mimics the gestures, but the dynamic personality and the on-stage confidence is just missing. It's like watching a very good karaoke performance.<br/><br/>Even IF Freddie Mercury was truly an unhappy, tormented soul in his private life, that never showed up in his performances. This is certainly a watchable movie, but I was rather disappointed in it, given all the awards and hype it had."
"writer-57589","2","0","2","13 July 2019"," Rami wins an Oscar for lip-syncing?
","There was so many inaccuracies in the film, that it's hard to stomach (other than the fabulous music by Queen). What irritates me the most is that Val Kilmer DIDN'T win the Oscar for The Doors in which he sang every song himself and the real Doors music plays and you can't tell the difference. He WAS Jim Morrison. To give an Oscar for lip-syncing and the director (who is amazing) didn't even give Rami brown contact lenses?! I won't go into the inaccuracies, because that would be spoilers. But for one, Freddie didn't know about his Aids until after the Live Aid concert and he never left Queen for CBS. Of course, the idiot agent played by Mike Myers also never existed. Overall, it wasn't worth the Oscars."
"Doctor_wHoagie","4","0","1","12 July 2019"," Embarrassingly inaccurate, lacks soul
","Let me state: Rami Malek does a fine job as Freddie Mercury from a character perspective. But the films direction in having Rami LIP SYNC his way through the film instead of actually having to attempt his sound like Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash or Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles is rather frustrating. The editing is also really awful. Abrupt cuts, an honestly hokey Live Aid CGI'd performance. It's just makes seem like a really high budget VH1 movie. Worst of all, it makes up a narrative that Mercury had done the live aid concert because he had contracted HIV. WHICH IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I actually changed my rating to a 4/10 while this review because besides Malek (not an Oscar winning performance IMO) the acting is rather average. Don't bother."

2018
Dir: Bryan Singer
Runtime: 2 hr 15 mins<br/><br/>Synopsis: Singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor and bass guitarist John Deacon take the music world by storm when they form the rock 'n' roll band Queen in 1970. Surrounded by darker influences Mercury decides to leave Queen years later to pursue a solo career. Diagnosed with AIDS in the 1980s, the flamboyant frontman reunited with the group for the benefit concert Live Aid - leading the band in one of the greatest performances in rock history.<br/><br/>Very high expectations walking into this one. Can't really compare it to ""A Star is Born"" although a fantastic music film this was more of a biopic than a story on its own. Always a fan of biopic films, but only in the case that they are done correctly. They usually follow the same formula as well, start with before the main character is famous, slowly build up that character, watch the character peak, and sometimes there will be a climatic finish or you will see the character fall from grace and never return. This pretty much followed the same general rules to a biopic film. Didn't date back too far into the pre fame and ended on a high note as Freddie Mercury's story should be done. The cinematography is always important in music films especially during the concert and live performance scenes, you want the audience to feel like they are there in the crowd as the camera gazed up at the star and the dramatic pan shot used to portray how massive or even small a crowd is. Did great use of montages crossed with concert scenes. What I did notice that a repeated formula was used throughout the film. They would show how one of their hits were created, it would slowly lead into a concert of them performing that same song and then transition into a montage of similar concerts. Sometimes the use of concerts can be under used and sometimes over used which makes it seem like too much drama or too much of a musical, I felt that this had a pretty good balance of both although it would have been fun to see some of the songs performed more in their entirety in concert than just the montages. Great camera shots and the dialogue was fantastic in portraying how fabulous and extravagant Freddie Mercury was. The film itself was wildly long as are most biopics but at one point seeing that I was only an hour in I was super surprised as how slow the film was progressing. There wasn't much dry points with the aspect that almost all of the dialogue served a purpose wether it coming back into play later in the film or it just solidifying a scene properly. The characters are so great. Although I've only seen a small amount of ""Mr. Robot"" Rami Malik is such an amazing actor. His portrayal of Freddie Mercury was probably going to be one of his greatest performances so far in his career. If you watch the Live Aid original footage and watch the performance in the film he is almost mirroring Mercury's movements and facial expressions. Queen was before my time but the film did a great job at building these characters if you don't know them. Absolutely recommend a theatre watch although it is very lengthy but the concert scenes are worth it. I'd probably buy this film because this will fall in line with other classics like ""Ray"" or ""Walk The Line""<br/><br/>not perfect only because that this is a biopic so it's hard to make it feel original with out being too artificial, and the repeated formula could have been done a little better"

","Like Freddie Mercury to Queen, this movie stands almost exclusively on the foundation of Malek's outstanding performance.

If you're looking for a feel-good movie featuring a stellar lead and polished music video-esque scenes, this is a solid choice. However, my personal enjoyment does not make this an outstanding film.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing leave so much to be desired. The amount of cuts left my head spinning. Additionally there was nothing interesting by way of shot composition. Lots and lots of simple shot, reverse shot scenes of characters talking. Bohemian Rhapsody is visually uninspired, and so poorly edited I found myself sucked right out of the environment.<br/><br/>The pacing of this story is so breakneck, it feels as if they rushed every single beat to get from one song to the next. While it's expected that the music takes center stage in a film about a band, there was surprisingly little substance by way of character development or thematic purpose.<br/><br/>The script relies on feel-good clichÃ©s to keep audiences invested, but it lacks any degree of nuance or subtlety. Prepare to be beaten over the head with the same old done to death ""family is everything"" theme, and don't expect to find any deeper meaning than that.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun movie with a truly outstanding lead actor, that winds up lacking in almost every technical category.

And I hated bombastic (crowd singing) lyrics like ""we are the champions."" Occasionally they had a bona fide, really catchy hit like ""Killer Queen,"" or ""You're My Best Friend"" (despite the poorly mixed and over prominent bass part on the original recording).<br/><br/>
So you might surmise that I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody (the film) given my history with the band. Actually, however, I found it thoroughly watchable. And yes many critics condemned it as ""formulaic,"" which it was probably was. But my response to that is, ""so what?"" You don't go to see a film about Freddie Mercury to study intellectual history-you basically want to find out why the band was so popular and what the nature of Mercury's charisma was.<br/><br/>
Much of the film's success is dependent on Rami Malek's Oscar-winning performance. His is a bravura performance, mainly highlighting Mercury's talent as a performer. But he also does well in the more dramatic moments--particularly his love/hate relationship with his bandmates: guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee), Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) and bass guitarist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello).<br/><br/>
Aside from his being gay and contracting AIDS toward the end of his life, I knew nothing about Freddie Mercury's biography and found all the information about his family background quite interesting (which included the fact he was born in Zanzibar and his family was of Indian Farsi ancestry).<br/><br/>
The film keeps your interest through a series of escalating conflicts. In the early stage it's Mercury's rebellion against a strict and traditional father. Once Mercury joins the band, they must find a way to raise money for their first album-after selling the van the band uses to travel around for concerts, they battle a record executive over the six plus minutes length of their eventual hit, Bohemian Rhapsody (the A&R rep is actually a fictional character played by Mike Myers of all people!).<br/><br/>
Less interesting is Mercury's relationship with a girlfriend, Mary Austin. Despite his purported devotion to her, she's merely a sounding board for Mercury's initial profession of his sexuality (he tells her he's ""bisexual,"" but she insists that he's gay).<br/><br/>
The band eventually leaves its record company EMI after they refuse to release Bohemian Rhapsody as a single. There's more conflict propping up when the bandmates resent Mercury for starting a relationship with his day-t0-day manager, Paul Prenter (who is later cast as the villain, spilling all the gossip about his relationship with Mercury, in a tell-all TV interview).<br/><br/>
Mercury's liaison with Prenter as well his more successful relationship with Jim Hutton, is hardly fleshed out at all and one gets the feeling that there's a lot more known about his dealing with his bandmates then what went on in his private sex life.<br/><br/>
Bohemian Rhapsody eventually wears out its welcome with some convenient fudging of historical events. The rift between Mercury and the rest of Queen supposedly occurred after the mercurial singer decided to cut a solo album. But truth be told, two of Queen's other players cut solo albums first. And Queen never broke up before the Live Aid concert.<br/><br/>
Then there's the matter of AIDS diagnosis-in the film he's contracted AIDS right before Live Aid-but in reality, Mercury came down with AIDS a few years afterward. Thus all the angst before the concert, proves untrue (and hence manipulative).<br/><br/>
Critics also were aghast over the bandmates getting their digs in against Mercury. There's the scene where they force Mercury to leave the room and discuss whether they wish to take him back into the group. Again: never happened. I don't begrudge the bandmates for sticking up for themselves however-indeed Mercury didn't write all of Queen's hits.<br/><br/>
The Live Aid concert also proves a bit anti-climactic (better to watch the original on Youtube). I would have rather heard the full version of ""Killer Queen"" at some point then to have to sit through all the truncated numbers of the Live Aid concert (most of which were not necessarily their biggest hits).<br/><br/>
I was actually glad there was little emphasis on Mercury's illness and declining years. Yes it appears he indulged himself in later years with lavish parties often characterized as ""orgies."" But somehow none of that diminishes Mercury's status as a cultural icon.<br/><br/>
While I'm still not convinced of Queen's ascendancy in the pantheon of great rock groups, Bohemian Rhapsody nonetheless made me a believer in Mercury's talent more as a performer than songwriter. Like another great ""performer,"" the iconic Michael Jackson, Mercury died way too young!"

","Review:
This is one of those movies that is over 2 hours long, but you don't want it to finish. It doesn't delve too deep into Freddie Mercury's life, but you certainly get an insight into the period before he sadly died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS, on the 24th of November 1991, at the young age of 45. The performances were great throughout the film, especially from Rami Malek who deserved the Oscar for his role, but you don't get to find out that much about the rest of the band, who also played a big part in making Queen such a unique, and successful band. I would have like to have seen more about the last 6 years of Freddie Mercury's life, after the Live Aid concert, but at least the movie ends on a high note, even though you know that he's dying of AIDS. Anyway, the movie starts with Farrokh ""Freddie"" Bulsara (Rami Malek), an Indian Parsi refugee from Zanzibar, working as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport in 1970. After seeing the band Smile perform at a pub, Freddie encounters Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and meets the drummer, Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy), and guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee). After learning that the lead singer for there band has quit, Freddie offers to join and he demonstrates his vocal ability. With Freddie as the lead singer, and a new bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello), the band sells out gigs across Britain. After selling there van to book a studio to record their debut album, Freddie changes the band's name to Queen and legally changes his own name to Freddie Mercury. The band signs with John Reid (Aiden Gillen), Elton John's manager, and receives a contract with EMI. After touring to promote the album, Mary and Freddie become engaged. The album hits the American charts, and the band embarks on a sold-out U.S. tour, where Freddie questions his sexuality. In 1975, Queen recorded their 4th album but leaves EMI when executive Ray Foster (Mike Myers), refuses to release the operatic and lengthy Bohemian Rhapsody as the album's lead single. Confronted by Mary, Freddie comes out to her about being bisexual, although she assures him he is gay. They end their engagement and she moves next door when he purchases an extravagant house in 1980. On Queen's world tour, Freddie begins an affair with Paul Prenter, the band's day-to-day manager. Tensions arise in the band as Freddie sinks into debauchery with the manipulative Paul. Following a successful show, Paul puts Reid up to proposing that Freddie pursue a solo career and disband Queen, prompting Freddie to fire Reid without consulting the band, furthering their strain. After their latest video is banned from MTV because the band appears in drag, Freddie announces his $4million solo deal with CBS Records, effectively breaking up the band. In 1984, Freddie moves to Munich to work on his first solo album, finding himself lost in drugs, alcohol, and gay orgies with Paul and becomes increasingly ill. Mary, now pregnant by her new partner and concerned about Freddie, urges him to return to the band, as they have been offered a spot in Bob Geldof's benefit concert, Live Aid at Wembley Stadium. Realising that Paul withheld this news, Freddie severs ties with him, and Paul retaliates by going public about Freddie's sexual escapades. Freddie returns to London and reconciles with his bandmates, and they agree to perform at Live Aid after getting a last-minute slot. With HIV/AIDS spreading worldwide, Freddie discovers that he has contracted the virus, and he reveals this to his supportive bandmates. After an amazing performance, helping to increase donations and making the event a massive success, the movie ends with real photos of Freddie Mercury, and you get to see one of his performances during the end credits. It is quite a remarkable story, which is entertaining throughout and I couldn't help tapping my feet during some of the songs. I was also impressed with the way that they were able to recreate the Live Aid concert, which had amazing attention to detail, and the fact that Rami Malek also performed the songs, shows how much work went into the film. The only problem is that I didn't learn anything new about the man himself, who led an extremely extravagant life, but with that aside, I still enjoyed it. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Bryan Singer, who also brought you The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil, X-Men, X-Men 2, Superman Returns, Valkyrie, Jack The Giant Slayer, X-Men: Days Of Future Past and X-Men: Apocalypse. Although it's down on paper that Bryan Singer directed this movie, he was only the director through principal photography, which began in London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence, and clashing with the cast and crew. Dexter Fletcher, who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete the film, although Singer retained sole director credit as per Directors Guild of America guidelines. Fletcher received an executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018. It's a good thing that it didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture because there would have been a bit of a discrepancy about who would have it on there mantle. Anyway, Sacha Baron Cohen was set to play Mercury in 2010 but he left the project in 2013, following creative differences with the producers. He must be gutted after seeing Malek winning the Oscar for a leading role! Anyway, this movie was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide, setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres, so it certainly made a big impact. Personally, I think that it could have gone a bit deeper, and the director should have taken some risks but apart from that, it's a decent watch.<br/><br/>Budget: $52million
Worldwide Gross: $876million<br/><br/>Genre: Biography, Drama, Music
Cast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Allen Leech, Tom Hollander, Aaron McCusker and Mike Myers. 7/10"

","Saw this on a flight to the US, enjoyable film that holds little back regarding his life. I've always liked films that mixed music with the content but which are not musicals if that makes sense but you would expect that here of course and it delivers in spades for any Queen fan. Freddie's life as a gay man is covered without being too overwhelming or in bad taste and it is clearly intrinsic to the story throughout. Rated a nine as it portrays a few things that are historically wrong but I suspect were done that way to avoid gaps in the story that would otherwise have occurred with the film ending with Live Aid.<br/><br/>Have to say the Live Aid scenes far exceeded expectations and having sat through the entire concert when I was younger bought back memories of that amazing event. Overall it's a must-watch for Queen fans."

","Let's get one thing straight: 'walk the line' this movie is not. Sure it was great fun and as someone who didn't really grow up with Queen because my parents are immigrants who wouldn't know them if you smacked them with them, there was a lot of 'THAT'S A QUEEN SONG?'. I was pleasantly surprised there. Rami Malek gave an energized performance of Freddie Mercury. This film however falls short in that in never addresses any struggles. Sure Freddie went through a period of being on his high horse, but even that was just annoying and you wanted to slap him more than anything else. In terms of real struggle or drama, this film is lacking. It's not an emotional experience like 'a star is born'. A fun film to watch I guess, but I came out of it feeling like something was missing and then my best friend wanted to see it so we did and then she said the same thing. It felt incomplete. At first I was against the idea of making a more salacious version of freddie's Life, but now I'm starting to think it would have been more interesting than this."

","'ll be short, I'm not much a Queen fan (I mean, I like some songs, but I've never followed the band. Mainly because I was born some years after Mercury's death) so I believe I'll have a neutral vision about the movie (I'm far from being a hater too).<br/><br/>Anyways, the songs scenes, live the composition of some sounds, how the band was innovated, and etc is what the movie does best, besides the acting (mainly from Rami Malek) of course. However, the movie fails on actually being a movie, there is no clear narration of events here, I mean, sure the movies the band's ascension, until what was probably their peak, but there not actually a story, some things come and go, and you never see a thing evolving from that the first agent Freddy fires, he makes a huge treat and so, but we never see him again, and other things too.<br/><br/>But as is hard to make a good cine biography, is also hard to judge it, sometimes I don't know how exactly I'm supposed to grade it, was it made for the fans/followers? Was it supposed to be a romanization of the real story? And here, I believe they tried to do something of the fans, which is completely ok, but for what I've seen, there are actually tons gafs/mistakes throughout the story, and what indeed happened, I saw a lot of real fans complaining. So, at the end, what is the point on try to be for the fans, and ""real"", while you are ignoring a lot of important details of the real story?<br/><br/>There is no much of a learning curve here, besides kind of a forced one at the end, and the movie is basically a bunch of scenes of shows and Queen's amazing songs cut together. Just will not give a lower grade, because of the songs (which are truly great), and Malek's performance, he deserved the Oscar nomination, the movie did not."

","The biggest British band since The Beatles, with arguably the most iconic frontman of all time, Queen was always destined to have its story told in flamboyant fashion on the big screen. This depiction is clearly rooted in a deep affinity for its subject matter, though it suffers many filmmaking flaws. However, this does not stop 'Bohemian Rhapsody' from being a highly entertaining viewing experience, which most Queen fans will find spellbinding.<br/><br/>Perhaps the main draw of the film is Rami Malek's remarkable performance as Freddie Mercury. The singer's every quirk and physical tic is painstakingly portrayed in exhaustive detail by Malek, who gives his all to perfect Mercury's self-confident strut and irresistible charm. The rest of the cast is also committed for the most part, with Gwilym Lee and Joe Mazzello particularly enjoying themselves as Brian May and John Deacon.<br/><br/>The re-creation of Queen's hit songs also allows for some stupendous displays of musicality. The much-vaunted climactic Live Aid set is highly impressive, and goes full throttle on the band's seminal sound. It's a consistent way in which the film drives up its entertainment value, drawing on the universal language of music to craft an eye-popping celebration of the musicians.<br/><br/>However, on a less shallow level the film is mired in its historical inaccuracies and a half-baked approach to the actual chronicling of the band's story. Mercury's chequered life is sugar-coated for a wider appeal, and is simply falsified at times for the purposes of the story, which swiftly becomes bogged down in cliche. The closest people to him, at least according to the film's version of events, are his wife Mary and personal manager Paul, neither of whom are developed beyond the barest of stock character features.<br/><br/>This focus on Mercury also stops the rest of the band from ever being more than a footnote in their own story: there's still a Queen biopic begging to be made, which tracks their fascinating story in a more focused manner. This lack of focus is without a doubt due to the abrupt change of director after the controversial Bryan Singer was sacked halfway through production.<br/><br/>Ultimately 'Bohemian Rhapsody' never quite reaches the heights it aspires to, as underneath the fanfare it is the most formulaic and underdeveloped of biopics. If you can look past these flaws, however, there's a barnstorming presentation of highly entertaining musical talent anchored by an impressive leading performance. 67/100"
"pipecax","6","0","2","18 February 2019"," ""This is where the operatic section comes in!""
","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is the most boisterous biopic of the season, the most controversial of the last few years as well, do not though, look at these factors in a good way. Going from awards, nominations, and arbitrary, ceaseless accolades coming from the industry to unsafe firings, serious uproars around the private life of those involved in the movie and harshly mixed opinions between critics, moviegoers and 'Queen' lovers. The music-related cinematic event of the year doesn't go beyond the conventional story of ascent and fall, vice and fame, money-fueled madness and redemption; a frivolous apology that disappointingly gets sidetracked by the shiniest banalities and the primal artistic, personal dilemmas of both Mercury and May, Taylor and Deacon; this flick isn't a true-blue hit, trust me.<br/><br/>Plenty of hiccups in the way of this highly-anticipated but incompetent Hollywood film adaptation; among them is the replacement of an almost perfect Sacha Baron Cohen, which was, allegedly, due to a creative discrepancy between the actor and the producers, who refused to show any somewhat damming material that endangers or hurts the golden legacy of a rock band that broke the mold. Probably, Baron Cohen was right. Now all that's left is to dream of an assuredly R-rated pic, a comprehensive biographical story with powerful chiaroscuros on each member of the family, as well as the cornerstones that made 'Queen' a point in history: their relationships, their sexuality, obsessions, behaviors, hopes, sins, demons and successes; the film centered on mass appeal aspects, as expected.<br/><br/>Let's be honest: the film is pure entertainment, a noisy and shallow spectacle taking advantage of each one of the most emblematic hits of the British band, simulating to deal with the recreations of their properly iconic video clips and striving to deliver unknown answers to the questions about the vicious existence of the Queen frontman. Finding matches in the portrait of real-life footage is entertaining, such as the ""I Want to Break Free"" music video or its gargantuan finale, however, with a two-hour-plus runtime, is it right to be okay with this, when the brand 'Queen' is involved? I don't think so.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Rami Malek's the only true winner among all this chaos. Malek, a.k.a. Elliot Anderson in Sam Esmail's voracious techno-thriller ""Mr. Robot,"" is, from the outside, Freddie Mercury. The American actor has come up with the role people will recognize him for from now on, not only because of the celebrity he portrays but the fiercely impressive performance he acts proudly on the screen. He's not merely imitating the most representative mannerisms of the outlandish singer, he understands carefully the psychology of a man turned into a legend, he does justice to his role even if the lifeless, sanitized script threatens to mess it up. The way he dances, walks or behaves, his voice in the most ordinary dialogs, the expressiveness of his gaze, the inner struggle to find who he truly is, every detail his performance is composed with, beyond the most discussed such as the fabulous voice - a vocal amalgam between the actor, Mercury himself and Christian rock musician Marc Martel - is what enriches and makes it - with the permission of Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe - the best performance in a mainstream film by an actor in 2018. A tough call is to choose which would be the best interpretation between Malek's brilliant PG-13 performance or the supposedly suggestive, raw R-rated by Baron Cohen. Regardless of your choice, we'd probably have a mind-bending Mercury in front of us.<br/><br/>Having said that, the lead man's brutal showcase aside, some factually-based re-creations are deftly realistic, notably two quick-witted music-videos incorporations and the monumental, unforgettable closing sequence at Wembley Stadium. To say that the 1985's Live Aid re-creation, such a symbolic, meaningful 20-minute performance for the history of rock music, is perfect would be a whopper of a lie; by being gratefully long, its pace and rhythm tend to drop constantly, the editing work is respectful but some cheap CGI crowds and quick cuts feel plainly contrived; nevertheless, the Live Aid performance was the first sequence they filmed for the movie and it is astonishing all along, because of the dimension of the event itself, powerful because of the authenticity and concordance duplicating the epic clip; seeing Malek playing with his crowd and then seeing Mercury do the same is breathtakingly beautiful, and that, keeping in mind such a challenging feat, should be considered a real achievement.<br/><br/>The 80s', as an eye-catching and helpful visual and narrative resource, are depicted in a lackluster but congruent way, the compositions lack energy and spark even speaking about a time where color and brightness were in its greatest splendor. Directed flat-out by Bryan Singer and replaced during the last days of shooting by Dexter Fletcher, the film is not artistically daring, provocative or inspiring, is freely faithful and straightforward, bombastic when it shouldn't, slow-paced and off-and-on when ironically the most gigantic spectacle must come up. The editing work, especially in the quick montages on the concert performances and significant plot knots, is compelling and kinetic, however, pushing the hyperactive cuts out, the biopic loses its touch and starts slowly tearing apart just for rising from the ashes along the last 20 minutes.<br/><br/>""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Bryan Singer and certainly polished by Dexter Fletcher is not, by no means, the ""Queen"" definitive biopic, nor it is Freddie Mercury's. In short, a conventionally entertaining biographical film only aimed by Rami Malek's pitch-perfect performance. 20th Century Fox's turbulent production will once again make the British band's iconic anthems popular, will once again bring the leading man into the spotlight, will have thousands of angry fans and will please the less fussy ones on the legacy of a group of visionaries who has long been a crucial part in the history of rock music. With a strong supporting cast - especially Lucy Boynton and Ben Hardy, - the all-time great musical support, some impressive re-creations and a performance by Malek for the ages, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is not a boring time at the movies, is an artistic composition that fails on most of its fronts; a look-over as superficial as diluted through the lifetime of five men who found in freedom of expression, queer spirit, togetherness and unique personalities a safe space for perennial memory."

And I can't understand a lot of things in this film. I like Queen, and I really love Freddie Mercury. But terrible makeup and very mannered actor's game (Rami Malek). Huge fake teeth ( Freddy had some problem, I know, but it look like some gum in Rami mouth.). It's look like poor musical. I can't understand why director copied scene in Live Aid.

","There is something quite odd about this movie. Rami Malek did a great job, however the movie seems to focus a lot on signature songs, but not what was behind these songs - what were the inspirations? A lot of focus on Freddies' wife, which was interesting, but it felt like the film was obligated to touch on a couple of songs which happened to turn into hits. No real focus on the making of key albums (and there were many) or real character development of the other Queen members. Freddie is frequently seen moping around his empty house - which just seems to paint quite a shallow picture of a ""loneyl gay guy"" when surely he was more than that. What about expanding on his solo career? Or the times he spent in Berlin where he obviously got sick. The worst part was the Live Aid concert at the end, which was treated in the same way as a big climax in a hollywood blockbuster. It felt a bit shiny & fake to me, the way they were performing and all who knew Freddie were watching his performance with adoration, obviously thinikng something like ""wow, he has AIDS, but he's doing SOOOO well!"" but of course, only a few people knew he had AIDS at that point. Its a good film for telling a story thats neer been told. But it could have been done with a bit more authenticity and heart in my view."

","Bohemian Rhapsody<br/><br/>When a band is named Queen don't be surprised if all of their songs are about Welsh Corgis.<br/><br/>And while the group in this biography doesn't dwell on dogs their output does run the gamut.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) goes from fan to front-man when he replaces the singer of his favourite band. Backed by the original guitarist, drummer and new bassist, Freddie christens the band Queen and they release a successful album. However, Queen's eclectic sound makes them a hard sell, while Freddie's alternative lifestyle makes him a media darling.<br/><br/>Framed by their 1985 Live Aid performance and sprinkled with their timeless tunes throughout, this behind-the-scenes look at the legendary band skims over the important parts and instead focuses too much on the nominal contributions of the other members and their qualms with Mercury.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, without Queen the only music played at sporting events would be the national anthem.

","This film really feels like a greatest hits montage. Yes, you get to hear all the Queen songs you enjoy. Yes, you get to see many different moments of Freddie Mercury and Queen's career, BUT it feels really rushed, frazzled, and overgeneralized. The film has a problem not focusing on one thing. Whether it was the themes, plot points, stories, or characters, it really feels all over the place because of it. The viewer never gets to dive deep into the problems Freddie Mercury or the band faced. Everything just felt so surface level and generic. I have heard people say that the film feels like it could apply to any band, and I can agree with that somewhat. Parts of it are Queen specific, but those parts seemed like minor details. The structure and plot of the film are what feels like a generic ""make a rock band"" movie with similar beats to films such as Almost Famous. With a better script, director, and editing, this film could have been very compelling. I read another review that said the film should have been focused on the events proceeding the Live Aid Concert instead of Queen's whole career. I thought that was an excellent idea because it would have allowed the filmmaker to focus more on a few specific issues the band was facing and flesh out the characters a bit better.<br/><br/>Of course, there were some good moments in the film. Rami Malik's performance is decent, nowhere near as good as other actors who have taken on musical personas, such as Jamie Fox's performance in Ray. The music is fun because well... it's Queen and they have some fun songs. The costume design is easily the best part about the film, but other than those few things, the quality of the film is rather mediocre. However, that does not mean Queen fans won't like the movie. I think many people, particularly Queen fans, will enjoy the film since it plays their greatest hits and has a straight forward story. If you are looking for something more than just a surface-level music biopic, this is not the film for you."

","I just finished 'Bohemian Rapsody', the movie. Unfortunately it falls so very short of.....well almost anything actually. Malek does his best but alas his best is not good enough, thus all we get is a choreography-like sequence of shallow Mercury's gestures, grimaces and stage moves for the video clip-educated audience to take joy from their identification. Especially in the first part, Mercury's character portrayal is merely a caricature, full of gay and/or puppy stares, pompous statements and passionless dialogues. At the same time young Freddie looks more like a young Prince (later known as the Artist ðŸ˜€) with protruding teeth than Mercury. Things get even worse in the casting area when it comes to the rest of the band members and reaches its global minimum with the selection of Mike Myers for the role of the EMI executive. Direction uses all the screenplay cliches existing, character depth is absent and song performing scenes could be so much better (if one notices closely, some even had dub problems). Ah, there is one good thing about the movie. Music is good. But i guess you knew that."

"andrewestrella","Null","0","2","12 January 2019"," Rami Malek's Stellar Performance is Undermined by a Superficial Look at Queen
","If I am being honest, I am massively disappointed in this film, and I think my rating is being extremely generous. While I think Rami Malek delivers one of the most heartfelt and transformative performances I have ever seen, I feel like the script and entire plot was rushed, making the entire flow of the film kind of awful. As a previous reviewer stated, ""Rami Malek was too good for this."" I do not deny or regret that Malek be nominated for any Best Actor award, but having Bohemian Rhapsody as a whole win for Best Film is absurd. How can this film possibly win Best Film at the Golden Globes over A Star is Born and If Beale Street Could Talk? Are you kidding me? Like I said, the acting from Malek is exceptional, but the film as a whole is painfully average.<br/><br/>Now, I did not have the best knowledge of Queen as I went into the film, but I could tell from the get-go that the film was rushed. In a matter of only a couple of minutes, Freddie Mercury went from working at an airport, to meeting band members at a pub, to forming Queen, to literally one year later. What in the actual hell? I would actually argue the first half of the film was actually bad in many instances for trying to include so many things at one, which made the story so muddled and feel so quick, which is not a good thing at all. There were way too many things trying to be included at once, which made the flow and pace of the film to feel horrendous.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film slows down in the second half, but that first half left a really bad taste in my mouth. I think the film really shines with every single performance, especially the We Will Rock You scene and the Live Aid concert. All of the musical performances in the film were absolutely excellent, and I will never forget any of it. I was pumped up and I was truly feeling it. But in between all of the performances, whether in the first half of the film or the latter, was a bunch of plot points that I did not really care too much for, and I was sometimes even kind of bored. My favorite plot points included the record deal with Ray Foster (played my Mike Myers), the formation of several songs (including ""Bohemian Rhapsody""), and the emotion surrounding Mercury's diagnosis of AIDS. However, the plot point I had a hard time liking was Mercury's relationship with his wife because it was hardly even developed, that when any emotion was attempted, I had a hard time caring, despite how phenomenal the performances were.<br/><br/>Again, every musical performance here was excellent, the Live Aid performance was phenomenal, and Rami Malek transformed into Freddie Mercury, but the plot was so muddled, that it heavily distracted me. Regardless, I have learned a ton about Queen and am currently listening to every album they recorded, and plan to do so with every artist who performed at the Live Aid Concert in 1985. So I guess I can thank the film for that.<br/><br/>I also forgot to mention how horrendous the CGI audience looked at the Live Aid concert. I was cringing when the focus was not on Queen. It was The Scorpion King level bad in regards of CGI."

The first thing that Freddy does in Rock Band Land is to declare himself Queen of the foursome, and rename the whole shebang after himself. Freddy is much more of a Red Queen than a White Monarch (though he takes after that social butterfly Alice in that he plunges down every rabbit hole he runs across). Eventually Freddy tries to race Across the Universe in true Mercury fashion, belting out six minutes of a BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. But then he catches AIDS from some farmers, and decides to rest on his laurels by declaring himself to be ""Champion of the World."" Since this never ending story clocks in at well over two hours, there's plenty of time to cram in the thousands of little snits and petty quarrels among Freddy's many families: The Zoroastrians, the former dental hygienists, the leather shop crowd, the breeders, and the gold record farmers (who perhaps should be designated as ""miners"").

My wife wanted to see this and I've been a fan of Rami Malek's since Mr. Robot's pilot episode, so I was happy to go along. Holy hot damn does he deliver on every front-emotionally, physically (he worked with a performance coach to get Mercury's performance nuances down pat), verbally, everything about Malek's performance is on point. I was blown away at how he lost himself in the role. Blown away. Although it's a standard rise, fall, rise biopic, there were undercurrents of taboos addressed that strongly resonated in this hyper-political age (pop-culture stardom vs. traditional Pakistani heritage, for example, or the 70s and 80s stigma of being gay in a religious household).<br/><br/>Theatrically, the songs, music, momentum, feel of Queen through the 70s and 80s was captured wonderfully through great cinematography and set/wardrobe design and I loved seeing the styles change without calling them out specifically.<br/><br/>Finally, I hope Malek wins an Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>Solid 8.5 or 8.6 out of 10, so I rounded up to a 9."

","Almost did not go to see this based on critics reviews, hate to say but ""fake news"". Better than a ""strar is born"". Oscar nomination for Freddy Mercury or was that an actor."
"eric-shoe","10","0","2","2 November 2018"," THE CRITICS ARE WRONG AGAIN!!!!
","I always read the IMDB User Reviews. Sometimes the critics match the users and sometimes they overrate a crappy movie. In this case they are DEAD WRONG! This is a fantastic movie which (again) proves these pundits are full of themselves. I stood around just to watch the people exiting the theatre and without question every person had a smile on their face and most were talking nonstop about the movie. Go see this movie and never again put faith in what one person has to say - believe the User Reviews - believe the people like yourself."

","Saw this movie tonight. Loved every minute of it. Interesting to see how the songs were created and the movie showed the sad, personal life of Freddie. The acting was awesome, the music was fantastic - of course - and had people singing in the theater. Can't wait to see it again tomorrow."

","I'd usually never give a movie 10 because you'll find a flaw somewhere but this deserves so much more than 9.<br/><br/>The performances were excellent, Rami's was outstanding (I'm glad Sasha B Cohen didn't complete the project), I think he'll be a contender for an Oscar. Of course the music was superb. If you're any kind of music fan, you must see this movie. Yes, it will have you tearing up towards the end but it finishes on a high.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed, like others, in the amount of coverage of Freddie's sexual escapades, that's not why we love him. The love story with Mary Austin was something I wasn't aware of so it was touching to see.<br/><br/>I'm left wondering what other hits they would've produced had Freddie lived through the AIDS crisis."
"nicolinafina","8","0","2","1 November 2018"," Not a movie about Queen
","I loved the movie, but I don't think they should call it a movie about Queen when it was mostly about Freddie Mercury. I mean I just saw the movie and I can't even remember the last name of the other three guys in the band. I remember that I looked at my watch half way through the movie to see how much time I had left to enjoy the movie because I wanted more and I still want more. I laugh and I cried, but mostly I just sat with a smile enjoying the movie.
I think that Freddie would be honored if he would be able to watch the movie and I think he would like that it's about his music and not his death.
I also think Rami was amazing! I never saw the guy playing the hacker Elliot in Mr. Robot dancing around in Freddies outfits and make it look believeble. Rami is a brilliant actor and a perfect Freddie, every move and word in the movie was so thought through. All the hand gestures, covering the overbite with his lips, walking, talking were so believeble. I didn't even think about that it all was just an act because it felt so real.
I think that Rami Malek got an Oscar nomination coming his way.
Can't wait to watch it again and embrace it all once again."
"MathiusGudsgave","10","0","2","1 November 2018"," Let yourself enter a time-machine and witness the queen of rock...
","I honestly admit that the idea of making a movie about Queen entered my life a bit later than probably the most of other moviegoers. However, the very moment I realized it's a real deal my shock turned into an expectation and growing restlessness. The more information I got throughout the years the movie was (not) in making, the more concerned I was, mainly about the main cast, Rami Malek. This name was completely unknown to me and it scared me a lot. There was no resemblance to Freddie, first teasers were not promising. Thus, I was waiting impatiently for the final product. I knew the music would be great, but the movie about a rock band is not only about music. Then there were first official trailers. With each one my doubts began to fade only to turn into a wistful suspense the very moment I sat down inside the cinema. I decided to wipe all trailers, prejudices and expectations off my mind just to give the filmmakers a chance to show me what they had achieved. Once the lights in the movie theatre dimmed, every single soul held its breath and waited for Dolby Atmos to play the first notes of ""Somebody to Love"". What a clever choice for an opening song. I tried to watch the movie as an unbiased spectator, but alas, this didn't help me at all. After 134 minutes which felt like a blink of an eye I left the cinema full of emotions, fragmented into atoms only to try and get myself together on my way home. I'm really not sure what to blame - the sound, the acting performances or the production design, but for me Bohemian Rhapsody has become the film of the year 2018. Yes, Rami Malek is not a perfect double of Freddie Mercury, but who is, right? If you grab it as a whole, with all the gestures, voice and facial expressions, you will see Freddie Mercury more than you wish to. Other actors also exceptionally resemble the original members of Queen, with Gwilym Lee being the king of them all. All individual parts of the film (although it's not divided into sections or chapters and thus stands for a coherent piece) represent almost epic examples of film artistry. The production design, underlined by a great list of songs, is like a luxurious candy or a praline you will want to have again and again. Another ""darling"" element of the movie is the humor which can be seen as a subliminal tribute to Mercury's wit. The producers also managed to avoid forced pathos and tear-jerking scenes. The entire movie climaxes with the final fifteen minutes during which the entire crew revived the legendary performance on Live Aid. The moment when the camera flies over the Wembley Stadium to gradually take down amidst the audience will make you grab your seat and feel an (un)pleasant vertigo. You can almost touch the heads of the people. All the scenes featuring live performances of the band were incredibly vibrant and for many Queen fans it will be a dream come true - to travel back in time and feel the atmosphere of the concerts first-hand. I believe that the main aim of the film was not to shock the audience with controversial scenes, nor was it meant to bring a whole bunch of surprising new facts about the band. This is the role of documentaries. Bohemian Rhapsody is an allegory of a lover of life, a singer of songs. A resurrected story of a journey against prejudices, a story about perseverance, audacity, and an immeasurable talent of a man who fully deserves a proper tribute on a big screen. And I'm glad the entire crew of the movie did just so."

","Loved, loved, loved this film. Well lived up to expectations & then some! There are no words to describe Rami Malek's performance, there were times I thought he was Feddie, especially the Live Aid performance. All the other actors were amazing as well. The actor that played Brian May so sounded like him. Can't wait to see it again."
"PyroSikTh","8","0","2","30 October 2018"," Toes the Line Between Feel-Good Entertainment and Gritty Biopic
","The movie starts, as all good movies do, at the beginning. Freddie, known then as Farouk, is a baggage handler at an airport, casually writes lyrics at the bus stop, and goes out to gigs every night. One night he encounters a band called Smile and approaches them about filling in for their recently-absent lead singer. What follows is a management deal, recording studios, and world tours, until Freddie gets too big for his boots, is manipulated by one of his managers, and descends into drugs, parties, and breaking up the band to pursue a solo career. Then the film culminates in his AIDS diagnosis and the band coming back together for LiveAid.<br/><br/>One thing that stands out as a bit shaky in the film's storytelling is how insanely rushed the beginning is. Freddie joins the band, the bassist appears out of nowhere, they perform their first gig, and then they sell their van to fuel a recording session, they get noticed, picked up by a management company, and suddenly hit it big overnight. Is that how it really happened? I don't know, but I doubt it. The film paints their career trajectory as amateurs suddenly becoming world-famous professionals, and once there there doesn't feel like there's much growth in them or the bands trajectory, they plateau before descending equally as abruptly. The movie isn't a particularly short movie, so I understand there were time constraints, but it almost felt like they focussed too much on Freddie's fall from grace, elongating the second act, and not enough on his (and their) initial rise or his comeback.<br/><br/>That said, ending the movie with the LiveAid concert, cutting out the last six years of Freddie's life, didn't feel like a particularly bad choice. As much as it would have been nice to see a little more of what happened after the comeback and diagnosis, it ultimately meant the movie ended on a high note, with the best scene in the whole movie, filled with inspiration and an infectious crowd. I had to remind myself I was in a quiet cinema and not actually there in the crowd at Wembley, the urge to clap and cheer was so great.<br/><br/>As for the nitty gritty, the character work is really well done. Freddie Mercury of course takes centre stage, and we feel we get a good insight into his character. He's a somewhat awkward outcast, who endures a life of self-discovery, and is ostracised and misunderstood because of it. But he's not painted as an angel either. There are a number of scenes where he's a complete dick to those around him, he's clingy to his ex Mary, and he often comes across as completely full of himself, which the film makes a point to justify by making him right almost all the time when it comes to the band. Rami Malek does a really good job here as well. While I think Sacha Baron Cohen was probably a better fit visually (Malek is too short), Malek definitely has the dramatic chops to bring Freddie's private side - as well as his more flamboyant side - to life.<br/><br/>The rest of Queen are sidelined a little, but they still get enough screen time to still be a prominent enough presence, particularly in the first and third acts. Gwilym Lee is about as perfect casting as you can get for Brian May. He looks like a young Brian May, and has the guys mannerisms and way of talking down to a tee. Ben Hardy is pretty good as Roger Taylor as well, and gets plenty of chances throughout the movie to show multiple sides of Roger, despite never seeming to age over the course of the movie's fifteen year timeline. And then there's Joseph Mazello (the little kid in Jurassic Park) as John Deacon, who I'm not even remotely familiar with, but he looks the part, and can at least play Bass pretty well, so that's a plus in my book. Aiden Gillen is serviceable in his small role as Queen's manager, Tom Hollander is great as their Lawyer, and Mike Myers makes an (as always) unrecognisable cameo as a Record Producer who doubts Queen's potential early on.<br/><br/>The big climax is the LiveAid concert, and it is by far the best sequence of the whole movie. They filmed a recreation of the entire set, but of course time constraints meant it had to be cut down a bit. The set is vast, recreating the stage, the backstage, and the front of the crowd as well. While I felt it a little odd to see the majority of their iconic set recreated and mimed by look-a-like actors, it was a really great opportunity to add in some creativity in camera shots, as well as give us the closest we'll ever get to the performance in high definition, show some of the reactions beyond the stadium, and use it to tie the whole movie together.<br/><br/>In all Bohemian Rhapsody is a good little movie. It manages to toe a careful balance between feelgood entertainment, and portraying the darker sides of Freddie's story. His drug use, his vagrant parties of excess, his sexuality, his manipulation by the hands of Paul Prenter, and his diagnosis framed by the rise of the illness are all touched upon just enough without bringing down the mood too much. I'm also amazed at how much Queen I actually knew without ever really clocking it was Queen. If nothing else, that's the mark of an iconic band; when their music is so intrinsically woven into modern culture thirty years later. I give Bohemian Rhapsody a really good 8/10."

","This movie does not go into the deep dark ends of the kings sex crazed parties filled with drugs and god knows what. BUT it is there. You just have to look for it. An example would be a party we see in the film. There are piles of cocaine in the room and at one point we even see Freddy taking drugs and that at some point has snorted a tone of cocaine. Rami does a fantastic job as Freddy, in fact the whole cast is spot on. It's funny and moving and after the screening i looked around and there was a see of eyes crying over the music. Anyone wanting to see more detailed parties in the film, it will be shown on an extended cut."
