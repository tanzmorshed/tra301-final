"Sleel","8","346","402","17 March 2003"," Hooray for decent, more realistic spy films!
","I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.<br/><br/>Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.<br/><br/>While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in ""Ronin"" and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.<br/><br/>To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.<br/><br/>As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).<br/><br/>While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre."
"gbheron","9","228","270","11 December 2002"," What a Spy Movie Should Be Like These Days
","James Bond and Ethan Hunt take notice. ""The Bourne Identity"" is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.  Gone (or almost gone) are the special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell, in those franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters. ""The Bourne Identity"" has a very straightforward story to tell, a mystery that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases). <br/><br/>Set in various locales in Switzerland and France during the winter much of the visuals for ""The Bourne Identity"" are gray and damp. That's a plus, Monte Carlo and like locales can get boring. Mat Damon is great as Jason Bourne, fished from the Mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds. A total amnesiac, he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a well-trained assassin, and that someone is out to kill him. Franka Potente is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run with him. Run or be killed.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie. Doug Limon, thanks, you did a great job."
"destinylives52","8","10","10","20 August 2016"," Very good spy/action/thriller movie
","Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a highly trained, U.S. spy whose wounded body is found floating in an ocean by a fishing boat. With no memory of who he is and what happened to him, he has to piece together how he came to be shot in the back and left for dead; and most importantly, who and what he is. But Damon must do it fast, as time is running out and the ones he worked for are sending assassins to find him. ""The Bourne Identity"" is top-notch spy movie, filled with action, suspense, and a mystery that is slowly explained as the movie goes on. Matt Damon is well suited for the role, and with the help of fancy editing, he comes off as a martial arts expert who can quickly dispatch multiple foes in a few seconds. The movie moves along very fast, making the near two hour running time feel like it's thirty minutes shorter than it is. Fast pacing and a likable hero (Damon) are two big strengths of this movie that fans of spy/thriller/suspense movies should not miss. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Identity"" is the scene when Damon evades the police with an original Mini car! Hey, it's not the car, it's the driver that counts.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoment"
"guinness1971","9","56","68","9 November 2005"," Excellent
","I was pleasantly surprised with the Bourne Identity.Very rarely do I get to watch a movie that surpasses my expectations.First of all can I say that there are so many films out there that have the same regurgitated ideas and plot lines.Not many of which have any originality.<br/><br/>This however is one of the exceptions thankfully and pleasantly.Centred around a man who gets washed ashore and with no memory.( OK so this has been done before !!) but this movie was original.A selection box of mystery, action and great acting by all concerned.Haven't seen much of Mr Damion I have to admit but he was impressive.The photography ( can I use that term without sounding like a theatre studies student ?) was very good.In fact watching this movie was like watching one of those middle of the night foreign movies in a funny sort of way.However this was much more.<br/><br/>In a word this film was ORIGINAL.Well directed and well acted. Good to see a film that doesn't have to rely on spectacular special effects and painted backdrops.This film worked because it worked without any of that.( Now I am waffling)"
"CAMACHO-4","8","93","121","23 October 2005"," One of the best spy films around
","This story has been done several times in the past, most recently in ""A Long Kiss Goodnight"". It's also true that Doug Liman and the producers created their own Jason Bourne mythology,since this movie is different in many ways to the book. But the truth is Liman takes an old story and puts a new fast paced spin on it.<br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out who he is. As he travels from city to city he's followed by CIA agents who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs. He's helped along the way by Marie played by the brilliant Franka Potente. Together they come face to face with the people that want them dead.<br/><br/>The cast is great and so is the story. This film should be on everyone's top ten list."
"philip_vanderveken","8","196","267","13 September 2004"," Don't watch this movie if you think James Bond is someone who you can meet in real life.
","Next to Ronin, this is one of the best action / spy movies that I've ever seen. I heard a lot of good critics, but didn't know what to think about it. I only saw it 2 years after it first appeared and I'm a little disappointed that I didn't go watch it in the cinema.<br/><br/>I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the ""super hero"" using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal women.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets, no incredibly willing women sharing his bed... Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence. In the meanwhile he has to deal with amnesia, while being hunted without knowing why. In the end this is still a man which you can identify yourself with.<br/><br/>I would say: Go watch it when you are a fan of movies like Ronin, don't watch it if you think James Bond is a person who you can bump into on the streets when going out. Personally I would award this movie with an 8/10."
"Aly200","10","12","13","7 July 2016"," An Exciting Action Film
","What if you had lost your memory and learned the CIA is out to terminate you because you know too much? That's the question Matt Damon's super-spy Jason Bourne wants to know and it could cost him his life. <br/><br/>In the starring role, Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the charming and lethal secret agent on the hunt to find out who he is. Mastering different martial arts styles and weapons training in addition to several foreign languages, Damon is a force when he takes the screen as Bourne. <br/><br/>The film's action is endless as Bourne is chased around Europe by assassins of the secret he is out to discover. From car chases in snowy Germany to hiding out in the lovely European countryside and ending finally in the City of Lights (Paris, France). The film's fight scene are just engrossing as Bourne gains the upper hand each time due to his special combat skills; he rarely uses a weapon unless it's needed to finish the job and incapacitate his opponent.<br/><br/>The story-line is solid though it heavily deviates from author Robert Ludlum's novel. However the premise is intact as the film covers Jason Bourne's start on the path to find out who he is."
"sneads01","10","7","7","21 March 2011"," Finally! A movie that can stand without excessive special effects.
","I enjoy the great special effects of movies such as the Star Wars series and other action packed movies such as the Die Hard and James Bond films, but the special effects are just as much a part of the plot and story lines as the writing. It is refreshing to watch a film that does not rely on excessive special effects to tell its story. The Bourne Identity (2002) is one such film. The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a man found shot and lying in the ocean by fisherman who has lost his memory. He struggles to regain his strength on the ship and he tries to piece his life back together. He hits a dead end and finds that he must leave the boat. Bourne has a bank account number that leads him to a safety deposit box filled with money and fake passports. Bourne realizes that he must be a secret agent for some country. He hooks up with Marie, played by Franka Potente. As it turns out, Jason Bourne was a secret agent who was shot because he did not fulfill his mission, to Assassinate Wombasi, an African Leader, played by Adewale Akinnouye-Abaje. There were agents who planned to kill Bourne because he has now been considered a rogue agent. One familiar face, Julia Stiles, plays Nicolette, an agent in an operator type position. There was also the agent played by Clive Owen, the Professor, who was one of the agents sent to hunt Borne down and kill him. Packed with action and suspense this film is wonderfully shot. There were flash cuts in certain action packed parts of the film. Also, during the action there was minimal music playing in the background to add to the realistic feel to the film. I can say that I enjoyed watching a film that did not need to blast techno or other type of music to express the action of the film. The use of less sound made the film enjoyable. You can concentrate on the action on the screen and not worry about who made the song and other things that can be distracting when watching a film. These flash cuts and the use of less music added a dramatic feel to the film because Borne can be a real person, this can happen to any agent who defies the government and choose not to follow orders. They can be hunted down!"
"Boyo-2","8","22","27","24 June 2002"," Classy entertainment
","Maybe its me, but it gives me a familiar feeling when I see a guy in a turtleneck sweater, an overcoat and a rifle.  I know its a cliche, but why would this movie re-invent the medium anyway? <br/><br/>I also like car chases through foreign cities, passports and accents.  So with all that intact, I liked 'The Bourne Identity' very much.  It has all the elements of the genre.  You know what you're getting and you get what you want. <br/><br/>There is no point in going over the plot.  It gets confusing about 3/4 in but it does not matter that much.  Its fun for two hours and that's it.<br/><br/>
I have been a huge fan of Franka Potente since becoming mildly obsessed with 'Run Lola Run' and she does not disappoint.  She has some real chemistry with Matt Damon and has a very sweet, inviting way about her.  She is not traditional leading actress material, thank God, and I credit the producers for hiring her.  Even more so when you realize that Julia Stiles has a small part in this movie.  I am sure someone wanted a bigger 'name' to be Matt's female lead and it might have occured to more than one exec to switch Franka and Julia, but obviously I am glad that did not happen.<br/><br/>
Clive Owen adds another strong performance to his resume.  He has only one big scene, really, but makes the most of it.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are known for their sturdy work and they also deliver here.<br/><br/>
Excellent, summertime entertainment.  8/10."

"jadortmunder","8","30","39","12 March 2006"," Fine little action flick
","I can sympathize with reviewers who had read the book and were disappointed by this film and the liberties it apparently took with the story. I've had that happen with books I've enjoyed and it can spoil a film you might otherwise have liked. I never read the book, so I was able to appreciate this film on its own merits - slick, tough, fast-paced and refreshingly devoid of the kind of nonsense that has made the Bond films harder and harder to sit through. <br/><br/>I'm especially impressed by the fights, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, are among the most believable martial-arts-based fight scenes ever seen. No big grand gestures or Olympian kicks - just fast, nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly good - even Damon, who is no fave of mine, comes across believably as a man who's trained to hold it all in, but isn't sure what it all is that he's holding in. Cooper, Cox and Owen shine in their all-too-brief screen time. Potente is attractive in a real person sort of way (sigh of relief for this genre) and possesses an inner strength that makes her character's actions and reactions ring truer than what we'd get from the traditional Hollywood eye-candy girlfriend these films normally feature.<br/><br/>From the gritty bowels of the trawler, where Damon awakens to his situation, to the field where he confronts his most deadly assailant, the locations are the antithesis of the travel poster hotspots that Bond so frequently visits. Despite its breakneck pace (handled so well by Liman and so poorly in the sequel by his protégé), the film manages to convey a sense of melancholy that lifts it a bit above the average action thriller. Sorry book fans - it may not be your cup of Ludlum, but it's still a damn fine little action flick."
"thebrenman","10","6","6","14 July 2012"," Excellent Thriller
","The Bourne Identity is the beginning of a series of movies that should set the bar for all thriller to come.<br/><br/>It has a more than decent plot about an Agent's Experience in the CIA. Its action scenes are also excellent and are not too unrealistic. The romance is also proficient, and is kept to a minimum(I personally don't see that often in thrillers), so it keeps me more engaged in the film.<br/><br/>The Cast and soundtrack are beyond excellence. At first glance(post Good Will Hunting), Matt Damon doesn't seen like a person that is suitable to play Jason Bourne, but proved us wrong. Now, I can't watch a Bourne movie without him. The soundtrack was made by John Powell which did a good job. Its no Hans Zimmer, but it is better than most other thrillers.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was extremely good. I highly recommend it."
"raybarber","10","6","6","20 September 2004"," Excellent story makes an excellent movie
","Always seen the books but never read them - now I will. This is a great cloak and dagger spy story that really works in this format. Matt Damon is not the perfect Jason Bourne, as he just seems a bit 'young' to forfill the role of bond like super-spy. However is acting skills are classy enough that he carries it off well. The story is very fluid and the action is well-paced. Easy to follow and yet never boring, it really shows how a great story is the best place to start with a movie. Done in a very tasteful manner that makes it believable and engaging. I consider myself a 'fussy' movie viewer, but this really was entertaining, even the second and third times!"
"Chris2004T","10","255","397","17 December 2004"," Great movie, 1 very incorrect review
","This is a great movie. Unfortunately one reviewer has no knowledge towards the field of psychology. One reviewer states it's a good movie based on a completely false occurrence, that being amnesia in general. They say it doesn't exist and nobody loses their memory of their identity while retaining knowledge of everything else. This is untrue. I am currently studying to become a psychologist, it's called Dissociative Amnesia. -Dissociative Amnesia - formerly Psychogenic Amnesia, is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal information. This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of critical personal information. Dissociative amnesia, unlike other types of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma, such as a blow to the head. The predominant disturbance is one or more episodes of inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness - Just to prove, it's true, and does happen. So this movie is not based on something made up, similar losses of memory do happen to people. Especially people in a job such as that. So, concluding, this is a great action film, I truly enjoyed this movie along with the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Both are I think going to be a couple of the best movies we will see this decade (2000-2010)"
"Agent10","8","54","78","14 June 2002"," It's the little things that make this film work
","While the action genre is as believable and formulaic as an NSync song, The Bourne Identity takes a much needed step to the side to watch oncoming traffic. Subtle, yet still holding true to multiple action formulas (lots of fighting, cool weaponry, and chase scenes), this film presents a new era of action film making which could be all the wave. Matt Damon, who has the unfortunate nature of watching his less talented friend Ben Affleck gain notoriety for trash movies, is an excellent choice as the CIA operative turned amnesiac Jason Bourne. <br/><br/>His presence is both believable and realistic, like he is some guy who looks like a bookworm. While the film's cinematography was rather average, there are moments in the film which presents actual anxiety. The viewer knows something is coming, yet the genuine far exhibited by the characters makes those moments so interesting. I thought this would be some average action, but I walked away amazed. Franka Potente played the role of Marie perfectly, even though some prettier and less talented actress could have been placed in this film. Kudos to the producers for the casting choice. 7.4/10"
"claudio_carvalho","9","87","132","20 September 2003"," An Excellent Non-Stop Action Movie
","The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect. This movie is everything that 'Tripple X' and 'Die Another Day' intended to be and did not offer to the viewer: a non-stop and excellent action film. Fortunately this screenplay was not in the hands of Tom Cruise, otherwise he would like to perform the role of Jason Bourne and spoil this film, as usual. It is amazing the filmography of Matt Dammon. This great actor knows how to select good screenplays. I am not familiarized with the filmography of Franka Potente ( I believe most of them has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil), but in 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy' I liked her performance very much. One thing that called my attention along this movie was her perfect accent in English (with the exception of the 'sh....' expressions in German). The great Chris Cooper and Julia Stiles perform secondary roles along this outstanding action movie. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Identidade Bourne"" (""The Bourne Identity"")"

","Loved it (especially the pursuit through Europe).<br/><br/>I think Matt Damon is a strong actor with an as usual compelling performance. You know he is an assassin but you want him to succeed due to the way the story is set up. <br/><br/>I loved the solitary feel you have for Damon's character despite him nearly always being surrounded by random people. I also liked the down to earth fighting style used throughout the movie. Made it feel real and more grounded. Having watched the TVM original, I thought this would have to go some to enhance the story but it does it very well.<br/><br/>I recommend this as the solution to the incredulity of Bond films!"

We have plenty of them, but while in hunger games they often were used in a too confusing way, here we have a smarter use of them: you can figure out well what is going on despite the shake. that's wonderful.<br/><br/>Can't be that much of a fan of the music and sometimes of Matt Damon's acting homever.

","""The Bourne Identity"" (2002) is the first installment in the famous Bourne-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Some attention needs to be paid to the minor characters, especially the different assassins. The more you understand and get from the first half, the more sense the second half will make.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity has a bit of everything - tension, sensuality and surely violence. Neither part, however, is overly prominent (except perhaps the violence in the third act), to the degree where it is detracting from the overall story and characters. The focus stays steady, and the tone doesn't shift very much throughout the runtime. Not a lot else needs to be said - prepare for a thrilling dive into one of the greatest action movies of the 2000s.<br/><br/>My overall grade: 8/10."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","4","4","19 June 2017"," Surprisingly good and entertaining
","Not that there is any bias intended against the spy film genre, far from it. Nor with films that contain a good deal, or a lot, of action. There are some good, very good even, ones out there. There are also however ones that are too derivative, are basically style over substance (a few not even executing the style particularly well) and favour can-see-it-coming ""thrills"" and ""twists"" and bombastic action over telling a good story.<br/><br/>What a pleasant surprise that 'The Bourne Identity' turned out to be. Had heard next to nothing but good things about the Bourne films and had been meaning to check them out for a while, while worrying as to whether they'd be my cup of tea or not. 'The Bourne Identity' not only does what it set out to do very well, with lots of fun and intrigue, but it is also a film that has a brain and respects its audience. It clearly knew what it wanted to be and who to aim it at.<br/><br/>Sure, the basic story is not exactly original, occasionally there is a little routine-ness. This doesn't really matter all that much though, because 'The Bourne Identity' succeeded in giving the genre a considerable freshness on the whole. It does lose its way a little towards the end, when things do become a little too cliché and some things could have been explained better and felt less confused. While still doing a good job, Clive Owen did deserve more to do than what he got, a come and go character that disappears too quickly and early.<br/><br/>However, visually 'The Bourne Identity' is very slick and stylish, special effects very wisely kept at minimum. Am not always a fan of the camera technique used here but here it added to the intensity and didn't feel that excessive or abused, certainly didn't look amateurish either. A reasonably dynamic soundtrack and authentic sound quality helps too, as does astute direction that keeps everything moving along with confidence.<br/><br/>'The Bourne Identity' contains a sharp and well written script that provokes thought, with nothing being confused, rambling or cheesy. The story for much of the length is exciting and has a considerable freshness that is really refreshing. The pacing is relentless, while avoiding the traps of being too hectic or being dull, neither of which it ever is. The action is very well choreographed, confidently performed and keeps one on the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>Matt Damon carries the title role with ease, and Franka Potente provides gutsy support, their chemistry to me was believable. Chris Cooper is fun, and while a little too briefly utilised Clive Owen and Brian Cox both do very good jobs.<br/><br/>In summary, surprisingly good and entertaining and a very good start to the Bourne films. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","This is a drama. It is not ""Midnight in Paris."" The scenes could be the background for any American visitor-the Right Bank Hotel (looks like the Ritz- you just pass through, you don't stay there) - the strange phones - crossing Pont Neuf- the Gare du Nord and its statues resembling a cathedral - the backgrounds along the Seine - La Samaritaine department store - L'Hotel des Invalides and Le Tour Eiffel in the background - driving on the quai's, on sidewalks and down a set of steps. This movie is better than the sequels in the Bourne series due to the romantic interest between Jason and Marie and the humanity expressed in the script vs. the action in the sequels. The script has some special lines, such as Jason's ""Just keep on talking, it's relaxing,"" and ""How do I know that?"" and Marie's ""I said I was your personal assistant, I just asked for it"" and ""Nobody does the right thing,"" and the dying agent's line ""We always work alone.""

Landing in Switzerland,the man finds that he has a series of remarkable skills,from tying complex knots to combat skills.Getting a safe deposit box number from one of the bullets,the man goes to a Swiss bank and finds a box filled with cash,guns and passports,one of which has the name ""Jason Bourne."" Going to the US embassy,Bourne is taken aback,when guards and police start attacking him,who appear to know his ""missing"" identity.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Put together from a ""struggling"" production, (from the studio wanting bigger bangs for their bucks,to the entire,told within flashback outline being cut mid-production) director Doug Liman and cinematographer Oliver Wood impressively hit blockbuster combat scenes with a murky,European ""Spiv"" atmosphere. Keeping plot details away from Wood in order to bring an urgent sense of surprise to the movie,Liman surrounds Bourne and Marie with an enticing mood of dread and doubt,as smoothly spun tracking shots corner Bourne and Marie in side streets where lingering over the shoulder shots make everyone look like a possible informant. Along with the spy mystery,Linman rolls out short,sharp shocks of gripping action scenes,which turn from a thrilling car chase to a twitching with anxiety stakeout.<br/><br/>Keeping the bare bones of Robert Ludlum's novel,the screenplay by Tony Gilroy & W. Blake Herron keep exposition down to a minimum,in order for the viewer to feel the full reverb of the clues Bourne uncovers on his past. Sending Bourne and Marie on the run,the writers brilliantly challenge the duo with constant fears of spivs hiding in the shadow,and sharp-shooting spies and hit men smashing into Bourne's clean slate identity.<br/><br/>Sent on the run again, Franka Potente (who would reunite with CIA ""tech"" Walton Goggins in the extraordinary TV series The Shield) gives a terrific performance as Maire,who despite clearly being caught in the midst of something she has no wish to be in,is given a punchy,rebellious edge by Marie.

","In 1962, Hollywood introduced British spy James Bond who made an iconic name in the action genre, and the legacy of this household action hero continues today through the longest running film franchise In the 1980s, we were introduced to Bruce Willis' John McClane, a New York cop who served justice as he took a dozen of German terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza one by one, and his astonishing charisma has lead to a spawn of a few sequels. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is what some describe as just a modern day James Bond. But with a powerful portrayal by Damon, he feels more like an original character, a spy agent with a highly trained set of fighting skills in both gun and hand-to- hand combat. In this spy action thrilled directed by Doug Liman, Matt Damon steps into what is arguably his most charismatic role aside from his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Good Will Hunting'. Damon plays the title character Jason Bourne, a CIA agent who wakes up on a boy after being rescued by a group of fisherman. Suffering from amnesia and covered in bullet wounds, he travels to Switzerland where he uses his old bank account to put together the puzzle pieces of his identity. He is soon assisted by German woman Marie (played by Franka Potente) to search for his identity but soon find himself by hunted down by ruthless assassins by Black Ops agent Alexander Conklin (played by Chris Cooper). Bourne must escape from the vicious criminals while searching for answers to what they want him for. <br/><br/>Not very many action flicks offer a spectacular mix of tense action and mystery like this action thriller. From the hyper-kinetic action sequences, to it's slick editing, to the highly compelling plot, to the overall likability of the lead character; this film stops at almost nothing to deliver the strong, visceral experience viewers come to root for. In an age where many films of the action genre struggle to find a solid balance of both action and coherent plot development, this one manages to stand out. The plot moves through the title character's search of his identity and the conspiracy that surrounds, and what ensues is a nice array of tension and unpredictable scenes. The fiercest moments show Jason Bourne engaging in brutal martial arts combat against the baddies, complete with stunning choreography and camera-work that, while a bit shaky, successfully express the intensity of the scenes. One of the most intense moments lies in a beautifully shot staircase shootouts scene. The film definitely has a sweet taste in action, and it delivers quite well especially with Matt Damon who's quite energizing vibrant in the lead role. Franka Potente is also very strong as her character who makes a competent supporting character rather than a typical damsel-in-distress. Praise can also be given to Chris Cooper as the main villain. He may not serve as a memorable antagonist, but that's not the point as the lead character's primary goal is not to capture or kill the villain but to search for the reason why he (the antagonist) trying to take him down.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling, and purely entertaining experience for action fans everywhere. This film is easily a household name in Matt Damon's career as well as the action genre of the 2000s. For all looking for a great popcorn flick, this one is worth checking out."
"brchthethird","9","3","3","14 November 2014"," A tense thrill-ride with superb action sequences
","THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tense thrill-ride anchored by Matt Damon's strong central performance as a amnesiac assassin in search of who he is. It also kick-started the Bourne series, which raised the bar for intelligent action films. There's not too much need to go into plot details, except that Jason Bourne is a former CIA-trained assassin who is nearly killed when a job goes south. He wakes up with no memory of what happened before and sets off on a mission to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. One aspect I really liked was the balance between action and drama. The action scenes are quite relentless, but the film also allows a relationship to be developed between Matt Damon's Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente), a woman he meets practically by chance. They each have their own somewhat similar problems, and they work together to try and fix them. Normally these types of movies just focus on the protagonist, but here the audience is also exposed and given insight into the other side: the people who are trying to bring Bourne back in. Although some suspension of disbelief is required, the movie does feel grounded in reality, especially considering the recent glut of leaks regarding the NSA. In my opinion, it was nice to see the inner workings of intelligence agencies, and to top it off, a smattering of government intrigue as well. I thought the plotting was very solid, and the performances across the board were very good. The only weak link I found was Julia Stiles as Nicolette, a Paris-based CIA asset who runs a safe house. I thought her role was slightly underwritten, and her performance wasn't as good as the rest of the cast. Moving on, the technical aspects of the film were all excellent. I thought that the action sequences were well-filmed and easy to follow in a geographical sense. The fights were quite intense and well-choreographed as well. Matt Damon makes for a good action star, and this movie is proof of that. The score was also quite good, and helped maintain tension throughout the nearly two-hour running time. All in all, I thought that this was an excellent action film that can hold its own against similar series, like James Bond (which this clearly was intended as). Highly recommended for fans of action films and thrillers. You won't be disappointed."
"C22Man","8","3","3","29 October 2013"," Excellent spy thriller
","The Bourne Identity is the first film in the hit spy trilogy starring Matt Damon as an apparent ex CIA assassin. It comes off as a slick and smart film, avoiding the usual action clichés and having very intelligent ideas that work. The film is high octane stuff mainly thanks to the interesting premise, excellent performances and superb action set pieces.<br/><br/>The plot sees fishermen recover a man's body out at sea with two bullet holes in his back. He is suffering from amnesia and doesn't remember who he was, later discovering his name to be Jason Bourne. A laser device planted in his hip shows him his bank account which is full of money and a gun. Bourne then finds himself hunted by the police and, with the help of a woman named Marie, he searches for answers in Paris which lead all the way to the CIA. The story flows extremely well and has a lot of twists that help in making things more interesting. The general story about Bourne is just an interesting one and you can never really tell where the film is going to end up, which makes it all the more gripping.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional. Matt Damon is excellent as Bourne, perfectly portraying him as confused and conflicted but still very clever. He does a great job of handling the action, intense and emotional scenes with astuteness. Franka Potente is equally good as Marie. She comes off as likable and her normality gives her a realistic edge, she makes for a sensitive and courageous companion for Bourne. Chris Cooper does an incredibly solid job as the CIA man who is tracking Bourne's every move. He shows him as a cold calculating figure without removing all of his humanity. Brian Cox is great as always as the intense Abbott, Cox's sheer presence shows intellect and cunning. Julia Stiles is very good as informer Nicky. Clive Owen is very good too as the stoic assassin the 'Professor'.<br/><br/>The action scenes are brilliant. The fights scenes are a lot more realistic than most films, which makes them fast, exciting and surprisingly brutal. The fight with the would-be assassin and the climax in particular are excellently shot. The car chase is a highlight, it just feels naturally gritty while still being a thrilling and entertaining set piece. The characters are well fleshed out which is something most action films miss out on. Bourne is an interesting person and as he finds out more so do the audience, he eventually does feel like a real spy and thanks to Damon's intense portrayal he does appear to be fighting for his life. The same goes for the realism as the characters do come across as somewhat vulnerable. The film itself is shot really well, it captures Paris very beautifully and espionage atmosphere is nicely heavy. Its surprising how well paced it is, it seemingly moves quickly but still has time to add hints of melancholy and emotion to the story itself. It is a brilliant style of relying on story and characters with bursts of action and energy, which harken back to older action films. The score by John Powell is great as it is both nicely moody and rather exhilarating when it needs to be. <br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling and emotive in equal doses as its one of the finest spy films around."
"ChristianUnchained","8","3","3","23 April 2013"," An awesome start to a great trilogy
","A bold and intense suspense trip that doesn't let up until the final scene. It successfully blends noir, spy, thriller, suspense, and action styles while maintaining incredible pacing and heart beating intensity. The minimalist score does a great job capturing the essence of what is occurring in the film, and the level of intrigue that this world creates leaves us begging for more. While Damon is excellent, other sub characters are weak and poorly introduced and written. There are one or two bothersome plot holes that always drive me crazy when watching, but other than those minor issues The Bourne Identity is a AAA thriller with suspense and thrillers to spare."
"cosmonadz","8","3","3","6 March 2013"," Bourne tastic
","I really enjoyed the first outing of Bourne. I think it was a coming of age film for Matt Damon and although it isn't his best performance he did prove the doubters wrong. Personally my favourite of the trilogy as the web unfolds and the plot thickens the pace of this action packed thriller just goes from strength to strength. I enjoyed watching the original TV series and thought the movie did a good oh of transferring it to the big screen. I enjoyed how the character unfolds and his balance of emotion and anger are ignited through his confusion. Enough is covered in this opening movie to give you the taste for wanting more but not leaving you bemused. The supporting cast do a decent enough job of carrying Damon through the scenes and even a heavyweight pitches in (Clive Owen)'to lend a supporting hand. Damon almost reminds me of an insomniac 007'but maybe with less suave about him. All in all a good effort and full marks for keeping me entertained. Damon proving himself and making sure that the likes of good will hunting were not just a fluke! The other two movies fit in perfectly and make the whole 3 parts one it satisfying meal of a movie."

","This is a great film which I would recommend to anyone who loves action films and the spy type of film. This is not like the normal type of spy film it is very different to most of the others. This makes it a must see. One thing that let it down was the car action which you could tell was fake but apart from that the film was spotless. You didn't actually see him doing his job and his task, instead you got him running away from the people he work for that are trying to kill him. The actors in the film are great they play the roles really good and that the thing seem real like you are in the actual film and part of the people in the film. It is gripping near the end and you just want to know what happens and if he is going to die."
"Hey_Sweden","8","3","3","3 January 2013"," A rousing mix of action and intrigue.
","Previously filmed as a TV miniseries in the 1980s, Robert Ludlums' spy thriller ""The Bourne Identity"" gets re-imagined for the movie audiences of the 21st century, and it's a refreshingly more human look at a well worn genre, giving us a hero who's believable at all times; he may become a standard action hero in some scenes, yet has the appeal of an average Joe; Matt Damon delivers a creditable performance in this role. At the start of this story, he's fished out of the Mediterranean Sea with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is. Soon he's forced to take it on the lam, as his CIA superiors back home are determined to put closure on his botched mission. Fortunately he manages to hook up with a young woman, Marie (Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run"") who is able to provide him with some all important transportation. The action scenes are stylishly staged, but never overwhelm the meaty story which gets a respectful adaptation thanks to screenwriters Tony Gilroy & W. Blake Herron, director Doug Liman, and a talented cast and crew. They just hook you right in with an impressive atmospheric opening and slowly but surely begin to crank up the tension. Fine use is made of various international locations and the widescreen cinematography (by Oliver Wood) is excellent. Damon is fun to watch in the lead; even though his character may be in the dark for the balance of the movie, he always shows himself able to adapt to different situations and to sense when danger is near. He shares a good chemistry with German star Potente, who's very appealing and as sexy as any ""Bond girl"" in the James Bond franchise. Also in the excellent cast are Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Walton Goggins, and Julia Stiles, although Clive Owen is kind of wasted as a professional assassin dubbed The Professor; his is an intriguing character who disappears from the story a little too soon. Many riveting scenes, including one where Bourne is kind of making like Spider-Man during an escape attempt and a lively car chase sequence. Even at 119 minutes, this never feels as long as it is as Damon, Liman, and company keep you watching and engrossed the entire time. All in all, this can stand up very well against any James Bond series entry or other spy film of old; it's got enough vitality and solid story telling to make it pleasant viewing. Executive produced by Ludlum, and followed by ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". Eight out of 10."

","Matt Damon had a huge splash on the Hollywood scene in 1997 with Good Will Hunting. But his followup movies like The Talented Mr. Ripley, All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance failed to captivate both audiences and critics alike. It was this movie that not only made Damon an action movie start but a bankable star in general who started to get offered much better projects afterwards.<br/><br/>The story is about a highly trained CIA assassin who while on a mission gets amnesia and then subsequently betrayed by his handlers.<br/><br/>After Damon the stunts and the action scenes are the reasons this movie worked so well, along with a great supporting cast with Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, Franka Potente and Brian Cox."
"vishaal811","10","5","6","24 September 2015"," Not your average action thriller!!
","The Bourne Identity is a spy thriller which, on the surface, is strikingly similar in premise to the James Bond series. However, as the movie commences and gathers momentum, it becomes strikingly clear that the filmmakers have strived to make this movie a lot more focused on the characters and the plot. Even though there is enough action to satisfy the genre fans, the intelligent way in which the story is presented gives us a unique perspective on the life of the lead character.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, is a CIA agent who was sent to perform a certain task in Europe. At the beginning of the movie, Bourne is unable to recall his identity or the purpose of his mission. As the viewers are also unaware of this, it allows us to see the world from his point of view. I believe that this generates a much greater impact than knowing beforehand the identity of Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>For the majority of the movie, Jason Bourne struggles to remember anything about his past which is well executed by Matt Damon's acting. The CIA plan to capture him and the whole movie is essentially a battle between Jason Bourne and the CIA.<br/><br/>Technically, all aspects of the movie is quite impressive. A car chase sequence, in particular, is pulled off with consummate skill. Due to a run-time of just over two hours, the movie keeps you hooked and the strong writing enables the film to never lose traction.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend watching this movie as it is not a mere caricature of some other well-known spy thrillers. Instead, it is a unique story told by a talented director which has all the elements that are necessary for a timeless classic."

","Realistic, thrilling, fast-paced, deadly, but on top of all, he needed luck to be on his side in order to solve his own puzzle, whoever wrote the script deserves praise just as much as Matt Damon.<br/><br/>This film/series should have its own genre, call it 'realistic thriller' if you'd like, because it just doesn't do it justice by putting it in the same category as films like James Bond, there's no unneeded characters in the whole series, no unneeded love scenes - which is the most unnecessary thing in a thriller/spy movie.<br/><br/>The thing I love the most about this film/series is that the background music is absolutely flawless, to maintain the same level of excitement(if not more) with that same tune in the theme music for 3 movies, is simply brilliant, it brings the movie to the next level.<br/><br/>People who are lazy to think, lazy to listen to every word, or simply just trying to watch some stuns or cool computer effects, will be disappointed because this movie is nothing like that.

"thesar-2","10","5","6","1 December 2012"," The Start of a Masterpiece Trilogy
","As a fan of James Bond, but acknowledging its campiness, clichés and formulas, it was extremely refreshing to see a true spy/action movie with a movie star I already respected, but never thought could pull it off: Matt Damon. Damon did a superb job as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity as did the rest of the cast. You rooted for him, sympathized with him and despite the past you soon learn to question, you still wanted him to succeed. Bourne is found without a memory in the ocean by fishermen who attempt to help the young man by dropping him off, with a little bit of cash, near a place, Switzerland, where he might regain his identity. There he learns of extraordinary fighting skills he was unaware of and meets the soon-to-be (and obvious) love of his life, Marie. Both try and piece his past together, while formulating a future together, albeit on the run from a mysterious ""Treadstone"" organization. The action, when shown, is intense, the intrigue storyline is not only plausible, but on-the-edge of your seat exciting, and the cinematography is stunning – I must visit Paris, France soon. The only flaws I can find (though I didn't look for them) was the obvious pairing of Marie and Bourne, their inevitable sex scene, and Marie's accent (and languages) that jumped from one culture to the next. Other than those minor defects, this was a wonderful, suspenseful and crafty movie. I absolutely loved them reverting (as they did with the as-good sequels) from CGI and made me believe in action again and not the green screen. Also, despite knowing there was more than one book this was based upon and knowing sequels were in the works, I loved this was a completely stand alone feature and is absolutely recommended."

","The Bourne Identity (2002) directed by Doug Liman, written by Troy Gilroy and W. Blake Herron and starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, Franka Potene as Marie and Chris Cooper as Conklin. The Bourne Identity was originally a novel written by Robert Ludlum that was published in 1980. There was also a made for television revision of the novel that starred Jacklyn Smith and Richard Chamberlain in 1988. However the most successful of the three would be the movie starring Matt Damon. This movie was about a young man who was recruited to work for the American government as an assassin. During one of his missions he was shot, and thought to be dead, in the middle of the ocean and found by a foreign ship of some sort and nursed back to health. Once he was aware he realized he did not know who he was and thus he was unaware of his identity except that he was Jason Bourne. Jason soon sets out on a mission to discover who he is and why he is able to do incredible things like; running extreme fast for a long distance without losing his breath or being able to speak several languages without remembering how he learned them and even his expertise in fighting and shooting. Jason begins to have flashbacks of people, place and things that he's been or been involved with and starts to piece them together. He remembers a bank account and locker number where he finds passports and money and is able to travel to some of the places in his memory and with the help of Marie they realize who and what he was.<br/><br/>The lighting and the cinematography captured in the movie was impeccable. Doug Liman, the director did a wonderful job with the flashbacks, and the locations that the film was set in. The flashbacks that Jason was having were made to feel like you were actually having the flashback yourself. The color tone was a black and white with a small amount of color to make it true to real life flashbacks, a memory. The actual locations were set up so that you could imagine the action taking place would take place in the location. <br/><br/>I believe this movie would be an all time favorite like those of James Bond. The Bourne Identity was film with the perfect characters, lighting and location to make it a box office hit. If anyone else were to play Jason Bourne I don't think this movie would have turned out so great. I recommend, if you are a lover of action packed movies that you see this movie and you will agree with me and other movie goers believe, that this is a must see film!"

","Matt Damon is Jason Bourne in the 2002 film `The Bourne Identity,' based on the # 1 best selling novel by Robert Ludlum.<br/><br/>The plot goes something like this<br/><br/>A man awakens on a small fishing boat outside France. Bullet-riddled and without memory, he finds himself pursued by mysterious assassins, all the while trying to gain back his memory.<br/><br/>I recall first reading `The Bourne Identity.' It was a well-written book. Like the book, the movie is also good. Perhaps it is the excellent cinematography of France  it captured the clichéd images I imagined when I read the book. The acting is surprisingly good, as well. Not many people know that `The Bourne Identity' is the second film to be based on Ludlum's novel (see the TV version starring Jaclyn Smith and Richard Chamberlain from 1988), but the newer 2002 version is much better, and definitely worth wasting your money on.<br/><br/>Matt Damon pulls off the character of Jason Bourne with ease, while Franka Potente does not disappoint. Chris Cooper has fun with his role, and a small role by Julia Stiles surprises.<br/><br/>There is a great car chase in this film. Fans of the Seventies and Eighties-type genres will love this movie. It has the feel of a classy thriller, and never resorts to stupidity instead smarts, or action instead of plot.<br/><br/>Of course many things had to be dropped from the book to make this film. That is only expected. But I'm glad they didn't `butcher' this movie up like some other book-to-film movies.<br/><br/>Overall, `The Bourne Identity' is not a great movie, but it sure is good, as well as surprising. Very much so, in fact. <br/><br/>4/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"
"MaxBorg89","8","9","14","19 December 2005"," The name is Bourne, Jason Bourne...
","Sick of all those recent spy flicks (I don't need to name them, you know what I'm talking about) where plot and characters are buried by hundreds of visual effects and everything is the same movie after movie after movie? Then try The Bourne Identity, which brings new life to the genre. It's got everything you're after: intelligent story, believable and likable characters, and yes, action too, but it's realistic action, not some Matrix-style kicking.<br/><br/>The most intriguing aspect is arguably that the hero is a vulnerable human being. In fact, at the beginning of the movie he is found half-dead in the French sea. Once he recovers, this stranger (Matt Damon) is stunned to realize he can speak five or six languages fluently, but doesn't remember where he learned them, or anything that happened prior to his awakening for that matter. The only clue he has is a bank account number in Switzerland, which reveals his name is Jason Bourne and he 's involved in some kind of classified activity. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time to sort things out, as his superiors (Chris Cooper and Brian Cox) think he has deserted and decide to take him down. With only a German student named Marie (Franka Potente) willing to help him, Bourne must put all the pieces together and find out exactly who he is before it is too late. <br/><br/>Director Doug Liman and screenwriter Tony Gilroy have made their own version of The Bourne Identity (Robert Ludlum's novel is almost completely different), but who cares, as long as the movie works? It's one of the best spy stories ever made, and it looks like something that could actually happen (all of Bourne's weapons can be purchased by an average citizen). This is the anti-Bond, a man who actually gets hurt and would rather be left alone, and his vulnerability is grippingly conveyed through Damon's powerful performance. If there is a defect, it has to be the fact that the film's focus is almost entirely on the protagonist, overshadowing a fine supporting cast (especially Cooper and Clive Owen, whose turn as the Professor manages to be much more than a stereotyped ""silent killer"" pantomime).<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting action movie of 2002, with an even better sequel continuing in the same direction."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","15","27","31 January 2007"," The Good & Bad Of ''The Bourne Identity'
","This is a solid suspense-spy film with an agent-on-the-run scenario. People who like a paranoid theme, where everyone is after you (I plead guilty) will love this. <br/><br/>THE GOOD - The amount of violence in here was just about right, not too much and not too little. I also enjoyed the Paris scenery, both the street-level shots and the aerial photography. Ovrall, the cinematography is very good in this film. It's an involving story that once you're hooked, you stay that way. The two hours go by pretty quickly. The cast is interesting. I was familiar with Franke Potente after seeing her in ""Run Lola Run."" Potente has a different, and intriguing look to her. The action scenes in here are very good, including an excellent car chase.<br/><br/>THE BAD - I get tired of American filmmakers trashing their own government all the time, in here its them trying to kill one of their own agents. Also, there are too many usages of the Lord's name in vain, mainly said by Chris Cooper's character. It also took a bit to accept Matt Damon as some physically-rough spy since his image was not that prior to this film.<br/><br/>OVERALL - A good movie that is part of my collection. I liked the sequel even better, although part of the reason was that I was now familiar with the main characters after watching this film. Anyway, I highly recommend both movies for fans of suspense, crime, intrigue, good locales, etc."
"alanfw","10","6","9","2 March 2008"," One of the best action-thrillers I've seen ( maybe THE best )
","When I first heard what this film was about from a friend of mine who had just seen it I liked the sound of it . When he told me that Matt Damon was playing the lead part as a covert/clandestine CIA operative with amnesia + martial arts skills etc I must admit , I just couldn't picture it ( I guess because I hadn't seen him in that type of role before ) . But when I watched this film , all my doubts were banished. I already thought of Matt Damon as a good actor before this film , but his performance in this ( and all of the Bourne films ) elevates him , to one of the truly great actors. It's the fact that he is so convincing in the role and that you can really sympathise with the character. As it turns out , casting Matt Damon for this role is pure genius. I simply can't imagine anyone else in the role. One of the many aspects of his performance which impressed me was the attention to detail, for example the effort he put into the pronunciation of the different languages he speaks in the film which without a doubt contributed to the character being more believable.<br/><br/>I'm glad the film didn't go down the route of getting the actors to speak all in English regardless of which country they were in ( as so any other US films do ) The excellent Franka Potente was equally impressive , and was the perfect match up with Damon. Her character adds a different dimension to the story and works well giving the Bourne character more depth and allows viewers to see Bourne in a different light. The action sequences in this film are superb. Finally an action-thriller with fight sequences that are as realistic as they are complex. This is what all action-thrillers should be like! This sets the benchmark. 10/10 !!!"

","Now this is a movie that follows the 'spy thriller' guidelines to the letter.<br/><br/>Nothing is missing. A hero in the middle of a worldwide secret conspiracy? Check. Rivaling secret organizations? Check. Skillful martial arts fighting? Check. Improbable and yet heart-pounding car chases with a cool-looking chased vehicle? Check. Speaking of vehicles, a romantic one for the hero? Check too. Cold European locations? Check. And so forth.<br/><br/>If it's a genre that's been hard to reinvent since the 'James Bond' movies, it's still one capable to furnish a few little gems. ""The Bourne Identity"", directed by Doug Liman, obviously follows the ""Bond"" legacy (notice the hero's acronym) but it does so in a way that never fails to entertain even the least likely to be surprised fans. Maybe because it didn't try to surprise.<br/><br/>Indeed, instead of going to the 'prestige' road and try to pretend to be smarter than many James Bond film (which 'James Bond' new movies tend to do actually), Liman trusts his material and manages to make a decent and promising thriller, good enough to become the first installment of a successful series. And he lets the script, based on Robert Ludlum's novel, reveals its little tricks, starting with the two novelties in the lead characters.<br/><br/>Matt Damon, still looking young enough to pass as Will Hunting, is Jason Bourne, a young man looking for his true identity, and Franka Potente, the ""Run, Lola"" girl is Marie, the outsider who finds himself taken in that adventure more or less against her own will. There's a reason for her script in the story, but as far as the film's concerned, we know it's necessary for the hero to have someone to talk to, and Potente always finds the right tone. She's not excited, she's shocked and nauseous about violence but she's intrigued enough by Bourne to trust him and follow him.<br/><br/>I know it's tempting to say that the mystery is the reason why the film is capable to hook us, but Bourne's dissociative amnesia isn't exactly a riddle for the ages and there are enough hints about his secret (fighting skills, language fluency...) to figure out that he's not a coal miner. When at the opening, he's fished by Italian boatmen, riddled with bullets and without any memory, I figured it was because of a mental treatment (à la Ludovico) and he was probably a secret agent whose mind might have been brainwashed one bit too many, but the film comes up with a rather simpler explication for the amnesia, so simple that I actually liked it.<br/><br/>It reminded me of that moment where Jason gives a detailed but rather complicated plan to Marie in order to gain information about hotel customers and at the end, all she had to do was asking politely. This is a film that has enough self-awareness to never pretend to play it smarter than its audience and till the end, no spectacular twist comes up trying to wow us, nor any overly long climax. In fact, there's no big reveal, we suspect for a long time who Bourne was, the trick isn't to figure out who he is, but just enjoy the the cat-and-mouse chase with the CIA and a few gunmen.<br/><br/>On that level, the film isn't overcrowded but what is there is quality. Brian Cox is the CIA Deputy Agent (I guess he'll have a bigger role in the next films) Chris Cooper is Conklin, the man who wants to get a hand on Bourne after an apparent failure during a black operation named ""Treadtstone"" and their climactic confrontation is one of the film's greatest moments. Now, I have to give accolades to Clive Owen who, with less than ten minutes of screen-time and only a few lines, steals the show as the cold ""Professor"". Seriously, any actor with the right physique could play the emotionless killer but Owen has a brief exchange with Damon where he injects his own emotionality, and proves that after all, they're still humans with emotion and maybe they don't enjoy it that much. Maybe that's the key of the ""Bourne"" film, something I'm beginning to like, people don't enjoy what they do but they have to.<br/><br/>Bourne wants to identity until he's having second thoughts about it, but he must escape from his tormentors if he wants to start a new life. Marie doesn't want to follow him and jeopardize her life (or her relatives) but she doesn't feel too hot about leaving him either. Cox' character must answer for a failed job and Cooper's Conklin must get the responsible and punish him accordingly. all about jobs getting done and hierarchical strata. And while James Bond seems to enjoy what he does, Bourne is just going into a direction he's forced in and the real shift occurs when he understands he must be the one calling the cards. And even then, he never acts as if it's fun to have all these skills but he's got them and that's what matters.<br/><br/>And that might be what works in the film, it has great special effects, unlikely fighting moves, amusing and thrilling stunts, suspenseful confrontations, and they're all played with the right dose of seriousness and self-awareness, allowing to establish two-and-half dimensional characters for the next installments. In fact, what we get is a well-made thriller, so well I was wondering what would be the harder to believe, the falling from the stairs with enough time to shoot a villain between the eyes or that such a film wouldn't get a sequel"

","I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters in 2002. Back then it was so fresh, and so good--it was a unique story that kept you on the edge of your seat. Indeed, in 2002 I probably would have given this movie 10/10 stars.<br/><br/>That said, watching this movie on Blu Ray recently, I felt like it's still a great film--but one that loses a bit of its charm on a successive viewing. This movie is full of suspense and cliffhanger scenes that make you wonder what's coming next. But it's also a story that once you've seen it once, you more or less know what's going to happen, and so the thrill factor deteriorates significantly, thus making the movie not as fun to watch time and again.<br/><br/>Another thing that the movie has going against it is the picture quality that the movie is filmed in. The movie has a clarity that at many times makes it look more like the set of a sitcom than a spy movie. This is especially true for indoor scenes--it may very well have been exceptionally good lighting rather than the type of film itself that was used. Whatever the case, the movie at times looks too polished, and too crisp.<br/><br/>Still, overall this is a fantastic movie. Matt Damon plays an amnesiac who slowly but surely uncovers bits and pieces about who he actually is. That knowledge is more obvious more quickly to the audience than it is to Damon's character--but throughout the film we learn more and more about the fascinating back story of this man without a memory, and the story is engaging and full of thrills. <br/><br/>All that said, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It's a great movie, but one that there are a few flaws to nitpick."

","It's hard to believe The Bourne franchise is over 14 years old. With 4 successful films under its belt to this point, and one more on the way, Jason Bourne has become one of Hollywood's most enduring protagonists. Luckily, after so long and many repeated viewings, The Bourne Identity still holds up.<br/><br/>Before Paul Greengrass came on board and gave us a few heart stopping thrill rides, Doug Liman directed the first entry in the series. While there are a few dated stylistic choices by Liman, he did a great job kicking off the series. It was released in 2002, but it definitely has a 90's action-thriller vibe from its look and feel. It's also far less cinematic than its successors and in turn makes for a great cable watch (which is probably why I've seen this film north of 10 times).<br/><br/>As I understand, the film's budget spiraled after several re-shoots and push back's, so John Powell had little to work with in terms of a natural score. I feel like that helped him create a more grounded sound and tone to the series, as he has gone on to score 3 more Bourne films. Powell's score, along with the great end credits Moby tag, make for one good listen. The Bourne Identity doesn't nearly have the scope that the Greengrass films do, but it has a surprisingly amount of awareness for an action film. The entire series is more cerebral than it gets credit for.<br/><br/>Accompanying Matt Damon as Bourne himself, is an impressive cast that consists of German star Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Clive Owen. Potente serves a great counter to Damon in that they both play lost souls searching for answers. She also essentially plays the audience, who is going along with Bourne as he ventures deep into his past. Owen, Cooper, and Cox are all great as different levels of C.I.A. agents. Particularly, Clive Owen, who does so much with so little amount of dialogue.<br/><br/>I'm of the belief that, besides Legacy, the Bourne films get better as the series goes on. With a charismatic performance from Damon, in a somewhat unlikable role, it's all the more impressive just how successful these films have become. Hopefully that continues moving forward.<br/><br/>+Damon's commitment<br/><br/>+Supporting cast<br/><br/>+Powell's grounded score<br/><br/>+Good action, but better characters<br/><br/>-Some dated stylistic choices<br/><br/>9.0/10"

","An Italian fishing boat crew working off the coast of Marseille, France finds an unconscious man called Matt Damon adrift in the Mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back.<br/><br/>The man awakens on board, and very soon he comes to realize he suffers from retrograde amnesia, having only one clue to his identity: the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector surgically implanted in his hip. He uses the information and travels to Zürich, Switzerland to find the corresponding bank and discovers he is skilled in advanced hand-to-hand combat and fluent in German when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen questioning him for loitering in a closed park at night.<br/><br/>The man arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash in different currencies, a handgun, and several passports with his photo, but with numerous aliases and nationalities. He assumes the identity of the top passport, ""Jason Bourne"", and leaves. A bank employee notifies a CIA Special Activities Division group, ""Operation Treadstone,"" about his visit, and the police arrive on the scene. Bourne manages to escape and flees to the U.S. consulate, where he is accosted by the officials there but once again manages to elude capture. A few blocks away, Bourne approaches Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) and offers her US$20,000 to take him to Paris to the address on his ""Bourne"" passport card.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, when back at CIA headquarters, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), the head of Treadstone, reveals to his supervisor, Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), that Bourne was the covert operative responsible for a failed assassination attempt on exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Intending to sever all connections between the CIA and Wombosi, Conklin sends three highly-trained ""assets"" (assassins) to eliminate Bourne. Bourne and Marie arrive at the apartment in Paris, where he finds that one of his aliases, ""John Michael Kane,"" was supposedly killed two weeks ago. The first asset, code-named ""Castel"" (Nicky Naude), ambushes them but Bourne subdues him after a brief fight. Marie checks Castel's bag and panics when she discovers a hit list package with photos of CCTV footage of her and Bourne at the embassy the day before. As Bourne tries to calm her down, Castel escapes and jumps out the window to his death before Bourne can learn anything else from him.<br/><br/>Conklin enlists Nicolette ""Nicky"" Parsons (Penina Mezei), a logistics technician at the Treadstone Paris safe house, to assist him in tracking Bourne and Marie. Bourne goes to meet Wombosi to obtain more information but the second asset, code-named ""The Professor"" (Clive Owen), kills Wombosi before Bourne arrives. With the news of Wombosi's death, Bourne surmises he was an assassin before the onset of his amnesia. Bourne and Marie flee to the home of her stepbrother in the countryside where Bourne decides that he no longer wants to be who he was before .<br/><br/>Back at the CIA headquarters, Conklin tracks Bourne and Marie to the countryside house. The next morning, The Professor tries to snipe Bourne but Bourne creates a diversion and dispatches him in a cropfield, having sneaked out. As he dies, The Professor tells Bourne about their mutual connection to Treadstone. Bourne sends Marie and her stepbrother away for her safety, then uses The Professor's cell phone to arrange a meeting with Conklin to bring him out into the open so he can track him.<br/><br/>Bourne tails Conklin back to the Paris safe house where Conklin tells him that he (Bourne) planned the entire operation to kill Wombosi. The revelation triggers Bourne's memory and through successive flashbacks Bourne remembers he used the Kane alias to infiltrate Wombosi's entourage but couldn't bring himself to kill Wombosi because Wombosi's children were present with him. He aborted the mission and tried to flee the boat, but he was shot twice by Wombosi and fell overboard from Wombosi's yacht into the Mediterranean, where the Italian fishermen later found him.<br/><br/>Bourne tells Conklin he is quitting Treadstone and warns them not to follow him. After knocking Conklin out, Bourne engages in a shootout with several other Treadstone agents in the building. Bourne is wounded during the gunfight but kills the other agents and escapes the building. After Bourne has escaped, Conklin orders Nicky to close down the safe house, and shortly afterwards is murdered by the third asset, code-named ""Manheim"" (Russell Levy), on orders from Abbott. Some time later, Abbott explains to an oversight committee that he shut down Treadstone because of its ineffective cost benefit ratio and proposes a new program, ""Operation Blackbriar.""<br/><br/>Bourne, now free from the CIA, travels to Mykonos, Greece, where he reunites with Marie, who runs a scooter shop, and the two share an embrace."

There's spy intrigue, politics, lots of action and a fair amount of violence, a dark governmental department overseer, more assassins and a romantic entanglement, all in just under 2 hours.

The first time I saw it, couldn't wait for the part 2, I just became a big fan of Matt Damon. The movie has everything, drama, action, good acting and a great history. Damon is the only one who can be a Jason Bourne in my opinion, his character is so smart but not so brilliant like a Jet Li. You will see a realistic movie in all it's senses, even the fights have realism. But remember this is not all about fighting, shooting enemies or killing people like a crazy man, this is a different movie you will enjoy for sure.

Franka Potente is just right as his lead female, You want to slap Chris Cooper's character, almost from the very start. Julia Stiles has a small role but at the time, it was a mature one for her.

","This movie, is simply great.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: <br/><br/>We're immediately thrown into the story (and the water) as Bourne wakes up on a fishing trawler with no memory of who he is or what he does, or just about anything really. His only lead being a code that takes him to a bank in Zurich. Quickly, though, he learns that he's an outstanding fighter, able to respond quickly to any threat, on pure instinct. He also quickly learns, that someone wants him dead, for reasons he of course, knows nothing about. So, as he learns more and more, so do we. And we're thrown into the life of an amnesiac that finds out that he's a killer, one of many, trained to kill without hesitation or emotion, all of them a part of the Treadstone operation.<br/><br/>And the life is hardly a flashy one. It's straight to the point, you do the job and get out, and more importantly, you don't fail, or you're likely to end up dead. Matt Damon is great as the amnesiac Jason Bourne, playing the character with 30% confusion, 30% frustration and 40% determination to survive. Franka Potente is just as great as Marie Kreutz, a woman swept along with the ride on a 10.000$ whim, thrown into the chaos, giving Bourne a supporting shoulder when he needs it the most. (and she's got a smile to die for, but that's neither here or there) She becomes the anchor, and though she at one point really doubts what she's gotten herself into or who Bourne really is, in the end her reluctance to leave and disappointment when Bourne finally gets her into the car is visible, and well played by the actress.<br/><br/>The movie pretty much sets its pace early, and it keeps to it, giving Bourne little to no time to find out what's going on without someone hunting for him or anyone that might come between them. He has no clever gadgets, no agency that protects his actions. He has only himself, his skills, and every now and then, Marie to help him survive the hunt for information. If you like action movies with a realistic touch to them, the Bourne series will hopefully not leave you disappointed.<br/><br/>At least, it didn't to me. 9/10."

This film is a refreshing and enjoyable exception. The cast is picked masterfully and plays great together. Strong performances from Matt Damon and Franka Potente leave you breathless. What I was on a look out for is a shallow dialogue, thinking the movie will focus primarily on action scenes and chase sequences. I was pleasantly surprised by the delicate balance of both. You do have moments where you wonder if the script could have been improved a little bit, because of the improbability of events (I am talking about the obvious stupidity of certain agents that chase Jason and gaps and holes in CIA surveillance in general). You have numerous questions and concerns as to could that really have happened, but once you get over that little obstacle, be prepared to be entertained. Go watch the DVD, you won't regret it."

"compi24","9","2","2","14 August 2011"," Review of ""The Bourne Identity""
","""The Bourne Identity"" is a 2002 film directed by Doug Limon and starring Matt Damon. The film follows the story of Jason Bourne (Damon), an amnesiac desperately attempting to discover more about his true identity while simultaneously embedding himself in a convoluted conspiracy involving the CIA. Now, when I had first heard ""The Bourne Identity""'s fairly original and intriguing premise, I was already expecting this movie to be great. Did it disappoint? No. No, it did not. This is one of those movie's that just cannot fail - it has a rock solid story crafted by one of the most intelligent authors of our time, a brilliant screenplay written by one of Hollywood's most sought after screenwriters, and an intensely entertaining lead performance. ""The Bourne Identity"" and it's sequels are often credited with setting the par for most spy thrillers of the past decade - Does it deserve that credit? I believe so, for I have seen a multitude of films with similar concepts that have come out since ""The Bourne Identity""'s release. However, most, if not all, of the movies that have tried to replicate what The ""Bourne"" movie's have done, cannot reach the level of intrigue that each of the ""Bourne"" movies have reached - and they promptly fall flat in comparison. That being said, everything about this film, beit it's fighting sequences, it's car chase, or it's intense cinematography has made an impact on the spy thriller genre, and the modern film industry, as a whole. All in all, I felt that ""The Bourne Identity"" was an intensely entertaining thriller with a large amount of intelligence clearly woven it."

""The Bourne Identity"" is a decent action flick, with lots of high-speed chases and hand-to-hand combat scenes; Matt Damon is very believable and natural as the title character, and Franka Potente as his love interest shows why she could be regarded as the modern cinema's overlooked gem. Chris Cooper also shines as the bad guy, although he is unlucky to share many scenes with the late Brian Cox, and Cox always had the ability to steal the scene whenever he appears on screen, and this movie is no exception. A good action flick. 8/10"

","What makes an action movie good? Is it the special effects? The explosions? The exotic women? The fancy gadgets? <br/><br/>The Bourne series puts these questions to the test. There are almost no special effects in this movie. There are no explosions in this movie. There are no particularly 'sexy' women in this movie. There are no gadgets in the movie. On the contrary, the computers used by the CIA look like computers that were around in 2004. But I would like to put it out there that ""The Bourne Identity"" is one of the best spy-thrillers ever released.<br/><br/>The Bourne series is really a blatant winning movie. It's gripping, it's confusing just to the perfect level where the audience has to keep watching to understand the plot. At the end of the movie, we want to know who this man we've come to know as Jason Bourne is.<br/><br/>I think we as an audience should challenge ourselves to challenge Hollywood to make more movies like this. Movies that don't rely on that ""WOAH!"" factor. Movies that can make it, and be great movies, without sex, gore and violence.<br/><br/>For you action junkies out there, don't let this review fool you. There is still action in this movie. The multiple fight scenes, while not filling the movie, are interesting and faced-paced. I firmly recommend this as a must-see movie and a must-see series for anyone who enjoys action movies."

","Those of you who have ever read any of the great novels written by Robert Ludlum, know he is a superb writer. Having read the book which is the basis for ""The Bourne Identity "" I found that director Doug Liman did not adhere very closely to the book. Instead he allowed the main character to float to the top of his demise, like a dangerous water Mine and allowed the ticking to get louder as the movie progresses. Our hero is found floating in the waters off the coast of Marseilles, dead to the world. Yet, within weeks, Jason Bourne is out to learn, what is that ringing in his head? What was he doing before he was shot, but most important of all who is he? The film begins with a watery mystery, followed by a trail of bread crumbs which then explodes with a high powered surge of pure Adrenalin. Action scenes follows Bourne wherever he goes and so too, his adversaries who are just as lethal as he is. Excitement awaits movie audiences as our hero encounters both the heavies as well as his fellow Treadstone agents. False identities are as plentiful as the bullets which try to kill him, but for any Ludlum fan, what awaits us at the end of the film, is usually not what we expect, for that we need to read the book. Exceptional acting by the fine cast and a great way to spend an evening with Matt Damon. ****"

","**Again last paragraph for serious review**<br/><br/>From France, to Switzerland and the Czech Republic. ""The Bourne Identity"", does a wonderful job of using the scenery in creating dynamic, eye popping action. This is definitely one end of the spectrum in action movies. The other end of the spectrum would be around negative 65 and with that number would be the new release of the hit action movie ""Unknown"".<br/><br/>This is mainly because Unknown is in Berlin and as eventful an action movie as watching an American women's basketball game. However, Bourne is a masterpiece in which I enjoyed the entire movie. Where as in Unknown I enjoyed booing the last scenes and applauding the end credits.<br/><br/>Well its about time to fix my roof, because of those damn kiwi birds keep crapping and clogging my gutters, so lets get to the endpoint of my movie summary.

","This is one of these films that I always catch up with later post the hype, but totally enjoyable. The European locations totally work for me, and the public in general, 'Ludlum' knew that Europe provides the most cultural and evocative of settings. The slightly less credible Amnesiac was apparently born of the writers Vietnam experiences, so perhaps is more of a reference to PTSD,but he does not linger on it. Above all else Ludlum was an entertainer, and this shows in the plot development, sneaky CIA type organisations, departments of dirty tricks, and enigmatic assassins, which are plentiful. Along with excellent car chases and sophisticated weaponry. This is part of a very well made spy trilogy, and must be applauded; especially when you consider these films as a good substitute for the presently awful 'Daniel Craig' Bond Fayre. And like Bond you are tempted to rush out and buy Jasons 'Tag Heuer',and spruce up that old Mini of yours!. An American in Europe?, absolutely, and totally enjoyable."
"TonyHurtado","10","2","2","5 December 2010"," The Bourne Identity, my favorite film of all time.
","As you can tell I am a huge fan of The Bourne series because of the fact that Matt Damon is my favorite actor and that I own the movies on DVD and Blu Ray, now on with the review. Allot of people thought at first that this was going to be a rip off of James Bond but they were sadly mistaken. It turned out to be one of the greatest films of 2002. It was rated #8 out of the Top 10 films of 2002. This was a great movie, to say the least every opportunity was taken which made it very successful. I say that this film made Matt Damon's career, not to say he didn't have great movies before that, but this movie was his best in my eyes. Him playing the character Jason Bourne made his career.<br/><br/>The story was brilliant too because it had not been used so far in any other movie that I know of. I am not going to spoil the movie but I will just give a little summary. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is highly trained spy who loses his memory, but just because his memory is lost doesn't mean the agency that hired him forgot about him. So he is put through many obstacles because his agency tries to terminate him because of a failed mission. This movie is filled with action and adventure, it also had a great cast. Besides Matt Damon they had Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the entire film would have to be The Mini Cooper chase. I thought it was well edited and well directed by Doug Liman. The action was perfect in this scene, when I was younger I would constantly watch that scene, I would fast forward all the way to that scene and just watch that scene. It completely obvious how many stars I give this film and that would be 10 out of 10 stars."

These are words you seem to find on just about every movie-case these days but in this case, you can believe them. It had me fully enthralled from start to finish. The tempo seemed to ebb and flow from full-out action to dramatic character interaction and development flawlessly. The car-chase and hand-to-hand fighting scenes might be the best ever put to film and Matt Damon, who has sounded like he's trying a little too hard in some of his other efforts, is 100% believable. Everything about this movie draws you in and forces you to want more.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it's only a 7.7 in the eyes of the IMDb world but in my opinion, it's worth much more. Easily a 9. This is what action movies should aspire to.<br/><br/>But that's just my two scents. ;)"
"starlit-sky","10","2","2","7 September 2010"," My name is Bourne, Jason Bourne
","The Bourne Identity is the first movie of a very successful trilogy. The movie begins with a body floating in water off the coast of France, pulled into a boat. Soon we learn he is not an ordinary person. There is something mysterious about him. He is suffering from memory loss and doesn't remember anything about his own identity. On top of that, there are dark characters lurking at every corner that are chasing after him. As the story unfolds, we get to find out more about him but there is still a good amount of unknown facts that maintain the suspense and mystery. This is a very well-made movie with a very well written screenplay, amazing action scenes (the car chase scene is just amazing) that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end. Jason Bourne, like James Bond, is a spy and this is a spy movie but in many ways there are major differences which make The Bourne Identity quiet special. Most James Bond movies are one-dimensional in the sense that James Bond is the good guy and everybody he is eliminating are the bad guys. Jason Bourne, on the other hand, is multi-dimensional because he is constantly re-defining himself (and that goes throughout the entire trilogy) and the movie is not really drawing a clear picture if he is the bad guy or the good guy. This ambiguity is possible due to his amnesiac condition. For all we know, he may have been a bad guy before his accident but now he is defining himself with his current actions. This ambiguity creates a mystery around him. And the mystery is thickened through the identity of the people who are trying to eliminate him, mainly Conklin (Chris Cooper) who is running the Treadstone project (more about Treadstone in later movies). The conflict between Jason Bourne and Conklin, and Bourne's turning against the people who gave him the assignment adds a whole another dimension to the movie which is not seen in James Bond movies. I must say that The Bourne Identity is probably the best movie of its kind. It doesn't fall into known clichés, unrealistic action scenes, explosions, hero doesn't display any super powers, no special effects, no silly plot twists and turns or plot holes, all of which we are accustomed to see in average Hollywood production. Highly recommended."
"neil-476","8","2","2","21 August 2010"," Excellent spy thriller
","The strength of The Bourne Identity is that the audience is in exactly the same position as Matt Damon's Jason Bourne throughout the movie - in complete ignorance as to exactly who Bourne is, but quietly desperate to find out. We, however, are given more information than he is, because we are given occasional glimpses into the operations of the shadowy organisation for which Bourne works, in the persons of Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Styles.<br/><br/>This film powers along, delivering exposition, paranoia, action and excitement for its entire running length. Matt Damn is an excellent lead: he has a powerful physical presence in the action sequences, but he also conveys the low key distress of someone who is disturbed at discovering what he is capable of. Franka Potente is a believable companion, sucked into circumstances beyond her comprehension.<br/><br/>The script is good, making a simple story into something highly textured, and the film as a whole is two hours of gripping fast-paced entertainment, a cut above the usual standard for this type of movie."

","REVIEWBOT Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a man of mystery; he is found floating adrift in the ocean at the start of the movie with no memories and no identity. All he has to go on are two bullet wounds in his back and an implanted device which displays a Swiss bank account number. I have something not unlike this, so needless to say I was already intrigued. He soon discovers he has a knack for beating people up and escaping tricky situations as different CIA agents are trying to kill him. Along his way he hitches a ride with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who gets caught up in the chase and helps Bourne try to rediscover his unknown past.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is a sleek film with an array of interesting locations throughout Europe to keep you entertained. The action sequences are fast paced, with plenty of interesting fight scenes and car chases without reliance on hefty special effects. It has often been compared with James Bond, however I find this irrelevant. Bourne is a grittier action hero, and not dissimilar to a robot which I find pleasing Matt Damon portrays the character well; a man obviously trained to kill, but with a sense of vulnerability. Franka Potente as the quirky Marie has good chemistry with Damon and also puts in a good performance.<br/><br/>Overall this is an action packed movie, and a worthy contender for your DVD collection!

","Looking back now, ""The Bourne Identity"" is an alluring string of pearls i can watch once a year w/o getting bored, which is no mean feat for a flick. <br/><br/>In 2002, i joyfully assumed that any sequel would keep the level of excellency, but ""Bourne"" II and III are pitiful hells of devaluing ""Puke-Evoking Rapid Cuts Only Sedated Oafs May Acclaim"", which abbreviates PERCOSOMA: a popular but rather quirky cinematic infestation with the potential to ruin any otherwise watchable film. The trivia of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" proudly states, that ""The average length of a shot is 1.9 seconds."". Overdose of Percosoma. But ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" even tops it by the numbers. <br/><br/>Anyway, I seriously wonder why this new-millennium classic is not among the IMDb top 100. With ""Memento"" rightfully ranking 29, and the last and IMHO worst of the trilogy, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" on 154 (by today's date), this chart certainly suffers from it's own peculiar sort of mental flaw.<br/><br/>All this must be Langley again, trying to alter the public's view on the Bourne case :)"

","This is based on the Extended Explosive Edition DVD release. I have not read the novel myself(so I cannot make many comparisons, nor comment on the quality of either as a different version of the same tale), but I know enough about it to realize that a lot of it was abandoned when making this. If you want a retelling that stays closer to the book, watch the 1988 mini-series. With that out of the way, this is a very smart, highly realistic and entertaining spy film, not to mention one of the best of them. Mainstream audiences will be able to follow it and piece it together, and the well-written plot is not overly convoluted. The pacing is marvelous, this is never boring, and it lets you breathe. Acting is strong and convincing, Damon captures the expert knowledge, and the vulnerable nature, of the role, and has us believing in both aspects. The characters are well-written and credible. This is well-told, concise without requiring a second viewing to understand it. The dialog is well-written and delivered impeccably. The hand-to-hand fighting is awesome, the shootouts are cool, and this is frankly exciting throughout. The sequences are fresh and unpredictable. It's fast, intense, engaging, well-choreographed and stylish without being excessively so. There is good suspense in this. It keeps you interested throughout. There are few clichés in this. This has a little strong language, and mild violence. The disc comes with several concise featurettes covering the vital areas, the music video for Moby's Extreme Ways, a Van Helsing theatrical trailer, a few deleted scenes and the ""bookends"", an alternate opening and ending, with introductory interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who were involved in making the movie, CIA flicks and/or story-driven action-thrillers. 8/10"

First of all, there is that interesting plot about his past which now seems to forgotten, and for some reason he is wanted dead, however, with intense action and thrill moments, he makes it out alive (- how original)...<br/><br/>The good points about this movie is that it was well executed, good plot and scripts overall, with quite some intensive action moments. The soundtracks also went quite well with the movie :) Some of the points which I did not like include the fact that his past is not quite well evolved with various 'holes' about his past remaining unfilled. However, you can get a good idea of what is going on. One more thing about the ending is that it seems that he was left to live 'scotch-free' for no apparent reason in the end... One more thing is that how could such a trained professional fail to achieve his mission just because... because he's seen kids? Well, that is not really a reason for a professional to fail, and if he failed, why is he wanted dead so badly? Otherwise I have quite enjoyed the movie and am glad that such a story is set on a trilogy, rather than just one movie.

Matt Damon is terrific as Bourne and he proves himself to be a talented actor especially in the action/fight sequences.

The action sequences are intense and somewhat realistic others not so much but that's okay. The chases between mostly Bourne and people are him are also well executed. There is some suspense and a little romance for the women which balances well between the action. Despite some flaws overall The Bourne Identity was much better than expected.

He is found by French fishermen and he goes on a quest to discover his identity. His bosses at the CIA believed he had died and thought his mission was a failure. They were are shocked to see he shows up in Zurich and they try to hunt Bourne down. Bourne is shocked to see he has a number of passports, thousands of dollars in cash, and a gun in a Swiss bank security box. He discovery he has a nack for language, fluent in German and French, physically fit and can fight without even thinking. He acts like a spy without him knowing it, also checking for exits and threats. In Switzerland he befriends a gypsy, Marie (Franka Potente), he takes him to Paris where he lived. There the hunt hots up, with local police and CIA top agents after them. They have to hide and work together to solve the mystery.<br/><br/>They are a lot of positives in this film. It has an excellent cast, it's Matt Damon's first blockbuster and he is good as the spy who is both cold and emotion and also one high alert. Their is Franka Potente, a very good actress and is a woman caught in the middle of this chase. Chris Cooper is good as the villain, and there are other excellent supporting actors, Brain Cox, Clive Owen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Julia Stiles. The Bourne Identity is the director's (Doug Liman) first blockbuster and he shows he is a excellent action director. There also some excellent action scene, such as the car chase in the mini with Ready, Steady, Go as the backing song, to the fight scenes to the final fight. Also, he doesn't use shaky cam like Paul Greengrass did in the sequels. It also a part of the trend that X-Men started out, getting an indie director to direct action film and bring strong story to a film. There is a fantastic script by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron. They wrote a very intelligence, thoughtful script that makes you thing. There are themes of memory, nature vs. nurture, the all seeing eye of the CIA and their willingness to be ruthless. It is also unusual for a blockbuster because it makes out that the Americans (or at least the CIA) as the bad guys. It has a left-wing political stance which Greengrass continues.<br/><br/>It's an excellent film and needs multipal viewings to truly understand it."
"zardoz-13","8","2","2","21 March 2009"," Natural ""Bourne"" Killers!
","The Matt Damon international spy thriller ""The Bourne Identity"" qualifies as an entertaining, European-lensed, cloak & dagger epic that relies on hair-raising heroics rather than in-depth characterization. Based ostensibly on the 1980 bestseller by bestselling author Robert Ludlum, this spirited but spartan saga about an amnesia-ailing C.I.A. assassin left for dead in the stormy Mediterranean Sea on a dark night after he takes two bullets in the back amounts to a surprise and a guilty pleasure from journeyman director Doug Liman of ""Swingers"" and ""Go."" Little did Liman know when he made ""The Bourne Identity"" that he would exert an impact on the most famous espionage franchise in the world, the James Bond series, and that Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli would alter 007 so that he resembled Jason Bourne more than Ian Fleming's protagonist. The deja-vu, derring-do screenplay by veteran Hollywood hack Tony Gilroy of ""Duplicity"" and ""Proof of Life"" and newcomer William Blake Herron delivers everything that fans of spy thriller treasure most: a laconic but likable hero, a nasty nemesis, a harrowing car chase, snappy bone-crackling martial arts fights, and gritty gunfights galore. Indeed, despite its far-fetched plot, most of ""The Bourne Identity"" looks as realistic as most Hollywood movies allow themselves to be.<br/><br/>The film unfolds as the crew of a small Italian fishing vessel bound for Marseille pulls an unconscious man in a scuba suit out of the sea. Not only does the ship's captain does two slugs out of our anonymous protagonist, but he also removes a capsule from his hip which contains an encoded Swiss bank account. Eventually, this rugged survivor (Matt Damon of ""Dogma"") recuperates, and he remembers neither his identity nor his past. Off he heads to Zurich where he finds a safe deposit box stuffed with dozens of passports, wads of cash, and an automatic pistol. No sooner has he set foot outside the bank than an informant alerts the C.I.A. in Langley, Virginia,. Bourne's ruthless, amoral C.I.A. superior Ted Cronklin (Chris Cooper of ""Money Train"") has dispatched him to assassinate a South African politician, but Bourne vanished without a trace. Now, Cronklin sends out more heavily-armed assassin and snarls: ""I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown!"" Back in Zurich, Bourne eludes the authorities, bribes a young Swiss woman, innocent bystander Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente of ""Run, Lola, Run""), to drive him to Paris, France. As Marie and he are getting acquainted, a hit man interrupts their romance and riddles everything in sight. Suddenly, Bourne finds himself fighting for his life with martial arts skills that he never knew he possessed. An inventive, off-beat, evasive auto chase that careens through packed Parisian streets, sidewalks, and stairways ranks as the liveliest since John Glen's ""For Your Eyes Only,"" with our leads crammed into a vehicle the size of an apple cart with hordes of cops on their heels.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman paces the action for maximum suspense and keeps our resilient hero on his toes throughout this whirlwind thriller. Although ""The Bourne Identity"" winds up just as predictable and preposterous as any scenic James Bond spectacle, this lean, mean, PG-13-rated opus is nevertheless a resourceful and ingenious potboiler worth watching at least twice. Moreover, Matt Damon proves that eh can make the grade as a tough-as-nails action-hero, more so than his ill-fated Oscar winning ""Good Will Hunting"" co-scenarist Ben Affleck who whined his way through the woebegone ""Sum of All Fears."" The scene where the assassin shatters the window to enter the premises and surprise Bourne is a jolt to the system. Liman co-produced the two sequels that followed. A top-flight supporting cast is fleshed out my Brian Cox and Clive Owen."

","Jason Bourne (Damon) is suffering from amnesia. He finds a bullet in his back with a bank code and sets on a journey to find his identity.<br/><br/>When you see a body lying in the middle of the sea, completely motionless you know you're in for something special. This opening shot uses a great mix of colour and direction, with a sweet silence to create a sombre mood that will instantly engross you.<br/><br/>Matt Damon (The Departed) is Jason Bourne, the man lying in the middle of the sea. As a boat picks Bourne up we feel his memory loss and what follows is a flowing narrative filled with an intensity and interest.<br/><br/>Damon's depiction of Robert Ludlum's character is wonderful. Silent and professional, everything that was intended.<br/><br/>There have been many debates over Bourne and Bond. The British franchise is light hearted, has gadgets and has an overwhelming use of action encoded. Bourne however is more serious, professional and realistic. This first instalment of the series for example has realism down to the ground. There are consequences to actions, there isn't much action and there are no clichés. Not to mention this 2002 hit climaxes with so many unanswered questions you will be ripping The Bourne Supremacy out of its case without a second thought. Recent Bonds Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace have been compared to the Bourne series as they are darker and more serious, but these 3 films are much more sophisticated than Bond will ever be.<br/><br/>This is by far more realistic than any Bond. Though the Bond films are funnier and have cool gadgets, the Bourne's have more realism, carefully choosing the action sequences and giving a highly intriguing portrayal of the American government and CIA.<br/><br/>The narrative is consistent and justifies the genre beautifully. The film dives into genres of mystery, crime, thriller and drama, giving a wide perspective of realism of its own.<br/><br/>The whole concept of finding his true identity invites viewers into the narrative and will leave you shocked come the chilling end. The dealings with the police fall into the crime area, and the dramatic turn of events involving beautifully directed memory flashbacks give this film a high dramatic turn.<br/><br/>The music score is wonderful. Playing softly in the background it gives the film a strong intensity feeling and Moby's Extreme Ways finishes the film off beautifully"
"Tweekums","9","2","2","24 November 2008"," What a spy thriller should be
","This film is exciting from the start where a man who has lost his memory is pulled from the Mediterranean until the end where he confronts his erstwhile employers.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an assassin with amnesia who must piece together who he is from the contents of a safety deposit box in a Swiss bank. Unfortunately for him he is spotted and his CIA bosses assume something is wrong with him and attempt to arrest him when he visits the US consulate. He escapes and pays a German girl (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. They realise just how much danger they are in when an assassin attacks them in Bourne's apartment. From then on he must play cat and mouse with the CIA and the French police until he can finally identify and confront his former employers at the end.<br/><br/>The acting is solid throughout, both from the two main characters and from secondary characters, especially Clive Owen in a small roll as another assassin sent after Borne. It is also nice to have a leading lady who, while pretty, isn't an exotic, unrealistic beauty like we tend to get in another spy franchise. The action never really lets up, we have plenty of fights and an exciting car chase where Bourne must evade the Paris Police while driving a clapped out old Mini. If you enjoy spy thrillers I'd certainly recommend this as well as the other two films in the trilogy. It is good to see that a really exciting film doesn't need to resort the excessive swearing or violence which would have taken it above the 12 certificate."
"Sanou_san","10","2","2","30 October 2008"," A nice clean beginning
","Bourne Identity has got to be one of the most excitingly gripping movies I've ever seen. Though I've never been a top fan of extremely plain action movies, this one has got to be an exception. Bourne Identity as played by a rising brilliant actor Matt Damon, who played Jason Bourne, an extremely trained assassin, whose affiliation is a clandestine even among CIA offices. The story begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon of course) whom he abandoned a mission due to unexpected psychological disturbances in his brain, however his desertion lead to his life's danger, as his target manage to kill him instead, but he narrowly escaped. As the story progresses, we learn how Jason came into being and went to search for pieces of his past. Those who manage Treadstone (a secret operative section of CIA where Jason Bourne belongs) manage to track him down for two slightly unsure reasons: one to hold him custody and bring him into questioning about his failure to complete his recent mission, or second to eliminate him because of the threat he brought, which was tantamount to their suspicion of Bourne betraying them for he recently abandoned a mission.<br/><br/>I must admit that this movie is one decent project, and I never expect Matt Damon to excel very well and appear to perfectly fit the character of Jason Bourne. Superb certainly, for his uncanny character makes the story successful and effectively eye-catching for action-connoisseur viewers. This indeed deserve a neat sequel."

","Jason Bourne movies really represents the action movie of this decade, great character and plot lines.<br/><br/>I hope they can keep making it, and put out a new Bourne Movie every 2 years. I believe this movie about espionage is as real as it gets. The incorporation of technological advancements, clear truthful character personality, the movie is really great.<br/><br/>To think of it, Bourne is not like Bond, who is always invincible, surrounded by girls. The only inconsistent plot is about Marie, who died and disappeared from the series so suddenly, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movies. <br/><br/>All in all, Bourne is the only movie that I really enjoyed, and bought DVDs, of the past 3 years."

In the movie , we can spot similarities with Bond movies and the other like The Heat , Collateral , except that Bourne has perhaps introduced the genre of almost completely real storyline and fast-paced , non-stop action set in European capitals ( here Paris ) ; the main idea is to discover the identity of Bourne , who is in the beginning found floating in the sea . What follows is breath  taking action , claustrophobic chases , elements that are coming together slowly like in a jigsaw , and the final , nightmarish realization of one's life and mission ( 'You are nothing but a 30 million $ government property !

"winged_loner","9","2","2","10 July 2008"," What's missing in modern action films? Moral, Conscience, Character.
","I think 2002 was a year for great action films. Spider-Man, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and of course, The Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>It's one of the few action films in the last decade or so to really make you think. It's got twists. It's got turns. It's got Matt Damon. What it doesn't have is a shaky camera.<br/><br/>Now, bare with me. I'm saying that in a more scornful tone than you might imagine. A lot of people don't like Supremacy or Ultimatum because of the shaky camera work. I, however, like to down Identity for NOT having shaky camera work. Why? There are several reasons.<br/><br/>First, The Bourne series is one that should make you think while having your heart pounding to near-explosion at the same time. It should push both of your most valuable organs to boiling-point. Without a camera that moves around as if you were struggling to run just like the characters, I doubt your heart will race very far.<br/><br/>Second, Bourne is like an animal. He moves on instinct alone, because that's all he was left with. Now, I don't know about you, but the normal camera work in Identity makes the film and the character seem too... tame. Too solitary, despite the violence. A camera can change more than most people realize in a film.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the shaky cam is definitive of the Bourne series, at least in the last two. Every action series has something another doesn't. And what the Bourne series has is A) an excellent storyline, B) realistic character development, C) believable government action, and D) shaky camera work.<br/><br/>So in that, I find that Identity is just too tame to really capture the true Bourne. In other words, the Identity is lost until it is found in Supremacy. It feels just like 'The Italian Job' with the 'tame' camera. Maybe it's because Bourne is still a white-knight good guy in this one. He wants to be tame.<br/><br/>Otherwise, The Bourne Identity is the fantastic beginning to an excellent and enthralling trilogy. It's got the best romance story in any of them, and quite possibly the most believable characters in any action film. I'm glad the helm was passed to Paul Greengrass from Doug Liman, who went on to do decent work with 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and 'Jumper'.<br/><br/>It's fantastic, and that ending song, 'Extreme ways' by Moby is just too damn catchy to miss."

There's not too much action but there's enough to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. After you plug the DVD in you DVD player you'll not stop till it's over. Matt Damon was in a lot of great movies starting off with The Departed which was great experience too. All in all if you don't have this movie, get it. It is definitely worth watching over and over.

","I enjoyed this. It had been one of those movies I had heard about but had never gotten around to. There are times when it seems that Matt Damon is such a cold fish (ala The Good Shepherd), that one has trouble getting connected to him. In this film he is really believable as a man who has all the training of a killing machine, but a soft side that bears exploring. The character is put into situations he can't understand but can only react to. He has compassion but little understanding. What an interesting role. If there's a shortcoming, it's that the motivations of the bad folks aren't all that clear. It's still a delight to watch his relationship with his I-only- need-a-ride partner develop. There is a level of subtlety that most films of this type don't have. The car chases are spectacular but, for once, they backed down on the pyrotechnics. I appreciated this."
"dead47548","9","2","2","9 January 2008"," A revolution for the espionage thriller.
","It really takes the espionage thriller to a new, and much superior level. Instead of ridiculously over the top action with whatever the highest form of special effects are available at the time, Bourne is very low-key with natural and realistic action, and no visual effects. That's one of the main reasons why I love it so much. It feels authentic. Sure the backplot is a little far-fetched, but the way everything plays out from it is so natural and realistic that I'm just blown away. Damon is brilliant, as usual, and plays the most convincing amnesiac I've ever seen on film (eat it Memento fanboys). Franka Potente is gorgeous and also very natural. Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are easily two of the best and possibly the two most commanding actors working right now, and putting them together on screen was just an explosion waiting to happen. The casting of this film was brilliant. The car chase is possibly the greatest of all time (only Supremacy's can top it) and I always admire the use of Paul Oakenfold's ""Ready, Steady, Go"" in a film, although Collateral did use it better. My only big complaint about the film is the complete change in the story from the novel, although I do understand why it was done. They had to translate the Cold War era of the novel to modern times, and it loses a lot of it's details in the process but they replaced them nice and neatly. They keep the central plot the same, just change around a bulk of the details. If you hadn't read the novels, you wouldn't notice the flaw at all and think that it was very properly handled. Very entertaining and very authentic. One of the best films of the weak 2002 for sure."

","Thank you Doug Liman for making the movie and thank you Matt Damon for this flawless action.<br/><br/>I read critics that hate the movie and their main point of criticism is that movie does not follow the original novels' story. I have not read the book and therefore I really happy with the movie.<br/><br/>I understand who read and loved the book, they normally expect the movie to ""be"" like the book. But obviously director and Damon has chanced things (I mention Damon because he took part in fighting with the studio when they wanted the cut some of the scenes, but the director and Damon insisted keeping this scenes (farmhouse scenes) so, both the director and Damon believed in the movie.) And those changes created a easy to follow, always keeping your attention up movie but it also gives the plot and it's messages so clear.<br/><br/>I always like American movies that are shot in Europe, the director used very nice views of roads, buildings, streets and so on, movie flows like a nice stream and it's logic never fails.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is brilliant as always, he's playing his role in great confidence, fight scenes are very real, chase scene was nice and it reminds ""Italian Job"" in a smart way.<br/><br/>So, as a whole this movie is really good, sequels proofed to be better though."

","One of the best thrillers ever made, it has the reflective quality of Le Carre's earlier post-war spy flicks like The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and the TV dramas with George Smiley but with plenty of shoot-em-ups and car chases. The down-beat mini trashing the massed cops of Paris is so much more impressive than Bond with all his gadgetry pulling the same stunt. Great set-pieces but the best of all is the body surfing down the stair-well. Unbelievable. Matt Damon has a brooding presence which fits in well with the storyline and Franka Potente makes a sexy and believable sidekick and I'm glad they got together in the end, leaving a suitably open ending for the sequel. The story neatly turns the usual spy shtick on it's head with the bad guys as his own side. We all know now how true that is now. Should have been called, He Doesn't Know He's Bourne, but I'd go a million miles for a lousy pun."

"cybersupam","9","2","2","6 November 2007"," This is where a Bourne is born
","Much has been said about this 1st series of Bourne trilogy, where I am also now a participant. The Bourne Identity is the story of an ex-CIA assassin turned amnesiac who failed in his mission and shot up with two bullets. When he was treated by a doctor in the ship, he recovered from his unconsciousness but with a problem of amnesia as he completely forgot his own every identity. Then here is the beginning of his travel from one city to another for recovering his identity. He starts from Zurich then Paris. Really this should be ranked among the top 50 suspense-thriller movies of the present Decade of Behavior (from 2000-2010), due to its non-stop serious plot, actions and character roles. I personally did not notice any similarities with James Bond's movies as both are made in their own ways, except that both these are spy thriller. But many differences are there like this Bourne is much based on reality and innocence, while Bond possesses many special powers and orders from the head. He meets many new girls in new places. Surprisingly both their names are with J and B (James Bond and Jason Bourne). Matt Damon's portrayal as Jason Bourne is simply superb, and he perfectly matched with Robert Ludlum's evergreen character. His childish cute look with serious expressions pulled the audiences into better prospects. <br/><br/>It was in 1996, when I noticed one of my school teachers borrowed a book of the Bourne series from a public library. I was innocent then about novels and stories except comics. Who could imagine that one day I would be one of this Bourne's fans? The movie has no much nonsense romance and love scenes, which were also only in need to clarify Bourne's identity. Yeah, Franka Potente must be appreciated for her newly presence in American Hollywood community and perhaps this made the movie more acceptable to the audiences. She looks matured and normal in her role, and ignites the proceeding of the story. Julia Stiles as a CIA operative agent in Paris also satisfies with her side and significant role. Casting on the lead actors was an excellent work of Doug Liman. I found the most turning on dialogue was from Conklin when he says to Bourne-""I send you because you don't exist"". This sentence thrills on the importance and the quality of a spy assassin Jason Bourne. Along these, Clive Owen's short but interesting presence also need to be mentioned. He clearly proved that he is fit for James Bond."
"moviemaniac008","10","2","2","7 October 2007"," An Amazing start to an Amazing series!
","I wasn't very familiar with the Jason Bourne novels, and so I pretty stayed far away from the Bourne movies. However, when one of my friends saw The Bourne Ultimatum, he highly suggested it to me. So one day, a TV channel played The Bourne Identity (1st in the series). I watched it, and it was loads of excitement and fun. Story: Jason Bourne is the CIA's assassin, and on a mission, he gets shot and, when he is woken, doesn't remember a thing. But as he starts to befriend a young woman (Marie), things get serious. Really serious, especially when the CIA want his death. This is Jason Bourne's fight: for his life- and his identity.<br/><br/>Overall, nice special effects, interesting story and characters who you easily get attracted to. I actually find that the Bourne Identity could actually be an amazing start to an amazing series. The end of the film kept the suspense for the rest of the series (I will not tell the ending in order to not show any spoilers). It is a great film that actually intrigues me into reading the novels starring the one, the only, Jason Bourne. I shall soon go buy the DVD's and wait before The Bourne Ultimatum comes out on DVD because it doesn't play any more at the nearest theater. So, good film, nice special effects and amazing everything.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Get to the nearest book store or video store and rent- even better- buy The Bourne Identity and Bourne Supermacy both in novels and movies."

","The Bourne Identity in many ways revolutionized the expectations of people that love spy films. How is it different from the run-of-the-mill action films? I don't think you'll find another action film, let alone action series that is as story driven as The Bourne films and in particular The Bourne Identity. A mystery begins to unfold right from the first scene and you're caught up in this world of Jason Bourne and you're discovering everything as he is discovering everything making you feel like you're right there with him and feeling empathy for his character while being shocked and riveted by his realization of what he is. The Bourne Identity is exotic and brilliantly filmed in such incredible European locations as France, Spain, Czech Republic, and Italy and if you think that doesn't make a difference...watch The Bourne Identity because the locations are something that really makes The Bourne Identity what it is. Add all this espionage and action together and they still find time to establish a meaningful and very powerful romance between Bourne and a woman he randomly meets and it's a relationship so significant that it remains a driving force in Bourne's life right up through the trilogy.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has had some good roles, and has proved himself a very versatile actor but his role as Jason Bourne may stick with him forever because he does an incredible job capturing this cold blooded assassin with actual empathy and this strong, silent, deadly, and yet compassionate person. His performance is amazing and Bourne is movie history. Franka Potente plays the girl in the wrong place at the wrong time Marie Kreutz, who becomes romantically involved with Bourne. I don't find Potente beautiful in the typical Hollywood sense and in fact she's almost kind of plain compared to some starlets and yet that's what makes her and Damon have incredible chemistry and a very real romance together. She also blends in with her surroundings and has this very unique and exotic European look (she is German by heritage.) Chris Cooper is brilliant as the angry, and forceful C.I.A. villain Alexander Conklin who is desperate to get rid of Bourne before it uncovers his involvement with an undercover assassin project. Equally as brilliant is Brian Cox as Conklin's co-conspirator. Julia Stiles makes a small cameo entrance into the series as Logistics expert Nicky and although she doesn't have a big role, she becomes significant to the cast and is often tied to the series. Also watch for Clive Owen in a small role as assassin sent to kill Bourne in the English Country side.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity tells it's story and doesn't apologize for not being the typical blow everything up, non stop action type of film but it certainly has it's share of action and some incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Damon's Bourne is a far more brilliant hero and doesn't resort to simply using a gun but rather is always a step or two or five ahead of his foes and is so well trained it's just thrilling to watch him get out of every situation. When it comes down to it he can kick some serious ass and the fight scenes are incredible and his abilities are unparalleled making this just an incredible action, spy thriller with an intense story that starts a great mystery that spans three films. With each installment of The Bourne films they get better and better but this is where it all starts and it's a stone cold classic and a must see for anyone who thinks they know the spy genre because this revolutionized it. 8.5/10"

","(Note: I haven't read the book, so I have no idea how the film compares.)<br/><br/>**Minor Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>The ""Bourne Identity"", based on Robert Ludlum's best-selling novel, tells the story of Jason Bourne, a black-ops agent working off the map for the United States government. When a mission goes awry, Bourne (Matt Damon) is left with a blank memory. As he follows the clues to reclaim his...uh...identity, Bourne runs into trouble with the authorities and teams up with Maria (Franka Potente), a transient young woman in whom he finds his only friend. As the two race around Europe, Bourne slowly rediscovers himself, while his supervisors in the U.S. attempt to track him down.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Bourne Identity"" is ideal to use a classic narrative technique: placing the audience in the shoes of a character. A la ""The Matrix"", the protagonist here is completely ignorant. Therefore the world and story of the movie can be unfolded and explained without slowing the pace, because information new to the audience is also new to Bourne. When a second confused character (Maria) is introduced, that factor is doubled, permitting Bourne himself to introduce both parties to his knowledge of the espionage world. This method sucks the viewer into the story and creates a greater attachment than in a standard flick. <br/><br/>Adding to the attraction of the film is Matt Damon's everyman appeal. Damon has never been an action hero, nor does he look a stereotypical beefy action star, along the lines of Schwarzenegger. But in this case the casting is perfect, because Bourne himself is uncomfortable in his own body. Damon nails the part by maintaining a paranoid state of mind with perpetually moving eyes and nervous gestures. The German-born Potente is another casting coup, as her unique appearance is a breath of fresh air, eschewing cookie-cutter American beauty for an earthier, healthier doe-eyed look that is refreshingly effective. With a supporting cast completed by such reliables as Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Brian Cox, the movie's acting is scarcely noticeable, which creates a ""believable"" world of espionage.<br/><br/>That world is a paranoid world, one that director Doug Liman (""Swingers""), cinematographer Oliver Wood (""Die Hard 2""), and crew represent on screen very well. Wood utilizes constantly moving, often hand-held, cameras, and the editing team of Saar Kline (""The Thin Red Line"") & Christopher Rouse (""The Italian Job"") features jumpy, nervous editing, all of which brilliantly emulate Bourne's fragile yet kinetic mental state. <br/><br/>Speaking of ""The Italian Job"", that's a decent comparison for ""Bourne Identity"". Although the latter is edgier and more complex, both have a European feel, with Bourne's obviously stemming from the entirely European setting. The old-fashioned yet physically beautiful locations are complemented by a rhythmic soundtrack that never soars but frequently hangs and lingers as the story proceeds. <br/><br/>""Bourne Identity"" is classified as an action flick, but the action is decidedly different than that in other movies of the same genre. Containing very few special effects or CGI, the action centers on motion and pursuit, endowing the film with a edgier, more physical tone that is highlighted by a stellar car chase. Set in the middle of the movie, the sequence featuring a beat-up MG racing through the streets and alleys of Paris is the best cinematic chase since at least The Rock, if not long before that. The cat-and-mouse concept of the entire film is encapsulated in this quality set piece, which is more than just eye candy, serving also as a key turning point in the plot. <br/><br/>With surprisingly little face-to-face conflict present, scenes like this one must infuse the story with suspense, and that they do very well. While developmental parts are naturally but enjoyably slower, an underlying tension drives the entire story. Because it often spontaneously explodes to life early, that possibility persists throughout, moving it along like a people-mover, at a slow and steady pace that doesn't seem dangerous until something goes wrong. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Rarely does an action-based movie feature such a compelling story and human characters. 8 of 10 for one of the most underrated and best action movies in recent years."

","Having read the Book, I felt the Movie was going to be a serious let-down - it was just the opposite for me.  It was engrossing from the very start and held your interest the whole way through, and I cannot envisage missing the sequel ""The Bourne Supremacy"".   The scenery was spectacular at all locations while the performance of Matt Damon was really good - he was excellent in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and he followed that up extremely well here.  The supporting cast of all relative unknowns did first-class jobs.  This is a classic case of where it was better to see the Film after having read the Book.  I have just read some of the ""goofs"" printed about this Movie, which, in hindsight was a mistake as one tends to watch out for them, rather than enjoying the entertainment for what it is."

","At first when I glimpsed at this, I wasn't so sure about seeing Matt Damon in this kind of role.  But when I finally saw the film, I realized I was just paranoid as it's a very good action film that uses the european car chase formula and does it in a respectable fashion.  And there's a fight scene that was cleared for a PG-13 movie when it possibly passes for an R. I see how this even resembles The Italian Job in a sense but I am aware that this came out first - but anyway it's not like it's a bad thing. <br/><br/>
Matt Damon does surprisingly well in his fight scenes which are shot from many angles to take the burden off of the choreographer.

","Like others, I missed this in the theater. I have to say I'm glad I finally caught it. I had read the book once, in my early teens (1980-85?). Time takes its toll, so I only remembered the broad strokes of the book. Never did see the TV version, so I can't compare them.<br/><br/>I really did enjoy the movie as a whole. Damon did a good job with Bourne's confusion and sense of loss. He's no Anthony Hopkins, but he was effective. The action scenes were well done. The guy coming through the glass at Bourne's Paris place really surprised me. Good build up. The scene with Clive Owen gave both characters a little humanity to empathize with.<br/><br/>I do have to say the Bourne/Marie romance could have used a little more development, but oh well, it's an action flick, right? And Julia Stiles' character seemed very superfluous. I think they missed an opportunity for a good subplot, but maybe she'll show in the sequel. <br/><br/>All in all, I'd say a solid 4 out 5."

","The Bourne Identity is based on a Robert Ludlum book and manages to represent the essence of the story without being too literal, while also managing that rather more difficult task of being a good screen adaptation.<br/><br/>The emphasis here is on the action, the whole `Who am I' question only serves as a plot movement to kick-start some great sequences. It's not going to come as any shock to you that Mr Bourne is a CIA operative, or that he knows exactly how to take care of himself, or anyone unfortunate to get in his way.<br/><br/>The action scenes themselves are nothing new, yet they are handled with such skill by the director that you never feel like you've been here before.<br/><br/>Another of the films strong points is its performance from the main star, Matt Damon breaks very nicely from type and leaves you feeling that he very well could kill you with just his little finger. A good supporting cast also adds credibility with Franka Potente of Run, Lola Run fame and Chris Cooper who recently won an Oscar for best supporting actor in Adaptation.<br/><br/>If you're looking for some good solid spy action than look no further. The Bourne Identity Proves to be a very satisfying fare into familiar territory with good performances, great direction and a particularly good car chase through the streets of Paris."

","`The Bourne Identity' is a superb spy film. Gritty, realistic, suspenseful and surprisingly action-packed. `Bourne' is the kind of spy movie a Bond movie should be, but never is, at least in its entirety. Nearly as convoluted as `Spy Game,' (another great spy film) `Bourne' surpasses it, managing to remain both coherent AND interesting throughout. Lushly photographed,terrifically photographed and choreographed, superbly acted and beautifully scored, `Bourne' is a BIG success, in no small part, to Matt Damon.  Damon is incredibly convincing as an emotional automaton, who one minute oozes schoolboy looks and personal humanity, while in the next effortlessly kills or disables scores of adversaries.  During one such dispatching, Damon utilizes the most incredible stunt I've ever seen, and makes us believe he could do it. <br/><br/>The only improvement I could see could have been made to `Bourne' would be a little more explanation regarding the `Treadstone' programming.  What little explanation is provided gets lost in the action and suspense.  Otherwise, this movie is darn near perfect.<br/><br/>I can hardly wait to see Damon reprise this role. I just wonder what producers Kennedy/Marshall and director Doug Liman could do to match, much less top this. <br/><br/>I hope IMDB members who read my review enjoy this movie as much as I did."

I personally wish the story would have continued for at least another half-hour if not a full hour more. Matt Damon is much more believable than Richard Chamberlain; and Franka Potente completely outshines Jaclyn Smith.<br/><br/>Because of how spy dramas, suspense thrillers have evolved over the past several years, nowadays you're never quite sure whether or not our hero will survive. This allows for a heightened sense of suspense.<br/><br/>Doug Liman directed a great thriller which I will watch again and again, and I thank him for the lovely tour of Paris....the cinemaphotography was superb.<br/><br/>One minor disappointment was that there was not enough of Clive Owen who is a truly great actor and deserves more screen time."

","If you actually read the book by Robert Ludlum, enjoy it, then take a step back from it consider two things.<br/><br/>1) Thia book was written years ago, in 1980<br/><br/>2)Carlos Ilyich Ramirez, aka Carlos the Jackal - was still at large in 1980.  He is not now, as he was jailed by French Authorities, once again, many years ago.<br/><br/>You cannot take a theme that was resolved in real life and superimpose it into fiction and expect your audience to respect the work.  As Carlos was the central theme of all three books(The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum-all excellent by the way), it is both painfully obvious and decididly necessary to change the central theme of the film to reflect the secondary theme of the book, IE what National Secrets could this Rogue Agent/CIA Assasin impart to the wrong people/Government if coersed, bribed or whatever.<br/><br/>My opinion is aside from the obvious and necessary meandering from the Carlos angle, the film is a decent and effective attempt at bringing the thrust of Bournes struggle to find who and what he is, whilst avoiding shadowy hitmen at every juncture.<br/><br/>You simply cannot take a 500-600 page book written in 1980(as a techno/espionage thriller), leave it entirely intact and have it still appeal to a mass market.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with an open mind, as I usually do, and whilst I would have liked to see more depth to Clive Owens and the other assains characters, and more explaination behind the purpose of 'Treadstone 71', I feel this is still a movie to enjoy, so I recommend you give it a shot."

","When I first heard of this movie I thought it was just another action film. And when I heard it had Matt Damon in the lead, I thought the film producers had gone 'bonkers' to cast Matt Damon as an action hero. Besides, I never liked his acting. But, boy. Did my opinion change after watching this film. Matt Damon isn't only good, he's terrific as the former CIA assassin on the run from his boss. The movie too gives in a solid punch. What makes this movie really click is that it doesn't try to prove it is different from the regular action flicks. In fact, it shows that it is just that. It is its terrific execution which makes it worth watching over and over again. Doug Liman's perfect direction takes this film to great heights. And the action sequences are too be seen to be believed. They're just beautiful. Terrific. And the car chases are really awesome. The only really negative point in this film is Frank Potente as the Gypsy girl who gives Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) a ride to Paris and as you would expect become his love angle. She just isn't upto the mark. Infact, she looks like sleepwalking through the entire film. The strategy of casting a lesser known actress opposite Matt Damon wasn't bad but the director should have thought about casting a lesser known-good actress and not just the former. Opposite the extremely superb Matt Damon she looks like a drag. Another positive point in this movie is its cinematography. The lush locations of Paris and Switzerlnd have been captured beautifully. All in all, this is one action movie you won't want to miss. Terrific from start to finish. This is undoubtedly the action movie of the year."

","There aren't too many spy movies like this, in which the hero is not the James Bond type who's going to save the world from the ultimate super-villain.<br/><br/>Matt Damon portrays Jason Bourne (one of his many identities), a regular guy who lost his memory and is about to discover he's a genuine lethal weapon. He fights not to prevent the villain to take over the world, but to regain his memory, to find out his true identity and, in the process, change his previous way of life. All he has to do now is avoid the other agents trained like himself trying to eliminate him.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much. The addition of Franka Potente to it was a really nice plus. And seeing the whole story staged in Europe was a very nice change from L.A. and New York. But the main reason I liked it so much is Matt Damon's performance. He's one the rightful heirs of future Hollywood. He's shown that he can play any character convincingly, even when the role is a Van Damme type of character.<br/><br/>The action is good, the suspense is good, the chasings are good, the performances are good.

"jall1","9","2","2","18 June 2002"," Intelligent action thriller
","The Bourne Identity is an intelligent, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller. I don't think it's nearly as vacuous as some critics have indicated. The story behind the action isn't deep, but it is interesting and engaging, and it is complex enough to offer some real surprises and characters that are not what they seem. As for the action, it's some of the best I've seen a long time.  I like the hand-held camera work that gives a jumpy, tense feel to the action without making the audience seasick.<br/><br/>
Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is in many ways an anti-Bond, and his sidekick, Marie, played by the German actress Franka Potente, is an anti-Bond-Girl. Bourne, suffering from amnesia and trying to figure out who he is while protecting himself and Marie from assassins, is too busy for double entendres, and Marie always appears fully dressed. Instead of a classy Astin Martin with missiles and ejection seats, our heroes have a small red box on wheels. Instead of saving the world from a sinister plot while all the while remaining suave and sexy, they are nervously trying to save their lives in truly tense situations. Marie even unromantically vomits when she sees a dead woman. The romance between Bourne and Marie develops slowly and believably, and it is Marie that gets things going. ****minor spoiler: When they arrive at Bourne's Paris apartment, Marie gives Bourne a look that says, `I'd like to stay' (Wow, a movie with a character that can speak with good acting and expression rather than through obvious dialogue), and Bourne awkwardly invites her to come up to the apartment with him. When Marie says that maybe she should just leave because Bourne will forget her anyway, he responds by saying, `How can I forget you. You're the only person I know.' Aw, you can't get any more romantic than that.  End spoiler****<br/><br/>
The villains, including CIA bureaucrats and assassins, are realistic and creepy. The always good Chris Cooper and Clive Owen as `the Professor' do especially well. All of the characters, even the minor ones, are carefully portrayed, and it seemed to me that there was sympathy in the audience for all of the characters. This and other elements give the movie a realistic feel.  Director Doug Liman, who speaks French fluently, used only local crews while filming in Prague and Paris to help create a real European atmosphere. Real U.S. Marines play the soldiers that go after Bourne in the American Embassy. There are no gratuitous explosions that ring false or silly action sequences. There's only one explosion, and in that scene, Bourne uses it as a clever advantage over his opponent.  Some complain and nitpick about plot holes, but I think Identity is much more realistic throughout than Sum of All Fears is.<br/><br/>Watch for some fun details in the film. At the end, when two characters are having a conversation, look to the right of the screen over one of the character's left shoulder to see what has become of the red bag that is prominent throughout the film. And enjoy the great score by composer John Powell.<br/><br/>This is Matt Damon's first role as an action-thriller leading man, and he proves to be more than up to the task. While Jack Ryan is busy entangling himself in clichés, Jason Bourne is kicking some serious patootie.  If you're looking for a good thriller, skip Sum of all Fears and check out The Bourne Identity."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","2","2","15 July 2002"," The Bourne Identity is a taut psychological thriller that explores the genre from a variety of new standpoints, but doesn't quite manage to be as great as it could have and should have been.
","In one of the more anticipated thrillers released this year, Matt Damon takes on the role of a CIA assassin who has failed an assassination mission only to wake up and find himself on a strange fishing boat with no memory of who or where he is or how he even got there. It starts off under this immediately interesting premise, with Damon's character progressively educating himself about his identity through the gradual realization of his own ignorance to the true reality of who he is. The more he learns, the more he realizes that he doesn't know, as the saying goes. And we are more than willing to tag along and make all of these thrilling discoveries with him.<br/><br/>
The movie has a remarkable amount of strong points, but almost as many weak points. It grows a little frustrating after a while as we learn how much Marie is willing to put up with in order to stay with this guy. It's kind of important that she's there because, as he said in the most amusing line in the film, she's the only person he knows. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine that someone as good-looking as Franka Potente has been having such a hard time finding a boyfriend that she is willing to go through the car chases and gunfights and explosions that are involved with her new friend, who hasn't told her his name because he didn't even know it himself. And why did he pay her $20,000 for the ride to Paris? Did that serve any purpose in the film other than illustrating the massive amount of money that he has at his disposal?  <br/><br/>On the one hand, it's easy to see how weak the scriptwriting is when we consider the real logistics of Marie deciding to stay by Jason's side (if that IS his real name) through all of this mess, but on the other hand, we are willing to forgive things like that because the rest of the movie is so good. Some of the action scenes are a little extensive, but even most of those are forgivable. There is a scene, for example, where Bourne pushes a man's body off of a flight of stairs and over a drop of four or five stories, is able to concentrate enough to shoot a guy a couple of flights down, and then uses the body as a sort of cushion to break his fall. This is something that I've always wondered about (I can't remember why, but I've wondered why I haven't seen someone do this in an action movie before. Maybe now I know why). <br/><br/>Now, if Bourne is capable of doing half the things that we've seen him do in this movie, I'm more than willing to believe that he could pull something like this off, although the landing didn't look real at all. Now all I need is to see more people simply shooting the guy who's holding a gun to a hostage's head, demanding escape. I'm sick and tired of seeing cops put their guns down and let the bad guy go instead of just shooting him in the head when they had him in their crosshairs. I saw Charlie Sheen do it in Navy Seals, I just wish more action films would catch on and quit with the weak scripts. <br/><br/>Remember that scene in Snatch when Mickey O'Neil threw that first punch and knocked that huge guy out? Something similar happened in The Bourne identity when Bourne is sleeping on a bench in a snow-covered park and two police officers come to tell him to move along, and he ends up beating them both to the ground before he even really realizes what he's doing. This is what makes the movie fun. Sure, it's not the most intellectually involved screenplay, and it's even been done before in almost exactly the same form, but it's fun to go along with this character as he discovers all of these skills that he has, especially since he doesn't even know why he has them. <br/><br/>
(spoilers) There are times during the film when there are so many possible identities that may each be the real one (if there IS a real one) that it gets confusing as to which identity he is investigating or which one is thought dead by his enemies. However, whenever this does happen, it only serves to concentrate more attention on the action and the physical aspect of the film, which is clearly its strongest asset. We eventually learn that Jason Bourne is a $30 million government weapon, and if I remember correctly, there was nothing in the film to suggest for certain that Jason was not some sort of cyborg, including that first kiss scene. When Marie put that first peck on his lips, he stood there staring at her for a few moments too long, like he was consulting his memory banks trying to figure out how to react in this sort of situation. Besides, if he were a cyborg, it would explain his bulletproof shoulder blades!  <br/><br/>Here's a guy that has survived floating for an unknown period of time unconscious in the ocean (okay, THAT hints that he's not a cyborg), two bullet wounds to the back that would have punctured both lungs and probably his heart if it weren't for the above-mentioned bulletproof shoulder blades, and who can pull all sorts of fight moves that make Neo and Morpheus look like kids, and we are taken along with him as he desperately tries to figure out who he is. It's not exactly clear who the bad guy(s) is or are in this film, which only serves to add to the suspense and fun created within it. It's an interesting and refreshing change to see the kind of character development that we see in this film, where we grow to like and to root for this guy with amnesia only to later learn that he was pretty much the mastermind of the botched assassination attempt. Given that, he can't really be seen as the good guy, but I guess that since he only wants to forget all that and start a new life with Marie we're meant to see him that way.<br/><br/>And speaking of which, this is the first element of the film where it starts to falter. This guy is a trained government assassin, yet he is completely derailed by a couple of kids at the crucial point in his mission. Sure, it would not be a pleasant thing to see an African leader murdered in a film in front of his kids, but you have to wonder where that $30 million went if he is so easily weakened. But if you can look past the questionable female presence in the film (questionable only because no woman on earth would go through all this for a good looking guy) and the obligatory ending (I remember watching the conclusion of all of Bourne's troubles, and just waiting for the impending reunion scene), you will get a quality action film. There are some scenes where the movie knows it's messing up (such as when Bourne amazingly knows EXACLTY where the shotgun is in a house that he has only spent one night in), but it is always sure to correct itself sometime during the film (in this case, in the scene where he explains to Marie that he knows that the best place to find a gun right now is in the cab of the gray pick-up truck out front).  <br/><br/>Of course, we can't understand how he could know this, but that's beside the point because we aren't meant to discover a full understanding of who he was before the assassination attempt. The Bourne Identity is not about who Jason Bourne was before he lost his memory, its about who he is as a human being underneath all of the training that he was given by the government and the purpose of which he no longer understands or believes in. He doesn't want to be an assassin, he wants a normal life with Marie. We're just here to see the conflict involved in getting rid of one life and starting the other. These are very different themes for one movie to deal with, which is why it falters at some points, but the action and the acting and sheer fast-paced excitement over-shadow the lesser elements, making The Bourne Identity a very worthy action thriller."

Matt Damon and Franka Potente were great.  I never liked Matt Damon before, maybe because he is a Red Sox fan and I am from NY, but in this movie he was very good. Even all the supporting players were good, but very under used, like Julia Stiles and Clive Owen. (Clive Owen is great, why this guy can't get some good roles is beyond me.)

","I saw the Bourne Identity last night (6/4/02) at a special advanced screening in San Francisco.  Matt Damon was introduced at the end of the film and took questions from the audience for about a half hour.<br/><br/>I've read Ludlum's book and the movie is very loosely based on it. Essentially this is about a man found floating in the sea, near death from gunshot wounds.  As the man wakes, he has no memory and eventually he finds himself on the run with the aid of a woman he barely knows.  Unlike the book, there is no Carlos, Marie is a gypsy not a banker, and the movie is set almost entirely in Paris<br/><br/>I thought the movies was less of a spy thriller than a movie about two people on the run.  There were several lighter moments in the film with Damon and Franka Potente on the run.  Potente is really good and very funny. Chris Cooper (a great character actor) doesn't have the greatest lines, but delivers them quite well.  Julia Stiles is also in this movie, but her role is rather small.  Clive Owen is in the movie as well (not driving a BMW though) and while his role is small, he performs well especially as he talks about his life and sacrifices.<br/><br/>I thought this film was good entertainment, but not great.<br/><br/>Matt Damon said that he studied martial arts and had weapons training for five months.  He did do most of his own stunts.  Some of the fights scenes were great with an almost Matrix-like super-soldier type attitude.  There is a great stunt near the end of the movie as Bourne makes a move to get down the staircase.<br/><br/>The film was shot in Paris and the Czech Republic."

The Ludlum's novel have also spawned a television series and several more books . However , screenwriter Tony Gilroy , at Doug Liman's instruction, did not read the ""Bourne Identity"" novel ; instead, he worked solely from an outline prepared by Liman . In fact , the film has almost nothing to do with the original novel . This is the only film in the Bourne series with any resemblance to the plot of the book it's purportedly based on, and it's a very loose adaptation , all other movies in the series are original screenplays that use only the titles of novels by Robert Ludlum . In the book The Bourne Identity , the main bad guy is a real life criminal genius, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez of Venezuela, better known as Carlos the Jackal . Matt Damon's acting as a hard-rock , two-fisted without identity agent is top-notch . Franka Potente is nice as a young who helps Jason . Both of whom carry out dangerous action scenes .

"hnt_dnl","10","5","8","1 June 2008"," A refreshingly exciting and vivid action film
","I didn't really know anything about the character Jason Bourne other than in general he was some type of modern day James Bond type of hero from the novel THE BOURNE IDENTITY. I knew that they did a TV movie back in the late 80s of the same name and that Richard Chamberlain played the hero. But based on what I did know, in no way did I think that Matt Damon was right for the part of an international super-spy. I thought he was too young, too short, too nonathletic looking, etc. Let me just say that I was 100% dead solid wrong! Damon is exceptional as Jason Bourne in THE BOURNE IDENTITY and it is one of my pleasant surprises in film so far the decade of the 2000s. While it is not currently in my very top films of the decade, the way the decade is going, it could very easily end up in the top 10. because there are about only 2 or 3 other big Hollywood films this decade that I think are true modern classics (COLLATERAL and KILL BILL VOL.1 among them).<br/><br/>THE BOURNE IDENTITY is actually a surprisingly simple tale of CIA agent Jason Bourne, who loses his memory during a mission gone wrong. Bourne works for a secret sub-section of the CIA only known as the 'Treadstone' operation. This group is led by Conklin (played by the fine actor Chris Cooper in a confident performance). Treadstone seems to specialize in the assassination game, doing the CIA's dirty work by snuffing out potential threats to the US. Bourne goes missing after the failed mission and Conklin at first thinks he may be dead, but just to be safe, he orders CIA moles around the world to be on the lookout for Mr. Bourne in case he pops up.<br/><br/>Bourne does pop up at a bank in Zurich where he apparently has a safety deposit box full of fake passports, a lot of cash, and an automatic weapon. This is where he realizes his name is 'Jason Bourne' and that his 'home' is in Paris, which is really just a temporary place that Bourne was staying while on the assignment that went wrong leading him to lose his memory in the first place. While in Zurich, the mole contacts Conklin that Bourne showed up and this is when the fun begins. He goes to the American embassy in Zurich to escape capture, but Conklin has a mole in there, too, and the soldiers there try to take him into custody. During the confrontation, Bourne learns that he has all these amazing physical and mental skills as he methodically takes out his victims one by one (sometimes in bunches) and thinks his way out of danger as much as he brutes himself out.<br/><br/>Bourne hitches ride with Marie (well played by the alluring Franka Potente), who is in a bind herself because of inability to get a student visa to get into the US. Initially, she helps Bourne for money, but eventually (you guessed it), she falls for Bourne and vice versa; she also seems to be thrilled by the excitement of it all. So she tries to help him figure out who he is. Meanwhile, Conklin puts out contracts all around the world to 'hit' Bourne, as he can't very well have a secret CIA operative running around with all of Treadstone's dirty secrets. The most memorable assassin out to get Bourne is played by Clive Owen and he and Bourne have an exchange that is one of the best scenes in the film. The irony is that Conklin doesn't know Bourne is an amnesiac, so he is really out to get a man with no memory of Treadstone or it's operations! Bourne just wants to start fresh and be free.<br/><br/>THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a very fast-paced, exciting film. I find it much better than any James Bond film. It is a surprisingly simple story told with great flair, imagination, and humanity. As stated before, Damon is excellent in the role and does brilliant job carrying this film. The supporting cast is very good as well and the action is crisp, lean, and mean. It's really a good old-fashioned action movie that everyone can appreciate (modern and old-school audiences alike) because today's advanced technology factors into the film (internet, surveillance, weaponry), yet it is infused with a real humanity that makes you care about the central character and his predicament and wonder how he's going to get himself out of it. Great film."
"sbrobin","5","8","15","22 June 2002"," Decent, but pretty much like any other action thriller
","I was really excited to hear one of my favorite books was being made into a film.  I was surprised at the beginning whenn they didn't say ""based on the book."" After watching it, I can see why.  The only thing it has in common with the book are the characters and some of the first 5 minutes.  The plot is completely different.  The book is exciting because Jason Bourne (Damon) is up against the deadliest assasin of all time, Carlos the Jackal, and his origins are a mystery until the very end.  Carlos is nowhere in this film, and the secrets of the organization Bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 mins.<br/><br/>Another thing that I haven't seen in over a decade, is a very anti-climatic ending. No real final showdown with the bad guy, no incredible revelations, just an action scene that's less exciting than the first fight Bourne has.<br/><br/>As a standalone film, it's entertaining.  As a book adaptation, it's horrible."
"The Grand Master","9","3","4","5 November 2016"," Rewrites the rule book for all action/spy movies as a new hero is Bourne.
","It's hard to believe that back in 2002, The Bourne Identity would rewrite the rule book for action/spy movies and set a new benchmark. There's plenty of thrilling action sequences, and there's also the addition of brains to counterbalance the brawn. Matt Damon, who was an unlikely choice as the spy Jason Bourne, completely redefined the movie spy for the millennium and made himself and his character a household name. Based on the best selling novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Identity was one of the most successful movies of 2002 which spawned several successful sequels.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting) being rescued by Italian fishermen after being found in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea with two gunshots in his back. While being nursed back to full health, Bourne wakes up with no memory of who he is and how he was found, but is fluent in several languages and highly proficient in unarmed combat. finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The only lead Bourne can act on is a tiny laser projector under his hip which gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zurich. After he visits the bank in Zurich, he finds a large sum of money, various passports and a handgun. The visit to the bank alerts black ops CIA director Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper, Adaptation) who is in charge of Operation Treadstone. As Conklin and Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox, Manhunter) spearhead the operation to take down Bourne who is believed to have gone rogue, Bourne enlists the help of German woman Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente, Run Lola Run) to initially drive him to Paris with a sum of money but finds herself being caught up in the middle of the secretive plot. While Bourne slowly uncovers how he found himself in his current situation and who he really is, he also uncovers the conspiracy to see through that he is not to be taken alive.<br/><br/>Matt Damon won critical acclaim for he previous roles in Good Will Hunting (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Here in The Bourne Identity, his career kicks into another gear as super spy Jason Bourne who also has cemented a well deserved spot as one of the greatest characters amongst such names as James Bond, Rambo, Terminator and John McClane to name a few. It's hard to believe Matt Damon was an unlikely casting choice, but now Jason Bourne is one of Matt Damon's best roles.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast round out the movie well such as Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Clive Owen, Julia Stiles (another unlikely casting choice) and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Keep an eye out for Walton Goggins (The Shield), Gabriel Mann (Revenge), and Josh Hamilton (American Horror Story).<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman was also an unlikely choice as director following his work in indie movies such as Swingers (1996) and Go (1999) but here his work has worked wonders.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity spawned several blockbusting sequels however giving credit where its due, The Bourne Identity was the movie that started it all and made its permanent mark. Putting a lot of no brainer action movies to shame, The Bourne Identity is more of a thinking man's action movie with spectacular stunts and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride. Even after Moby's Extreme Ways plays during the end credits, you still find yourself glued to your seat. The Bourne Identity is still an entertaining action movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>9/10."
"Lejink","8","3","4","9 August 2015"," First Bourne
","The first in the successful Bourne franchise set the bar higher for future entries it has to be said. Matt Damon reinvented himself here as an action hero in the form of the title character, the first sight of whom we get is floating face down in a dark, stormy sea. He's not dead of course and recovers remarkably quickly from being shot so many times in the back, but once he does, he methodically works his way back to filling in his amnesiac memory as he finds out he's a broken-down killing machine who's now a liability to his employers.<br/><br/>Along the way, inevitably of course, he joins forces with a girl (there's always a girl) of the feisty and rootless type naturally, who although only taking Bourne on initially as the most expensive taxi-hire in history, naturally develops feelings for him, even as all hell seems to break loose around him. From there to the end the race is on for Bourne to get his memory and identity back before the bad-good guys get him. Considering the number of sequels spawned to date, you can guess our guy doesn't exactly lose, although rather the same can't be said of some of his most ardent pursuers.<br/><br/>What immediately set Bourne apart from other spy-action-hero types is that there are no gimmicks about him. The way that he comes across as an ordinary-average sort of guy (until you press his buttons) gets us on his side from the very start, our faith in him to come through as a good-guy in the end vindicated by the humanity he shows in his first would-be- assassination mission. More than that, the fast-cut action sequences are quite superb especially the expertly choreographed fight-scenes. The movie never slackens as it moves as relentlessly forward much like our hero's own mission to find himself.<br/><br/>Damon is terrific in the title part and dominates the film. The direction keeps the tension going right to the end, interspersing the dynamic, stylised action sequences with just enough character-setting to fill in the backgrounds, without slowing the film to a halt.<br/><br/>Even better was to come in the series but this excellent opener is more than just a ""curtains-up"" on one of recent cinema's best characters, it's an excellent espionage thriller in its own right."
"A_Different_Drummer","10","3","4","10 August 2014"," Penultimate Spy/Action/Testosterone Flick...
","This review for latecomers to the movie, most likely younger viewers who consider anything prior to 2010 to be ""dark ages."" Wrong. Within its niche (loosely, action/spy/amnesia) it may end up being one of the greatest ever, watchable and entertaining over and over...<br/><br/>I think I have seen this more than 10 times, putting it up there with Fistful of Dollars and Godfather. The pedigree is astonishing. Ludlum was not ""respected"" in his lifetime but he sure sold a lot of books. Interestingly, Bourne had ALREADY emerged as the most popular of his works, long before the film adaption was attempted. While not breakthrough -- amnesia stories have been done to death, especially in the 1940s -- the combination of the memory issue and the assassin twist essentially put the story over the top. There were written sequels (rare for Ludlum) and posthumous attempts to revive the character in new novels (very rare!).<br/><br/>This 2002 film was serendipity. Gilroy, a veteran, did one of the leanest adaptations ever. His writing is genius. The film moves through progressive action arcs so eloquently the viewer does not even realize what is happening. Consider the arc where the Bourne character takes out Clive Owen's counter-assassin. It's almost brusque. On the news that the dog is not responding, Bourne goes into action like a tiny Terminator. Not a second of screen time is wasted. How many films can make the same claim? Damon is an excellent actor but the argument can be made that he did too good a job with Bourne (hence his refusal to appear in the last film). Arguably he was too young for the part ""as written"" but props to director Liman for going with him anyway. That decision made film history.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is brilliant. Cooper and Cox as supporting characters? R U Kidding me? Wow.<br/><br/>The criticism can be made (not by me, but it can be made) that Potente does not inject enough feminine energy (she mainly reacts, never acts) which probably explains the over-emphasis on the Pam Landy character in the two sequels. Which works well. But the truth is, this is a man's action film, and one of the best ever, so the director had latitude.<br/><br/>And poor Clive Owen. In of the great ironies of cinema, his action scene became a metaphor for his A-list career. At the time, the common wisdom was that he was ""the next big thing."" Didn't happen.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. The sequel is serviceable but not a standout. The final part of the trilogy is satisfying but lacks magic. Any future films without Damon are to be scrupulously avoided."
"secondtake","8","3","4","25 January 2011"," Furiously dynamic, and if a little thin on substance, buttery with effect
","The Bourne Identity (2002)<br/><br/>It's a slightly ludicrous plot and not a very complex one, but it's so well done, so fast and well acted, it just takes off and never stops and works great. You couldn't ask for a better action adventure espionage film without depth. Not only is Matt Damon well cast and doing his best, but his lesser known female unwitting but not at all witless companion is terrific, too. And that's Franke Potente (forever known best for ""Run Lola Run"").<br/><br/>The fighting (in slightly fast motion to give a comic book feel to it all, even more than a martial arts style) and the CIA backroom stuff (where they have to kill their own agent to protect their image on Capitol Hill) is all good enough for any movie. But for me, the thing that lifts this just a bit higher is the relationship between the Damon and Potente characters. The actors play it all very cool, show normal fear and confusion, and really demonstrate a deep trust in each other. By the ending, you are so happy for them, you might be sad to hear there are two sequels.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman seems to come out of nowhere for such a complex and well directed film, though his two earlier features, ""Swinger"" and ""Go,"" are both very strong. It's interesting that both the sequels received similarly rave reviews among the mainstream press, and both were directed by someone else (Paul Greengrass), which might point to the strength of the underlying story and cast. On the other hand, Liman set the tone and style of the following two films, and there is something superior about having done it first. This is a good film, and a great film of its type.<br/><br/>The photography (and effects) are talked about here, and director of photography Oliver Wood shoots all three films, which shouldn't be overlooked, since these are such visceral, visual experiences. Guaranteed to not let you doze off. Good fun!"
"amesmonde","Null","3","4","12 August 2010"," Effective espionage that avoids clichés
","Thanks to Bourne, Bond was given that update make-over that was needed. Although a loose adaptation of Robert Ludlum novel it's a far superior to closer rework The Bourne Identity (1988) TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain and 'Angel' Jaclyn Smith.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's does a surprisingly great job, not just as Jason Bourne the character but against type cast, convincing the viewer that he's a dangerous and physical spy. While the Bourne Identity is action packed with some fantastic fight choreography and car chases it feels realistically grounded as an effective espionage thriller. The captivating screenplay by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron gives the cast time to shine. Franka Potente Brian Cox and Chris Cooper are all on fine form and there's also a small, memorable role by Clive Owen as an assassin.<br/><br/>The film has a great look and benefits from the real life European locations, Doug Liman's direction is exceptional utilising a hand held style that has become common place in mainstream films since. The score is exciting and Moby's theme tune is captivating, for such a high concept film Bourne Identity is very convincing,- it avoids clichés, has some twists and exudes atmosphere.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is must see."
"sanddragon939","10","3","4","15 August 2008"," A Killer of a Thriller Identified
","The Bourne Identity is an action-packed adaptation of renowned author Robert Ludlum's international bestseller of the same name. And it sure as hell isn't your average leave-your-brains behind thriller (which is sadly what many of the James Bond films had become). The plot is the primary focus of this film, which the mind-numbing action scenes, gloss and glamour taking only secondary precedence. The film begins with the unconscious body of a man (Matt Damon), with two bullets in his back, being hauled out of the Mediterranean Sea on a stormy night by the crew members of a fishing boat. When the unknown man regains consciousness, he realizes he has no memory of who he is or how he ended up in this predicament. The only clues to his past are a Swiss bank account number embedded in his hip and an in-depth knowledge of various European languages. The man embarks on a journey to discover his true identity. But the more he leanrs, the more questions arise. Who is Jason Bourne? How did he become a living breathing fighting machine? Why is he being hunted at every turn by the authorities and a mysterious group of assassins? Jason must use every skill he has acquired in an unremembered life to survive, answer these questions, and uncover the secrets behind the 'Bourne Identity'. The film is in no way an accurate adaptation of the Ludlum novel, eliminating much of the novel's complex multi-layered plot and backstory. Nevertheless, it remains fairly true to the spirit of the novel as far as the protagonist, his motives and character are concerned. The Bourne Identity is a character based drama. Unlike the book, its a story of people adapting to near-impossible circumstances, rather than about uncovering conspiracies and schemes. Damon's brilliant performance as Bourne is supplemented by an excellent supporting cast of Franke Potente as Marie Kreutz, the film's female lead; Chris Cooper as Conklin, a CIA black ops strategist; Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, a high-ranking CIA official and Clive Owen, in a minor but fairly significant role as the silent killer known as the Professor. All in all, a truly unforgettable film."
"TimBoHannon","8","3","4","6 August 2008"," A New and Engrossing Hero is Bourne
","Jason Bourne is not James Bond. The name bears a remarkable similarity, as does the world the super-agent inhabits, but the parallels end there. Bond investigates and spies for his government; he possesses alluring charm, perfect confidence, detailed knowledge of his enemies, premeditated plans, and an ability to murder anybody without warning. James Bond seeks violence; violence seeks Bourne. Bourne has no desire to take others' lives, but wherever he hides, the bloodshed finds him. When it does, he has no choice but to use his lethal skills. ""I don't even know who I'm running from,"" he laments. He must devise his next moves quickly. He is not charismatic and he has no swagger. The two JB's are completely different, but the brains and brawn behind ""The Bourne Identity"" prove both styles can succeed.<br/><br/>A fishing vessel off the coast of France rescues Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), unconscious and floating face up. He has been shot twice and has a laser pointer imbedded in his hip. When he awakes, his biographical memory is gone. The pointer provides the only clue to his identity--an account number to a bank deposit box in Zurich. He uses extremely advanced martial arts to escape intense situations, and what amazing skills they are. He strikes with a superhuman combination of strength, precision and awareness. He seems to have eyes in the back of his head. His environmental perception reaches extraordinary levels, but he cannot understand why, nor the reason somebody tries to kill him in Paris.<br/><br/>A mysterious branch of the CIA does know. Its leader, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), fears the implications of Bourne being alive and causing commotion. From his basement war-room, he directs a team assigned to track Bourne and put him ""in a body bag."" After Marie (Franka Potente) drives Jason to Paris, Conklin adds her to the hit list for his specialized assassins (Clive Owen, Nicky Naude).<br/><br/>Few action movies work well without a powerful villain. Physically, Chris Cooper is the perfect choice for Conklin. His perfectly slicked hair, bass voice, and face, which looks like the façade to a vault of experience, make the perfect image of a forceful leader. Cooper communicates a lot of information with his mannerisms, mostly while issuing orders with fire in his speech.<br/><br/>The great part is that we don't just see him give the orders. We hear them explained, we hear responses from team members, we see the field agents receive their messages and prepare for action. Liman keeps us in the room when he hear his underlings report what they have discovered and how. We see him update his superior (Brian Cox) and discuss with him the next course of action. These scenes add a special flavor to the film.<br/><br/>The action appears at an unusual pace, mostly during the first hour. The best are the fistfight in Paris and a car chase that soon follows. Liman follows the top rule for filming action. Do not try to manufacture tension with rapid fire cuts or fancy camera work; let the quality of the production speak for itself. Just find a quality angle to let it speak. It is sad that Paul Greengrass broke it for the two sequels. Only Alex Proyas has permission to that.<br/><br/>What is on screen is indeed high quality. It also reveals another difference between Bond and Bourne. Evasion is always his first option. While being chased inside a building, Bourne throws away the gun he takes, the third time in the movie he does that. Even in the climax, he only kills the guards because he has no choice but fighting them. Acting wise, Damon plays Bourne straightforward, nothing fancy here. Damon is understated, the correct approach for a character of that personality, yet he remembers that even a hunted man can smile.<br/><br/>Potente is an attractive woman, but that is not the point here. Marie's function is companionship and transportation for Bourne. She is more than a sex partner. In fact, Bourne chooses to sleep on the floor when they share a room. Potente also remains toned down. Brian Cox and Gabriel Mann (playing Conklin's top assistant) both bring what their roles need. Cox has his best moment when he tells Conklin ""You never made a mistake before!"" Most impressive among the supporting cast is Clive Owen, who speaks volumes with his silence.<br/><br/>""From Russia with Love"" is probably the only Bond movie structured like ""The Bourne Identity."" Both are heavily plot and subterfuge focused. The payoff is far better in the former, but ""Bourne"" excels more in its slow areas. By keeping a close eye on the details, Liman assures that no moment is boring. There are no Bond-like gadgets since Bourne has no Q to make them. He uses standard equipment in innovative ways. That is only one of the reasons why ""The Bourne Identity"" wins in all categories."

","This is a fabulous movie, an example of what Hollywood can do - now and then - to keep us interested. There is no point me summarising the plot as it's a well known movie and the review does not need that.<br/><br/>This is an action thriller, of an understated variety. The character development is natural and the plot points unfold in an uncontrived fashion; this engenders a much more riveting engagement that the OTT 'XXX' approach. When action sequences occur they are filmed in a stark and 'realistic' manner and they are all the more exciting for this.<br/><br/>Focussing on a few key characters enables us to build a relationship with those people, a relationship that really does make us care for them and their outcomes.

"treeskier802","10","3","4","30 April 2007"," One of the Best in the Spy Thriller Genre
","The Bourne Identity is a historically important film for the popular spy thriller genre. The story is character driven and this is what gives it the edge it needs. The action and fight scenes are not gratuitous, which you see in too many films in this genre and the action is realistic, which adds to the plot rather than subtracting from it.<br/><br/>Unlike many of the Bond films, especially the Moore and Brosnan movies, the movie grasps the feel of what audiences yearn for in a spy thriller. It is realistic and gritty without being so complex that it would be difficult for the layperson who never experienced being a secret agent to understand.<br/><br/>I must admit that I absolutely love the spy thrillers; they are my favorite genre of film. I would have to rank The Bourne Identity, Ronin, From Russia With Love and Casino Royale the best of the genre. All of these movies really capture the essence of what secret agents should be in film; they are gritty, packed with timely action, and are realistic.<br/><br/>What sets Bourne aside from the others is the unique story of a man who finds himself lost with amnesia and running from the people who trained him. He is not on a mission for his government, but instead is running for his own life.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's acting is superb and there is a great supporting cast notably Franka Potente and Chris Cooper. The soundtrack is perfect as is the cinematography; both capture the absolute correct mood.<br/><br/>Whether you are a fan or not of the spy thriller, you may still like this movie because it is a great story with great characters.

","I've seen this movie on the shelves for a while. I was planning to watch it one day, you know, when circumstances would bring it on my path. No, it's true, I didn't care much about it, for obvious reasons: First, this movie didn't seemed very popular, and nobody ever told me anything about it. But second, Matt Damon in the lead role left me somehow perplex, probably due to his lack of charisma.<br/><br/>Whatsoever, now, in early 2007, I took the time to enjoy this, finally, excellent production! On the whole, the movie shines by its precise realization; its well balanced way to tell the story, to establish character's relations and successions of events. Amazingly, especially for this kind of movie(thriller/action/stealth) almost nothing is exaggerated, or, at least, unrealistic and over-saturated to the extreme like the usual ""made in USA"" productions. The pace is just right, and leave us exactly the right time to taste and enjoy every details without relieving the needed tension. So, on the directing side, this jewel is just wonderful! The cast is another strong point. It gave me another look to its main actor, Matt Damon, by showing his physical ability, and by using his kind of average charisma, as I said, to enhance the natural behavior of his character. Chris Cooper, to my opinion, is always welcome, maybe not his most memorable performance ever, but still excellent. Enigmatic, Clive Owen was a good surprise to me. Few dialog for him, but he astonishingly fits as an invisible sniper hit-man, I wouldn't ever have thought so! The haircuts and clothes were, maybe discrete, but perfectly chosen. Franka Potente was enjoyable too, it's the first time I've seen her on screen though.<br/><br/>Sadly, I've watched a 4:3 (full screen) version of the film, so I can't fairly comment the photography, but it seems to follow the whole thing, being homogeneous and just right. The sound was especially well mixed, and didn't seemed to use typical audio FX samples for details like gunshots, silenced gunshots or engines, and it feels even more realistic that way. Lovely use of the surround sound even in calm or quiet moments.<br/><br/>Clean and brief, but effective fighting scenes are something we can't miss. The (only) car pursuit was delicious, sharp, dynamic and spectacular, but still sober and realistic! Hard to believe isn't it?! The European settings were perfect and refreshing overall, even funny (for the pursuit).<br/><br/>Obviously, this movie was a great surprise, and, to my opinion, stands above most ""bigger"" productions of the same genre.

Not only did he bring a subtle angst to his portrayal, he showed an amazing ability to portray the physical requirements of Jason Bourne's character.The script had minimal flaws which in lesser films can detract from the ability of the viewer to engage in escapism.

","This movie has become my favorite spy/assassin movie of all time.  The first time I saw it I thought it was very good but not great.  Wrong.  This movie kicks so much a$$ it's ridiculous.  I think you just have to watch it a few times before it sinks in.  The acting was great, car chases were killer, plenty of shooting to keep you entertained, and a cool storyline to follow and keep you in suspense.  Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, rescued by Greek fishermen 30 miles off the coast of France with two bullets imbedded in his back, he has no memory of his life or what happened to him.  He soon discovers when he reaches land that a secret U.S. government agency called Treadstone knows he is alive and is trying to eliminate him.  He must elude his pursuers across Europe and discover his identity with the help of a woman he hardly knows (Franka Potente) before it is too late and they kill him and her.  Based on the best selling novel by the late Robert Ludlum, I have heard that the writers took some liberties when they created the screenplay but since when is that bad thing when you do a good job.  The casting was excellent and the locations fantastic, one of the higher points often touched upon in other reviews.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are poster boys for bureaucrats gone bad and Julia Stiles does well in her limited role.  Clive Owen is devilish as The Professor one of the hitmen assigned to kill Jason Bourne.  I never would have considered Matt Damon of all people as a legitimate action star but he sure can surprise you time and time again.  He has definitely eclipsed buddy Ben Affleck in terms of box office draw AND acting.  This one put him on the map as a leading man and sensational new star.  Engrossing from start to finish.  Followed by the sequel The Bourne Supremacy."
"keihan","Null","3","4","17 February 2003"," A 1970's throwback...well done
","For starters, let me say that I have partially read the novel that this movie is based on (published in the 1980's) and found it a sometimes tough, boring slog. The only reason I picked it up to begin with is because I saw the TV Movie in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain. It was the beginning of my understanding that books and movies, by their very natures, are completely different animals. As for this version of ""The Bourne Identity""...well, I wasn't expecting much (though I was intrigued by certain ivory-tower critics who gave this film a second look when it hit DVD and decided that maybe it wasn't so bad). If I was moderately entertained, I'd have called it a success. But I was suprised.<br/><br/>For all its occassional hi-tech trappings, this film reminded me, more than anything, of 1975's ""Three Days of the Condor"" with Robert Redford and Max Von Sydow (anyone who liked ""The Bourne Identity"" needs to see it immediately if they haven't already). It's geared to entertaining the over-18 crowd as opposed to the usual adolescent thrill-seekers most modern action films pander to. There's gunplay, but nothing so overblown as ten thousand bullets for one shoot-out (the cat-and-mouse game outside the farmhouse comes to mind). There's martial-arts (a lesser-known style called Kali), but no wire-fu for once. And, lest we forget, there's one of the best car-chase sequences in recent memory through Paris (who'd have thunk that a Yugo could make such a good getaway vehicle?).<br/><br/>But these are general elements. Specific details that brought back ""Condor"" memories are as follows:<br/><br/>--Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Like Redford's low-level researcher, he plays a man stuck in a situation that he has no idea how he got into and even less of an idea of who's aiming the bullets at him. But it's not quite one-for-one. Redford didn't have anything to fall back on aside from his experience in the Army and Ma Bell. His ignorance is based on his rank in the CIA hiearchy. Bourne, on the other hand, speaks multiple languages, has formidible fighting skills, and is one of the brightest tacticians I've ever seen on the silver screen. But he has absolutely no clue as to how he is able to do what he does. It's all just instinct and reaction. The frustrating conundrum for him (a fact that is made very clear in the initial sequences when his skills come into play) is that, in spite of these advantages, the unknown past may have already doomed his future.<br/><br/>--Franka Potente as Marie Kruetz. Potente's role is more of a bohemian version of Faye Dunaway's character in ""Condor"" than anything else. But again, there are key differences. Redford forced Dunaway to cooperate at gunpoint, only coming over to his side with great reluctance. Kruetz is made of sterner stuff, as one would expect from a lifetime on the road. Bourne uses that other great persuader, money, to get what he needs from Kruetz and actually gives her the option of getting out while the getting is still good. Their eventual sleeping together even feels a bit less forced than the similar setup in ""Condor"" (a particularly novel touch about the inevitable morning after scene is the fact that Bourne is already up, dressed, and has wiped every surface in the room). The relationship is really the heart of the movie. Without it, most of the story is just not there.<br/><br/>--Clive Owen as the Professor. While I'm a trifle disappointed that Owen didn't get more to do with this role (unlike most folks, who discovered his obvious talent in ""Croupier"", I first saw him prove his acting chops in the video clips for the old adventure game, ""Privateer 2: The Darkening""), his smoky, grey presence brings to mind Max Von Sydow's cultured assasin in ""Condor""(even the ""Professor"" moniker seems to hint at such a connection). Like Bourne, he's a killing machine, as impersonal and scary as a fully loaded AK-47 to the head (the scene where he pops into pick up his info from Julia Stiles illustrates this beautifully). The only real difference between him and Bourne is the fact that he knows the answers to the questions Bourne has been asking. That he doesn't mind answering them after being bested calls to mind Von Sydow's killing of Redford's quarry and then politely suggesting an extended vacation in Europe when they both walk outside. A baddie who isn't really a baddie...what a concept, huh?<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I thought that the final twist on what put Bourne out in the middle of the Mediterranean to be both logical and even believable, given everything that came before. This would seem to suggest the influence of John Woo (but only in the arena of character development, something particularly stressed in ""The Killer"" and the ""A Better Tomorrow"" films). It's basic plot logic: set up the story in such a way that, when the final suprise twist comes through, it doesn't feel like a deus ex machina so much as a reasonable conclusion.<br/><br/>I honestly hope that this film is the start of a trend in the action genre. Just because most action movies are the cinematic equivalent of junk food doesn't mean they have to be. What's wrong with a little fillet mignon?"
"fredericksmith1952","10","4","6","11 February 2012"," Or is it the fact we, as Americans, think our government is capable of doing this?
","Matt Damon comes off well as the celebrated Jason Bourne, and Franka Potente is marvelous as Marie. While loosely based on the character created by Robert Ludlum, The film keeps you drilled to the screen as it moves quickly from one scene to the next. Brian Cox and Chris Cooper are superb character actors and a fine addition to the film as the two CIA operatives in charge of Treadstone. Julia Stiles is particularly good in the role as ""Nicki"", the operative who coordinates the ""assets"". Excellent performances throughout the film are what makes this story so believable, or is it the fact we, as Americans, think our government is capable of doing this?

","I give The Bourne Identity a strong 8 out of 10. Its pretty good. <br/><br/>I have not read the books, Im not a big book reader anyway. <br/><br/>The movie has enough to keep you interested. It has a good character, that is Jason Bourne. Matt Damon plays him well, he is very believable as Jason Bourne. You can really care for the main character. He has no idea who he is, what his name is or anything. Until he starts to beat people up, he thinks there is something very suspicious about himself, he was an assassin. That's cool. He was a killing machine, that know's a lot about how to work with guns, he knows some good fighting moves, but he wants to know how he knows how to do all these things, and who he was, and who he worked for. The movie is something you can really identify with. And I really liked all the stuff between Franka Potente and Matt Damon, pretty good chemistry, and the movie is a good journey and adventure, you keep learning the more it goes. <br/><br/>A lot of the action scenes were pretty cool. Im not much for the car chase, but I like all the other action scenes. The fight with the assassin in the hotel room, the scene on the stairwell at the end of the movie, the scene between Clive Owen and Matt Damon, I like the Embassy scene when Matt Damon climbs down the wall. And the fights and stuff are pretty brutal. And Jason Bourne uses anything for his disposal. I like how a lot of bad guys are after Bourne. <br/><br/>There is a lot to keep you interested and entertained, there may be a few weaknesses, maybe some of it kind of takes up time I guess. There are some parts that don't seem to be needed or that are not really important. <br/><br/>A good action movie with a main character to care a lot for."

","I figured this was a can't miss movie. Doug Liman is a great director and it seemed like the cast was pretty strong. However, what a standard, paint by the numbers, average at best, spy thriller. Do we really have to wait two hours for the happy ending that we all know is coming in the end? The scenes of Europe were nice, but hardly enough. Added to the problems of this movie is the fact that Matt Damon is just not that strong of actor, he seems to be void of any real charisma. The guy is plastic and unless you are a 14 year old girl, not worthy of your time. In this movie we get to see him kind of interact with a romantic interest, however it is tacked on and less than steamy. Talk about going through the motions. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities, the good guy is a saint, yata yata. What shocked me was why this movie was getting such high marks, it was ""Ronin"" without the action. Once again, mediocrity is praised as good and good is praised as great. Well, this movie was not great or even that good. Sadly lacking."
"tedg","Null","9","18","14 June 2002"," The Studio as the CIA
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Here we have another film ruined by conservative studio executives worried about engineering their `take no chances' summer blockbuster. After an entire year of countless arguments, delays, rewrites, reshoots and audience tests, we have as flat and unimaginative a film that Hollywood can produce. This is precisely the stuff we see in this story and countless other CIA-centric plots: the man in the field (Liman) has talent and intuition, but the company (here Universal) thinks it knows better. It throws its power around and thwarts every speck of cleverness. Death and failure result.<br/><br/>It was set up to be quite clever: Ludlum's innovation was in recasting the airport thriller as a fractionated narrative told from many perspectives. The protagonist, whose knowledge the reader usually shares, is the least knowledgeable of all. Clancy has since wrapped this style in war gizmos, and Grisham in legal technicalities. Altman brought this notion to film; Tarantino styled it; Liman's evolution (in `Go') was to root the narrative confusion in the angst of discovery which brings us right back to the intent of Ludlum. <br/><br/>Okay, you have to begin with a dope as the lead because of the economics of the situation -- that was dictated by Universal and golden inner circle of decisionmakers. The last time we had such a stretch between the intellect of the actor and character in a summer movie was when Denise Richards played a nuclear scientist in `The World Is Not Enough.' Matt rivals Raquel Welch in the dumb department. But sobeit.<br/><br/>But see who else Liman assembled: for the girl, he collected Potente who all movielovers know from `Run Lola Run.' That was a breakthrough experiment in parallel narratives with the same intent as `Go,' but an orthogonal approach. No serious moviegoer cannot understand that as backstory to this. Make the `company man' be Chris Cooper, someone whose role here is exactly between his Sheriff Deeds of `Lone Star' and Col Fitts of `American Beauty,' both characters works of art.<br/><br/>Make the second love interest (presumably established for the continuations of the franchise) Julia Stiles. She is pretty, athletic and currently inexpensive. Her three Shakespearean film experiments are unacknowledged in their adventure in redefining the narration of the master. (Ophelia as film student!)<br/><br/>The magic in a project like this is in the editing and shooting footage to appear part of the editing. For instance, there needs to be a lot of handheld work, and this needs to be jiggly in a selfaware fashion. As taught in film school, the rhythm of the shakes should match the rhythm of the fast cuts. So we got a director of photography who worked with Woo and knows how to do this. Any competent editor would do, but Liman wanted an abstract stance (like his other two projects). Pulling that off with such a nervous camera requires insight, so we get an editor that has slogged through the intellectual challenges of Terrence Malick on his massive visual meditation on war.<br/><br/>Then the trouble begins. In the most ironic of developments, the Studio forced all sorts of safe formulae on the project. Gone is the narrative folding of Ludlum and Liman. Gone is the abstract camera: all is framed in those stock `computer screen' images where a shot of Berlin has a text overlay that types out the name with the accompanying clack of keys. Added is all sorts of bumpf techno tracking stuff that was never part of the story (or the real CIA) but sold well in `Spy Games' and `Behind Enemy Lines.' Gone is all the miniconspiracy of Stiles' character (`too complicated for kids'). Gone is the detective story. <br/><br/>Gone is any chance for us to like what we see."
"Duckhunter_NL","6","8","16","6 August 2003"," The worst book-adaptation i have ever seen (1.5 out of 5)
","I cannot believe what has been made out of, arguably, Ludlum's finest! Not a shred has been left of the original, suspense-filled story. It's unbelievable someone adapted a script from the book this badly! Robert must have turned in his grave at the premiere, I'm sure he'd never allowed this atrocity to happen.<br/><br/>The film is just not compelling, not 'gripping' anywhere! The audience never gets involved, which is a very sad outcome for such a promising plot. Unfortunately, the plot's been mangled to a fraction of what could have been. Should have been! I mean, even the main antagonist from the book, the absolute bad guy, the other pivotal character next to Bourne, his nemesis, the one who makes Bourne what he is, is blatantly omitted from the movie. Absolutely INCREDIBLE! A pure disgrace if you ask me. It's like deleting Sauron from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or cutting Darth Vader from Star Wars!!! (believe me, it's that bad). At best, 10% is left of the original story.<br/><br/>Apart from some somewhat entertaining action-sequences, that never get your blood boiling because you're never emotionally attached to the main characters, it's like watching a documentary in fast forward. Not that the acting of Damon or ""Lola"" Potente is that bad, it just seems that every other character was brought in from amateur-night, and the script is even worse. The whole production just screams out: rush-job. As I've read the book 6 times, I came in to see this film with great expectations. Alas, the movie shockingly bored the hell out of me. Utter disappointment and a total rip-off.<br/><br/>One advice: read the phenomenal book cycle, forget the awful movie. They're in no way related."

The beginning scenes were so dark and confusing that it did not set the stage for what was to come. compare this to any Bond movie, and I mean any, all the way back, is a disgrace and ridiculous.

","This contemporary CIA film was something like the French version of Pirates of the Caribbean. In the end, our protagonist, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) really only wants some high adrenaline, the girl, and some gold and silver.<br/><br/>But before he hits the jackpot, we've got to rock out with this curious George. He really does monkey climb his way toward self-identity. Spiderman he is not, but he does hang from high places, reverse rock climb on the side of a building, though more like a tree frog than a monkey. That's o.k. It looked very scary. He's not really a frog. Trying to shake off amnesia from his enemy captors aboard a stormy ship off the coast of France, he makes land successfully. For a $20,000 payoff to a frustrated single girl named Marie, she quickly becomes his ally, his x for thrills and chills. Meanwhile, he retrieves a lock-box of his essentials, numerous passports, one by the name of Kane, that leads him to a luxurious Paris flat. From authorities, he learns that Kane is declared dead from a transportation accident. In the newspaper, Jason reads that he is an assassin. Marie and Jason return to the road, arriving at Eamon's quaint countryside home, along with his two small children. Who is Eamon? Marie's brother, lover, ex-husband? The superficial contrast between idyllic pastoral life and gun toting sniper chases only sours our identity for Bourne. His untimely home invasion, at Christmas, to Eamon's is simply an annoying artifice. He looks more bumbling than Bourne all through out this film. And that is being nice. I could say that he looks like one of the witch's evil monkeys from the Wizard of Oz. Is he an ant bully or just simply a pirate in search of his booty? CIA Director, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) is like the Witch's chief monkey ready to pole dance at Bada Bing's. (Shrug) Maybe that is really the better gig Chris? At monkey command central, Conklin going ape over his astray monkey, Jason finally captures the bugger. Conklin's assistant, Nicky (Julia Stiles) has placed her drive thru order: one chicken patty, extra-make-up, pickle, onion, hold the lettuce and the tomato, fries and a carton of milk. And like Dr. Evil, Conklin (finger to chin) reminds Jason, that Jason is really a $30 million dollar super spy for the CIA, whose been making way too many mistakes. Bourne can't stand pressures from chief monkey Conklin, goes ape and breaks away, yet again a free monkey 'at last.' Still Bourne is chased, by what alliance, we're just not sure anymore. But we do know that Bourne is running for his life, not his death. Where in the wheel does he land this time? Another quaint scene, in a tropical café situated on a beautiful scenic blue-skied European coast, where Marie now conveniently resides. Uhh Ohh! Are you thinking what I am thinking? It's the Bourne pastoral tip-off! Is he going to tell Marie that she's run from danger, flee the café, jump off the cliff into the ocean, or instruct her to immediately head to the basement, if there is one? He's in her arms, but for how long? Who is Jason Bourne? A reverse rock climbing evil monkey? A thorn in some lion's side? Or is he a teddy bear dressed in a Nic Cage snakeskin bomber jacket, or a leprechaun smoking a cute little brown pipe? The more interesting question might be whose world is more entertaining  Wayne's World or Bourne's World? The film is directed by Doug Liman, but be forewarned  this film is closely aligned to how Jerry Bruckheimer does gay Paris."

"tugboat2030","3","4","8","28 September 2002"," Bad Movie
","This movie was made simply to get people in the movie theaters to see Matt Damon and things blow up.  What's worse, it has no redeeming qualities.  The acting is atrocious, everything about it reminded me of either Spy Game or the Matrix.  The whole idea of Damon not knowing who he is and yet sensing everything that's going to happen is pretty nonsensical.  Don't look too deep in this movie, you'll get nothing.  Just be a passive sponge and wait for the box office to instill in you what a good movie is.  And if you agree with me, go watch Spy Game, it at least has some fairly good acting."
"jotix100","7","4","8","11 July 2002"," We'll always have Paris
","Doug Liman is a fine director of thrillers, as demonstrated here. This is one of the fastest action films in a while. <br/><br/>The story is somewhat muddy with all the turns and twists. Some readers at IMDB have compared it to Spy Games, which pales in comparison to this film. That other film had two actors that are an enigma: Brad Pitt and Robert Redford! <br/><br/>The Bourne Identity gives us another wooden actor: Matt Damon, who is the best example of a bad actor with the right connections. He's always in the right place at the right time. Mr. Damon keeps turning up like a bad penny in Hollywood films when there are better actors who are having a hard time paying their bills.<br/><br/>Take the case of the character actors of this film: Chris Cooper, Clive Owens and Brian Cox, to name only 3! They don't have anything to do here. It is a shame they are hired to be in the background of a non-actor.<br/><br/>
I wonder if anyone that saw this film could explain to me how is it that what the main character goes thru' and doesn't even get a scratch to his face. I guess the studio executives expect us to grin and bear it and justify what we see as a fantastic agent who is super-human.<br/><br/>In the love sequences there are no chemistry between Ms. Potente and Damon. Run Marie, run from this sucker. Make better adult oriented films in Germany or wherever, but never pair against Mr. Damon again.<br/><br/>Sorry Mr. Liman, better luck next time and better actors too. You certainly know the business of entertaining an audience."

We'd have another target on the axis of evil list! Besides sucking wood chips...this film is boring, slow, poorly acted and filmed. Don't waste your time. Matt's pal Ben made a much better film.

"ivo-cobra8","10","2","3","8 December 2016"," The original and the best Bourne action thriller!
","In my opinion, the Bourne Identity is the best out of the entire trilogy. Jason Bourne is really cute in this movie and he's less ""angry"" or in his ""I need to kill anyone who follows me"" mode. I love this movie to death it is my second favorite Bourne film in the trilogy. The first one will be The Bourne Supremacy. The movie is the second adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name (the first being a 1988 television film starring Richard Chamberlain as Bourne). This is a mystery spy thriller, that you keep guessing what happened with Jason and it is so intense. Matt Damon does a powerful performance and incredible job as Jason Bourne. This movie is packed with curiosity, romance and of course action! It is not boring or over long and most the time it feels like the film is more realistic. This is the real Jason Bourne and not the character Matt Damon was portraying today in the fifth installment Jason Bourne (2016)! I hate that movie but I love this one! <br/><br/>Plot. A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory. <br/><br/>I did hear about this movie in 2002 or 2003 I always wanted to watch this movie after reading an article in the magazine about this film. 10. years ago when I was in high school I watched this movie on TV and I loved it I turn on my computer and I went to see if there is any sequel and yes it was The Bourne Supremacy and at the time our network did not give the sequel on TV it took me 3 years till I download and watched the whole trilogy. And I love the first two movies to death and I love the character Jason Bourne he is decent. We find out more about Treadstone that, is assassin squad a top-secret black ops program of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). <br/><br/>I absolutely love this film to death! Director Doug Liman did amazing job producing and directing this movie and he knew exactly what he has to do to make it right and it worked. Clive Owen as The Professor the CIA hit-man was a fantastic assassin and the villain I loved him.<br/><br/>I love the chemistry between Jason and Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), I love the fight scene between Jason and CIA assassin Castel (Nicky Naudé) in Paris. I love how Jason becomes a fugitive and he doesn't kill trough entire film anyone except the bad guys on the end of the movie. <br/><br/>I love the showdown scene with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) using a 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun belonging to Eamon (Tim Duttin) to search for the Professor, after the Professor tracks him and Marie to the farmhouse in the French countryside. Bourne shoots the Professor twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him, I love that scene to death. <br/><br/>In this movie Julia Styles has a lot to do! In mostly sequels she was useless, but in this movie she was brilliant and the star off the movie! She was helping Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) CIA, really hunting Bourne, she was powerful joy able and intelligent field logistics coordinator and agent handler. I love her to death in here!<br/><br/>Brian Cox as Ward Abbott as Head of Operations was incredible villain and he was the mastermind behind Treadstone operations. <br/><br/>Chris Cooper is fantastic as Conklin Field Director of the Treadstone he is the fantastic villain. Franka Potente is sexy and really gorgeous likable. I love her ascent because she is really German like her character Marie is.<br/><br/>I never read a book or the novel and I have never hear about the movies or the character before but watching this movie I fall in love with it. This movie become the hit in summer 2002. Who would have thought that Good Will Hunting himself could pull off a kick-ass balls to the walls secret agent character that would essentially change the way we see action movies for the 21st century. Matt Damon does that very thing. The Bourne Identity is filled with old school action and stunts that makes this film dare I say better then Bond ever was. Of course that changed when Casino Royale came out, however it was Jason Bourne that started the new look. <br/><br/>Overall: This movie is brilliant and intelligent, I love this film to death! It is my second favorite film in the series, love the car chase scenes with Bourne and Marie siting in it. I have fun watching the movie and I will always watch it over and over again. It is my favorite spy mystery action film. <br/><br/>Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 10/10 <br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is a 2002 American-German action thriller film. It is an adaptation of Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name.

"elsycurr","4","2","3","5 July 2004"," Why? Why? Why?
","I have read some of the comments and I agree with Twassel and Alex V. that the movie was confusing and had no heart. I sat through it because the action was pretty good and I was hoping that it would redeem itself by the end. I had heard so many good things about it, which is the reason why I sat through the whole thing. The Paris scenes were really nice though. I got a feel of actually being in Paris for a few fleeting moments. BUT I just kept wondering why are they trying to kill him? He didn't do his job, ok, and they didn't want him to go back and try to kill the African leader again, so they wanted him dead? IF so, why did they kill the African leader anyway? Ok, did they want his head for the African leader so he wouldn't write his tell-all book? The African leader didn't ask for that, he just asked for money and wanted to rule his country again. AND why did the girl stay with Bourne???? There seemed to be no motivation there. After they both knew he was a killer why in the heck would she want to stay with him (they didn't convince us enough that she loved him)? Why would he want to put her in that much danger. They should've parted LONG before they put her friend and the two children in danger. Well, the action kept it going because Damon was really kicking butt but the plot was VERY weak!"
"Darkside-Reviewer","7","1","1","16 June 2020"," Matt Damon is Jason Bourne!
","I first saw the the Bourne Identity on DVD in the mid 2000s and honestly I didn't enjoy it all that much but that was probably because I was only fifteen years old and I didn't really pay much attention to the story so naturally as the sequels were released I had no interest in them and it wasn't until 2020 that I gave the movie a second chance mainly because I was watching a lot of action movies at the time and the Bourne franchise had always been recommended to me as one of the best spy action movies out there and now that I have watched all the Bourne movies I regret not watching them sooner as I really enjoyed them and have now even started reading the books they are based on by Robert Ludlum.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is about a man who is found and rescued by a passing fishing boat in the middle of the ocean with bullet holes in his back on the brink of death after being saved he wakes up with no memory of who he is or where he came from his only clue is a tiny laser pointer/projector that's found embedded in his hip which projects text of a bank address and a safety deposit box number when the boat reaches shore he is given enough money by the fishing crew who saved his life to make it to the bank and hopefully discover his identity but he soon begins to realise that maybe it's better to forget his past than uncover the truth behind who he is.<br/><br/>Matt Damon gives an excellent performance as Jason Bourne really bringing to life Ludlums classic character Damons performance would be one of the most memorable in his career and he would return to play the character again four more times each time being just a memorable and action packed as this one.<br/><br/>This is one of the best spy, action movie franchises out there along with other classics in the genre like the Bond movies the action scenes are well done and are done with practical effects that give the movie a more realistic and unique feel with a story that's both interesting and thought provoking keeping you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of stylish action movies that give you an enjoyable story with great characters and awsome fight scenes."

"Easygoer10","9","1","1","11 February 2019"," Terrific
","As with most action (and other type) films now, the first of the best. That is absolutely true here. The Jason Bourne series of films, which is at 5 and counting now, is quite good. After the 3rd film, I thought it was already wearing thin, and had closure. One thong you can count on, is when a studio has a hit, they will wear it out, and that is proven here. When the 4th and 5th versions came out, it simply became a game of seeing how many different people can be roped into the same roles. I just saw this film again on HBO (of course; it's 17 years old now!). Even though I have seen this at least a dozen times, it's the 1st time I noticed Walton Goggins in it, who has been cast in a slew of films the past decade. I had noticed Gabriel Mann before in several fims, but the 1st time I noticrd Goggins was in ""Predators"" (2010). Anyway, I still like this film very much; it launched a whole genre, in my opinion. Soeaking of multiple films, the extreme are the ""Fast & Furious"" films. The film series should have stopped long before Paul Walker was killed in a high speed car wreck. The true face of greed shone brightly when the studio (and actors) kept making them; it is incredibly disrespectful to have done so. Pardon the digression. This film, ""The Bourne Identity"", is terrific. I liked how Doug Liman handled the end, with Franka Potente is found by Matt Damon, and (ultimately) kindle a relationship.<br/><br/>My main problem is Clive Owen doesn't have a larger role. He is truly a brilliant actor. He made up for it, hiwever over tge nrxt decade; appearing in many excellent films, like ""Children of Men"", ""The International"" (which the big shootout in ""John Wick 2"" copied completely, and not half as well), etc."
"vithiet","9","1","1","29 December 2018"," This first Bourne movie was a welcome refresh of the spy action thriller genre
","This was a refreshing take on the spy action thriller movie that helped re-set the genre's standards for the following 2 decades. Matt Damon was perfectly cast in the role."
"Badmoviessuck","8","1","1","16 December 2018"," Spi movie done right
","This movie is good.
The reason that it's so good is because of Jason bourne.<br/><br/>CHARACTER
Jason bourne is an compelling character who goes through an pretty great character arc cause if Jason bourne wasn't as good as a character as he is this movie would have been a 3/10.
In the beginning of the movie we already get to know what his name is and his name is, when his birthday is and where he was born, that's all we know about him but then we see that he has a lot of passports saying that he lives in Canada Schweiz etc.
And then when get to see that he has a hidden compartment and there, there is guns and money.
We never know why he took all of the money and threw the gun i think it's because he was aware that people where watching him so he needed to take the stuff and escape and that beginning scene was amazing.
So we get to know a bit who Jason bourne is.
His desire is easy, survival, he want's to try to do the right thing and survive while knowing more about who he is that's his two desire's.
the people who are giving him a challenge doing so is Alexander and his team they are tracking bourne to kill him.
He dosen't face a lot of challenges but it's a fun ride nonetheless.
And change he dosen't change a lot as a person which isn't a flaw in the movie.
The change we get is that bourne remembers what happend and what he did and who he really is.<br/><br/>RELATIONSHIP
This is gonna be short but i like how they deal'd with the relationship between Bourne and Marie. They kissed and they are a couple but they don't show that they are an actual couple cause the thing i hate with certain movies is when characters relationship dosen't develop that well but they become a couple and they act like a real couple kissing each other loving each other even though their relationship wasn't that much developed but that dosen't happen in the bourne identity.
They kiss in one scene and that's it, they show a little bit that they love each other but they don't show that much and Marie isn't even there like 30 or 40% of the movie cause bourne made a choice to keep her safe.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is decent.
I feel like they could have gone more creative with the action cause all it was, was Jason fighting bad guy's and it just felt like there was no emotion to the action.
Example: the car chase, it was the worst scene in the movie cause it felt tedious and it didn't have any stakes.
Most of these action scenes don't have any stakes but it didn't bother me that much.<br/><br/>VERDICT
The bourne identity is a solid movie i think you guys will like cause it has a great character arc when it comes to Jason bourne"

","This espionage movie is the first in the series of Jason Bourne films based on the popular coterie of books of the same name. They succeed where the current James Bond films fail. While Daniel Craig's sociopath Bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy, the emotional sub plot in the Jason Bourne films are direct, focused and sensible.<br/><br/>It makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is, even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move. Throughout the series, he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so, blazes a path toward redemption. Having read two of the originals books this series is based upon, I can say that the Jason Bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor Matt Damon had a lot to do with that. This is an excellent action espionage series of films."

I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie but let's just say it's a lot. Everything about this movie is incredible...and the soundtrack is just incredible by John Powell. Here on IMDb I can only give this movie a maximum of 10 out of 10, but my true rating is 1,000 out of 10."
"CinemaCocoa","9","1","1","13 April 2017"," The Bourne Identity is a superb and solid action thriller that took everyone by surprise
","I imagine a lot of people forget the more humble, stealthy experience that is the beginning of the Bourne story.<br/><br/>When a man is found afloat in the ocean he finds he has no memory of who he is. When a shadowy covert operation begins to send assassins after him and watch his every move, terrible truths are revealed as he is on the run.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed films like The Fugitive, The Bourne Identity was a natural progression for me, it is probably a massively underrated film especially since its own series got so bombastic. Identity is such a moody, quiet and real experience. Damon plays a very subtle character in Jason Bourne; a man who has no identity to define himself with, but has hard truths to find answers for. The film is not exposition heavy, even when it frequently bounces from our hero to the men hunting him, it maintains a strong sense of tension and mystery without ruining it with blatancy or over explaining everything. Something action movies do far too often. Directed by Doug Liman (not Paul Greengrass, who would continue the series) and scored by John Powell, the film is drenched in a great atmosphere of tension and puzzle solving.<br/><br/>The characters too are compellingly human, everyone is performing extremely well here, Brian Cox, Chris Cooper and Franka Potente, Clive Owen is even briefly in this well cast film. No one feels out of place, unnecessary or poorly written.<br/><br/>The action sequences are great too. From what I remember of Greengrass' follow-up Supremacy there was a lot of shaky cam, and I was surprised at the lack of shaky cam in this movie. Sequences are very well shot, giving kinetic weight yet not loosing the audience in the process (and this was after Gladiator, when everyone wanted to do shaky-cam!) There's an awesome car chase too involving Bourne escaping in an old Mini Cooper, very memorable stuff.<br/><br/>All in all The Bourne Identity is a superb and solid action thriller that took everyone by surprise, propelling one of the biggest action/espionage franchises since Bond forward."

","Matt Damon is perfect in this movie, but he may have grown too mature and experienced in the follow-ups of this movie.<br/><br/>I know it is correct for a movie to be different from novels, but these changes in movie, which are different from the novel, is convincingly good enough. The follow-ups (Supremacy and Ultimatum) had too many changes that went too far and would not beat this one. But if the changes of both follow-ups are considered reasonable, then they should gotten a new good actor, who is Matt Damon, and not grown too mature and experienced like Matt Damon, TBH, IMO."
"AmyJenson1995","9","1","1","19 February 2017"," So thrilling
","When we talk about spy movies, we always think first about James Bond or Mission Impossible. We think gadgets, supermodel lovers, lavish glamour and the top edged super car each one of us would love to get an hand onto.<br/><br/>But the Bourne saga is so much different. We don't have any of these. We just have a man, Jason Bourne, struck by amnesia after being found in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, shot and unconscious. A man who tries to find out who he is and how he got there. A man who is also trying to escape from a bunch of mysterious assassins relentlessly tracking him down to kill him and Marie, the woman who's helping him despite her in his quest, showing his unsuspected unarmed combat skills to survive.<br/><br/>And we have a lot of action too, efficient and very enjoyable to see. Each of the combat scenes is really thrilling and so is that car chase throughout Paris. It's so well executed and you don't need anything more to keep us entertained.<br/><br/>The story itself is thrilling as we follow Jason and Marie throughout their journey from Zurich to Paris, watching them getting really close to each other while trying to stay alive facing those CIA assassins. Of course there is no doubt that Jason is a CIA assassin himself but that's not what causes the thrill. Watching them trying to survive is what makes us so attached and completely in.<br/><br/>The leading couple, Matt Damon and Franka Potente, are truly awesome in their respective parts. Matt is mysterious and cold. He's not much more different from the killers he takes down but he's opening himself with Franka who plays that ordinary woman coping with his own problem but whose life changes forever when she accepts to bring Bourne to Paris with her Austin Mini and help him in his quest. We are so far from the supermodel and the super car for sure.<br/><br/>But that's something we should look for: realism. Those gadgets and the glamour is cool but so superficial. Jason and Marie are much more like us besides the lethal and instinctive skills of Jason of course. We're feeling so much more attached to them and this is one of the movie's strengths. Maybe that's what pushed the James Bond creators to rethink their copy and deliver us Casino Royale."
"chrishavluciyan","8","1","1","15 February 2017"," Brilliant action movie with an actual plot
","Jason Bourne Identity is not like the action films you are used to. It's different and has an impressive plot.<br/><br/>The film starts with a man floating in the ocean, seemingly dead. After being rescued by a boat, the ship doctor brings Jason Bourne back to life by removing bullets from his body. Bourne – whose identity is lost and doesn't remember anything – begins a journey trying to discover who he is and uncovers some mysteries along the way.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, this movie isn't one of the clichés that involves lots of bungee-jumping, explosions, women, and no plot.<br/><br/>The Jason Bourne series is also a book adaptation – which I haven't read yet – such as James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Although I like the movie in general, I wasn't convinced with the fighting scenes. They didn't give me ""the feeling"". Jason Bourne is an agile fighter, flawless in combat. However, at the back of my mind, the fighting scenes seemed unrealistic and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Overall the movie has got a decent plot, brilliant actors and neat cinematography. You will probably like this movie if you are looking for a more realistic action movie to watch."
"dougdoepke","Null","1","1","12 February 2017"," So Where Are The Good Guys
","The movie reminds me of a Hitchcock thriller. Of course, Hitch filmed during a period of much slower tempo, and would likely have emphasized emotional psychology over slam-bang action. Still, it's a heckuva thriller. Bourne's got more lives than a cat, and he'd better. That's because a secret agency of the US gov't has got him in their sights. Seems the poor guy was an assassin for them, but on one assignment got shot, thrown into the sea, and lost his memory. Now he's trying to find out who he is, but in the process is jeopardizing agency plans for something or other. So now they're using all their techno-wizardry to take him out. It's like banks and banks of blinking circuits on his trail. From Bourne's standpoint, it's like he's up against an entire unseen universe. Good thing he's got as many tricks up his sleeve as the agents tracking him.<br/><br/>I guess you could say this isn't exactly a promotional for our covert agencies. Their bureaucrats appear ruthless and unforgiving, especially headman Conklin whose neck is on the line. On the other hand, I think we sympathize more with Bourne than like him, given the bloody trail he leaves behind. Still, I like the way the screenplay eases him into the relationship with Marie, making it more credible. What I do have reservations about is that over-long and incredible car chase. Seems to me that careful use of a less can ironically add up to a significant more, a lesson this sequence needs to apply. Anyway, Damon's persuasive despite his boyish looks, while Potente gets to show her chops and in fairly subtle fashion. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie's a white-knuckle two hours. It also registers a popular change in how audiences view our gov't's covert agencies, plus the slimy politicians who pitch for them."

","Funny that in the DVD bonus they never mention that this movie is a remake of a TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain (1988) which was a far better film. I personally don't think that you make a good action film just shaking the camera around like crazy, MTV style. There was more in the original movie and in the book that they left out in this ""easier"" version; so much they left out that this movie doesn't really have legs on its own. I reccomend the vision of the ""old"" film instead of this. Franca Potente doesn't really make a good acting in this one just like the other female role in the original film who is a very cold and empty character. Most of the characters in this new version don't have personality, they just stand there in the movie... MOst annoying is the boring soundtrack and the special bonus video by Moby. What does that have to do with the film? Another one of those useless video for a completely out of tone soundtrack. Some nice action but because of the shaky camera you don't really enjoy those, at least that goes for me..."

","The book the movie is based on is quite good.  There was a two part TV movie made in 1988 that was followed the book quite closely but bad acting and low budget made to be just an average spy-thriller.  The new (2002) version is very typical of Hollywood screw ups by tuning good idea into video game (run and shoot as enemies popping up from every direction).  No suspense, no twists and turns, no need to think (this brain function doesn't get performed in Hollywood), the plot in full view after first 15 minutes."

","Absolutely do not waste your time or money seeing this movie!  I assume that everyone who gave this movie a good rating has never read the book.  This movie has very little in common with the masterpiece written by Robert Ludlum.  Hollywood has changed everything from the book.  I couldn't believe it when they introduced Marie as a ""gypsy"" rather than a Economist w/ a Ph.D.  Where is Carlos, the world's greatest terrorist who provides the main story line in the book?  They wrote him completely out of the book! Instead of Carlos' henchmen trying to kill Bourne, the movie has CIA operatives trying to kill him.  They even changed the spelling of Cain to Kane, why? I stood up and literally booed when the credits rolled.  I should have left 10 minutes into the movie, but I guess I just wanted to see how bad they could screw it up.  On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst you can screw up a adaptation of a book into a movie, the Bourne Identity gets a 10. Puke - I'm vomiting now just thinking about it."

","I truly believe that this is the worst mid- to high-budget film I've ever seen. I don't want to insult the author of the books, for the sequel was quite enjoyable, but this film was indescribably bad - in fact, I feel that in all future DVD releases of the trilogy it should be ruthlessly cut down into a 10 minute introduction to the second installation.<br/><br/>Where to start? The plot. There is no plot. Other than the tired old premise of someone important losing their memory and turning against their former companions, which isn't really properly explored. The ending leaves much to be desired, such as an ending other than one you might write at 3 AM to meet a deadline.<br/><br/>Since the film was produced for an American audience, it would be unfair and stupid to complain that all of the French people were speaking English. I'm willing to accept that we're watching a magic translation of some kind, but not when they dip in and out of French, making it clear that they are supposed to be speaking largely English. Why were all the American agents large Englishmen with Yorkshire accents? Why were all the assassins incompetent, firing 6 shots when 1 would have been enough to kill the target? This film had no moral message. The main character, it is painfully obvious from the start, is a trained killer. His enemies are trained killers. The romance felt like it had been written by Edward Bellamy. Nothing was satisfactorily resolved (in fact, in the second film there are several references to scenes I assume were edited out of the first).<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity? More like the Burned Indelibly. Onto my brain. Because it was so bad."

There's nothing more to it than that. Nothing too silly like Bond films, but no real suspense or drama either. Casting was good. Brian Cox never gives a bad performance and Clive Owen's turn about in character once caught is a nice touch. I think you need to feel for the characters a little, but I couldn't bring myself to feel one way or another about them. All in all a bit of a let down. I must confess I will still watch the Bourne Supremacy when I get the chance so it can have been all bad."

They travel to Paris and try to unravel his mystery identity, but the answers are not to his liking and sinister agents are quickly on their trail ...<br/><br/>This is a handsome spy-drama based on a book by Robert Ludlum, which deserves kudos for being a traditional, no-jokes, European action thriller in the vein of The Ipcress File or Day Of The Jackal. It has terrific art direction, some fine set-pieces (the escape from the Zurich embassy, the Paris car chase), some excellent locations and features a great percussive score by John Powell. For me though, the plot is just a bit too familiar and clichéd; the big bad CIA have computers that can show them what's happening on any street-corner in the world but can't find one guy even when they know what he looks like, where he lives and how he operates. The amnesia shtick is good (though a bit derivative of The Long Kiss Goodnight, where Cox plays a similar role) and the first half of the movie is very enjoyable but the resolution sucks - Bourne turns out to be a badass assassin who gets all maudlin at the sight of his victim's kids ? Gimme a break - did he flunk Objectivity 101 at hit-man college ? As a grownup spy thriller though this is fine entertainment, and zips along at a terrific pace.

","The premise of the movie, which comes from the Ludlum novel upon which it is based, is that of a mysterious character suffering from amnesia, attempting to rediscover his past while other mysterious people are trying hard to kill him. All movies require a suspension of disbelief to work, and I found this one partially successful. The acting ranged from mediocre to excellent, with Chris Cooper delivering one of the strongest performances of all as the CIA agent desperately trying to put the genie back in the bottle. Matt Damon is OK as Jason Bourne, but I just don't think he has much dramatic range. At times he looks a little too much like the nice young man next door rather than the superbly trained assassin he is supposed to be. Brian Cox, Orso Guerrini, and Clive Owen do more with less in much smaller roles. Franka Potente is believable and interesting to watch as the accomplice/love interest. She is attractive but not so drop-dead gorgeous that it gets in the way. I enjoyed the car chase sequence in Paris, the European setting, and pace of the movie. It was MUCH more interesting and less formulaic than most spy movies I've seen."

But somehow, this film failed to deliver.<br/><br/>Certainly, Matt Damon was believable as the confused assassin, certainly all the ingredients of car chases, espionage and techno gadgets were there. But none of it ever came together and really 'did it' for me. There was virtually no chemistry with the leading lady, and it all just seemed like it had been done before. Maybe the knowledge that there was a sequel ruined it - at no point did I feel that Bourne was in any danger, and I already know the ending. Disappointing."

The other problem is that Matt's character,<br/><br/>Jason Bourne is a mix of good and evil, and that works for a Drama like for<br/><br/>instance the ten performances I have seen as William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet',<br/><br/>but not for an action flick like this."

","It's really sad when you see a potentially good filmmaker go Hollyweed. Here Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) proves he's no smarter than the average actor out to make a buck, and Matt Damon, who's made mostly intelligent choices in his career, joins him. What's really sad is how they've seemed to convince themselves they've made something 'different' instead of just the usual Hollyweed tripe. This is tired, trite, predictable stuff. No surprises at all. But then this was written by a man who specializes in tired, badly written novels. The Stephen King of spy thrillers. There are plot holes you could drive the proverbial Mack truck through, as usual. And the 'action' sequences are just plain dull and predictable.

"CrazyRu","2","3","6","20 October 2002"," The action not worth watching especially if you've read the book
","There is always a chasm between a book and its screen version. Some rare creators manage to overcome this gap and make equally good movie, although not necessarily mirroring word after word. But in the case of BI I agree with Krokor's from Australia doubts on whether the screenwriter actually read the novel of the same name or just heard of it. So, watching this movie (luckily, for free, otherwise i'd have regretted the spent money) i tried to forget what is it made after. The problem is that it didn't help to improve the impression either. The movie has too many blunders, the scenes which you just don't believe (it's not sci-fi, after all). I understand the eternal problem of the lack of time, but the explanation of the plot behind the Organisation totally lacked clarity, not to say the question with those secret pills.<br/><br/>
All i liked about this movie was the car chase - rather good promotion of the car. Though probably the character of Franka Potente should have looked a bit more upset about the injured Parisians in the car crashes, if she is so sensitive about loving the killer. But surely that question never was a problem for most of the screenwriters of the actions (anyone watched a car chase from ""Beware of the car""? that one is a good, although funny and unreal exception).<br/><br/>So i can't recommend watching this stuff, especially if you've read the book and like it."

I must admit the possibilities presented by the plot are numerous, but the script just failed to take advantage of them. Of course, we all knew how it was going to end up, before we even took our seats.  Matt Damon was obviously going to be the amazing hero that we know and love him to be.  Unfortunately, it was no Legend of Bagger Vance comeback, but we knew what we were getting ourselves into. My highest expectations lay in the realm of what would make this particular action film unique.  I didn't find much.  I had to moan out loud when the Bond-esque, and wholly gratuitous romance began.  Granted, I have a soft spot for our sexy Lol(it)a, but I just didn't want this film to be a standard repitition of movies past. The ending was the biggest disappointment.  It was just a bit too BLAH.  I think the confrontation in the safe house was p*** poor, and left me longing for the excitement of the car chase that occurred way too early in the film.

Not only does it NOT have any resemblance to Ludlum's book, it doesn't even deserve to lick the boots of the Robert Chamberlain miniseries, and when you're worst than a Chamberlain miniseries, you're REALLY bad! The film is one big chase where Bourne is pursued by dumb French cops (gee, isn't that an oxymoron?) and the Evil American Government (notice the capitalization) that goes around murdering civilians like they breathe air. There is no subtlety whatsoever and I'm at a loss why they name this movie after Ludlum's book. Talk about tarnishing a great book!"
"cbrandt86","1","8","26","14 October 2002"," ""Loose"" is the keyword
","The promos for ""The Bourne Identity"" mention that it is ""loosely"" based on Robert Ludlum's book bearing that same title.  ""Loose"" is exactly the term for this film.<br/><br/>For starters, there is absolutely very little connection between the greatness of the book and the littleness of the screenplay.  Indeed, this book-screenplay combo might well form the perfect example for illustrating the phrase ""digging a mountain to discover a mouse"".<br/><br/>My major grouse relates to the characterisation of the protagonist.  In the book, it is one long, intense, and involving journey of self-discovery, one that the reader not only vicariously enjoys, but also relates to her own life.  The screenplay contains zilch of this aspect.<br/><br/>Therefore, there is little sense in grading this screenplay.  The very concept is flawed.  It is pure F at the very outset.  Of course, if you were to view the film minus this background of the book, it seems an okayish thriller, but that's not the point.  Over here is a masterpiece that could've made an exceedingly good screenplay.  Instead, its gone to the dogs.<br/><br/>The most awful thing about this whole business is that the book's author Robert Ludlum himself is the Executive Producer, hence, must've personally approved the screenplay.  I am afraid he's getting on in years, perhaps he ought to go in for MRI scanning to check for cerebral strokes.  No person in full control of his creative faculties could've allowed such a degeneration of book content, especially when it is his own.  If he rushed into the job because of financial considerations, then its a case of penny wise and pound foolish, for a neat job of this screenplay would've surely assured good business for the sequels.<br/><br/>To sum up, losing one's hold on the creative faculty isn't a good thing at all."
"BernMaya","1","5","14","29 May 2006"," Another great novel, butchered by Hollywood. When will they get it right?
","Where do I begin???? Did Mr Ludlum loose his mind before he passed away? How could he allow Hollywood to destroy the beauty of his finest novel, my favorite spy novel of all time? ""Based on a novel by Robert Ludlum"" is an understatement. There is nothing from the novel except the name of the main character Jason Bourne -who is not even the true identity of the main character, but his CIA cover - and the fact that he had amnesia and had a microchip planted in his hip, that's it. Oh, no wait, he also worked for a CIA cell called Treadstone 71. Where is the true assassin, Carlos the Jackal, the reason why Treadstone created the Bourne identity altogether? The script writers obviously have a very naive and distorted understanding of how the CIA works. My dad was a CIA officer and I can assure you that they do not go around killing people all over the world, innocent as well as guilty, just because someone at headquarters ordered them to do that. They also don't sentence one of their field officers to death simply because they lost contact with him. In the novel, David Webb was a washed out CIA officer who underwent plastic surgery to take over the identity of well known assassin called Jason Bourne. He spoke many languages, European and oriental, and was sent to draw out Carlos from his hideout. The beauty of the story is his relationship with the Canadian economist Marie St-Jacques and his quest to find out who he was. In the movie, Jason Bourne had to run away from other CIA assassins, while in the novel, it was Carlos and his men who were after him. the CIA was trying to figure out what happened to him, not kill him. And whose idea was it to cast Matt Damon in the lead role? Jason Bourne is supposed to be in his 40s and not a young looking kid. In the Bourne Supermacy, he actually is a college professor and Marie gets kidnapped (I'm sure the Hollywood version is completely different, have not seen it yet). When Hollywood turned Mission Impossible into a movie, they had the entire team killed, turned the team leader into a traitor, and left Ethan Hunt to be the solo hero. Now they butchered the Bourne identity altogether. Please read the story, or at least watch the TV movie with Richard Chamberlain. It is more faithful to the novel. What a disappointment this was. If a story is good enough to be a bestseller, why change it? Oh and the scene where Matt Damon rides a corpse down 7 floors and then walk away without a scratch... I mean come on. Are you kidding me?"

Unfortunately, this movie never improved.<br/><br/>Supposedly there is mystery, intrigue, action, and suspense. But not much in my opinion, and I appreciate other movies that are action packed and suspenseful and I really love an intricate mystery. But as the story unfolds it never gets any more interesting. The woman who drives him to Paris and becomes a sidekick of sorts adds very little to the story except for someone to react to him and a reason for him to talk out loud. I was hoping for intricacy with her in the storyline, some backstabbing, some former knowledge of him, something of depth, but no.<br/><br/>What I thought was weakest was the characterizations and bordered on laughable was that of the African minister and that played by Julia Stiles. A teen movie princess turned into some threatening head of secret ops? Completely unbelievable. They both seemed comical and you knew they were supposed to be serious. All they served to do was to make Matt Damon slightly greater in stature in his role.<br/><br/>Even the car chase scene was silly. A Mini Cooper? Come on, it wasn't a goofy golf course.

Clive Owen's character had so much potential, but was just unexploited. The fight scenes were not bad and I think Matt Damon did an excellent job and Franka Potente looked great and did a decent job, but the story never came together for me, even though I could tell there was the making of a very good story. Given the first line of dialog of Jason on the ship with the captain I could tell that they were trying to put the struggle of the character in 1 minute of the movie, when it probably made a great part of the book.

Unable to remember who he is or what happened he goes to the bank to find many passports, a lot of money and a gun.  When he leaves the bank he finds that he is being targeted by the police and another, more sinister force. As he puts the pieces together he realises someone is trying to kill him. But who? And why?<br/><br/>I went to see this for free at the audience preview in Birmingham and I was genuinely looking forward to it and I pretty much wasn't disappointed.  The plot is nothing special and doesn't go anywhere too surprising but it still makes for an enjoyable ride and is quite thrilling.  The journey is good and it is fun to uncover Jason's past and skills with him.  The ending is OK but it has some elements that are dumb  like he's a killer (but he's a nice killer who can't kill kids!) and the usual happy Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I don't know how closely it followed that but I think they did a good job despite falling into several clichés along the way.  The locations are well used and the director doesn't go into travel agent mode the way many directors do when you give them European landmarks to film.  The pacing of the movie was a little too slow at times and there were patches where it dragged  but then the thrills did last for the majority.  The lack of explanation in the plot bothered me a little bit, but I suspect sequels are already in the pipeline.  Also I kept thinking of how much fun the Long Kiss Goodnight was!<br/><br/>Damon was pretty good  he was convincing and cool, but maybe a little bland at times.  Potente I don't like.  She got annoying with all her swearing in German etc.  She did OK but I wasn't ever totally sold on her character. Chris Cooper is great despite being office bound for the majority.  Brian Cox was also good but why was he cast? Was it an in-joke that he was also in `The Long Kiss Goodnight'?  I don't know why Stiles was in this for all she got to do  maybe she had a free weekend to do some shots!  My only disappointment was the screen time of Adewale Agbaje.  He is a great actor (doubters should watch his 3 season performance in Oz on HBO), and I hoped he would have a big role.  Alas he doesn't have much screen time and his role is only his usual Nigerian stuff with no scope for showing what he can do.  Someone give this man a film vehicle to show his skills please!<br/><br/>Overall this is a solid thriller.  The plot is a bit clichéd but it moves along well and is only occasionally a bit slow.  The ending is the price you pay for a Hollywood blockbuster but other than that it's harmless Saturday night fun and thrills!"

","Look, I don't mind if a movie differs from a book, if the changes are equally as good, better, or more cinematic.<br/><br/>But the only thing this movie has in common with the book, besides the name of the character and a few people in the movie, is the original premise.<br/><br/>Beyond that, this film is just different.  And it is far worse in the change.  They tried to skew it younger, and meaner, and made the US government more evil.<br/><br/>It is less fun, less realistic, far shallower, and just stupid most of the time.<br/><br/>I can't understand why they took a perfectly good book, which had been made into an award winning two part TV movie, and made it into such a piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Even my cousin, who is a manager and producer, and loves most films, was not at all impressed with this film.  I was shocked, and showed me just how bad it was.<br/><br/>Luckily, there were some cool scenes, and Matt Damon was pretty good with what they gave him, but that can't make this movie worth paying $10 to see."

The action sequence was good, really good, but what truly stood out was the script and dialogue. Instead of a character that is just there to be a hero but nothing else, the movie revitalize the idea that a good person, a good character does not necessary need to save the world or be a hero just for the sake of being one.

","The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect.<br/><br/>I Bourne is trained. Is he ever. He speaks several languages, is a formidable martial artist, has highly trained powers of observation and memory, knows all the spy tricks and is a formidable driver. We see that during a sensational chase scene through the streets of Paris, much of it through narrow alleys, down flights of steps, and against traffic<br/><br/>While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information.<br/><br/>Douglas Liman, the film's executive producer, directs it. He directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spy craft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere. His direction seems to slow down the piously choreographed chase scenes & martial fights to focus on heavy exposition between Damon & Potente's characters as they unveil they myriad of mysteries regarding Bourne's fishing out of Mediterranean waters & his very identity; before expert action film director Paul Green Grass took over in the second film & speed the film up with his shaky hand held camera & fast editing & mixing style. Liman does not playing out the film as a stage play in which we are acquainted with the characters' mystery & conspiracy strung ids & limited superegos.<br/><br/>The fights are just impressive, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, are among the most believable martial arts based fight scenes ever seen. No big grand gestures or Olympian kicks just fast, nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort.<br/><br/>This movie is better than the sequels in the Bourne series due to the romantic interest between Jason and Marie and the humanity expressed in the script versus the action in the sequels. The script has some special lines, such as Jason's ""Just keep on talking, it's relaxing,"" and ""How do I know that?"" and Marie's ""I said I was your personal assistant, I just asked for it"" and ""Nobody does the right thing,"" and the dying agent's line ""We always work alone."" The story raises issues about organizations which tend to eliminate their own members. In the end, truth and justice win out on an individual level, if not a societal level which, it seems, was the author's message.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, a great opener to a trilogy that Green Grass would enhance by letting the script dissolve in the film with the pace & mood of a classic, nearly Hitchcock, espionage thriller. The entire story is a set up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well crafted and acted, we give it a pass. The Bourne Identity is excellently paced and brings a great deal of realism to the spy genre. The fight sequences are fast and believable, the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of Jason Bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify with."

","16 June 2002. Taking into account three or four weak points in this spy thriller, The Bourne Identity boasted a wonderful car chase scene that didn't necessarily go over the top, which included much more realistic images of passing cars, a Matt Damon that hit the ground (sometimes literally) running with his deft moves and struggling to find his identity. There's even a female who knows when to stay and when to run. I can't imagine, though, how another CIA assassin can expose himself so easily in the movie, unlike Enemy at the Gates, the cat and mouse game was too easy which takes place in an open field, how a meeting place could be so lax in CIA surveillance, and how one character (a supporting role) could ever be left a live at the end of the movie. But even so, the movie is compelling, always entertaining, and pretty easy to follow. Today's current events, however, cast a deep shadow over this movie now that CIA assassinations appear to have received the stamp of approval by the President, the U.S. government, and even the American public. I guess the collateral damage and corresponding retaliation is worth the risk."

","The world of espionage has been captivating the attention of audiences for decades. Almost everyone loves a good spy movie. In 2002, Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity, adapted from the novel by Robert Ludlum, which took a new and interesting take on the classic espionage thriller. The Bourne Identity raised the bar for spy thrillers and started off a series that has spanned 5 movies and 14 years.<br/><br/>In the movie, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat. He has been shot twice in the back, has no idea who he is, and the only form of identification on him is a laser-pointer-like gadget holding the information to a Swiss bank account that had been implanted in his hip. Soon after reaching the mainland, Bourne realizes that he isn't the kind of person who works a 9-5 desk job. He has increased awareness to his surroundings and his own limits, and he can easily beat up whoever gets in his way. After finding numerous passports, a lot of money, and a gun in his Swiss safe deposit box, Bourne enlists the help of Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris in exchange for 10,000 dollars. Bourne and Marie develop feelings for each other on the trip to Paris, so upon reaching Paris, Marie decides to stay with Bourne and help him discover who he is. Following clues to Bourne's identity, Bourne and Marie travel around Europe trying to piece together who Bourne is and was, all while trying to avoid the CIA. The CIA believes Bourne has gone rogue, and they are doing everything they can to track him down and kill him.<br/><br/>The movie is centered on Bourne's search for who he is. This search for identity is what keeps the audience involved and working with Bourne to piece together who he is. In a scene soon after Bourne leaves the fishing boat, Bourne is sleeping on a park bench and is woken up by two police officers who are looking for trouble. Bourne replies to the officers in their own language without hesitation, and this is our first clue that there is a lot more to Bourne than we know. After one officer pulls out their club and the other draws their gun, Bourne knocks them both out and disassembles the gun in a matter of seconds. After this incident, Bourne looks at his arms, wondering the same thing as the audience, ""How does he know how to do that?"" During these fight scenes, the camera is quickly shifting from angle to angle to show the details of what is happening in the fights. This, combined with hearing what Bourne is hearing, gives the audience more of a first-hand fight experience. Also, the lighting and color during the action scenes of the movie is typically brighter and more vivid. Throughout the movie, reaction shots on Bourne are frequently utilized because Bourne is always the first one to realize when there is danger close. <br/><br/> As Bourne is piecing together what he used to do, he doesn't want to believe that he killed people for a living. He realizes that he and the people around him will never be safe until he ends things with the CIA, so he decides to fight back so that he can live a different life. A life that includes Maria.
Near the end of the movie, when Bourne is confronting the CIA agent who was in charge of him, the agent says that Bourne is ""a malfunctioning, 30 million dollar weapon,"" and tells him some details about the mission he was on right before Bourne was found by the fishermen. The agent says that Bourne had set up the entire assassination plan himself. Flashes of light, pictures, and different lighting is then used to show a flashback to when Bourne is on the boat of the target where the assassination was supposed to take place. During this flashback, we see that Bourne failed the assassination because the target's young children were laying on top of him, and Bourne couldn't kill the target knowing that the guy's young children would be forced to watch their father's assassination. This is when we learn one of the most important pieces of information relating to Bourne's identity. He is an assassin, but he is much more than just an expensive weapon. Bourne has compassion and a conscious that guides him. This character progression causes The Bourne Identity to be an enjoyable film from start to finish."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","0","19 August 2018"," It's one of the best in its genre; suspenseful and exhilarating.
","The only real issue with this fast-paced, exciting and involving mystery-action-thriller (one that truly uses all three genres as core tenants of its narrative) is its occasionally 'cartoony' sound-design. This is most prevalent in its fight sequences (mainly in its stand-out 'pen' fistfight) and severely reduces the impact of these otherwise engrossing and believable - not to mention realistic - set-pieces. However, it's a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, considering that this is easily one of the tightest and most intriguing action-thrillers of its generation. Along with its two sequels, it kicked off a whole new kind of movie in the way that only a true classic could, and it's a joy to watch from beginning to end. It really is masterfully constructed to be as suspenseful, engaging and exhilarating as possible while remaining remarkably restrained, too. It's also distinct from its follow-ups in that it never really shakes the camera, though it is edited quite quickly during the high-velocity moments - which include a phenomenal car chase - even if the cutting speed never reaches that of its successors. This leads to a consistently legible and uniquely styled piece that legitimately stands out as one of the best in its genre. 8/10"

","I reckon I've seen this film a while ago and wasn't really all that impressed with it so I basically let the rest of the franchise slip through my fingers. Then again that is probably a good thing since there are so many franchises, and so many films, these days that keeping up with all of them is a chore in and of itself. Still, a part of me wanted to give it another shot, even though I'm not a big fan of spy thrillers, and in a way I am really glad that I did. I guess the last time I watched it I was a somewhat tired and wasn't able to get into it. In fact, I'm sure this film is also based on an older film that I also loved (or even a book, though I haven't read the book and am unlikely to do so).
 Anyway, I suspect the plot of this film is quite well known. A man is fished out of the ocean (though how he managed to survive is beyond me - he should have been well and truly dead, especially if he is floating face down) and basically can't remember a thing. However there is something implanted in him which reveals a Swiss bank account number. To cut a long story short, it turns out that he is a skilled assassin, and is being hunted down by the CIA for some reason or another, though it turns out that he failed a mission and needs to be, well, killed. Not surprisingly he also picks up a female partner to travel with him on his adventures (ah, don't you just love Hollywood cliches).
 Well, yeah, it is a spy thriller, and it really did end up keeping me drawn in right through to the end. Okay, it turns out that you pretty much know a lot more than what he does, which does drag the film down somewhat. In a way it is a shame in that regards because it would have been so much better if they had kept the whole CIA business hidden away behind the scenes so that everything was being revealed to us as it was being revealed to him. In a way it did subtract from a lot of suspense. Not surprisingly though he does get his memories back eventually, though it is rather dubious as to how they actually came about - there really wasn't any trigger for that to happen, and once again it might have been better for it not to have actually happened.
 I'm not really all that sure if there is much more that I can say about this film though. It is sort of a straight out action thriller, and I suspect that the various sequels are going to be pretty much the same. Still, it was a pretty cool idea, though as I have mentioned it is hardly original (since I believe that it is based on a book). Of course, the period in which this film is set suggests that there was probably been some significant diversion from the original, since the good old evil empire that was the Soviet Union no longer exists, but then again this is also very much about a government agency that has gone completely out of control, though apparently it was quite like that at the height of the Cold War, with CIA operatives basically living it up in Europe. Not surprisingly this does translate over to similar films, particularly since most of the action takes place in Paris (though a part also takes place in Switzerland). So yeah, this was a pretty cool film, and I'll probably go and watch the sequels some time soon."

Jason Bourne is a relatable and unforgettable character brought to life by Matt Damon's energetic performance as well as Doug Liman's skilled direction. <br/><br/>The film has excellently shot and brilliantly choreographed action sequences. Each and every action sequence is memorable, and there are a lot of intensely thrilling moments as well. Jason Bourne is a well written character, and Matt ensures he delivers a top notch act to make this portrayal a memorable as well as realistic one. Another credit to Franka Potente, who plays her part in a terrific manner and does justice to her character which doesn't feel irritating or pointless but important instead. The entire cast fits in their respective roles and delivers a good performance. The editing is top notch, as the entire screenplay works without any hiccups.<br/><br/>That being said, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a captivating action thriller with a watertight script and no dull or unwanted moments. I'm now eager to watch the entire BOURNE film series, and undoubtedly I would love to own the DVD."

Will he live? Will he die? 90 min action chase.<br/><br/>3. Doug Liman. Tony Gilroy. Remember those names? Doug Liman is in my opinion the ultimate best director of ALL the bourne movies. I love the other Bourne versions as well, but Doug Liman made the mold. He created the original. The core. And he did so with masters skills I havent seen the equivalent of yet. Doug Liman not only directed, he also produced this debut. That means he had almost total controll over HOW he wanted to shape it. And that can be noticed in the attention to detail. Everything from editing, to photography, to soundtrack is ONE. It is a perfectly mixed blend of just the right ingredients to make Bourne one of the biggest action heroes in modern cinema. It is a rush. An adrenaline kick. And Doug Liman is to be thanked for that.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy is the screenplay writer of this classic action packed thriller, although it is based on a novel by Robert Ludlum. And however underestimated writers can become in action movies I herald the power of Tony Gilroy's words in Bourne's debut. Most of all I like the friction between the characters. Everyone is under pressure, under intense pressure. Not only Matt Damon but everybody connected to this assasin on the run story is likely to get wasted in a storm of bullets. Supporting roles are excellent, at a level unheard of in most blockbusters. That is typical of all the Bourne movies in which acting is paramount! The story and the words that make these characters believable are what Tony Gilroy is to be thanked for. And when I can believe in the characters on the screen, then I know I can enjoy a movie time and again. <br/><br/>You are about to see the very best in modern action movie history: the Bourne debut. I must have seen it dozens of times and I still cant get enough of it."

Once the plot sets it and it becomes on the move, the film becomes an instant great entertainment. The plot and storyline is relentless, like a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces take time to form any kind of sense. Filled with gripping moments and enough thrills, The Bourne Identity is one of the best action thrillers. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne, whose loss of memory becomes less disturbing than the revelations he discovers about himself. Overall, the Bourne Identity does what it maintained to do, which after 15 years later has produced several more successful sequels."

"sol-","Null","0","0","7 March 2017"," Total Recall
","Pursued by unknown enemies, a worried amnesiac tries to remember who he is and why he has such sharp reflexes in this action thriller yarn. As the protagonists discovers a stash of fake passports, each with his photograph, and as police agencies seem to track his every move, the film has a decent dose of mysteriousness. The action sequences are well filmed and memorable too, with a scene in which lead actor Matt Damon scales a large wall and a sequence in which he has to allude an assassin (played by Clive Owen) in some cornfields standing out in particular. Clocking in at around two hours though, the film sometimes feels bloated with a lot of a cutaway sequences in which military types debate what to do about Damon; while these add exposition, they also subtract from the immediacy of the action. A heavily foreshadowed romance between Damon and Franka Potente, who gives him a ride, further distracts from the central plot and Damon's personal identity crisis is hardly all that juicy. The film is all about Damon embracing his old identity as opposed to something like 'Total Recall', which is about attempting to deflect from what one once was. That said, the eventual revelation of how Damon lost his memory comes with much bite with a haunting, near-silent scene on a luxury yacht at night. Damon's increasing anxiety at not being able to get answers comes across well too with some very good scenes in which he dials up various numbers asking for his names on his various passports in the desperate hope of some clue."

","It's sad when a perfectly good novel is used only for the barest of plots and character names.  It seems that Tony Gilroy made this adaptation without even reading the book.  Mr. Gilroy went for the ""modern"" take on the movie and threw out the ENTIRE premise for there being a Jason Bourne.  Carlos the Jackal was the perfect foil for Bourne/Webb.  By eliminating him, Gilroy, had to come up with a very contrived assassin ring that has been done to death - thereby eliminating any possiblity of sequels such as The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum.  I can't believe I actually liked the 1988 version with Richard Chamberlin and Jacklyn Smith better than this one."
"Bobby_Dupea","1","4","12","2 February 2008"," Pretty Ridiculous
","What happened to ""Carlos"" in this new version? I guess he was out of date for the Y chromosome generation, huh? In this film, Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne like he was some kind of James Bond-like *superman* who get nary a scratch while fighting his many opponents. He even gets to beat up policeman and U.S. Embassy staff like there's no tomorrow while trying to find out who he is. He's like an unstoppable robot who's martial arts skills put Wesley Snipes in BLADE to shame. I suppose this, as well as the MTV-style editing and quick cuts will appeal to the teen and twenty-something head-banger idiots who think this is hot stuff, but I found it utterly implausible and ridiculous. An insult to my intelligence.<br/><br/>At least Richard Chamberlain was more believable as a man who was caught up in events beyond his control. Even in the 1988 miniseries, Chamberlain handles a gun very awkwardly and doesn't fight very well so as far as I'm concerned, he makes a more believable Jason Bourne than Damon does. Plus that was more faithful to the Ludlum book than this pile of crap.<br/><br/>Grade: F"

","As I am a huge fan of Robert Ludlum I looked forward to seeing this film and what a disappointment it was. Maybe as such a fan I should have been prepared and the review should have stated that it is only loosely based on the Ludlum novel of the same name. If I hadn't have read the book I would have been completely mystified by a lot of it. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is simply not believable and the character of Marie unrecognisable from the books. If any Ludlum/Bourne fans want to see a valid representation of the story you can do no better than to seek out the video version with Richard Chamberlain - it follows the story and amazingly enough Chamberlain IS Jason Bourne."

","Boy, was this ever a bomb! Sorry, I just can't buy any of the characters in this movie. Matt Damon as a uber-assassin who loses his nerve and memory because...why? Potente's dialogue seemed to be mostly a German expletive. And who's the Nancy Drew, secret agent-lookalike that runs the Paris operation? I also loved Matt's boss who wants to clear the safehouse in Paris of anything that will indicate a presence, and then proceeds to put his hands and fingerprints everywhere! Absolutely priceless in its stupidity. I particularly liked the dubious morality at the end, when all the killings and misery that li'l Matt has caused during his operations are magically washed away and forgiven 'cause he and Franka found love. I guess this movie is OK if all you want to see are things blowing up, cars defying all laws of gravity and physics, and people shooting big guns. Personally, I prefer a good plot and believable characters, but I guess that's not everyone's cup of tea."

","The problem with The Bourne Identity is that we've seen it all before, and done much better. We also have been spoiled by ten years of X-Files episodes, which have pretty much explored every horror theme and conspiracy theory out there.<br/><br/>Knowing that, The Bourne Identity could have been saved (like xXx, Mission Impossible) by _original_ action scenes and stunts, and by a main character who has a much more ambiguous look than Matt Damon. Damon is simply way too pretty and bland to hold your interest for very long. Franka Potente, likewise, is attractive, but in a bland, sturdy, Germanic way.<br/><br/>I dozed off half way through, woke up again and saw the second half of the movie another day. The problem is, I hadn't missed much if anything. The story could be picked up just as well with half of the movie missing - not a good sign for a thriller or spy movie.<br/><br/>They had the budget, they had lots of sort of interesting locations (Italy and France are no longer as exotic as they were 50 years ago, when no one traveled very much.), they had some stars.<br/><br/>A major issue is that the theme is not outlandish or involving enough to capture your attention. He's a spy/assassin, something went wrong on his mission, and now someone is trying to kill him. Huh? Really? Who could it be? Who cares? I mean, would your life be improved if you found out? Is it really worth over 1 1/2 hours looking at Matt Damon looking puzzled? The sparks between Damon and Potente aren't exactly flying either. And Brian Cox is now so much associated with low budget movies that I dread every time he appears on the screen. (With the exception of The 25th Hour of course - in which he actually got to act.) What happened to all the potential he showed in Manhunter?"

","I just saw these films and look forward to a sequel. These Bourne movies rock. The best action since Raiders of the Lost Ark. As opposed to the recent James Bond movies the Bourne movies actually makes sense.<br/><br/>The CIA is portrayed as a violent, corrupt brainwashing cult, and Bourne as an archetypal, warrior-hero trying to fight his way out. Meantime he is being attacked by cia-ninja assassins and he himself is one of them. These people are the only ones who fight back. Normal people don't. The CIA-treadstone, as they are called, assassins are obviously trained very well in martial arts. Highly recommended. The first one is even better than the second, I think. Bourne is more cool in the second but the story in the first one is even more astonishing. 10/10."

","As spy thrillers go, this one has handsome location scenery, car chases, narrow escapes and enough implausible fistfights and killings to keep any plot spinning until the happy ending fadeout. It's all done in a brisk, stylish, no-nonsense manner and played believably by Matt Damon (his escape from the top floor of a building would make Spiderman proud), Franka Potente as ""the girl"", and Chris Cooper who tends to overplay the role of a CIA man obsessed with capturing and killing the amnesiac-ridden hero. Matt Damon's fans will be impressed by his judo and action stunts that appear to be his own, not a double's. His overall performance, however, is a bit on the bland side and lacking in the urgency his character should be displaying.<br/><br/>The plot is never given anything but a sketchy viewpoint so that the viewer is just as baffled all the way through as the hero is. This can become a bit unsettling as we go into the second hour of the movie still not knowing why his life is in such constant danger from the CIA operatives trying to kill him. The ending leaves too many questions unanswered with less than satisfying results.<br/><br/>But for those who like spy thrillers, this one might be just what you're looking for--as long as you don't want to know all the answers."

","*** out of ****<br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a man who's found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back.  He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life.  After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity.  With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller.  It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences.  What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging.  The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.  <br/><br/>From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works.  Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry.  Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment.  Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does.  Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).<br/><br/>For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).<br/><br/>There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up.  Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, ""Hey, it's Julia Stiles!"") in a role that could have been played by just about anyone.  But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling."

Absolute suspension of intelligence and belief are required to watch the ""Bourne Identity"". The only positive feature of this flick is the genuine attempt of Matt Damon to be a serious actor. You really feel sorry for him, he is so obviously out of his depth. Damon is no spy. American Intelligence is a true oxymoron as Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are portrayed as two faced bumblers. Clive Owen should have been the main character instead of the struggling Damon, Owen and his craft are wasted and he has all of 3 or 4 lines in the film. It was nice to see Simon Adebisi from ""Oz"" in a film, even a lame one such as this. The fight scenes are mere cartoons and hilarious, and their pathetic execution are the highlights of this film. The one scene where a wild haired blonde guy with swimming goggles flies through the window firing a machine gun is the best. The fight continues in super fast and slow mode and once beaten and killed, the bad guy rises up like Nosferatu. It was a direct rip off of Jim Carey's fantasy fight scene in ""Dumb and Dumber"".

The story (sorry, didn't read the book) made fifth-grade assumptions about what goes on in CIA circles. You don't send in snipers, one miserable and random failure at a time, in plain sight, to finish a fellow op off. I'm sure even the ""incorrigible"" CIA gives their employees the benefit of the doubt. None given here.<br/><br/>I guess the Matt Damon character was the good guy--I couldn't really tell. I was so sick of his paranoia and the fact that he was so comfortable in his role of killing people (yet he had flashes of humane-ness; yeah, whatever), I wanted him dead. I was pretty sick of his girlfriend, too. This waste of time had a million holes in its plot (How'd he get to Switzerland (Switzerland is a major fortress!)? Why was the African guy targeted (I was never convinced he was good OR bad)? Why were the French so lame? Why didn't the CIA practice triangulation? Why did the CIA not practice more discrete forms of assassination? What the hell was with the blonde chick--why did we care about her? Why was the bureau chief so constipated? Weren't the French the least bit curious about the machine guns in their hotels? Why did the French guy in the countryside just up and quit?).<br/><br/>I give it a 2 for YAWNFEST!

","The TV series that preceded this is far superior. Much closer to the book and with much more depth and really good supporting cast. The only noteworthy things in the Damon version is a quite cool car chase and how sadistic Damon's ""character"" is played. When I saw this version I was hoping that it would be at least close to the original version but boy was I wrong they took out the plot the characters and missed out on the settings. Famke Potente was good in Run Lola but is miss-cast in TBI just like Chris Cooper who usually is really good in supporting roles but he probably gave up trying after reading the supercliched script. Why should he waste any of his talent in this film when surely no one else did. My advice is avoid this and instead see the original or read the book. Some very deranged people compare Matt Damon to James Bond claiming that Bond should move over , great joke. Damon is about as charismatic and believable as a ironing board in comparison."

So the coolest thing in the whole story is that advanced ""laser pointer"". (In Russian translation they called it ""microfilm"". Ugh.)<br/><br/>And, by the way, those attempts to put Slavic languages in the movies are boring too.

Throughout the entire movie the fight scenes include a lot of the use of the shaky cam technique. Shaky cam is usually used to cover up how bad a movie's action choreography is and still make the movie intense.

OK in the book he is slightly older but apart from that this movie is how I imagined things from reading the book.<br/><br/>There are things omitted, probably to keep the movie from going on too long, but it moves at a good pace and keeps you interested throughout.<br/><br/>All supporting actors are good, Franka Potente is very good and holds her own as Marie, Brian Cox is excellent as always and interesting to see both Clive Owen and Julia Stiles in relatively minor roles but carrying their parts off really well.<br/><br/>The director Doug Liman must surely get credit for bringing to the screen this complex and interesting character."
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","2","12 December 2015"," A great spy thriller - but the sequels are even better
","Hollywood comes up trumps with this engaging spy thriller, based of course on the novel by Robert Ludlum. It's a film that serves to reinforce my belief that all Hollywood thrillers shot in France are top-notch, and it's a film that employs all the modern, stylised tricks of the camera to come up with a winning formula. The story is straightforward enough: an amnesic spy falls in love, suffers numerous assassination attempts and is on the run from the police, as he desperately tries to regain his memories. Matt Damon, taking the title role, gives an engaging and likable performance and in addition proves himself worthy as a lean but powerful man of action.<br/><br/>Speaking of action, the film acquits itself well with some stunning chase sequences – the hunt in the bank is amazing and finishes off with a nicely perilous high-rise scare-show; there's a car chase with a mini that just about equals the ones in RONIN, plus the various fight sequences all employ a super-fast sped-up martial arts style fighting that looks pretty cool to me. Watch out for the bit where a ballpoint pen becomes a lethal weapon, cringeworthy stuff. Technical qualities are excellent and to enhance things further, a great supporting cast all does their best. Franka Potente is attractive and feisty as Bourne's accomplice, Maria; Chris Cooper is excellent as the stressed-out CIA man on Damon's trail; Brian Cox delivers another of those catchy, powerful extended cameo performances, and finally Clive Owen steals his scenes as a tough hit-man, nicknamed The Professor.<br/><br/>THE BOURNE IDENTITY is about as good as you can get for a modern action thriller. The storyline is complex, but gradually revealed piece by piece so that it's relatively simple to follow. Although it lacks the scope and extended time-frame of other recent spy thrillers such as SPY GAME and THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, the low-key approach to the action works nicely and the gorgeous European locations make it look refreshingly different. Intelligent, pulse-pounding and packed with intrigue and excitement – a rare treat in these modern brain-dead blockbuster days of cinema."

","A man who is nearly shot to death gets his life saved by a fisherman. He wakes with amnesia, not knowing who he is. He meets a troubled, but kind woman, Marie. He discovers he is a former assassin named Jason Bourne. Jason must fully figure out why he's being hunted by Treadstone. I think the sequels are amazing as well, but the first is still the best (Though, Bourne Ultimatum is a really close second!) This one feels raw compared to the sequels and the most passionate. I wouldn't say it's action-packed, but the story is very engrossing and there are some action scenes that are exhilarating. There is an amazing (and lengthy) car chase at around the 50 minute mark, which would prove to be a benchmark for the rest of the sequels. I also enjoyed the fight scenes. The shaky cam isn't as prominent as it is in the sequels. If the ending doesn't make you smile, I question your sanity. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is the character development. Even though Bourne is a Stone Cold killer, his transition into a caring human being was really fun to watch. He really is an anti-hero. Marie is a great character as well. She doesn't have much in her life, so why not go along for the ride? She really has nothing else. It was fun to watch Jason and Marie's relationship evolve. I questioned the casting choice of Damon at first. He didn't seem badass to me , but I'm happy to say he proved me wrong in a big way. I really can't picture anybody else as Bourne. Renner did fine as Aaron Cross in the spin off, but it wasn't the same. I also liked his paranoia as Bourne. It really added to the suspense. Damon is able to make you care about his plight. Franka Potente is solid for the most part. She is stone-faced during some of the most hectic moments, but she comes through. She's got a charm that is hard to resist. Her chemistry with Damon is fantastic and is one of the reasons this movie worked so well. Chris Cooper is really good as the villain. His use of the word ""solider"" grated my nerves though. Brian Cox is fine. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is kinda wasted. Julia Stiles is easy on the eyes and good in her role. Clive Owen shows up briefly as an assassin. <br/><br/>This is a phenomenal movie! I consider the Bourne trilogy to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time. I own all of them, and watch them at least once a year. This is still the best! <br/><br/>9.3/10"

Seriously, the movie is very good and is worth watching it. There is no way you mistake Bourne with Bond or Hunt, even if it diverges a little from Ludlum's novel it is still very good to stay on it's own, and the best part is that inspired the even better sequels, but we'll get to that later.<br/><br/>'The Bourne Identity' is worthy your time and money!"

I don't know about you guys but Matt Damon surprised me in this film because after Good Wil Hunting I never thought he would be in a role like this. He managed to surprise all of us but that is how good he is. The action was real and the supporting cast was awesome as well. The thing I like about it was Jason Bourne's use of weapons you would think were harmless. I really think more action films should have realism but that's me. And I like how intelligent it is.

","I must admit up front that I am a hard sell for films like ""The Bourne Identity"". While it's a very well made film, it's also the sort of genre that I am not drawn towards as I just don't love non-stop action. Many do--so keep this in mind.<br/><br/>The film begins very well--and very stylishly. A man is found floating in the Mediterranean--almost dead. A doctor on board the ship examines him and finds VERY bizarre things--two bullet holes in the body as well as a strange device implanted in the man's thigh! Clearly he is no ordinary guy! However, the moribund man awakens--and is clearly a guy not to be trifled with, as he's nearly dead but still a killing machine. But here is the odd part--the machine has no idea who he is, how he got there or where to go next. The film that follows consists of Jason Bourne learning who he is--all the while practically EVERYONE is chasing him and trying to kill him! The film is one chase scene after another--all well done but also a bit tiring for me. Again, you may not feel this way--if you adore non-stop action and suspense, you'll probably like this well-made thriller. As for me, it did not leave me wanting to see any of the sequels--it was good but enough for a lifetime of action/suspense for me. As for me, I just want more story and less mayhem."

Like so many other actors in so many other roles it isn't easy to imagine someone else in those roles.<br/><br/>I have listed favorite scenes in other movies, but not all movies I have reviewed. I have three scenes that I especially like.<br/><br/>The first scene I like is when Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franke Potente) leave Bourne's Paris apartment. They are cornered and Jason decides to run, but he is trying to get Marie to leave. Marie doesn't want to leave so Jason brings her along for the ride. And what a ride it is!<br/><br/>Jason drives an Austin Mini Cooper through the streets of Paris to escape the Paris Police. One of the best parts is when he drives the car down a set of stairs. He escapes the police and does so with flare. Can you imagine having a high speed car chase in a Mini Cooper? I think it is funny as hell.<br/><br/>The next best scene is when Jason confronts The Professor (Clive Owen), another agent like Bourne. He does this with flare as well. Bourne blows up a large propane tank to distract The Professor. Then Bourne runs into a field and is able to shoot and wound The Professor. After getting little information from him, Bourne watches as The Professor dies.<br/><br/>The last of my favorite scenes is after Bourne confronts Conklin (Chris Cooper), his former boss. Bourne hits Conklin and renders him unconscious, seconds later Bourne must fight his way out of the apartment building by killing four agents. One agent he kills by shooting through the forehead while falling through the air and landing on the body of one of the agents.<br/><br/>I do have some advice for those that want to read the books by Robert Ludlum or Eric Van Lustbader. Don't read the books thinking that you will be able to follow the movies. I have only ever read the first book. The only similarity between the first book and the first movie is as follows: the title, many of the character names, and Jason Bourne's amnesia. The rest of the book is completely different from the movie. I have to say that that was probably as it was supposed to be, since the book was released in 1980 and the movie came out 22 years later.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 stars out of 10."

","To say that Jason Bourne is comparable to James Bond is something of an understatement and a very underrated claim at the same time. They even have the same initials, by the way. Some might say that it is just being clichéd to compare the two, but in my mind, it truly works. Where Bond is suave and impressionable, Bourne is direct and doesn't really care what people think of him. The film definitely departs from the source material, but not to its discredit. The film manages to transcend the genre by taking the places and names from the books and create its own original story. It follows the baseline of the books, but crafts a world for our main character which is plausible and modern enough to not even appear dated. The performances are all top-notch; as it should be, the persona Damon creates as Bourne is by far the best role in the film. I would say its absolutely one of his best roles - what one would call a tour-De-force performance. However, ample support is supplied from the rest of the cast also. Potente is especially good, and even though Cooper just seems really mad all the time, it really is a testament to his acting abilities if one watches his other movies and understands his immense range. Something that only just recently came to me about these films is the diversity of the cast. There is Bourne, who is a definite loner, even when he's with Marie. He can never get over the changes that his experiences have forced him to make, and he is therefore incredibly tortured by conflicting emotions and thoughts all the time. So no matter who he interacts with, the focus is always on Bourne. He functions in all situations the same, and deals with everybody (except Marie) more or less the same. He is what he is, and you either love him or hate him - no gray area. Then we have those who are tracking and/or trying to kill him, and they have their own separate part of the movie that only sometimes interacts with Bourne. Because of all this, everything is literally on Damon's shoulders to carry the movie, and that is why he is so great. Just like Bourne, Damon has to stand out. If he doesn't, then his role means nothing, and the viewer doesn't care about what happens. This is much like what happens in ""Unknown"", the fairly recent Liam Neeson vehicle, which has a very similar storyline to the Bourne films. The movie also fits in rather nicely with the other two, and creates a viable trilogy. One might say that they prefer Liman's directing simply due to the fact he doesn't use choppy editing like Greengrass did, but I understand the need for both methods in their element and could not imagine either one to be any different. As with all three of the Bourne films, the action is astonishingly simple once one gets used to it, and anyone is more than welcome to freeze-frame and follow the choreography. Some have said that the way these films compose the action sequences is unnecessarily fast and showy. I disagree. The films' choreography is a symbol for the character of Bourne. The action is literally so fast it's over before you even realize, much like it is from Bourne's side of things. Due to his amnesia, he doesn't understand what he's doing either, per Se. It's a reflex for him to react the way he does. He just does it, without hesitation or remorse, which is exactly why he's so good as an agent. I will say that for me, the franchise's only disadvantage is for anyone who's never seen the films before. When I first watched the films, I didn't really understand it either. It was all too complicated for me at the time. But after watching all three of the Damon films (haven't seen Legacy yet) several times once I got older, I have progressively understood what is going on within each one. Once I understand what's going on, it's a piece of cake to invest myself in the story and characters. But for those who are beginners like I was at one time, the films probably seem horrible. That's when I would say to stick with them for the long haul - watch them all again, if you have to. I love these films, and I would strongly recommend them to anyone. Don't underestimate the awesomeness of Bourne."
"tieman64","Null","1","2","22 March 2013"," Quantum of Solace
","""At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist."" - John Le Carre <br/><br/>The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.<br/><br/>As action movies go, ""The Bourne Identity"" is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, ""Identity"" features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.<br/><br/>The film's sequels, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its ""running man"" plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's ""ingenious"" battle tactics now rarely surprise. <br/><br/>Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond (""Goldfinger"", we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, ""To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody."" <br/><br/>Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says ""my argument is not with you"". Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. <br/><br/>Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity (""The name's Bond. James Bond.""). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.<br/><br/>Whilst a ""liberal action film"" is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with ""what represents me?"" (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.<br/><br/>No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed ""Identity"", has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of ""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum"", is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.<br/><br/>The most interesting of the franchise, ""The Bourne Legacy"" was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In ""Legacy's"" case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are ""suicided"", and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.<br/><br/>As an action movie ""Legacy"" is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it ""legal"" for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as ""terrorists"", ""insurgents"" or, as has happened several times, simply ""animals"" (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - Worth one viewing."

","""The Bourne Identity"" is a taut, solid thriller that doesn't have to rely on explosive, over the top action and Bondian gadgetry. Matt Damon does a fine job defining the character of Jason Bourne, an amnesiac slowly reconfiguring his life as an assassin in the employ of the American government. I particularly enjoyed his martial arts scenes, though I'm wondering how much of that was Damon versus a stand-in. Franka Potente was believable as Marie, thrust into a situation that at a certain point allows for no return. The intrigue, mystery, action and chase scenes all blend together in a successful adventure that keeps one guessing, although the revelation of why Bourne failed to kill Wombosi brought the story down a notch from for me. A professional assassin wouldn't let feelings get in the way of doing the job. Another distraction was Brian Cox in the role of Abbott; I kept wondering how he could possibly look so much like Marlon Brando."

","Matt Damon plays a skilled assassin with amnesia after getting shot twice in the on the back on a mission. He meets a girl called Marie (Franka Potenete) and after, it is a huge cat and mouse chase through out the whole film. Okay, as some of you may be aware, Bourne Identity is the first of a collection of books by Robert Ludlum, and Bourne Identity the film and Bourne identity the book are two completely different things. It does not strictly follow the book so if you want to watch this film and look at it as an adaptation, then your going to be disappoint it but if you look at it as a film on its own. It is fantastic. It truly is. <br/><br/>I am glad that Matt Damon played the part because if it was someone like Tom Cruise (excluding his amazing performance in Collateral), it would be different. Not bad but different and it would not suit the intensity of the film. I was also impressed by Franka Potente as well. Clive Owen also stars in this film and does not say really say anything. But when he says his lines, it is what very emotive. Very powerful as well.

","Robert Ludlum's novel, previously the source of a 1988 mini-series for television, gets a slick, hyped-up, big-budget theatrical treatment here, with Matt Damon agreeably cast in the lead as an amnesiac with ties to the CIA who discovers to his amazement he is skilled in combat defense; he'll need to be once the CIA operative learns of Bourne's whereabouts and sets out to have him eliminated for foiling an assassination. For audiences weened on spy-thrillers, this is a highly acceptable piece of escapism. However, amnesia as a plot-point in movies goes a long way back...and was never an exciting angle anyway. Director Doug Liman doesn't bother toying seductively with the audience; we never have to guess what's around the next corner because Liman is mostly interested in noisy bursts violence accompanied by shattering glass, and in keeping wiry Damon constantly on the verge of extinction.

","I will admit up front that I watched this movie expecting an action flick. There, I said it. So complain all you want about how people these days have ridiculously short attention spans - yes, I am not beyond turning my brain off for an hour or two in order to enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>However, I also enjoy watching movies that are original, or thought provoking, or character driven, or plot-centered. While the Bourne Identity was plot-centered, it certainly wasn't the other three. It was a failure as both a ""deep"" movie AND a brainless action flick.<br/><br/>There were no exciting special effects, few explosions, and few fight sequences - all of which could be forgiven (easily!) if the characters were even remotely interesting. I've never seen a Matt Damon movie before, and his performance here didn't make me want to go out and see more of him. Because we know basically from the beginning what happened to him (based on the scenes with the CIA agents), I didn't care at all about his character, either. Franka Potente was all right I suppose, but Marie wasn't written in a way that made me care about her, either. I rolled my eyes at the obligatory ""kissss meeee"" scene; I knew it was going to happen eventually, but it was so drawn out and lacking in chemistry.<br/><br/>And also - just when it starts to get interesting, when he finds out he's a government project or whatever - it just ends. After all that pointless running around and hiding and ""Marie, just go! This life isn't good for you!"", we don't even delve into what probably would have been the most interesting aspect of the storyline. I suppose in the sequels we learn more about whatever it is they did to him to make him a superspy, but I don't care enough to find out. I only sat through this movie because I was watching it with other people; otherwise, I would have turned it off long before it reached its end."

","A wounded man is pulled out of the sea by fishermen who help him recuperate, but he suffers from amnesia and doesn't know why people are trying to kill him.

The silly stunts would be fun if, like Bond, the film didn't take itself so seriously, but this a humorless affair. Damon is rather one-dimensional as the hero. The quirky camera work that worked well for director Liman in ""Go,"" his enjoyable 1999 comedy, is not suited to this drab endeavor. What's more, it rambles on too long."

Whoever wrote the script just stole the main characters name and the fact that he had amnesia and went on to write his own story from there. It uses vague references to the book, but that's it. This movie should never have been titled ""The Bourne Identity"". If it wasn't, I'd respect it a lot more. They even went as far as to rename the leading female role. Why bother? I don't understand why Hollywood always has to rip off good stories. Tell it like it was or call it something else. <br/><br/>The book is a very good read and has a much more thought out plot.

"varundelpiero","7","1","2","26 November 2008"," Better than the average...
","THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a pure and straightforward action thriller with solid writing and acting; no more, no less. It is superior to most films that fall in this genre because it manages to stay away from most of the worn-out action clichés, while focusing more on character/plot development and exposition than the action sequences.<br/><br/>Doug Liman and Tony Gilroy have created a fresh action thriller with THE BOURNE IDENTITY; one that will entertain many viewers without feeling stale or overstaying its welcome. The acting is pretty top-notch, with Matt Damon's emotionless and laid-back approach to his character a welcome one in a genre dominated by overacting or poor acting. Chris Cooper and Franka Potente play their supporting roles well, and Potente adds a nice contrast to Damon's Bourne. Clive Owen has a brief cameo that is worth mentioning.<br/><br/>So what about the action? Well, there is an obligatory car chase that gets a bit old after the first two or three minutes or so. Frankly, I don't see why these pointless scenes have become a requisite for the genre. This chase adds nothing that viewers haven't seen before, and didn't really have to be that long. The fight sequences are worth watching, and many of them involve some sleek hand-to-hand combat, which are thankfully well-edited and choreographed. But the real selling point is not the action, but the screenplay (as written by Tony Gilroy) which keeps the more intellectual viewers on edge trying to figure out Bourne's identity. The exposition is well-written and doesn't come out of the blue. Again, top marks for writing; something that is usually absent in action thrillers.<br/><br/>The editing is crisp and clean, making the movie-going experience worthwhile. I decided to mention this because most action movies have dreadful editing, to the point where the action sequences seem blurry and nauseating. The music in this film is also worth mentioning, as it contains a modern upbeat feel that suits the movie well.<br/><br/>A final note about Jason Bourne's past: it is worth noting that screenplays that encourage viewers to root for a character with a shady past/present are usually frowned upon by many 'upstanding citizens'. I bring to mind the recent controversy surrounding the popularity of Showtime's DEXTER series. I was impressed by Gilroy's ability to write the past Bourne as different from the present Bourne due to the amnesia. It should at lest keep these 'concerned' folks quiet.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film. That's right. I am no fan of action thrillers but this one is miles ahead of the ordinary. It is intelligent and well-paced, and will give viewers exactly what they expect, and more. Deserves a solid 7/10 and 3 stars (out of 4)."

","The Bourne Identity has been hyped by many people as the ultimate spy film, out-Bonding Bond etc. etc. To a certain extent that is true - it was exciting, broadly plausible and full of action. On the other hand, for a start it wasn't exactly a spy film. Bourne starts off not knowing who he is, he is chased around a lot and nearly gets killed a few times and he ends up still not really knowing who he is. He doesn't do any spying, he just realises slowly over the course of the film that he is himself a sort of spy.<br/><br/>The plot was barely recognisable from the book, apart from a few names, the chase from Zurich to Paris and the fact that people were trying to kill him. The reason why they were trying to kill him and the people responsible were new and the CIA involvement was never fully explained or developed. Perhaps this was a good thing, as the book is, I think, overly complicated, but they could have kept some sort of link.<br/><br/>In terms of plausibility, some of the fighting looked like something out of The Matrix (maybe genuine, but filmed to make it look like it was a bit super-hero) and the part where he jumps down a 4-storey stairwell using a dead body to cushion his fall was frankly laughable.<br/><br/>As it is, I still enjoyed it and agree it is a great improvement on most Bond films - as witnessed by the way that Bond was reinvented for Casino Royale. The lack of plot carry-over also means that I can watch The Bourne Supremacy when it's on TV next week without worrying that I am still only 1/2 way through the book."

","Much like another person's comments, I heard good things about it when it was on the cinema but didn't go and see it. That was a mistake.<br/><br/>By far, this is a magnificent spy-thriller. Matt Damon can be slightly hit and miss on occasion, but was perfectly cast as was the German chic who played Marie (his companion). She was terrific.<br/><br/>The story has a good level of detail and complexity without getting too bogged down in itself - a common problem for many recent US films in this genre.<br/><br/>There was more realism in this film as well. The hero was not invincible. He was injured at several points and his battle scars didn't magically disappear two minutes later. On a more subtle level: I noticed that the weather was terrible the whole way through. It was overcast, snowing, wet, you name it: just about anything other than sunny. For some reason, I liked that a lot. It gave a good atmosphere and realism to the film and gave us a break from all other actions films shot in europe under perfect, sunny weather. Small point, big difference. Also, I liked the fact that they didn't go overboard with product placement, unless Mini approached them to promote a car they made in the late 70s.<br/><br/>The lack of gadgetry was fine by me. Leave that to Bond. Bourne is more realistic and doesn't need the ability to fire a missile out of his wrist watch to get himself out of a fix. In fact, you'll notice throughout the film that if he acquires someone else's gun, he gets rid of it relatively quickly. Again, more realistic.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were great without being too over stated. Chris Cooper probably overacted his part to some degree, but that was not a major sticking point.<br/><br/>All in all, a very well made spy film with a good balance between action and plot.<br/><br/>For those who like a bit of cinema trivia, the car chase scene in Paris was shot several months after the film was finished. The producer and director were not happy with the car chase scene in the original cut, so they went back to Paris with key cast members and filmed it again. See if you can spot whether changes, hair length changes and so on during that scene!<br/><br/>Followed by a sequel that didn't quite reach the same heights, but was good nonetheless and I'm looking forward to ultimatum."

I also liked the fact that you never fully trusted ANYONE in this movie. That made for great tension. In the end, I wanted to go right out and get my own Sigarms 550 .223 sniper rifle, but it costs $15,000. And THAT, my friends, is why we have movies!!!"
"rmax304823","7","1","2","10 December 2006"," Rambo in the City.
","You remember, I'm sure, how John Rambo was a practically superhuman expert at surviving and killing in the forest? And he was hunted by a horde of ill-motivated nincompoops and outwitted all of them in the mountains of Washington? Well, ""The Bourne Identity"" is like that, except that its setting is urban and its a far less stupid movie. It's an action move alright, but not a stupid one. You can tell it's an action movie because there is a speedy car chase through the streets of Paris, and because the hero can cause a fuel tank to explode simply by shooting at it with a shotgun. You can tell it's not stereotypical because there are a number of physical fights in which one or another participant's pistol is knocked out of his hand -- and in no case is there a shot of the gun skittering along the floor. And neither does the hero bump his head against an adversary's head in defiance of Newton's third law. <br/><br/>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is hauled out of the sea with a bullet wound and amnesia. He spends the movie, along with the girl friend he acquires (Potente) trying to find out who he is, a ""born"" identity, so to speak. Meanwhile he's being hunted in the most thorough and high-tech sort of way by the CIA, who was to whack him for having failed to complete a hit. They're afraid he'll spill the beans, you see, and of course the police are after him too for various infractions committed in the course of his quest.<br/><br/>I quite liked the movie. The atmosphere of wintry Switzerland and Paris are nicely set up. Whew, it looks cold. The performances are fine, especially the two leads and Chris Cooper at the CIA honcho. Oh, I suppose we can all have doubts that the CIA are quite so good at what they do, but this story is fictional.<br/><br/>The action scenes, mostly mano a mano, don't drag on. They happen suddenly and are lightning-fast. The script is literate in the sense that people do and say things that are believable. Potenta's voice is especially neat to listen to. Her German-tinted sarcasm is perfectly believable.<br/><br/>Matt Damon, well, he looks perhaps a bit like a ex-preppy whose most violent endeavors involved a tennis ball but his performance is fine, as it usually is. And although Chris Cooper's part isn't overly large, I think it's one of his best roles. He has an amazing range considering what he brings with him -- from efficiently slimy here to gentle and sensitive in something like ""Lone Star."" And though the plot is propelled by a set of less than plausible propositions, compare it to ""Rambo,"" in which everything hinges on the revenge motive (if that's what it is) of one big hulking brute of an irritable sheriff.<br/><br/>It's a well-crafted action movie with no great ethical moral embedded in it. I hope not anyway. If there were a message it would have to be something like, ""Who are we, really?"" That's pretty banal unless it's treated as an absurdity, as in Georg Buchner's ""Woyzeck,"" in which, when the hero becomes conscious, he asks something like, ""Who am I? Where am I? Why am I?"" I'm not sure why, on the DVD, the director keeps drawing our attention to the ""realism"" of the script while, at one point, he tells us that nobody was shown smoking in the movie because he didn't want to provide bad role models for kids, even though the entire French crew had Gauloise stubs glued to their lips. What price political correctness?<br/><br/>Technically I suppose this is what I'd call a ""latent status movie,"" in which the hero has the status of a highly skilled craftsman but doesn't reveal it until circumstances force him to. Shane's latent status was that of a skilled gunslinger. Richard Kimball's was that of a doctor. This is a higher-order latent status movie in that, not only do his friends not know of Bourne's secret identity as a superb assassin, but Bourne has amnesia and doesn't know it himself. (Suppose, though, Bourne's secret identity turned out to be that of manager of a Sonic Drive-Thru in Amarillo or something?)<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with the movie but there is a director's audio commentary on the DVD. I do wish directors would do more than tell us which scenes were shot on location and which on a sound stage, and stop telling us how incredible everyone was on the set. Why not point out goofs, weaknesses, and conflicts as well? They're equally interesting.<br/><br/>I recommend it, and I recommend taking a second look at Franka Potente, a young German woman whose appearance would not pass muster next to Brittny Spears or Jessica Alba but who has an inner beauty as well as a hell of a lot more talent than most of today's tabloid heroines. She does have one major flaw -- her name. I keep getting it mixed up with Famke Janssen and Battleship Potemkin and Mandy Potamkin and Frankie Sinatra and the name of a Chevrolet dealership in New Jersey. She'll have to change it."

","Besides the obvious facts that Matt Damon did more than justice to Jason Bourne, and that Franka Potente and Matt looked really good together, all I can say is that the movie must have left Ludlum proud of his work.<br/><br/>Although the movie tends to sway a little from the book, the changes weren't drastic and at times, helped to get the story rolling. Everything from the time Jason is picked up from the Mediterranean till the time he realizes why he was there in the first place, is very well laid out. And who could have thought that Clive Owen, the main guy from Inside Man would be ' The Professor', another assassin. <br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes was when the Swiss police tried to take Jason to the police station when he was sleeping on the bench. The cop tried to hit him with his night-stick but Jason got hold of it and a couple of seconds later, the cops were the ones who were out cold, ...literally. Thank you for the awesome movie Doug Liman and of course, thank you Mr.Ludlum."
"saykeng","9","1","2","12 August 2006"," The Power of Observation keeps Jason Bourne ahead of his predators...
","The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.<br/><br/>The two Bourne movies, namely Bourne Identity & Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.<br/><br/>Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.<br/><br/>In the first movie, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Professor') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.<br/><br/>In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.<br/><br/>In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.<br/><br/>For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...<br/><br/>His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.<br/><br/>For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great! Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.<br/><br/>Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.<br/><br/>To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally."
"nastyhobbitses","10","1","2","8 August 2006"," Bond's been re-Bourne !
","Difficult to know were to start - so will simply say this is one of the top 10 movies of the last decade. The Bourne movies have taken an exciting new road - we now have James Bond without the clichéd gorgeous girls, ridiculous gadgets and tiresome one liners. Now, steady, despite what I've said I really like Bond, you know what your going to get and they're flashy, fun flics - never miss them. But if those movies ever grew up you'd hope they'd turn out like The Bourne Identity. Bourne is tougher, more real, the action sequences are brilliant and tough as nails. There plot is solid, information is drip fed at the right rate and you can never say for sure how things will turn out - which is absolutely essential and separates the simply good movies from the great. There are a small number of well developed characters and again, it's nice to see that you can do what's been done with Bourne without a couple of huge Hollywood names battering the movies path to financial success. Oh, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Opening scene is class too."
"lochnessbubba","10","1","2","5 June 2006"," If you haven't seen it, do so tonight!
","This movie has an intensely-gripping story with excellent action sequences and a solid and intelligent plot line. The genius cinematography sets the mood for the movie: cold and dark at first, which to me represents Bourne's state of mind when we are introduced to him; at the end we see him in a beautiful sunny Mediterranean Sea setting which signifies that he has gained some illumination into who he is. <br/><br/>The character development is superb and the action is almost believable compared with the razzle-dazzle of typical Hollywood productions these days. The storyline is strong enough that a ton of special effects are unnecessary- the way a movie should be in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>Best of all, we can actually like Matt Damon for a change because he effectively portrays a character we can empathize with. The character is an action hero without any of the clichés we typically associate with action heroes - no moronic 1-liners and no cheesy muscle poses.<br/><br/>The Bourne character has a workman-like approach to dangerous situations and seems as relieved as we are to get through a tough scrape. Damon obviously puts a lot of work into making the hand-to-hand combat sequences believable and reportedly does most of his own stunts for this film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is first-rate and perfectly compliments the cinematography to help create the mood of the movie. If you watch this movie and do not rate it at least a 9, watch it again and compare it with everything else out there being offered on the big screen that isn't worth the 2 hours of your life!"

This has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning, keeps your mind racing and your heart beating. It's refreshing, thrilling, gripping. It's beautifully shot and directed. Damon and Potente are superb together. There is nothing I can criticize about this movie - even the sudden blast of Extreme Ways by Moby at the end makes the hairs on the back of your neck tingle.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that, as soon as the end credits roll (but after the song ends) you just want to watch it again. It doesn't matter that you know the plot, it's like a pint of your favourite beer or a chocolate fudge ice-cream, combined with your favourite fair-ground ride and catchiest song (not at the same time else you'd be sick.)

","Some say this movie is complicated.. actually it's rather simple. A 30,000,000 dollar weapon named Jason Bourne fails a mission to kill this politically powerful African guy named Wambosi. Jason gets caught on Wambosi's boat, gets shot twice in the back and falls over in the water. The results of his injuries is amnesia. He wakes up on a fishing boat and thus the story goes on. The agency he is working codenamed ""Treadstone"" realizes that they cant have Jason loose on the field so they try and kill him. Jason Bourne isn't like James Bond. To quote Paul Greengrass: ""He doesn't rely on some izzy wizzy gadget to help him."" He relies on surreal intelligence and talent. Jason can easily come up with a plan to get out of trouble in seconds and execute it to perfection. I have to say the Bourne Identity and the Bourne Supremacy are the best movies I have ever seen, and both feature superb performances by Matt Damon. The fight sequences are extraordinary, and there's a lot of drama to go in with all of the action. The Bourne Identity and Supremacy are my two favorite moves of all time and both are defidentially worth seeing."

Chris Cooper, Clive Owen and Brian Cox were all great in supporting roles. THis film is directed well by Liman who directed great films up until Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

","When I went to this movie, I had read the book and was expecting something similar in plot. The first twenty or thirty minutes are great, I couldn't have made them better myself. Then it goes off and doesn't even include the main enemy of Bourne from the book. That's like filming the Lord of the Rings and making Denethor the main antagonist instead of Sauron! This movie was a wasted opportunity for greatness. Why would a director make a movie and throw away the very plot that made the plot worthy of filming? This is what is wrong with Hollywood. They fear new things in the film industry and whenever possible they twist these new ideas into the same rubbish they've been spewing for decades. They took a plot full of intrigue and suspense and made it into the average action movie with the merest hint of a twist to make it a little different."
"patryck","10","1","2","15 December 2005"," Better than Bond ... ""Bourne, Jason Bourne.""
","After recently viewing and re-viewing, I find The Bourne Identity to be one of the finest examples of the action/thriller genre. There are many scenes where no dialog occurs and the visual imagery is allowed to tell the story. (first, aboard ship, having bullets and capsule removed; escape from US embassy; safe deposit box discovery; apt in Paris; showdown at country house ...) I think this AND the next in the series, The Bourne Supremacy, are better Bond films, then any Bond film. The action, romance and intrigue are all there, just without the smarmy grin of silliness. Just exceptional film making in the genre that often doesn't take the time to do it well."

","Firstly, credit where credit is due...It's a good movie. Having said that, I hate it when they take a literary character and ride on his coat tails of success. If you are going to call a movie by the same name as a novel then don't stray from the overall plot or kill off characters who are supposed to live or save characters who are supposed to die. I understand and accept that books don't always translate well into movies. That's okay just don't go changing the whole story either. This movie begins right (same as the book) but the thing that I really hate is that it takes characters who are sympathetic in the book and turns them into irrational evil doers. There is no good reason to change them that way. Give the audience a little credit for intelligence and add a scene explaining why they are really chasing Bourne. While I'm at it, Bourne Supremacy takes my complaint to even greater lengths."

","This movie is simply excellent. It's filled with action which, related to other movies, is realistic beyond comparison. The psychological phenomenon of amnesia just adds an adequate bit of mystery to the plot during the first part of the film.<br/><br/>The movie has an ingenious plot, with a failed assassination that the CIA has to prevent from leaking out by all means necessary, at risk of political turmoil and possibly a great loss off credibility and good reputation for the organization. Bourne is of course a great risk both because of his severe memory loss and that he mysteriously failed to complete the mission. Those upholding that the movie doesn't have a plot must be incredibly stupid. My advise to you is to stick with 'Bond' or 'Indiana Jones' where you haven't got to do the slightest bit of thinking yourselves."

Bourne is hauled out of the sea with bullets in him and no knowledge of who he is or what he has done. With the help of Marie (Potente), Bourne slowly starts to discover his identity and purpose, all the while being chased by assassins and spies all over Europe. The film boasts realistic fight scenes, nail-biting action sequences and great locations across Europe. The whole film, in my opinion had a sense of realism about it.

I have read many of the other ""reviews"" on this site. My advice is to avoid them. Many are obviously written by embryonic film makers or wannabe film reviewers.

The fight scenes are brilliant and although the hero is capable of extraordinary physical feats, he avoids the macho or terminator-like attitude we are accustomed to. Special credit must be given to the scriptwriters, as the dialogs are exemplary: no overdose: short, poignant sentences contribute to the tension. Some breathtaking pursuits in the streets of Paris that can be compared to those in ""Ronin"" and do not last too long. The principal merit of this movie is that the viewer senses a lot of hard work has gone into the preparation and production: it succeeds in balancing a good story, action and a plausible ending.

It is a great spy thriller/action-adventure, with a noir-ish feel that adds to the realism if Bourne's plight. Like Dr. Kimble in the fugitive, Bourne must evade the powers that be whilst finding the truth to his past, a basic plot outline that never seems to fail.

","When I first saw this film advertised I wasn't sure Matt Damon could pull off an ""action"" hero, but he did with a big bang. We thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as we have action films with Mel Gibson, Arnold S, Harrison Ford and Matt did as good a job as they have. He could be the next 007! The action was almost nonstop, but with a good believable story line. Am excited about the next chapter in this series. Chris Cooper played a believable bad guy, just spooky enough to give you the creeps! The scenery was beautiful in Europe. The best sequence was the driving one in the little red car going down the steps, evading the police. It seems to me that Matt Damon has grown as an actor or maybe because he is a little older, too. The woman in the movie who played his love interest was very good, too. Hope that she is in the next one."

","This movie is nothing short of fantastic. It moves fast, the characters are intelligent and believable, and it keeps you guessing (if you haven't read the books).<br/><br/>Damon is excellent and believable in the role (to the extent that a role about a super government agent is believable). The pacing is excellent. Indeed, it is so fast that the viewer starts to feel the sense of being thrown in a whirlwind where they, like the characters in the movie, don't really know when or where it is going to end. The reason why the movie moves so quickly is because the lead characters are constantly confronted with obstacles that they barely get by, before they are thrown another obstacle (courtesy of the CIA). Perhaps the James Bond folks should take a few notes to improve their franchise.<br/><br/>The action is great. The fight scenes are fun and unique. They are unique in that you get the sense of Bourne's lethal abilities, without having to watch a traditional kung fu fight. The director achieves this by showing the fight slow motion, but occasionally sped up greatly, to give the general effect of very violent fights. The fight in Paris was one of the best, most original fight scenes I've seen in some time. (It is only unfortunate it wasn't followed up in the next movie).<br/><br/>Franka Potente is also excellent in her limited role as the civilian caught up in this international intrigue. Although she is pretty much limited to the straight woman for all the wildly dangerous things that are happening to her and Damon, she gives her best to the role. This woman can really act, so if you like her in Bourne, check her out in Run Lola Run and the Princess and the Warrior (the subtitles are worth it). Chris Cooper had fun with his role as well.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is like a pleasant roller coaster ride, it moves quickly, has its twists and turns, and leaves you breathless and wanting more."

","I saw this after seeing BOURNE SUPREMACY. <br/><br/>A man who's been shot in the back three times is found floating off the coast of France (Damon). He soon discovers that his name is Jason Bourne and is some kind of superspy. <br/><br/>The first movie is not better than the sequel, but it is different in tone. There's more of a feeling here of lightness, even amiability, and the source of that is, I think, Damon's performance. *He* is much better here than he was in SUPREMACY, mainly because there's a more natural blending of his natural, sort of boyish charm and the action. Damon often gives the sense that he doesn't understand how he's doing what he's doing, and that seems right for him, a natural fit. <br/><br/>We also have the addition of a female here, Potente, and their relationship inevitably helps soften the mood. <br/><br/>The story is not as sharp as it was in SUPREMACY, which is actually an extremely well-written version of the breed. As Bourne begins to unravel the mystery of his past, Treadstone sends operatives out to kill him. Much of the action is Bourne knocking them down one by one, until he knocks down Clive Owen, who gives him enough information to finally advance the plot to the climax. It's entertaining, don't get me wrong, but doesn't have the sense of inevitability that a great genre plot should.<br/><br/>The action is superior. Whatever Greengrass gained by the extensive handheld work in SUPREMACY (immediacy, mostly) he lost with incoherence. The director here takes a much more restrained approach, and that's welcome. The Paris chase scene is better than the climactic Moscow chase scene in Supremacy, in particular, partly because we have a better sense of what's going on. I also think the final Damon/Owen fight -- the best sequence in the film, in my opinion -- is aided by relatively static shots. <br/><br/>IDENTITY is lighter, more of a popcorn movie than the rather sad SUPREMACY. Both are worth seeing. With Chris Cooper and Brian Cox, both basically doing themselves as badguy agency officials."

","Bourne Identity is a movie that seemingly should be placed in the category of the summer international espionage movie  a la XXX, Jack Ryan, and the grandfather of them all, Bond. <br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is bringing something else  basically, it's trying to hybrid character development and plot movement with the action genre. I don't know if it can be called a character piece or a plot piece  it's about a spy with amnesia. But what it does do is make smart choices, old film choices, and the characters become fully-embodied  it's a film that stares at you rather than winks at you. <br/><br/>It's pulled off because Liman (director) & Gilroy (writer) make some ultra-smart choices: limited use of gun play, using a very artistic and efficient fighting style called Kali, and the downplay of any action scene with reality elements (people do get injured, things that are blown up are still on fire a scene later, nobody takes 6 in the chest and keeps on ticking) and the quite surprising performance by Matt Damon. He plays this character straight and controlled and the character is all the better for it. If anything, the performance boiled down to what he didn't do, and his discipline really makes the character.<br/><br/>The same can be said for Marie (who book fans will remember as the Canadian economist) played by Franka Potente. Potente has an uncanny ability for making characters whose very nature seem preposterous seem very real. Most evidently done in 'the Princess & the Warrior'. She's a largely ignored talent, which I would imagine comes from the fact that she prefers quiet, downplayed performances (method performances) over the 'look at me' quality that most other women in her field choose. <br/><br/>You're not going to see this movie to see how spies deal with amnesia and how that relates to humanity as a whole, you're not really going to learn anything about yourself in the movie. But you won't be disappointed  it's a movie that recalls the golden years of actual location shoots, no effects, quality acting and chemistry, where movement of the camera meant something and where you don't smack your hand against your head with every cliché action man line. <br/><br/>It's one of the first films in recent years that hasn't made entertaining and stupid synonymous."

","Apparently, quite a few people like this movie, but I sure can't figure out why. This is one of those flicks in which the director seems to have outsmarted himself. There are plot elements that simply don't get filled in, which seems to be the latest craze/excuse for not knowing how to effectively wrap up a story without letting it become too contrived. Perhaps it would have been better had I read the book, but then that's never worked for me, ever.<br/><br/>This film is emblematic of the biggest problem with films today: all the various parts are extremely well polished (cinematography, acting, site location, special effects), but perhaps too much so: the ""cleanliness"" that results if often emotionless, too sterile for life. You wind up feeling like it's an industrial video you're watching, not a motion picture.<br/><br/>This flick, despite the ""action"" scenes, just bored me senseless.

","I passed on this film in the theater, but have since seen it several times on cable.  It is very well-paced and there are no unnecessary scenes. Unlike many of the other people who said there was no chemistry between Damon and Potente, I think the two of them worked because they were able to keep the focus on the plot.  <br/><br/>The Paris setting is great and they used it to full advantage. It wasn't merely the ""careening down narrow city streets"" stuff; it included some truly French settings such as Bourne's apartment building, which was fabulous (watch, it will turn out that this was filmed in Pittsburgh).<br/><br/>It was nice to see Clive Owen in a small but pivotal role as an assassin tracking Bourne.  I was at a bit of a loss about Julia Stiles' role as an operative in Paris.  She looked like she would be more at home playing high school field hockey.  Her casting seemed thrown in to have more eye candy in the film."

","I have a hard time believing that this is the best these people were able to do with this cast and this material. I have no idea why young aspiring actors like Matt Damon, Julia Stiles and Franka Potente (please ask Tom Tykwer to give you a decent role again, Franka) felt compelled to play roles in this movie.<br/><br/>The script must have looked like a mess, with the line ""...moving swiftly along now..."" printed at least three times per page. Okay, the scenes are probably in sequence, but there is no continuity or natural flow of events. The editing is pretty shoddy as well. Looks like someone tried to fit material based on a 10,000 page script into a 100 page time frame.<br/><br/>The camera work made me nervous and giddy for all the wrong reasons (it is a Steadicam, not a Shakycam, guys! And this isn't NYPD Blue!). The production values are hardly any higher than in a low-budget Dolph Lundgren action movie, destined to go straight to video.<br/><br/>The movie opens on a ship, so of course the camera is tilting left and right... This is way beyond a tired cliche, it is tedious and distracting, and the tilting is overdone to a degree that I actually  wondered why the actors (or the camera man) did not fall over.<br/><br/>Talking about cliches .. there we have those amazing 'CIA computers' again, that can do anything in a few seconds. So we have a blurry cam picture shot from half a mile away; zooming in actually sharpens the picture (!), and three seconds later we know that this person paid a bill in Belgium three months ago - in font size 25 and spawning at least 15 wildly animating processes on-screen. This worked fine when a PC cost $50,000 dollars and 95% of the audience had never heard of them, but come on .. Database queries aren't that spectacular, even with the CIA's budget.<br/><br/>There appears to be no cinematography or 'photographic pride' at all (not even one single nice and captivating shot). It looks like it was a TV movie filmed in the shortest possible time, on a limited budget, and with several people already thinking about their next project (and rightly so).<br/><br/>
I know, a spy thriller can do with a bit of suspended disbelief, but there is so much distraction and nonsense going on, and the characters and action are so close to caricature, that disbelief hits you over the head most of the time. Instead of pulling the viewer into the train of events, the pace and the editing leave only one lasting impression: did they try to finish the movie in time before dinner?<br/><br/>This movie could have done a lot better with a slower and more even pace, a leaner and tighter script, classier 'cinematic' camera work, and way less editing. Less balls, better juggling."
"Roddy-15","Null","1","2","30 January 2004"," One of the best films of 2002
","Bourne Identity is definitely Robert Ludlum's best novel. But can it translate well into a good film? After watching films like Sphere (based on the Michael Crighton novel by the same name) and Queen of the Damned (based on the Anne Rice novel) and after enduring all the films loosely based on Dean R. Koontz's great novels, I can say I wasn't expecting much out of Bourne Identity. <br/><br/>Fortunately Bourne Identity proves that not all films taken out of grandiose novels turn out to be mediocre entertainment.  In the novel, the terrorist Carlos is the enemy.  Needless to say that had to be changed-Carlos is in jail now.  If you read the book, you will realize that a lot of chapters were simply skipped.  There was no option.  If the movie had had every chapter from the novel put into the film, it would have lasted more than four hours-just like the miniseries by the same name that came out in 1988. Despite all the changes made to the movie, despite all the deviations from the original story (some of them rather risky), Bourne Identity is a great film.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is definitely a great actor.  And his good acting doesn't fail to disappoint here.  And Franka Potente makes a great sidekick. She is far from being the typical Hollywood good actress.  And this role was definitely for her.  In one movie scene, you will see Matt Damon cutting her hair.  Then she dyes it.  This woman colored her hair blond once.  Then she shaved it all.  Now she is letting a man with amnesia give her a haircut.  She just can't stop doing things to her hair. Not that it bothers me. Nothing about this actress is annoying. She was impressing in Run Lola Run, and she continues to be. Same thing can be said about Matt Damon. He was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and he was perfect for the role of Jason Bourne, an agent suffering from amnesia who must find out who and what he is, and the more he learns about himself, the more in danger he gets.<br/><br/>Bourne Identity is far from being the typical spy film. Here there are no amazing, hard to believe gadgets that seem to come out of James Bond films. Here there are no amazing explosions that seem more like advertisement for good pyrotechnic companies than parts of any film. It is just a good suspense story equipped with believable action.<br/><br/>This is a movie every fan of the genre should see."

Matt Damon, as John Bourne, a CIA black ops spy who suffers from amnesia and spends the film piecing together the last two weeks of his life, uses his intellect as much as his fists. This is a smart movie, made even better by some wise choices for director and star. Doug Liman, director of Swingers and Go brings a refreshing excitement to this tired old genre, and manages to deliver some unexpected thrills. Franka Potente (best known for Run Lola Run) as Maria, a young woman who unwittingly finds herself involved in international intrigue, hands in a star making performance. As a viewer her character is the only one in the film that we can relate to; she's an ordinary person put in extraordinary circumstances. Look for Clive Owen in a cameo as The Professor, a hired killer sent to assassinate Bourne. In his three or four lines of dialogue he talks about the moral quandaries of his line of work. It's a beautifully acted moment, and a nice twist on the usual killer-for-hire character."

To be fair, there is no way a two hour movie can capture a book of over 500 pages that never lets up on the action.  Franka Potente was superb, as was Clive Owen.  What I can't believe is the number of people gushing over Matt Damon, who is (a) unbelievable as an assassin because he is so wimpy, and (b) an incredibly BAD actor.  As a critic once said about the young Katherine Hepburn, Damon ""runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.""  He is the one glaring hole in the cast, and it is too bad that among the three chief cast members, he is the American.  He may be able to write or produce, but all the praise for his acting is just another case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" much like his equally talentless pal, Ben Affleck."

You stay up to three a.m. to get to the last page.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity uses a sure-fire hook: a man fished out of the sea with a load of bullets in his carcass, minor brain damage, and no memory. There are only a few clues to whom he might be--a numbered Swiss bank account, heavy-duty martial skills, espionage instincts, etc. <br/><br/>And he's got nothing. No money, no ID, nothing.

The CIA, the Vietnam war, international terrorism, etc. Clearly, he was involved in something big and nasty.<br/><br/>Not so with this movie. Almost immediately, you see the US government connection. Good-bye suspense.<br/><br/>And good-bye human interest. In the book, Jason is tortured ad nauseam--as is the reader by Ludlum's prose--by the question of just what kind of person he really is. It's barely there in the movie. The same for character depth. You really don't end up caring much about Jason, Marie, anybody.<br/><br/>
In the book, Marie is forced to join him, against her will. With time, she becomes his ally, adding her own valuable skills and knowledge to help Jason survive and triumph. In the movie, Marie is merely this lost, clueless ""gypsy"".<br/><br/>I don't know anything about the director, but can't help getting the impression that he came up doing rock videos and TV commercials. The camera work is very edgy. It is meant to look hip. And now they let him do a real movie. Bad decision.<br/><br/>The action stuff is very good.

For example looking at a map before a car chase how many times have you seen bond do that huh. <br/><br/>
The fact that this film is set entirely in Europe makes it individual and gives it a little something extra, which is always good. The great cast grip your attention add Damon is a brilliant he shows Bourne strengths and weakness and give him a human quality. Over all the film is great and defiantly worth watching. So I'm biest but give me Bourne over Bond any day."

","This movie, shot mainly in Switzerland and France, was one of the few movies I've seen that lives up to it's billing from it's days as a book.  I am more impressed with Matt Damon each time I see him in a new movie.  I think that he brings Jason Bourne to life very effectively.  The movie flows quite nicely, was well edited and well shot.  I'm sure it was difficult filming in Switzerland in the winter, and quite difficult filming in Paris as well. The director makes it look flawless.  Franka Potente, who I believe is a real hidden gem as an actress, proves once again that she has global appeal and that her effective performance in the movie ""Blow"" was no fluke.  What I really enjoyed about The Bourne Identity was the action sequences.  For some reason, most Hollywood movies over-do these parts of the film to compensate for a weak story.  The Bourne Identity doesn't rely on them at all, as the story would probably flow just fine without them, however they are well acted, well choreographed, yet not the focus of the film. I personally hope that there is a sequel.<br/><br/>Perfect score."

It was all special effects and not much else. First and foremost, Matt Damon looked way too young for the part.<br/><br/>He is supposed to be a master spy and he looked like he just<br/><br/>graduated college....ZERO credibility. Then the girls part was a doctor of economics , she was all wet<br/><br/>too. Then they brought in a trio of assassins to get rid of Bourne. What<br/><br/>a waste of talent in Clive Owen who is one of the best new actors<br/><br/>around. Anyone who saw ""Second Sight"" will attest to his talent .<br/><br/>How cute, they made the ""Professor"" (his character ) drive a BMW.<br/><br/>After all those commercials he (Owen) did as ""The Driver"" this was<br/><br/>a ""cutesy touch"". Next , what ever happened to the character of Carlos? who was an<br/><br/>important part of the story (in the book).<br/><br/>If you want to see a better version of this book rent the  TV movie<br/><br/>made in the 80's with Richard Chamberlin. He at least had the<br/><br/>maturity and credibility to play Jason Bourne and Jaclyn Smith was<br/><br/>at least believable as the doctor who becomes first his victim and<br/><br/>later his ally.<br/><br/>She plays  Dr.Marie St.Jacques, a Canadian economist whose life<br/><br/>intertwines with that of the spy on the run.<br/><br/>The TV versions also had better location shots. The new version<br/><br/>was so dank and cold and wet all the time it made me want to<br/><br/>have a box of Kleenex ready in case I got a cold.<br/><br/>I can only say that everyone in this film was motivated by one thing,<br/><br/>to quote a great line from Sean Connery's character in the<br/><br/>movie""The Great Train Robbery"". When asked why he committed<br/><br/>the crime he replies....<br/><br/>""I did it for the money""....<br/><br/>MY sentiments exactly."

And why was she hand-cuffed? Because otherwise there would be no earthly reason why she would follow him. And because movie makers at the time had some respect for their audiences. That brings me to Bourne. Now, it may seem unfair to compare some run-off-the-mill film to Hitchcock, but the sad fact is these guys nowadays (sorry to generalize here but the movie made me so angry) don't care about plausibility because they despise their popcorn-eating audience. Of course, you should not start thinking about the story of 39 steps which is also ridiculous. But the point is Hitchcock makes you want to believe and care for the characters. Suspense of disbelief and all that. In Bourne Identity the first 5 minutes are okay. We just do not want to know why the hero has this bank number implanted. In case he loses memory? He goes to Switzerland? I buy that but then he beats the police guys, just why? You have pockets full of money but have to spend the night in the house of a friend when you are on the run? Potente is not bad but she surely does not save this one."

The first part was literally breathtaking due to the suspence, amazing action sequences and cool music and I found myself thinking that this might actually be a cool movie. But as soon as Bourne reads that newspaper and puts all the missing pieces together the movie instantly looses its tempo and meaning. After we discover Bourne's identity(coincidentally the title of the movie), well I guess there's just no point in dragging the movie any longer, unless the story had a deeper purpose or meaning. Not in this case though, Bourne decides to singlehandedly challenge the organisation he works for so he can then, after some action scenes of course, leave it on his own terms. Sounds easy?, well they make it look even easier. Oh yeah, and just before the end there's a scene that looks so ridiculously dumb and unbelievable that even Tom Cruise's scenes on the motorcycle in ""MI2"" or Pierce Brosnan's leap to catch the falling plane in ""Goldeneye"" started looking somewhat credible. It was like the director lost his focus for the 2nd half. The whole background of Bourne's spy organisation is ""explained"" in a single line. How or why he became a 30 million dollar government property is sadly never revealed.

However, the time came for a bad project to come. The wrongest thing in the Bourne Identity, is the plot and the directing, at points. The plot getss too confusing at times, maybe it was their wish, anyway when we discover what all of that was about, than it is much ado about nothing. Director Doug Liman is very effective sometimes, but can't keep up the rythm he put up himself. The chases and the fights are impressive and the camera movements are mind-freezing, but when the pressure be held, he forgets about it. Too bad. The cast, in its way is very good, Damon is a fine actor and always fits well in every role; German actress Franka Potente assures the comedy and the lovely good girl who starts with a good english, but by the end of the movie it gets worse and worse; Chris Cooper is good also, after American Beauty he is still looking for another memorable role. The biggest surprise is, however, Julia Stiles. To be honest I never really liked her but in this film, she proved otherwise. This film is not one of those that you can't say ""I loved it, its perfect"", neither can you say ""Ew, what an huge peace of ****"".

The Bourne Identity is fun, exciting, and totally enjoyable. I really liked the relationship between Marie and Jason, and the fight scenes were cool. That other review reckoned that the Bourne Identity borrowed heavily from The Matrix, again this is a crock. In fact, this is one of the first action movies in a long while not to do so. The action in this movie was believable, as was Marie's response to such extreme violence. This I found to be very refreshing, there's too many movies where innocent people have little or no response to witnessing insane acts of violence.<br/><br/>Anyway, I read the Ludlum book after seeing the movie, and I honestly prefer the movie. Jason and Marie's relationship is more believable, and whereas the movie is taught and exciting, the book becomes boring and predictable.<br/><br/>I used to prefer Ben Affleck to Matt, but this movie has led me to change teams.

","For all the p***ed-off children of the world, who crave good old-fashioned values like a decent script, decent characterisation, suspense, action, humour, style and the sheer exhilaration of watching cars being driven at inappropriate speeds through narrow streets, I give you, ""The Bourne Identity"".  Sure, it's not perfect, but any action film in which no-one ever says, ""I want this guy's ASS!"" gets my vote.  Similarly, it's worth pointing out that what dialogue there is is intelligent, unpatronising and lacking in the usual macho over-the-top profanities.  As the amnesiac, confused, blank lead, Matt Damon, with his weirdly flat body and strange, upside-down mouth, is perfect.  He's not a great actor, but he can look serious and confused and quietly determined.  Which, in this film, is all he needs to do. Luckily, he is surrounded by a superb cast, including the wonderful star of ""Run Lola Run"", the authentically disheveled Chris Cooper (he looks like he's been wearing that shirt for weeks) the enigmatic Clive Owen (what a fine actor he is becoming - the next Bond, anyone?  Or the next Bond villain?) and, of course, Brian Cox.  Let's face it, if you're making this sort of film, Brian Cox is obligatory. There are smartly-shot fight sequences, a great car chase, a respectably sultry and tenuous love scene, and, my favourite, a snow-bound encounter with the aforementioned Owen, who says very little, but makes every word count. There's nothing desperately original on show here, but in a movie world where ever-more vacuous cretinous nonsense seems to be the order of the day, it's nice to find a pleasingly old-fashioned bit of action that allows the audience to leave the cinema smiling rather than demanding their money back and trying to get the nasty taste out of their mouths."

And whilst Bourne isn't a secret agent (of sorts), he is an assassin out to kill some African Delegate threatening to expose CIA missions in the Congo or something.<br/><br/>I think Matt Damon plays Bourne very well. His Aikido/Jujitsu is very fresh, fast and he gives the impression he's doing it on instict rather than showing he knows the moves.<br/><br/>Yes it did drag a bit, and yes every cliche out of hollywood comes out of this (for example: he's an assassin who cares - pl-eeze).  But I think it's pretty good for a cheap seat at a cheap cinema. I wouldn't go top dollar for this movie I don't think its worth it.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is also in this, but doesn't really do anything of interest. The most intreging character was Clive Owen's ""Professor"". Saying almost nothing but showing off his brooding James Bond/Tim Dalton with Glasses look.<br/><br/>Its entertaining until the very end where Damon decides to go all out as Chow Yun Fat wannabe...but whereas Fat would slide down the bannister, Damon jumps off the side and flies down to the bottom.

","I had wanted to see this one for a while due to some good reviews and of course the combination of Doug Liman directing Franka Potente in a spy movie.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting to be all that impressed with Damon.  However, he ends up doing a marvelous job of portraying a seemingly average Joe in a no-memory predicament (think Leonard Shelby) who seems to have the instincts of James Bond and Bruce Lee together (the embassy sequence is especially savvy.)  The action sequences here feel realistic also, (with the possible exception of that final stunt), and the showdown between Clive Owen and Damon is very tight and unusually quiet for a Hollywood thriller. Actually, the setting, direction, editing, music, frequent use of subtitles, and the use of Franka Potente (brilliant pairing, but why do they go from making out to him sleeping on the floor?) as Damon's love interest make this whole thing feel very much like a European spy thriller.  I felt like I was watching a Luc Besson film, but Besson hasn't done anything this good in years.  The ending does a very good job of pulling together the loose ends, and I heard they had a hard time figuring out what to do.  Kudos for making it work.<br/><br/>   Our reel had some problems (It's been playing every night since June 14, so I forgive the projectionist!) and so a few plot points were missed.  What was Alliance Securities, and how did they find it?  How was Kane connected to the boat?  How did Bourne know that pressing R on his phone would link him to the Hotel Regina?  How did Wombosi or Bourne know to go to that morgue to search for the body, and whose body WAS in the bag, if not his?  I might just go see it again, so it makes more sense.<br/><br/>   So far, Hollywood this summer has provided some really inventive films. Insomnia, Star Wars Episode II, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Bourne Identity, Reign of Fire, Road to Perdition, Austin Powers 3, even Minority Report with its cliched ending provided some cool moments.

"artzau","4","1","2","22 June 2002"," Disappointing
","Aside from a good chase scene and some interesting photography, the rest of this Ludlum tale either falls on its face (viz: the superhuman feats of the amnesiac Bourne become rather trite after a while) or flattens out to a rather dull thud (the absence of a strong underlying story).  Too bad, as the gimmick in Ludlum's book, i.e., the loose cannon, the injured, traumatized Bourne, who is tied somehow to Carlos the Jackal, is now out of date with the aging Carlos presently behind bars in France.  The script lacks an over-arching conspiracy; in spite of an overworked attempt to implicate a conspiracy group within the CIA (who after the recent revelation of debacles show the CIA minions are a parody of themselves), the plot falters.  The film really never goes anywhere.  It becomes one beat 'em up scene after another, sparked by nearly impossible situations.  The scene-shifting, plot inside plot, spy vs. spy model of the Ludlum work is definitely missing.  Too bad.  Brian Cox, who created the role of Hannibal Lector and Matt Damon are nearly always worth the price of admission.  Too, wasted are the talents of character actors Clive Owen and Chris Cooper. Finally, the female interest, German Franka Potente looks lost most of the time. While this is not a bad film, Ludlum fans will be very let down as old Robert really caught our interest with this novel.  We would have liked a better script based on a decent novel."
"dgslater","5","1","2","19 June 2002"," Disappointing
","It's the script. Nothing of any merit can be accomplished in film without a decent screenplay, and The Bourne Identity suffers accordingly. A majority of the dialogue is muddled, seemingly adlibbed in parts, and fails to advance the story properly or provide its characters with substantial material for which to base a decent performance.  To Doug Liman's credit, the fight scenes are outstanding, but are not enough to save the plodding and lifeless storyline.  What is tragic here is that there was so much to work with.  The Bourne Identity has been begging to be made into a motion picture for years, and I'm baffled at how something with such promise could be done such a disservice.  First, the motivations of the characters are underdeveloped and misplaced, which is a script problem. Second, the emotional gravity that Liman tries so desperately to build is undercut by uneven performances, and what amounts to some terrible editing, but which, in the end, is a product of the awful script.  Damon never seems to establish the proper tone for an intercontinental, cold-blooded, super assassin, and poor Franka Potente (awesome in Run Lola Run) struggles to lend believability to a ridiculously half-baked character-(She may be a flighty vagabond, but, please, where's her motivation?).  Chris Cooper is adequate, but a little unkempt and anxious for a self-righteous, cool-headed CIA program director.  However, any flaws in the performances can again all be attributed to the script.  I imagine the pressure of making your first big-budget studio pic can cloud judgment and strain your patience, but I hope Liman has learned from his mistakes here and chooses, in the future, to demand more from those drafting the content on which he is working."

This might lead to the impression that you can predict what comes next and you certainly can. The action sequences are definitely state of the art but the plot won't take your breath away. This is partly because you have the feeling that Mat Damon/Jason Bourne does all this searching for his identity not because of curiosity but because he's got an awful lot of time on his hands. Furthermore the romance between F. Potente & M. Damon bears more resemblance to an arranged marriage than to affection.

Don't waste your time or money with this one.  If you don't want to read the book, at least watch the original movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.  It was a miniseries made in 1988 and follows the book a lot better than this supposed remake.

The director and writer extract a very promising premise from the original, but ignore every detail of execution that made it into a well-crafted story.<br/><br/>A well-made thriller is a thrill for the mind.  The conflicts, the situations and motivations of characters are complex, and require mental effort to follow.  And the effort pays off, because when we pay attention and expend the effort, we're rewarded with understanding, and consequently entertained.  This film shows absolute contempt for the mind of the audience.  The situations and character perspectives are an embarrassing mix of the obvious and the arbitrary.  Typically modern, sloppy script.  As one example out of hundreds, in the original, Bourne catches on quickly to his likely identity as a killer, but Marie, who's had a chance to observe him and get a sense of his character tries to convince him he's not, or at least not a criminal.  This gives her an actual purpose in the furtherance of the story, not to mention providing some real tension and meaningful dialogue in the early part of the story.  This whole aspect is missing in this version. The film-makers' perspective is clearly, ""Why bother with all that intellectual nonsense?  Just make her attracted to him, but a little scared, and let them trade a couple of one-liners, and everyone will understand.""<br/><br/>Doug Liman's camera work shows similar contempt for our higher faculties. He is apparently from the if-the-camera-stays-in-one-place-for-more-than-a-thousandth-of-a-second-the- audience-will-get-up-and-leave school.  And in all the action sequences, the shots are so tight as to prevent any actual visual perspective of the situation.  I'm up in the air as to whether this is done purely for the desired style, or whether it's just laziness in not wanting to go to the trouble of carefully organizing all the on-screen elements in such a way that a long shot will look right.<br/><br/>Modern films made along these lines are always disappointing, but when they take a work that has so many great attributes, and deliberately leave most of them behind just to make a typical, plotless action movie, it is especially infuriating."

","The spy genre seems top be a little out of steam these days. The only good spy film I've seen in a long time was Spy Game, saved by the two leads, the terrific technical aspects, and the human side it brought to the story. It's like watching the same movie over and over again, commmon endings, bad performances, predictable twists. I have no idea why people liken The Bourne Identity to these garbage films. Okay, so it was a disappointmetn to the book, but what movie isn't? The performances in this movie are very good, save Potente's accent changing, especially in the smaller parts like Chris Cooper's and Clive Owen's, who had little material to work with. First, I thought when the showed the Wombosi tape and the meeting, that this movie would take the common path and focus too much on other issues besides the main plot (Matt Damon). But that quickly changed, and I was presented wiht a very well shot, slightly cliched, but excellent spy thriller. The fight scenes were awesome, the car chase almost as good as Ronin's...but Ronin sucked besides that so who cares.....and my favourite scene of the movie, and tied for favourite of the year so far (with the final duel in Monte Cristo) is when Damon and Owen are in the woods having their spy showdown....I've always wanted to make a movie just so I could have a scene shot like that...but Liman got to it first. Oh yeah, Doug Liman....Swinger's was awesome too, nice switch. See it! This is top grade action thriller, a wonderful spy movie, and just a plain awesome movie....I don't know what anyone's problem wiht it is."
"dfranzen70","5","1","2","1 July 2002"," Still-Bourne
","Matt Damon stars as a young man found floating in the middle of the ocean by some French fisherman. He has no memory of who he is, but he does have a weird computer chip implanted in his hip and two bullets in his back. The chip contains a number of an account in Zurich, and there he finds a safety-deposit box with multiple passports, a lot of money, and a gun.<br/><br/>
The young man chooses the identity of Jason Bourne from the box. But who is Jason Bourne? The money and the IDs, along with his supersonic reflexes and hand-to-hand fighting skills, seem to indicate that he's not your typical car salesman. For whom does Bourne work? Is he an assassin? A good guy? A bad guy? And who's following him, anyway? <br/><br/>Bourne hightails it out of Zurich, heading to Paris in the company of Marie (Franka Potente), who accepts his offer of $10,000 to drive him (and another $10,000 when they get there). And of the course of the bulk of the movie, Bourne tries to reconstruct his life - and his identities.<br/><br/>
The movie is based on a Robert Ludlum potboiler thriller, and was made into a TV movie in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne. Having not read the book yet, I had no real expectations of the movie. Matt Damon, however, did strike me as a little too young for the role. He's a good actor, and this is a good role for him to work on his acting chops, but he just didn't do it for me in this movie. Damon can be appealing at times, but he's still relatively early in his career, and just not the heavyweight that this role seemed to demand. He seemed very unsure of himself (although, of course, Bourne's very unsure, not knowing who he is or what he's become), veering at times from strong-willed action hero to puzzled milquetoast. <br/><br/>As Marie, Potente isn't half bad - she's actually very good, and she gets better as the movie progresses. She's a wanderer without a real home, much like Bourne, and Potente does a fine job of essaying her character's change from someone being forced on a mission to a faithful sidekick, of sorts.<br/><br/>
Another problem is the lack of chemistry between Damon and Potente. The scenes they shared - and there were plenty - should have been sizzling, but they pretty much died in terms of chemistry. Luckily, there was plenty of action surrounding them to make up for this failing. <br/><br/>The worst problem, however, was the directing itself. Doug Liman (Swingers) is a pretty good director, but this was his first shot at a spy thriller. Too bad he dropped the ball - the pacing is absolutely leaden throughout much of the film. Either a lot of things were happening - which can be good, as it disguises plot holes - or nothing was happening. If providing a sense of atmosphere was the goal, the film did not succeed. <br/><br/>The writing itself was pretty crisp, although the characters were a little flat (and, aside from the two leads, they were caricatures, including Cooper's Machiavellian bad guy). The explosions and car chases were great, but that's become the norm for these films."
"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","30 June 2002"," superficial spy flick
","What exactly is it that determines the moral code by which a person lives? And can the very same person be a cold-blooded murderer in one incarnation, then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away?  These provocative questions are raised, though never adequately explored, in `The Bourne Identity,' a fairly standard man-on-the-run spy thriller based on the best selling novel by Robert Ludlum.  Written by Tony Gilroy and directed by Doug Liman, `The Bourne Identity' tells the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bullet-riddled body was plucked floating out of the Mediterranean Sea.  Initially unaware of his secret agent status, Jason - together with Marie, a young woman he picks up in Switzerland and hires to drive him to Paris - tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose.  Essentially we are back in old Hitchcock territory, where the story's hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to him.<br/><br/>`The Bourne Identity' might have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation.  Instead, the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise.  There are brief flashes where Jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience, but they are quickly thrown over for the usual cat-and-mouse accoutrements of this odd-man-out scenario.  And, frankly, despite the novelty of the Paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way, nothing in the film really much engages the audience's sympathy or interest. Matt Damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of Bourne's character, but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a government-generated killing machine.  What's missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character, whom we have come to view as comassionate and loving, could ever have done the things he is said to have done. That analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current form.<br/><br/>The film is at its most interesting when it shows how Bourne, because he is himself a product of CIA training, can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game.  <br/><br/>The film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of Paris (though it pales in comparison to the ones in `Ronin').  But I can't believe that filmmakers are STILL using that old standby  the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it.  I thought that one had been put to rest, finally and irrevocably, 30 years ago in `What's Up, Doc?'"
"WilliamSG","Null","1","2","28 June 2002"," Another poor film for this year.. - when will it end?
","*spoilers*<br/><br/>Why oh why can't we have a decent, stylish thriller? Why? For some reason, directors think they can have some flashy binoculars and the words 'Zurich, Switzerland' in a computer-style type-written font, and that all us idiots in the world will sigh 'ooooh...cool'. Well not this idiot. Oh, and I haven't even gotten onto the ridiculous plot-holes yet.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie sounded good. However, you have to suspend disbelief immediately when you're supposed to believe that Bourne didn't drown in the water in the beginning. I'll let that go though and move on... When we finally have Bourne on his feet, we're rewarded by some relatively solid acting. Matt Damon is a far superior and more believable actor than Ben Affleck, who was pretty unconvincing in ""The Sum of All Fears"", out around the same time as ""Bourne."" Anyway, Damon does a decent job, as does Franka Potente, who hasn't really done anything great since ""Blow"" and ""Run Lola Run"" - which was superb. Julia Stiles should be ashamed of herself for taking such a nothing part, and I won't any further mention of her during this review. Clive Owen does a pretty suave job as a government hired assassin, and I think we'll see a lot more of him in the future. 007 perhaps? <br/><br/>Anyway, to the meat of the review - the terrible plot holes. Stop reading here if you haven't see the movie! Firstly, why exactly is it that the CIA want Bourne dead? Why? It makes absolutely no sense! Wombosi was killed afterwards, and so surely they just need to contact Bourne and sort out the whole amnesia thing. But no! Why not kill Bourne? No wait! I think I figured out why the CIA wanted to kill him! - because the director thought it would make a good movie and that hopefully movie-goers wouldn't notice! Genius! As soon as we see Potente arguing at the American Embassy, you know she's going to be a part of the movie. How wonderfully coincidental that she just happens to be outside with a 'soon to be Porsche style' Mini when Damon makes his escape. How handy. Cliché-orama. And what about that red bag? Damon leaves it at the station in the locker, yet apparently never picks it up again. How then does he happen to have it back when they're shacked up at Eamon's house? The point of leaving it at the station was what, pray tell? That might not be too ridiculous, but you'd think the director could at least understand time zones whilst making the movie. 'Meet me in Paris at 5.30pm today' says Bourne, in one scene. We then see the plane, quite clearly not a Concorde - at the airport. There's no possible way the CIA agent could have made it to Paris at that time. You could just say I'm being picky, but it just irked me the second that scene graced the screen. Sigh (number 1 of many). Heck...watch the movie. You'll probably pick up far more instances than me in regards to the plot holes.<br/><br/>In regards to the action, of which there was little, - it was pretty irritating. There was once nice car chase, which has been likened to Ronin's, but it's not in the same league. Firstly, Bourne is driving a Mini. Secondly...well..is there need for one? It did however amuse me when a policeman on a bike tries to...well...ram the car, or something. I couldn't quite figure out that part. Car vs bike. I wonder who will win.<br/><br/>
In regards to the Bourne fight scenes, they were astonishingly poorly shot. The camera kept moving in different directions. It hurt the eyes to watch. It was a real mess. <br/><br/>I could go on, but I won't. I feel like this review is written as badly as the movie was directed. If you've seen the movie already, you'll know what I mean, and if you're about to see the movie, you'll soon know what I mean. Oh, and the ending. Can we say 'cliché' any more times?<br/><br/>

The Matt Damon version does NOTHING to explain who Jason Bourne is, or how he came to lose his memory, and is ""loosely"" based on the book much the same way that a Big Mac combo is ""loosely"" described as ""food"". The plot is weak, and the storyline doesn't explain anything. The main character is portrayed as a man who has lost his memory while on a mission to kill someone. No mention of the identity of the target is made, or why Jason Bourne was sent to kill him in the first place, and Jason Bourne's real name isn't mentioned either. If you want the REAL version, I seriously recommend that you watch the original 2 part mini-series, cos that IS taken directly from the book.

Anyways, so I thought that the visuals were decent because none of it really felt like it was done on screen and the places looked like real areas that you can find and go to. Some of the action was really awesome and exciting while other bits sort of fell flat. Matt Damon I thought has an alright performance but I didn't really think much of the female.

","I really lean both ways when it comes to this one. One part of me says, ""Wow, this is a great movie with a cool plot!"" and the other side says, ""I'd rather be sleeping in my bed than sleeping through this movie.""<br/><br/>First, the good: It's realistic. It's got cool locations and the action is 100% real (as in no CGI). <br/><br/>Then, the not so good: There's really not too much dialogue, and consequently not too much sympathy or empathy that goes to the characters. I have about the same amount of sympathy for a pedestrian on the street as I do for Jason Bourne in this movie. And instead of adding more dialogue or character development, they fill the movie with long, unnecessary shots of the locations and scenery. They show the characters doing pointless busy work all the time that really doesn't need to be shown on film! Probably because they couldn't think of anything else to fill the gaps! <br/><br/>And plus, it could've been over in a half hour. It's a simple story. And they kept it simple. And by doing so, they made it very boring. I'd say this is, without a doubt, the slowest action movie I've ever seen. But the ending DOES make you want to come back and see the sequels.<br/><br/>So, there you have it. My final advice is, if you haven't seen it, see it. It'll be a classic in the world of action movies someday... it's just a little slow. Don't watch it with high expectations, though. Like I said, it's slow.

I can't account for this picture's popularity aside from this one difference.<br/><br/>Most of the time, Matt Damon looks like he's playing a Jedi -- he goes through his ""action"" sequences without even seeming to breathe. He practically looks bored. Perhaps he feels the Force. I never thought I'd say this, but Tom Cruise actually looks like a talented actor in comparison. His ""Mission Impossible"" was much the same flick as ""Bourne"" but had far greater intensity and emotional involvement. <br/><br/>Which brings us back to the creative use of violence. I found it ineffective, ultimately, as it seemed to wrench the viewer out of what little realism is going on. Perhaps real-world assassins are just that cool (how much black leather can you fit in one movie?) -- going out to ""do the job"" and never feeling emotional or psychological consequences.

So then what does Damon's character do? He continues to carry this bright red canvas with him through most of the rest of the movie all across Europe.Duh!

The young man is now wanting to know who he is, going to this bank account in Zurich, he finds his identification as Jason Bourne, but also underneath the cover he finds more passports with fake names, money, and a gun! He is now following all the clues he has, and with the help of to-be love interest Marie Helena Kreutz (Creep's Franka Potente), they are trying to find out exactly what he did before losing his memory, and escaping the attack of the unknown agency assassins. Obviously we - the audience - know that bad guys, led by Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), with help from Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) are an organisation called Treadstone, a secret agency specialising in secret agents. Jason in the end finds out he was one of these agents, with the ""fateful"" mission being to kill politician Wombosi (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), before he and Marie go into hiding.

The plot deviation from the book takes place relatively early on and from then on the viewer is left wondering what went wrong.

His amnesia does not allow him to know what has happened in the last two years, but he does know that he has to outrun a large team of assassins in hot pursuit. Equally puzzling is his possession of a bag of multiple passports and money to burn. And what kind of movie would this be without the obligatory feminine charm. Along the way Bourne gets aid from a young woman(Franka Potente)who also is dealing with a messy life.<br/><br/>Beautiful European settings and the exceptional sound effects make the gun play, fighting and great car chase extra exciting. Damon does the role justice and helps make the unbelievable believable. Other cast members of note are: Chris Cooper, Gabriel Mann and Julia Stiles. Miss Potente is more viable as the movie progresses. Thrills, chills, intrigue and very loud action makes this one among this summers best."

","The Bourne Identity did not follow the book at all except the fact that Jason Bourne lost his memory. The plot in the book was about a man who loses his memory and tries to find out who he is. In his quest he finds out that he is a government agent trying to catch an international assassin named Carlos. He was following the trail of Carlos and he took the credit for Carlos assassinations so he could draw carlos out and make Carlos come after him so he could catch him. The movie strayed far from the book. Jason bourne was not a part of a group of assassins working for the government. The director of this movie is an idiot. He got away with changing the plot because Robert Ludlum was dead when he made the movie. If Robert Ludlum were alive when he made this movie the director would have been fired. Shame on that idiot."
"Ziya90","6","1","4","24 January 2010"," A run of the mill and forgettable action thriller
","For the first time, I watched Bourne Identity years years ago, it was just another action thriller like watch and be entertained. To me it is so weird and sad that the rating of Identity (7.7) is higher than the rating of Supremacy which is unusual and astonishing with amazing action scenes. Bourne Identity is a well made and engrossing action thriller, but ordinary and forgettable. The only success of the movie is that despite the story is cliché (a spy who loses his memory tries to remember his past and identity while struggling with other spies who try to kill him), the movie does not make you feel this. The relationship between him and the girl seems cliché (always our hero finds a girl or a girl finds him), but in my opinion, it was realistic, so no problem wih it. In terms of action, the movie is not slow paced, but there are two three action scenes including a well (but not cool or fresh) car chase that's why it is forgettable. Therefore, if you want an engrossing thriller, you are not disappointed, but if you expect a solid action movie, or lots of action, it becomes a big disappointment. The most and may be only astonishing thing was Clive Owen (so his character) to me. He adds zest to the movie. And there is one thing at the final part that I haven't forgotten since that year. It was a brilliant action moment which we had not seen a similar one before."
"blacklist-1","4","1","4","27 December 2009"," A decent effort but it fails to impress enough
","I knew nothing of the the Bourne books written by Robert Ludlum, but I like spy thrillers and thought it would be worth a look and I have to say I was quite disappointed. It starts intriguing with a man called Jason Bourne found shot on a fishing boat way out to see who wakes knowing nothing about himself, his name or past life and ends up being pursued by assassins as he tries to find out about himself.<br/><br/>Overall the story of the film is quite complicated to understand and may need re seeing twice but even then you like me may lose your interest in anything that's going on. Another criticism is that there is too much plot with very little action attached throughout. The movie as a whole becomes long winded particularly clocking at two hours.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as Bourne I'm afraid fails to impress. He seems far too normal with the situation he's in. There are not many emotive qualities to attach in particular when he falls for Maria played by Franka Potente. There relationship fails to convince really and the aura of Damon being physically diminutive makes him unconvincing as an assassin hired by the CIA.<br/><br/>However the supporting cast like Clive Owen as a hit-man and Brian Cox,Chris Cooper and Juila Stiles as CIA operatives make the most of there roles. The action what there was entertaining, it was well shot and to be fair the film is just setting up the story for the next two parts which I fear though will be equally disappointing. It's a decent effort on the whole but it just wasn't good enough."

I'll read it later.<br/><br/>If you like car chases, stunts and action scenes you will like this film. However, I don't enjoy the chase just for the sake of it. Too little background information is given. The storyline remains vague.<br/><br/>
Bourne fails to shoot the African dictator in exile because his children are hanging about. How unbelievable is this for an highly trained ""better than James Bond"" type of agent.

"phoeniceus","2","1","4","15 June 2002"," How Mr. Ludlum Really Died!
","It is evident that Robert Ludlum's passing came not by the natural aging process but from an advance screening of this adaptation of his most successful novel.  Fortunately, he gets to enjoy the wonders of the afterlife and we are burdened by yet another movie that wastes our time and money and fills up our consciousness with it's marketing ad nauseum.  Not every movie adaptation of a book will mimic the source entirely, but this doesn't even come close. The only common links that this movie has are the name Jason Bourne and that he has lost his memory of his life as an assassin. I don't even see how it can carry the title if it has nothing else of the meat of the story.  Where is Carlos the assassin, Bourne's adversary whom Bourne was trained to go after?  Where is Marie st. Jacques who was Bourne's shield and hostage and who at first tried turning in Bourne repeatedly before trying to help him learn who he really was?  Where is David Webb who took on the persona of Jason Bourne to lure out Carlos?  Clearly if you're a fan of the books don't expect this to be anything like them.<br/><br/>So, if you can't expect the movie to mimic the books then you can at least hope that the movie, in general is entertaining.  Sadly, it's sluggish like molasses.  And as i knew from the day they cast him, Matt Damon is no Jason Bourne let alone an international assassin.  And the makeup department didn't do well enough to cover his pimples.  But Damon is a big draw for the prepubescent girls who drool over his natural good looks, which seem to propel him to stardom since he has no natural acting ability.  But you can't really blame him since the direction and dialogue really didn't seem to provide him any chances to prove himself as an actor.  He had a moment or two where i began to believe he was in character.  The movie should have moved you along swiftly but there seemed to be a lot of pot holes along the way.<br/><br/>Bourne was a cold-blooded killer and yet one who had vulnerabilities he couldn't quite keep repressed.  Matt couldn't seem to bring out the cold or the warmth of the character.  He just seemed lukewarm.  I think the only redeeming quality of the movie was that it closed any doors to a sequel. But this is Hollywood, they'll find any way to make a sequel no matter how bad the first, right Mr. Lucas?"

"EthanBJones_03","4","0","3","28 May 2017"," The Bourne Disappointment
","​'THE BOURNE IDENTITY' was directed by Doug Liman, stars Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper and is the story of a man(Matt Damon) who is found stranded in the ocean with no knowledge of who he is. The only things he can remember are his enhanced ability to kill. As events unfold, he discovers who he is and why he why he didn't know who he was.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with skyrocketed expectations. That may have tainted my viewing but I just don't understand the sheer praise sent this movie's way. Sure Damon was pretty good and the action was pretty entertaining but aside from that, there is little more enjoyment to be found here. The Bourne Disappointment contains enough to be watchable but not enough to the point I can recommend it. Damon is, to be fair, pretty good as the star character but I don't think its the role he SHOULD be remembered for. The action is also decent but it doesn't hold to the standard that I've heard so many people praise it for. If you enjoy this movie, fine. But don't come to me and praise it as a gritty, realistic spy thriller that changed action movies because it just isn't. It's fine.<br/><br/>Right, the story for this movie has a genuine level of intrigue and I can understand it is more grounded in reality than say Bond, or Mission Impossible. That said, I don't think that it is interesting enough to make it better than what it is. While the story is fine it's not great and could have been done much better, especially considering the concept. Pretty disappointing to be honest.<br/><br/>Again, Matt Damon is the only genuinely great thing in this movie for me. I don't think it should be the role people recognise him for but I do genuinely buy both the confused side of his character and the badass side of his character. Franke Potente was, on the other hand, awful as Marie Krutz. She was more wooden than a tree and possessed no likable or redeeming qualities that made me care in any way. One thing this movie was praised for is the 'chemistry' between Bourne and Krutz. How? Where is their chemistry? An ant and the heel of my sneaker have more chemistry. Jesus and Judas have better chemistry than these two. Hitler and a homosexual Jewish man have better chemistry. They have no chemistry and I challenge you to prove me otherwise. Chris Cooper existed and was there. The villain was very weak.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this movie was fine. The use of shaky cam and Liman's breaking of things such as the 180 rule definitely benefited this movie and sold the idea of realism and grittiness. The effects were also fine but thankfully they weren't used consistently.<br/><br/>I do like how neither us(the audience) or Bourne actually understand the character of Bourne. I think the dynamic of that is clever and works well in the context of the movie. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is honestly just average. Some action is good and Damon was good as Bourne but I just can't see enough substance to keep this movie better than what it is. I don't think it deserves the immense praise it gets and I think it's fine. I don't recommend it but if you like it, than I guess I do envy you for seeing something I just cannot.<br/><br/>4/10"

","This movie begins with some fishermen in the Meditterean Sea recovering a body they see floating in the water. When they pull the unconscious man (Matt Damon) aboard the boat they realize that he is alive and has two bullet holes in his back. After treating his wounds the man awakens but doesn't know who he is or any events from his past. Fortunately, one particular piece of evidence found upon him has an account number for a bank in Zurich which the man immediately proceeds to check out when he finally gets to shore. Upon opening the bank deposit box the man discovers several passports under different names, a large stack of money in various currencies and a gun. He takes everything but the gun and decides to use the name of ""Jason Bourne"" from the American passport. He then proceeds to the American embassy in Zurich and discovers that for some reason he is wanted by almost all of the law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States. He also discovers that he is especially adept with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that the overall story was acquired from a book (of the same title) which was written by Robert Ludlum and used in a previous mini-series in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain in the main role. Unlike the mini-series, however, this particular film has better action and more suspense which results in a slightly better movie in my opinion. It is also followed by several sequels which are quite enjoyable as well."
"tomgillespie2002","6","0","1","2 September 2016"," A nifty, grounded thriller
","Few could have expected the affect Doug Liman's adaptation of Robert Ludlum's novel The Bourne Identity would have on action cinema, and on the career of star Matt Damon, when it was released back in 2002. This well-crafted, relatively low-key action thriller takes the done-to-death spy-with-amnesia story and runs with it, avoiding the lure of throwing in Michael Bay-esque explosions and wisely keeping things grounded, as shady government types in dull black suits stare at computer monitors and make demands to their younger cronies that they have the information they require 'yesterday'. <br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, a fishing vessel picks up a man near death with two bullet holes in his back. The on-board doctor tends to his wounds and pulls a small device from his hip, which reveals a Swiss bank account number when activated. The man has no memory of who he is, and so heads to Zurich to recover a safe deposit box that contains multiple identities, a wad of cash in different currencies, and a gun. He opts to go by the name on his American passport, Jason Bourne, but soon finds himself chased by a shadowy agency called Treadstone, seemingly led by the ruthless Conklin (Chris Cooper). Evading capture at the American embassy, he pays pretty German lady Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris in the hope of discovering who he is and who is after him.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne can now be spoken in the same breath as James Bond, and in fact makes the British super-spy seem ridiculous in comparison, especially the Pierce Brosnan incarnation. Bourne is infinitely more interesting because he is conflicted, tortured by a past of mass- murder and seeking to make amends for his actions. While the action scenes thrill in a refreshingly unspectacular way, it's Bourne's tender relationship with Marie that generate the most sparks. Potente is lovely in the role, and her naturalism and chemistry with Damon is the film's biggest positive, and there are smart turns from Cooper and Brian Cox as the grumpy old agency men and Clive Owen as a dead-eyed fellow assassin. While it may pale in comparison to the bar-raising Paul Greengrass sequels, Identity is still a nifty thriller with characters to actually care about."

I haven't read the book - like I said the genre is not one I can work up a sweat about - so I had no expectations to cause disappointment. After a slow start it picked up the tempo by the third reel, grabbed you by the throat and refused to let go. Albeit formulaic - the one about the fugitive who picks up an obligatory female companion to share his travails goes back at least as far as The Thirty- Nine Steps which is about as time-honoured as they come and Franka Potente is just far enough off the wall to be interesting. Certainly entertains for at least an initial viewing."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","20 January 2016"," Not the greatest spy movie, but better than most.
","I don't consider this to be the absolute epitome of spy action movies, but it does have some things that many spy movies do not. The most prominent of these is an internal conflict. Many spy movies make an attempt at internal goals, but most of these involve under-developed love interests, and even Bourne is not entirely exempt from this. However, his main internal goal is to discover who he is. The way it balances out is great because he wants to renounce his former life as an assassin, but that doesn't mean he isn't willing to use his awesome skills to do so. It seems a little contradictory to escape a life of violence by means of violence, but it's a lot more believable than many of the other peace-loving action heroes that movies have featured.<br/><br/>The form of amnesia that Bourne has is a little too convenient and is not unique to this movie, as we've seen it featured in the two most recent Fast and Furious movies (6 and 7). From what I know of the book, I think we only see Bourne's point of view, but it was good that they show some of the story from the perspective of Clonkin and the Treadstone division. A lot of what goes on within Treadstone is a little confusing, but it's okay because all we really care about is how it impacts Jason Bourne, and that usually becomes pretty evident soon afterward. Some of the story is just driven by the audience's desire to see Bourne fight paid guns with skillful and brutal technique. But we end up caring about him finding himself and protecting Marie as well. It's not boring when there isn't a fight scene going on like some action movies.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne is a likable character because he's a human wrecking machine, but he's emotional as well and you can sympathize with him. This is shown with the help of his companion Marie. It's true that her and Bourne ending up together is as expected and unlikely as in any other movie, but at least Marie has personality and actually likes Jason rather than just falling for him inexplicably like a Bond girl. There isn't as much development from our numerous antagonists, which include Wombosi, Clonkin and his staff, and the various unnamed people that Bourne has to fight. They mostly exist to drive the plot rather than create any real conflict. Additionally, I felt like the scenes with the antagonists were some of the worst executed. They featured dialogue and computer-style cinematography that is very generic to spy movies. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it felt like it didn't belong in this kind of movie where it's more a battle of wits and skills than of technology and gadgets.<br/><br/>This brings us to the action scenes. I thought the car chases were well done, which unfortunately cannot be said of The Bourne Supremacy. The hand-to-hand combat is very fast paced with tons of shot cuts to emphasize how superior Bourne is to most of the people he fights. They are well choreographed and have some original touches to them, like Bourne using a ball-point pen to fight one of his foes. Matt Damon gives a performance that surpasses what one usually expects from someone in his role. The same goes for Franka Potente in the role of Marie. The script is decent as is the directing and camreawork.<br/><br/>If you're looking for just an action movie, this will be satisfactory, but it has more to offer than action. Still, you probably won't enjoy it if you are averse to spy or action movies in general. If you liked the novel, I'll just say that from what I've heard the movie seems to deviate enough from the book that it might be disappointing for you. So if you decide to watch it, enjoy but be prepared to pay more than normal attention. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","The Bourne Identity is quite fun and faced paced, but really that's the only thing that makes this film watchable. The storyline is nothing new, whilst the cat and mouse chasing sequences (even though epic and thrilling) have been done to death. However, even though riddled with action movie clichés, The Bourne Identity does set itself apart from other films like it, with fantastic acting and a new spin on the secret agent idea.<br/><br/>Even though The Bourne Identity could very well of been another James Bond movie, it does have some individuality about it.

He doesn't remember basically anything about his life, so we follow him on his journey to discover who he is.<br/><br/>And this movie got many things right, it establishes the character of Jason Bourne very well, and we root for him, we want him to win, so the movie gets that very right. The thing that moves this movie is pretty much the intrigue we have in finding out who Jason Bourne really is. Matt Damon is great as the character, but I think the directing and cinematography could have been better.<br/><br/>Not to say they were bad, I just think a main problem the movie has is that it should have packed a meaner punch, few (but some) scenes feel a little bland and that shouldn't happen in an action movie. Another big issue I have with the film is another thing that should never happen in an action flick. That is that the movie feels uneven at times, not from a story standpoint, but from a speed point of view. What I mean is the movie moves very fast at times, but sometimes way too slow and this isn't really balanced.<br/><br/>In the end, I enjoyed the Bourne Identity, although I think the movie could and should have hit harder and been better."

","The Bourne Identity (2002): Dir: Doug Liman / Cast: Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, Clive Owen: Exhilarating remake about self discovery that hardly translates as decent entertainment. A wounded body is found at sea but he isn't aware of who he is so he assumes the identity of Jason Bourne. He can also speak several languages and beat the tar out of people. He pays a woman a sum of money to drive him from danger. Interesting setup becomes one violent scene after another. Director Doug Liman proves that he can handle action right down to the corrupt conclusion. He previously made a much better film in Go. Matt Damon mirrors Bourne's amnesia and paranoia but he is reduced to constant combat. Franka Potente serves no purpose other than to be a potential sex partner. Chris Cooper is also reduced to a standard role and Julia Stiles are wasted. Clive Owen would go on to become a rather successful action star but here he basically plays a role billed as the professor. The film exists as entertainment but as such it substitutes intelligence for numerous violent encounters and variations of martial arts fights that seem to go on forever. This is the first of several books surrounding the Bourne character but hopefully all of them won't be translated to screen this poorly. Themes of identity and ability overshadowed by pointless violence in this overrated dog show. Score: 4 / 10"

","Who doesn't like a good thriller once in a while? We're sadly bound to Hollywood providing cheap films in our local multiplex when the word, ""thriller"" comes to mind. It's the independent hits with an appreciation for reality that make you grasp at the edge of our seats. The birth of a soon to be five-film franchise is so far the most lame and lifeless. All the necessities for a successful film both in qualitative and financial terms are at the edge of the producers of, ""The Bourne Identity"" noses. Based loosely on Robert Ludlum's novel, the Bourne Identity is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fishermen who nurse him back to wellness. He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as the Swiss bank account, the number of which, is implanted in his hip. Familiar territory, anyone? He soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with a girl on a search to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. The whole identity crisis element gets tangled into so many films that don't even require the film to be good. We spend money on films to excite us, and since producers, writers, and directors know how to make easy films that can please audiences based on financial data, they throw the same baloney at us. ""The Bourne Identity"" relies on an identity crisis. Nothing is thrilling, exciting, or even the slight most interesting. Every second feels like a bedtime story kids beg to end to fall asleep. Director Doug Liman can do pretty fun things in wildly entertaining blockbusters, but he kind of just tells his crew to make sure the sound is loud and the camera is still. The whole films plays like the sound on a medical machine that stimulates the knowledge that a guy died. You follow? I asked too many rhetorical questions due to how repetitive the dullness carries on in the film itself."

","The Bourne Identity is an excellent Action/Thriller that keeps you watching even when it slows down in pace. It is similar to Bond movies but with one major difference - it's got a very good plot & story to it.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is perfect in the role of Jason Bourne, and Franka Potente as Marie - his somewhat unfortunate ""partner in crime"" - is good without ever becoming annoying. This is definitely a movie you need to pay attention to, because in parts the story moves along almost as fast as the action and if you don't keep up then it can be easy to get lost on what's happening. That is in no way a bad thing, though, as it gives you that ""want to see what happens next"" feeling. The movie does slow down in some parts, but even when that happens the movie's plot-line still ticks along nicely without it ever getting boring.<br/><br/>A movie very much recommended."

","This is the kind of action movie that always seems believable. Other action movies usually have some kind of weird gadget or an over the top over blown action sequence with some kind of scheme to blow up the moon or melt the polar ice caps. None of that is in this movie. The action scenes are good but they're believable. There aren't many strange or amazing gadgets in this movie. In fact there aren't any gadgets at all. This is the plot. A man (Matt Damon) is found by Italian fishermen riddled with bullets off the coast of Marseille, France. He is picked up and discovers that he is suffering from amnesia. He can't remember who he is or what he did. But he does know that he possesses a number of unusual skills. He travels to Zurich, Switzerland where he receives a number of passports all with his picture but with different names and nationalities. He takes the name Jason Bourne. Meanwhile in the United States CIA Director Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) is talking about a failed attempt to assassinate Nigerian dictator Nykwana Wombasi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and that Jason was responsible for it failing. They go to arrest him in Zurich. Meanwhile Jason goes to the state US Embassy in Zurich, but US Marines recognize him. The Marines attempt to arrest him but he escapes. He meets a woman named Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) that he offers $10,000 to if she drives him to Paris, France. She reluctantly accepts. Marie is suspicious of Jason for obvious reasons. Jason still does not know who he is and tells this to Marie. When they get to Paris, they visit Jason's assumed house. When they are there a CIA Agent breaks in and attempts to arrest Jason and Marie. They know realize that they are wanted. Under another identity John Michael Kane, Jason finds out documents about the night that an attempt on Wombasi's life was made. He finds out that an assassin was escaping off of Wombasi's boat when a secret serviceman shot him twice in the back. Afterwards Jason and Marie go to the French countryside and take refuge in Marie's friend Eamon's (Tim Dutton) house to stay away from the CIA. A CIA assassin (Clive Owen) attempts to kill Jason but he defeats him. He then tells Marie and Eamon to leave the house to stay away from any further danger. Jason confronts Conklin and another agent named Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who sent the assassin and Conklin tells Jason that he was the assassin whose mission it was to kill Wombasi, but he didn't because his children were in the room. Jason escapes and Conklin is killed by another agent. Jason meets up with Marie in Greece and the two are united. This is a really good well thought out action movie that doesn't feature over the top action scenes that you usually find in other movies of this genre. I highly recommend it."

","The Bourne Identity succeeds where many action films fail in that it keeps its action grounded yet entertaining. There are no huge explosions or entire city blocks being leveled just for the sake of looking cool and pandering to the action junkies among the viewers. Suffice to say it'd be more accurate to call this film an action thriller as far as mood and style go.<br/><br/>And it's a really good action thriller. The mystery of Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) memory loss is interesting, the locations are varied, the characters and their actors do a credible job of pulling us into their world, the action feels suitably heavy and threatening and as a whole the story is told well, with captivating pacing.<br/><br/>I also really like Matt Damon and Franka Potente together in this film. They have instant chemistry together, but it's never overplayed. They get to know each other along the way, but always at the terms of the larger action taking place around them. This feels more realistic than many other action couples where they seem ready to jump each other's bones at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>As a whole The Bourne Identity is a peculiar action classic. It's downplayed and even minimalistic, but it's shot and told so well that even hardcore action fans won't complain. Easily worth a watch."

","I came to this after a difficult viewing of a film about the psychologic nature of truth, how memory governs a story, looking to replenish myself with something similar but more straightforward. It felt good to be back within comfort zones.<br/><br/>It wasn't a spy film by accident, a genre that is in a deeper sense all about how we witness things. My yardstick of an effective spy film is how much of the spying is left to the viewer and how much is pieced for his amusement, how difficult it is to stay tethered to a shifting order of things.<br/><br/>Here we're so very comfortably tethered. On the boat we learn that he has no memory and it probably won't come back. One of the very first scenes is immediately in Langley so we know he's CIA. We quickly know about the specific mission. He's tracked, makes an escape. Video game opponents are activated to find him. ""I want Jason Bourne in a bodybag by sundown"" back in Langley. Great fights and car chases.<br/><br/>Most of the dialogue in crucial moments is so that we know exactly what's going on. So we share some of Bourne's uncertainty about the deeper reasons yet at the same time know much more than he does as we switch back and forth from his situation to the larger plot. Obviously it would be a much riskier film if we were called to fathom the larger mechanics from his pov alone, but for tonight it worked for me fine.<br/><br/>Damon would be completely wrong for this except his hardened spy is given to us via his wide-eyed boyish persona. So we follow an ordinary American youth who might as well have been backpacking across Europe, who is assailed by paranoid perceptions (looking out for exit doors etc), whose body is at crucial moments suddenly possessed by another self who pre-exists in a different narrative.<br/><br/>I liked that they put him next to an ordinary girl with a beat-up old Mini worrying about a visa, it draws out this boy in his late-20s who would have all the time to fall in love while hitching a ride to Paris but for this previous narrative of political wrongdoing.<br/><br/>In the end the son turns against the irascible father, played by Cooper and channeling American Beauty (the son was a filmmaker there, here he's struggling to piece an 'inner film'). He meets the girl in an island. It's all so childishly simple around that commentary.<br/><br/>I have the feel I'll be able to enjoy this again in the future as a North by Northwest pop-up without any baggage of cinematic mastery attached."

","Think about it. The books were loosely based on the romanticized life and works of Carlos the Jackal. And while a masterpiece in literature, in my opinion, it revolved more around Jason Bourne. It was a Psychological Thriller and remained a classic for that reason.<br/><br/>So, for obvious reasons, they couldn't adapt the movie directly from the book. The several names are there and people are there, but most of it had to be modernized and personally, I loved the way that they did it. The story remained about Bourne and how he is clawing his way out of his mind to try and remember anything and everything about his past life, not only out of sheer curiosity, but because, well, people are hunting him and he has no idea why.<br/><br/>Which is why I give this movie a damn good review. Everything else they could have tossed out of the window, but that psychological part, the part that I think most Bourne fans will agree, was the most crucial and they nailed it to the effing tree. Marie is there to help the damaged killer to find his human side and realize that not everyone in the world is after him. The acting is superb, the fight scenes are gritty, brutal and realistic, the plot, if basic, is strong and to the point. Only a few side plots are added and everything is neatly wrapped up at the end."

","This film is simply in my opinion fantastic. When I watch an action spy film I believe that apart from the Daniel Craig James Bond films there shouldn't be this idea of cool gadgets smart cars and endless women. This is the most appealing part of The Bourne identity for me, I enjoy action films a lot and with there being no gadgets, no real nice cars and only 1 female I got exactly what I wanted. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne a disgruntled man who has been shot twice and is rescued with no memory which leads to this story of finding himself. Damon is solid in this film he is tough when in fights with enemies but shows that he is a human being when treating others allied with him. You feel sorry for him in the situation he is in even though he is clearly a dangerous human being. He encounters Franka Potente who plays the character Maria who helps him and I believe in this crazy situation the chemistry between the two characters is good and believable with the distressing predicament with the government after them. Another positive is the fact that this film is mostly based in Paris which is nice cause it isn't London or the USA which is refreshing. This film is Awesome and if you like fighting spy films then this is a must watch film."

","When watching a film for the first time, it is necessary to allow yourself to be immersed completely in the story, characters and locations. This is harder if you have no background information, but can be even more rewarding if you commit to it. You learn as the characters do, and you follow their journey. What makes 'The Bourne Identity' so rewarding, therefore, is that for once you are on a complete equal with the main character in terms of information – you learn as he does.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a trained CIA assassin who has had his memory wiped, and is found by a ships' crew, floating unconscious in the sea. Gradually, we learn more about him as he does. He has a great set of skills which only need to be triggered to be used. He has a swiss bank account with a large number of passports, all in different names. After the CIA is notified as to Bourne's whereabouts, they send people to track him down, so he's constantly on the run. Damon is a really fantastic actor, and plays Bourne in a serious yet connectable way. Franka Potente also does a great job as Bourne's love interest Marie, and the chemistry between the two is a really fantastic part of the film.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with spy films in this day and age is the endless comparison with James Bond, and the need to be different. This is where the film succeeds so well. It's got gadgets, action, the girl, but treats them in a very different way. It's more realistic, the technology is ever present yet not futuristic, and the action sequences are far more stylised and extremely engaging. The fight sequences are gripping and the way they are shot reminds you of a martial arts film. The chase sequences are frantic and more intimate. And it's far bleaker than a James Bond film, more personal, and this is possibly all down to Damon's fantastic character.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is its plot, which is at time difficult to follow, however the brilliance of the action sequences often makes up for this. It's a watchable and enjoyable film, with a lot of promise leading into the next instalments in the trilogy."

"Tehmeh","9","0","1","13 September 2013"," Still one of the best action thrillers.
","""Bourne identity"" is not only a good movie, but it's easily the best Bourne movie I've ever seen. Granted, I don't recall much of the Chamberlain Bourne from 1980's, but out of all these new ones (including ""Bourne legacy"") I clearly like this one the most. Here are the reasons why:<br/><br/>1) This is easily the most emotionally appealing Jason Bourne out of all three of this trilogy. There is more depth and sincerity in his struggles, and he isn't yet too seasoned and determined as he is in the sequels. Matt Damon gives a very good performance.<br/><br/>2) This movie focuses on the essential. It isn't trying to be smarter than it is. This isn't a movie about CIA spy programs and conspiracies as much as it is about Jason Bourne. This approach makes the movie more relatable, more exciting and more effective in every way.<br/><br/>3) Wonderful cast. Casting was never a problem in the sequels either, but I like the actors in this one the most. Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Franka Potente. Good job from each and every one of them.<br/><br/>4) Execution. I love most of the scenes in this movie for two reasons: they are just long enough to tell you that certain part of the story and maintain the suspense - never longer. When there's action, it's not only exciting but you actually see what's happening. Example one: confrontation with Clive Owen's character. It doesn't really take that long, but it's effective and suspenseful from start to finish. It doesn't get tedious or repetitive and it tells you every bit of the story you need to know. Maximum effectiveness. Example two: the fight scene in the apartment. It's inventive and exciting, but not only that: you see what's going on. While the sequels went a little crazy with the shaky-cam, this one includes enough shots from steady, different angles to a) keep you in the middle of the action and b) let you see the big picture as well. This is easily one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, even if the sound effects are a little overblown. <br/><br/>5) Violence. I'm not a gore fan, but these are not (nor should they be) kids' movies. Some of the action really has an impact on you. When someone gets hurt, you feel it.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it. This is simply an effective movie: it's paced perfectly, the cast is wonderful, action is thrilling and the more personal focus on the main character seals the deal. The sequels never came even close. They're not as bad as their hideous visual style (Greengrass hates my eyes), but they chose the path of messier and less appealing storytelling, tedious action and general shallowness. Soundtrack-wise the sequels got the upper hand in my mind, but that's it. I'm not exactly a fan of director Doug Liman, but he did such a fine job with this film and I would've wanted him to direct the sequels too.<br/><br/>I'm writing this review now, because I just got this movie in a blu-ray format (universal 100th anniversary something edition) and I thought I might as well write a review, even though I've had this film on DVD for many years. I'd like to compliment the product itself: this is how blu-rays should be made. Straight from the menus you know that there's been some effort. Plenty of stuff, bonuses and extras too."

It feels very much like a setup for a larger franchise and can't stand on it's own feet.<br/><br/>The two leads lack a distinctive image, even though I liked Matt Damon's presence.

And he then goes and takes out his anger out on everything the CIA throws at him.

I vividly remember the big tentpole releases of 2002 (""Spider-Man"", ""Attack of the Clones"", ""Road to Perdition"", ""Minority Report""), and none of them hold up for me as well as ""The Bourne Identity"". <br/><br/>It was a gamble back then to cast Matt Damon in the lead role (even though Liman & Co. clearly spun the Bourne novels into something else of their own), but it pays off. Damon is fully up to the task and brings his A game, belying his fresh-faced looks and convincingly brings a lethal spy to life. It also helps that he's backed by Chris Cooper and Brian Cox, but he deserves loads of credit. <br/><br/>The beauty of this thing is that it just doesn't seem to lose steam. Bourne's always moving (and therefore, so are we), whether he's trading fists or bullets, playing Spider-Man on the side of a building, or tearing up the streets of Paris in a well-done car chase (with a great song choice). But even in the quiet scenes, the mystery continues to deepen, and our attention is never adrift. And this was before Greengrass' hyperactive editing took over in the sequels. That takes skill. <br/><br/>The movie's got plenty going for it: the car chase, the fight scenes, the rapport between Damon and Potente, the seething rage in Cooper, beautiful locations, and the occasional sense that anything can happen (indeed, shockingly brutal fight scenes). <br/><br/>Solid spy/action movie, and all-around entertaining.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

He must recover his past soon because he has enemies, and they are closing in on him.<br/><br/>Prior to viewing for the first time it helps to arm your self with the knowledge that the source novel is an intelligent suspense thriller, not a balls to the wall action filled door stopper. Viewing The Bourne Identity now you can see it's very much about introducing the character, laying the foundations for what will become a series of films. Director Liman is in no hurry to tell his story either, I'm still bemused about the reviews that came out upon the film's release that proclaimed it as a high energy action movie and that it is briskly paced! It's a good film, one which doesn't lack for visual smartness, contains a couple of ""classic"" sequences and introduced us to a new action character, but really the narrative is very routine and lacks zip. While the ending is an anti climax and rather threadbare in terms of solutions and reward for having sat through nearly two hours of movie.<br/><br/>Not the brave new dawn of action spy thrillers you may have heard it is, but the cast engage well, the script is mature and there's just enough carrot dangled to entice you further into the sequel filled nosebag. 7/10"

","A movie that gorillas, orang utangs, and chimpanzees would appreciate. Also gamers..(those poor lonely people who play video games...a lot). The story cant be more simple. The script could not be more simple. The acting (was this really acting??) is awful. It is a fast moving film, and it has a car chase too. Matt Damon must have been told....keep the same facial expression all through the movie. And that is exactly what he does. There are sequels Bourne 2 and Bourne 3...which are (incredibly) a little worse than this. Joan Allen is in both those sequels....she must have been told....look angry all through the movie. And that is exactly what she does. The trilogy is rubbish. Movies made....strictly....for Dummies. The stories are supposed to be about exciting things happening in the world of spying (C.I.A. etc.)"

","The Bourne Identity (2002) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Nice thriller has a man (Matt Damon) being pulled from the ocean with two gunshot wounds to the back as well as suffering from amnesia. Over the course of time his memory slowly starts to come back but he's dodging countless assassins sent to kill him. Wth the help of a woman (Franka Potente) he tries to figure out his true identity. THE BOURNE IDENTITY didn't completely win me over but there's no question that it's a well crafted thriller that makes perfect use of its star. I think it's easy to see Damon in this role because he can not only handle the action scenes but he can also perfectly work through the more dramatic moments of the story. There are several scenes where the character pretty much cracks from not being able to remember who he is and Damon managed to make these scenes seem very real. Another major plus is that he's just so good in the action scenes. I'm not sure how many people knew Damon would be able to pull this off but the transition to an action star worked. It took me a while to warm up to Potente. She's certainly got a different look and style than you'd normally see in a movie like this and that's one thing I did enjoy. Once the story picked up and her character got more involved I thought the actress managed to come out of her shell. The supporting cast includes a nice turn by Chris Cooper who is also dependable. I think one of the film's biggest pluses was the beautiful location shooting. There's footage from across the world and it really helped add to the story. Add in some nice action scenes and a pretty good, if easy to follow story and you're left with an entertaining, anti-James Bond film."

","The Bourne Identity is a good action film. The action scenes' were fast paced and gripping; the love interest which develops as the film progresses was well done; Brian Cox and the other CIA men were wonderfully shady and full of the wrong intentions.<br/><br/>The problem is that it lacks the Greengrassian touch. It is quite difficult to put your finger on it, but The Bourne Identity lacks something that the Greengrass films have. Perhaps it's the more defined use of hand-held camera in The Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatium; perhaps it's the fast paced soundtrack. I feel that, at certain points in the film, it loses momentum. It is probably about 20 minutes too long and I could have done without all of the shots of him walking down streets and close ups of his face when he's driving et al. The remarkable thing about the Greengrass films is that they are so crisp and tight; it keeps the movie flowing at a good pace and keeps the viewer interested in the narrative. Somewhere along the line, you just feel The Bourne Identity lacks this.<br/><br/>It is a good film and sets up the other sequels nicely, but it lacks something that the other films have - the Greengrassian touch."

","For any of you who have watched any or all of this series and left scratching your head and wondering why you didn't follow the plot .. well, you're not to be blamed. How Gilroy could have written not one but THREE consecutive screenplays without a single mention of Carlos the Jackal astounds even a jaded movie watcher like me.<br/><br/>If you who don't know who Carlos the Jackal was (he's a real character - Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - from recent history who was just sentenced to life in prison again on 16 Dec 2011, about 10 days ago), then you can't possibly know who Jason Bourne is, nor the very reason for his existence and the ***entire point*** behind this outstanding Ludlum series.<br/><br/>Why would a screenwriter completely strip the core out of three books? Bourne coming to an understanding of how he had been 'created' by the agency, and his growing awareness of the true nature of his mission would have only added to this film. Why oh why was anything of importance to understanding the plot excised? Does Gilroy harbor secret feelings of respect for the hit-man character of Carlos, and was he embarrassed to actually write this character into the script as a villain? Surely Hollywood hasn't drifted that far too the left. However, I can offer no other explanation. Gilroy isn't usually this inept.<br/><br/>That said, even Damon criticized the installment previous to 'Legacy'. Along with Sanchez' re-sentencing, Damon this last week delivered his own sentence upon Gilroy for his writing skills. Damon advised GQ magazine that the script that Gilroy had delivered for 'The Bourne Ultimatum' was ""unreadable."" Damon reported that ""This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It's terrible. It's really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left."" So perhaps Gilroy really is that inept."

","I will admit, the action is great, but this movie moves too slowly at times and is just... boring. Matt Damon has some great acting in this, but he's the only one who's acting satisfies me. Also, if you are a fan of Ludlum's Bourne books, you might come out disappointed because this has little to no connection to the original books. This is also a good thing, because the filmmakers are able to adapt the book into a modern day setting almost flawlessly. And as I said before, the action is great, but there is not enough of it in this movie. And the shaky camera does start to get a bit annoying. However, despite all of my negative comments, I would strongly recommend watching this because both of the sequels to this movie and absolutely amazing, and you might get a little lost without this movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I didn't like this movie, but I stuck through with it because of it's good sequels."

","I love this movie. It delivers everything that a spy chase thriller is supposed to deliver, and does it with exceptional skill and economy of action. Also, Matt Damon is fantastic in the title role of Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>First, a couple of caveats about who might not want to watch this film: it contains some violent fight scenes that are fairly graphic, and there are some shootings that are violent, although not in the graphic ""pink mist"" gory way. So you really don't want to sit down with the little kids and watch this one and adults who aren't keen on violence in movies may want to give it a miss. And there's some swearing, both in English and in other languages.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Jason Bourne floating unconscious in the ocean, where the crew of a fishing boat sees him and picks him up. While one of the people on the boat administers first aid, Bourne violently regains consciousness, and it becomes apparent that he has no idea who he is, where he is, how he got there. He has been shot twice, with superficial wounds; more strangely still, he had embedded in his hip a device that upon activation reveals a number that is apparently a bank account or code of some kind for a bank in Zurich.<br/><br/>The fishermen let Bourne off when they reach their port in Marseilles, and with the money they give him for the work he did while on their boat, he makes his way to Zurich and the bank.<br/><br/>Once there, he finds that he apparently has access to a safe-deposit box that is filled with currency, a variety of passports in different names but with his picture, and a gun. And now the chase is on.<br/><br/>Bourne's accessing the safe deposit box triggers the start of a CIA hunt for him. It's apparent that he's some kind of ""black ops"" assassin for the CIA, but he himself doesn't yet know that or really understand who he is and what he's been doing.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie consists of Bourne, who joins up with a somewhat flaky young woman who we know only as Marie (played superbly by Franka Potente) who he meets in the American embassy where she is trying unsuccessfully to get a visa.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Identity"" is a very straightforward chase movie, with Bourne running away from people bent on killing him while trying to find out who he really is.<br/><br/>What raises it well above the average for this genre are two things: first, the way Matt Damon becomes Jason Bourne and makes him a thoroughly believable character who is likable in spite of having apparently been a bona fide assassin. Second, the quality of the writing, the stunts/action, and the general high level of the acting throughout.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much of this movie away, but I do have to mention the car chase scene in this movie. The car chase has become such a staple of the action chase movie genre that it's very, very hard for anyone making this kind of movie to do something that doesn't seem mundane. The car chase scene in ""The Bourne Identity"" is exceptional in the way it is choreographed, the way it is photographed, and the unique twists it has. One of the better car chases of recent years, although when the movie is over and you start thinking about it, you have to wonder if Marie's decrepit little car really would have held together through what Bourne put it through in the chase! This is a superb action spy movie with Matt Damon truly exceptional as Bourne. You're on the edge of your seat rooting for him to evade the people who want to kill him and to find out who he is. A very enjoyable action/spy movie, one of the best of recent years."

","The Bourne Identity (2002) is a fast-paced, action packed, mystery film. Based on a man trying to find his true identity after an Italian fishing boat crew found his body floating at sea after being shot, and barely clinging to life. Once the man awakens and recovers from the near death experience, he seems to have forgotten everything about himself, including his name. One clue, the number to a Swiss bank account. While visiting the bank, he finds numerous passports all belonging to him under different identities, the identity he assumes is that of Jason Bourne. After finding his identity Jason Bourne (Damon) and leaving the bank Bourne asks a women for a ride. Refusing his request she is forced to reconsider once Bourne offers a large payment in cash. Finally convincing Marie (Potente) to drive him, the two travel together in search of all the clues to his past, but not without multiple problems and attempts from assassins to end their lives.<br/><br/>Lighting throughout the film has a dark effect to it, even throughout the daytime scenes. Based in the winter, the snow slightly brightens the scenes throughout the daytime shots, but the lighting is never bright until the ending scene when Marie and Bourne reunite in Greece. The darkness of the movies follows the darkness of Jason Bourne, from not knowing his identity to learning of his occupation, Darkness follows Bourne. The cinematic point of view throughout most of the film that the director chose to use is indirect-subjective. We are close to the action enough to get an emotional effect from the scenes. In the scene where Bourne and Marie reunite the director uses a subjective point of view, switching between the eyes of Jason Bourne and Marie as the looks at one another.<br/><br/>While The Bourne Identity is based mostly on action, drama, and mystery, the writers added in some romance between Jason Bourne and Marie. Reluctant in the beginning to give Bourne a ride to his destination, she travels with him and the two share a moment in a love scene. Again the film turns to a bit of romance when Bourne arrives at Marie's scooter shop in Greece."

","The 2002 film, The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman is a highly action packed movie about crime and mystery. The film stars Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is rescued by a fishing boat from the sea with bullet wounds in his back, a chip implanted in his hip and no memory of who he is. As he is recovering from his injuries on the ship he attempts to recover his memory of who he is. As desperate as Bourne is to find the answers to who he is, he will discover that he may wish he did not know. This chip implanted in his hip only has information of a bank account number, once Bourne find this lock box that this number belongs to he discovers many passports with different identities, thousands of dollars, and a gun. It is also at the bank that Bourne realizes that he is being haunted and his life is in danger. Bourne is surprised to have advanced combat skills. Bourne realizes that he needs to run and here is when he turns to Marie (Franka Potente) for help. He offers her money to drive him to Paris where he believes that he lives. Marie assist him in trying to find out how he is and who is trying to kill him and why. It is while they are in Paris that he finds out that he is a spy and assign. Once Bourne learns this about himself he wishes that he did not know who he was and wants to forget all of it. However, his life is still in danger and he has to fight to stay alive. This film is similar to a 1996 film, The Long Kiss Goodnight where a female is suffering from amnesia and as she uncovers the secrets to her past she realizes that she was once a lethal, top-secret agent. There are many filming techniques used in this film. Quick cutting editing is used throughout the film as the scenes change but it does not have a choppy effect of the film, because of all of the action in the film the changing of scenes are hardly noticeable. The scenes change from fighting scenes to scenes of the CIA on the hunt for Bourne flawlessly. The sound used in the film also keeps the audience awake and alert. The sounds of gunfire and explosions keep the film entertaining and make the audience feel as though the scenes are real because of the realistic effects of the sounds. Although Bourne was not happy with who he discovered he once was he is able to overcome his past and escape from the horror that was once his life."

","This is one of those action movies that will inspire other action movies in the future or at least the style of it all. I remember watching the trailer to this movie when it first came out which led me to watch this in theater the day it came out. And although when I first saw it in theater back in 2002 and didn't completely understand what was going on at that time during the first viewing of it. What I did know was that I actually enjoyed this action movie and was very entertained by it. This is a spy-thriller that is done right and is a fast paced and stylish action that hardly has a dull moment and is crafted very well for the most part. What I liked after viewing it again now is how it's somewhat simple and yet intelligent at the same time when it comes to the direction of the plot. Now I know this movie is based on the novel by Robert Ludlum and although I haven't read any of the Bourn novels I am pretty sure the author would have been proud and also relieved. Besides the fast paced, simple and yet intelligent direction, what really stood out to me was the fast stylized and yet realistic action sequences. Yeah the whole thing with the amnesia seems a bit generic and far fetched in this but that is a very small flaw. Even the chase scenes are done really well, so overall this is a solid movie that is worth watching and the other two sequels to come. And maybe even the sequels after that as well. In another words the future of spy-thriller/action movies is Bourne.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","An Italian fishing boat crew recovers a young man (Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon) drifting in the Mediterranean Sea. The young man is found to be unconscious with bullet wounds in his back. A crew member sets to extract the bullets in his back, finds a tiny laser device in his hip which reveals a Swiss Bank account number. The young man suffers from amnesia and decides to search for his true identity. Using the Swiss Bank account number as a reference point, he travels to Zurich where he finds an amount of money in different denominations, several passports containing his picture with several aliases and a gun in the safe deposit box. He assumes the name on the first passport; Jason Bourne. Bourne discovers he is skilled in hand-to-hand combat when confronted by the Zurich police for loitering at night and can locate the fastest escape routes. Bourne knows there is something more to him since these skills are not for the average man to possess. Bourne teams up with Marie Kreutz (played by Franka Potente) after persuading her with money to drive him to Paris where the address of Jason Bourne is. Bourne fights police officers, assassins, secret service agents who are trying to kill him. The theme playing in this film is self discovery. Bourne knows people are out there who want him dead but he must fight to defeat them and discover who he is. The head of a CIA group ""Operation Treadstone"", Alexander Conklin (played by Chris Cooper) has his feathers ruffled and sends assassins to eliminate Bourne. Conklin reveals to Ward Abbort (played by Brian Cox) his superior, that Bourne was the operative on a failed assassination attempt on an African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Marie and Bourne fight their way through all the obstacles facing them and eventually fall in love along the way. Bourne invades Treadstone Headquarters and there his memory is restored. His real name is David Webb .He could not kill Wombosi in front of his children that's why he ended up in the Mediterranean Sea with bullet wounds. The Cider House Rules 1999 is a movie that bears the same theme of self discovery. In this movie, Homer (played by Toby Maguire) discovers his true purpose in life after spending ages running away from it. He finds peace and fulfillment in life after his self discovery. The film uses surround sound from the opening scene which in incredible. The surrounds contain ambiance, intense sound effect and a feel of being there. The gunfire shots have high pitched sounds with precise bullet movements. The sound builds a level of suspense and uncertainty when watching the film. The picture quality is sharp with stunning locations used. The film looks subdued telling us of the mindset of Bourne and the way he is battling to find solutions to his amnesia. The pictures are natural in facial features with great focus on even the backgrounds. Jason Bourne fights to find out his true identity. Being able to discover one's self has underlined tones. We are born into this world without any memory of preexistence. Just like Borne, we may discover we possess skills and abilities unknown to us. In our search for self discovery, we find out who we are and our true purpose in life. Bourne finds out he is a trained assassin but decides to let go of that life and starts life afresh as a new man with Marie."

","One trilogy I had been dying to see is the Bourne trilogy, so many people just love these movies and I've heard nothing but positive reviews about them. Most people I talk too told me that it's a new James Bond movie. So I borrowed the movies from my boyfriend and watched them this week. Starting off with The Bourne Identity and what a way to start. While I didn't find the film as exciting as I would expect it, it is a very well done action movie. The choreography was awesome and Matt Damon makes for a very strong male lead. His character is the only thing that kept me going through the movie, we start off not knowing who he really is and want to find out with him what happened to him, who he is and why he's wanted dead or alive, though preferably dead. As he goes through heck to find out what is going on and only having one person on his side, a woman who is probably only with him just because he's hot, he finds out that he's almost like the Superman assassin. James Bond would probably say ""Well, at least I still have my sexy weapons and lines of hot women waiting to jump my bones"".<br/><br/>A fishing boat crew finds an unconscious man adrift in the Mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back. When he wakes up, the man comes to realize he suffers from amnesia, having only one clue to his identity: the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector. Traveling to Switzerland to find the corresponding bank, the man discovers he is skilled in advanced hand-to-hand combat when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen. He arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash and several passports with his photo, but with numerous aliases. He assumes the name Jason Bourne. A few blocks away, he induces Marie with $20,000 to take him to Paris to the address on his ""Bourne"" passport. Meanwhile, back at CIA headquarters the head of Treadstone, reveals to his supervisor, that Bourne was the covert operative responsible for a failed assassination attempt. Intending to sever all connections between the CIA and Wombosi, Conklin sends three highly-trained assassins to kill Bourne. <br/><br/>The only thing these movies fall victim too is the shaky cam effect, I understand it's meant to make the audience feel tense but it's not needed for 90% of the movie. Also I wished they had picked a different actress to play Marie. Nothing wrong with Franka Potente, she's a fine actress but she just didn't really capture me as Marie and made her character into such a cliché. Plus their love story isn't really that necessary and very random. However like I said this is a very interesting story and I'm glad that I decided to check these movies out. I really loved the car chase scene, it's rare we get a good one any more and it was handled so gracefully that made it so exciting. I'm so curious if Matt Damon did his own stunts which is probably unlikely however those fight scenes were just awesome and again done with such style that it made the film worth watching. The supporting cast holds up very well with Chris Cooper and Julia Styles, I'm sad that Chris Cooper didn't make it for the other movies because his character is so dark and a great villain, but the show must go on and other great villains will be introduced as we find out more about Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>7/10"

By freak chance it turns out that this is not a corpse, but a severely wounded man, who can not seem to remember anything from his past. Armed with only a Swiss bank account the delinquent goes out to reclaim his identity - that of the highly skilled assassin Jason Bourne! It was this welcome return of Ludlum's Jason Bourne that had most to do with a resurgence of spy movies, but it also served as a guidebook for future (and much superior movies) in the genre such as ""The International"" or ""Casino Royale"". With the unlikely hero carrying the face of Matt Damon it was a break out hit, which I decided to recollect in full during the festive season.<br/><br/>As such ""The Bourne Identity"" is a relatively crisp and refreshing action movie, which hardly ever gets a tune wrong.

Despite most fights or chase sequences being extremely flashy, spectacular and even innovative (at least eight years ago) most of them seem to be as solidly stuck in real physics and physiology as possible - with a couple of relatively irrelevant exceptions. Also the scripting was extremely tight for a spy movie and hardly misses a beat with suggesting possible scenarios for our hero.<br/><br/>One or two action sequences stand out in the movie, even if not necessarily the ones with are the most spectacular. Nothing as memorable as the shoot-out in ""The International"", but the relatively straight-forward showdown between Jason Bourne and Clive Owen's character The Professor is especially noteworthy.<br/><br/>On the minus side the stereotypical African overlord is a real downer and the movie really gets a slight overdose of stereotyping, which take away from the general pleasure of watching the movie.<br/><br/>Nonetheless by far the best of the Bourne Trilogy and despite the jumps in standards it has aged very well."

","Left for dead, an American intelligence agent (Matt Damon) wakes with no memory, and attempts to piece together who he really is.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is a solid, proficient action-thriller that rarely seems to strain for effect: the second hour - which has the hero chasing a paper trail across Europe, while the CIA tries to tie up its loose ends - isn't nearly as much fun as the first, but there's an unexpectedly classy cast for this kind of thing. Particular acclaim was directed toward the film's central car chase which was described as an exciting action highlight and one of the best realized in the genre. The film is the first in a trilogy, being followed by The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)."

","'The Bourne Identity' happens to be my favourite spy novel. Robert Ludlum takes us on an exhilarating ride through a plot full of unexpected twists. I chose not to watch this movie when it was released, primarily because I hadn't read all the Bourne novels. I finally saw this movie, six years after it was released, and I was surprised and shocked, and not pleasantly may I add.<br/><br/>Though its understandable that the entire novel can't be brought to life on-screen, comparisons to the novel are inevitable. The movie adaptation took away an entire character, one whose importance in the plot was next only to Bourne. And this deprived the movie of some of the best sequences, most importantly the titanic climax of the novel.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be very ordinary. Though the action scenes have been very well done, the suspense just wasn't there. Clive Owen has been wasted in a forgettable role. Can't say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne was what I had imagined, but he does an earnest job nevertheless.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't see the fans of the novel liking this movie."

He can remember several languages fluently, all the martial arts of Steven Segal, all the espionage tricks of James Bond, all the deductive skills of Batman, all the driving skills of Mario Andretti - but not his name. He doesn't know how he possesses these incredible combat skills and all this pent-up knowledge, but he uses it to his advantage in tracking down his true identity.<br/><br/>He's meant to be smart as hell, yet with all the fake passports, the inbuilt survival skills, the numerous bank accounts, explosives and computer knowledge, we figure out much sooner than he does that he's a CIA operative.<br/><br/>Apparently, he botched his last kill assignment with a Ugandan named Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who seems like he's doing a bad Eddie Murphy impression, until we realize that it's Eddie Murphy who does such a good Ugandan impression) and he's been on the run ever since.<br/><br/>Now the CIA, under slimy Chris Cooper, wants to kill him - because that's just how the CIA shows its love to former agents. And Bourne must use his mad skills to show his love back.<br/><br/>Brian Cox is the CIA boss and Clive Owen - long overcoat and all - is a hit-man out to get Bourne. Button-nosed Julia Stiles is a CIA gopher.<br/><br/>Bourne's love interest, scored in the silliest Hollywood Meet Cute manner, is Euro chick, Franka Potente (RUN LOLA RUN - ironic, no?).<br/><br/>We realize too late that THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a showcase for director Doug Liman to squeeze as many stunts and chases out of a Robert Ludlum novel as possible - apparently, the movie deviates grossly from the book - but it's done artfully and it all takes place in Europe, so it's exotic and sexy.<br/><br/>The obligatory car chase thankfully contains a minimum of arbitrary smashes, and when vehicles do crash, they just slam into each other and dent, glass shattering; obviously these cars are not as volatile as American cars that explode on the slightest impact or do flips off the backs of other cars when someone looks at them sideways.<br/><br/>In ROUNDERS, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, MR. RIPLEY, Damon was good, but always overshadowed or made to share the spotlight. Here in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, he has found his muscle stride, ripped himself up for the role, an assassin's assassin. With this movie, Damon becomes his own man, no more Mrs. Affleck.<br/><br/>THE BOURNE IDENTITY DVD features a tacked-on alternate beginning and ending to ""make it more current"" in a post-9/11 world - yet these tags in no way help the film, serving only to add a very lame very beige explanation monologue by Brian Cox and a cringeworthy Hollywood Romantic Ending where lovers run into each others' arms as the outro song starts - Moby's breezy, boppy, catchy little swirl.<br/><br/>The biggest stupidity with this alternate material: The filmmakers succinctly state ""We felt there shouldn't be any extra explosions than necessary - that no one will ever watch another movie with another explosion after 9/11,"" so they excised many big orange explosions. So how do the idiot marketers describe the Alternate Version on the DVD packaging? - ""THE EXPLOSIVE ALTERNATE VERSION."" <br/><br/>The original ending featured a cool ironic resolution: After months apart, Bourne tracked his girl to a scooter hire store where she worked, walked in and asked, ""Can I hire a scooter?"" She tries to tamp down her huge joy at seeing him and asks nonchalantly, ""Have you got any I.D.""

"dwpollar","7","0","1","19 December 2008"," Excellent action movie...
","1st watched 12/18/2008 (Dir-Doug Liman): Excellent action movie about a man named Jason Bourne(or at least that's one of his names) who is found at the beginning of the movie floating in the ocean, who is alive but has been shot. He doesn't remember who he is, why he got shot or anything else about his past. He finds a chip embedded inside him with a Swiss bank account number on it and he ventures to try and find out who he is. He also has the unique ability to defend himself and is almost computer-like with his self defense mechanisms and he doesn't know why this is either. We find out later that he is being tracked by the CIA and they are trying to get rid of him. This is the basic storyline of the movie, but despite the simplicity of the plot Matt Damon is excellent in the role and is very believable in this character. His cohort and female love interest played by Franka Polente(a German actress), is also very appealing as the drifter who attaches to the wandering anti-hero, carrying some of her own baggage as well. There is a bevy of other capable actors and actresses who co-star and also help the movie. I won't give away any more of the plot for those who want to watch the movie, but that's really about it! Have fun watching it like I did and enjoy this simple but well played story! Watching this definitely makes me look forward to the next installment."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","29 November 2008"," The rise of the modern action hero
","The new millennium has found its new action hero and it's not XXX or Pierce Brosnan's James Bond -- It's Jason Bourne. Based on the popular Robert Ludlum novel, ""The Bourne Identity"" finally makes the solo action protagonist work in the era of amped up stunts and special effects. Bourne is slick, skilled, way smart and attractive and best of all: he doesn't even know who he is. While more fast-paced and driven by mystery than most action heroes (certainly not as leisurely as James Bond), ""Bourne"" finally delivers the no-nonsense hero we all rightfully deserve.<br/><br/>We are introduced immediately to Jason Bourne (Damon) as he is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea with two bullets in his back. When he wakes, he has suffered a complete memory loss. Interestingly enough, however, he finds he has a pretty incredible skill set that includes some sort of mixed martial arts and heightened environmental awareness. Slowly he pieces his life together, only to find he's wanted dead for some reason by the CIA, who presumably he used to work for. While on the run, he picks up Marie (German actress Franke Potente, ""Blow"") who decides to join the goose chase rather than ditch him and take his cash.<br/><br/>The film carries a pretty all-star cast including Chris Cooper and Brian Cox as CIA higher ups and Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in smaller roles. They help sort of spread out your interest in the mystery elements of the film, mainly the very large and looming enigma that is Jason Bourne. As it is part of a greater series ""Identity"" doesn't exactly answer all your questions, but it clearly establishes who Bourne is and why the audience should care about him.<br/><br/>The concept of Bourne not knowing who he is at the film is a very obvious entry point for the audience--we are meant to learn about Bourne as he uncovers the truth himself and identify with him and his actions/choices as a result. He may be much more of a super spy in terms of the sweet moves he pulls on his enemies and not how many gadgets he uses (none), his drive to understand why he is that way keeps it real for us.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is a great fit for Bourne. He pulls of the sort of robotic, lay down the law quality that is Bourne's action hero side, but he does get across the internal struggle to understand himself that makes him human. Potente as the leading lady is an odd choice; the casting directors were certainly not going for a knockout in the looks department (or acting for that matter) but her very generic looks sort of help ground the film in reality in a way. Not every action hero is meant to hook up with a supermodel equivalent.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the action is really well paced and exciting, impressive for director Doug Liman's first action film. The fights are incredibly well-choreographed and the editing is nothing short of fantastic. While the script tries to awkwardly heighten the drama at times, you're really too caught up in the story and the action sequences to care too much about what Bourne and Marie are saying to each other. This is a spy thriller first, ask deeper questions later movie and best of all, you never shake your head at it. Welcome to the new age of action heroes."

","The Bourne franchise is one that has, for no particular reason, passed me by until now and it was only because I noticed the DVD on sale for a stupidly cheap price and been assured by friends that all three films were worth watching that I've now seen the first film. Assuming the law of diminishing returns applies to this franchise, I don't think I'll be seeking out the other two Bourne flicks in a hurry. That's not to say this film is bad  it's not; it's a well-made action film, slick and glossy, with some nice European locations  but there is just nothing particularly special about it, and the last ten minutes completely ruin what has gone before.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays the central character, a government assassin who is pulled out of the sea by a fishing boat with no recollection of who he is and a collection of bullets nestling just under his skin. The rest of the film concerns Damon's efforts to discover just who  and what  he is, aided by a German gypsy in the shapely form of Franka Potente, while he simultaneously tries to evade the CIA contract killers out to eliminate what they now consider to be a rogue agent. Potente, with her de-glamourised look, is as well cast as Damon is not. He's too preppy looking to convince as a cold-blooded killer  even one working for the land of the free. He looks like he'd run a mile if the saloon drunk decided he didn't like the look of his stubble-free face. Perhaps director Liman understood this because the fight sequences are edited at such a lightning pace that we're not really given much time to see what is going on. Sometimes the camera seems so close you half expect a flailing fist to catch the cinematographer a glancing blow.<br/><br/>Anyway, Bourne's quest follows a fairly eventful and predictable path, one that is strewn with a number of fist fights, a well-filmed car chase, a little rumpy with his new travelling companion and one welcome moment of dry humour when Potente over-rides Damon's convoluted plan to obtain vital information from a hotel through covert means by simply asking the hotel concierge to tell her what they need to know. Although Bourne remembers nothing of his past, he has retained the killer instinct as well as the smarts to gradually pull most of the strands together, which results in the inevitable showdown with his former boss  a role effortlessly nailed by the woefully under-used Chris Cooper, an actor who is the epitome of class.<br/><br/>Those last ten minutes, though first, we're expected to believe this highly-trained cold-hearted killer is unable to eliminate his target because of the cute button-nosed kid sleeping in the mark's lap. As if his employers wouldn't have tested him in this kind of situation. It really is a terrible moment that left me gawping. If he suddenly had an attack of conscience could we please have some kind of clue as to why? Maybe the CIA boobed  perhaps Bourne ticked the box marked 'I do not wish to assassinate cute innocent children on covert assignments of national importance.' Anyway, Bourne hesitates, raises his gun and  BAM  their go two stars from the movie's rating. I almost dropped another star for that stupid falling through the air on the back of a dead fat man stunt, but the film had already been spoiled for me by then so it didn't really matter"
"sme_no_densetsu","7","0","1","10 September 2008"," The first in the series is a solid thriller
","Typically I'm not much of a fan of the thriller genre but having just seen the Bourne trilogy I'm fairly impressed with what I've seen. This first installment, directed by Doug Liman, introduces the character of amnesiac Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and sets him on his perilous quest to discover his true identity.<br/><br/>The cast is a good one with Matt Damon doing well in a much more action-oriented role than any he had previously undertaken. On Bourne's tail are Chris Cooper & Brian Cox, both dependable actors. Franka Potente, as Bourne's romantic interest, isn't bad but I could have done without the romantic element altogether.<br/><br/>The story is a pretty compelling one once you get past the hackneyed case of amnesia. Particularly interesting is how the story here turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg, as seen in the two sequels. I will admit that I wasn't exactly thrilled with the ending here, though.<br/><br/>The direction by Liman is workmanlike and is more concerned with constantly propelling the action rather than creating visuals that are interesting in and of themselves. The music fits well into the scheme of things, contributing to the mood but rarely calling attention to itself.<br/><br/>This is a good thriller, sure to meet the approval of those who enjoy such films. I think that the two sequels were marginally better but this film is definitely an above average beginning to the series."
"Unholyxxxx","6","0","1","4 September 2008"," Could have been a masterpiece, but is nothing more than average, believe me.
","I saw this movie when it came out and found it an average but enjoyable action movie, nothing special, I didn't understand where some people's enthusiasm came from. But later I was recommended to read Robert Ludlum's book, so I did, years after seeing the movie with Matt Damon. And man, I liked it; the story was complex and exciting, with all these twists and turns. I couldn't stop reading and the whole time I thought; 'didn't I pay attention when watching the movie?? How could I have thought this wasn't anything special?' When I finished the book, I purchased the DVD and watched it immediately when I came home...<br/><br/>OK... First of all, no bad comment on Matt Damon, he is the Jason Bourne I had in mind the whole time when reading the book and he does a great job. The action scenes are nice too, nothing wrong there. But what happened to the story? Where is all the stuff that I liked so much about the book? They just shrunk the story to; man wakes up without his memory, finds out he's a professional killer and his former employer wants him dead. Is that all? What the hell happened to Charly, Delta, Cain? Where's Carlos? What about Jason's past, and the real reason he took the Bourne Identity? Did the writers think the people who would go see it, might probably be too stupid to understand the story in it's full complexity, the way it was meant to be? Really, everything that made the original story so incredibly interesting, was left away. Even if it would take 3 hours or more to tell the story of Jason Bourne, I would stay in my chair and watch it to the finish.<br/><br/>Before I read the book, I found The Bourne Identity an average action movie. After I read the book, I now find the movie an insult on late Robert Ludlum's work. Thank god there's more where that came from; so far, The Bourne Supremacy is just as exciting as Identity."
"cosmorados","4","0","2","16 July 2008"," The Bourne Identity. A film in two parts
","A man is dragged on board a fishing boat unconscious, shot and in pretty bad shape, however, through luck or God, he winds up in a French hospital with no recollection of who he is, however, what he does know is that his name appears to be Jason Bourne, however, the more he starts digging the more names he finds, the more under threat he is, the more he is able to lash out at a moments notice, blocking his opponents with the perfect amount of force. This is a man who is literally a walking weapon. Eventually he stumbles upon the beautiful Marie, who decides to help him feeling that maybe their is something more to Bourne than meets the eye.<br/><br/>The film is very VERY loosely based on the immense thriller by Robert Ludlum, and when I have been going through the reviews one thing stands out, and that is a large amount of people who rate the book do not rate the film and there are good reasons for this, for it isn't just about things that don't transfer well. There is great stuff in the Bourne Identity, key issues that relate directly to the title that are just ignored that make the rest of the film utterly pointless, the identity that he thinks he has is not necessarily what it actually is. In the book this is dealt with in a fantastic way that, if done correctly on film would have had the audience on the edge of their seat. Not touched on here.<br/><br/>However, the other big problem with the film and one that I can't quite believe that no-0ne else has a problem with is that the climactic end when we supposedly find out what has happened and who Bourne is transpires that the despot that Bourne was sent to kill, he didn't because their was a kid there. So, this person we were routing for pussied out, and we're supposed yo like him? I didn't. This could be a Robert Mugabe type or a Pol Pot type of despot who would no doubt be grooming his children for future atrocities, how many other children were going to be killed because he had not carried out the assignment? This was not some shadow identity that was fiction this was supposedly the person that we were routing for? Or, to put it differently, if the only chance you had to go back in time and kill Hitler was whilst he was playing with some children at his lair in the mountains, would you do it? I think most of us know what the answer would be.<br/><br/>The film itself is at its best when it is using or reflecting aspects of the book, which it does a lot of in the first half, and at its worse when it ignores them, as in the second half of the film. The car chase which other's have wrote is great is not the special and does not match the sequences in the superb ""Taxi"" series of films, or even the more recent ""Vantage Point"". The main issue that people have with this film and I suspect the main reason why it scores so highly is that it seems edgy compared to a Bond who is usually super cool, BUT, simply the virtue of being different does not necessarily a good film make.<br/><br/>For those who read and not just on a computer, get the book. It makes the film seem about as edgy as a rotting cucumber. Nuff said."

","My Take: Slick and stylish adaptation of the classic Ludlum bestseller.<br/><br/>Robert Ludlum's THE BOURNE IDENTITY, adapted here in this 2002 big screen romp, is an old-fashioned thriller, but a heck of a good one. It's an old-fashioned espionage chase thriller, owing a lot to Matt Damon's excellent performance in the title role, and the superior direction and pacing. Like all good mystery thrillers, this one keeps us gripped, guessing and interested from the first frame to the last. I was hooked.<br/><br/>The film centers on Jason Bourne, a man who finds himself in the middle of the ocean, with two bullets lodged into his back. he doesn't know who he is, and what happened to him. After being rescued by a fishing boat, he is dropped to France where he tries to find out who he is. He finds out he's a government assassin, a professional at the job, who the government no longer trusts. Now, he's a target of the government he used to work for. To escape, he aids help of Marie (Franka Potente), who also becomes a target of the same agency.<br/><br/>There are a number of great chase scenes that follow. There's the Paris chase scene where a Mini Copper is chased by the police. The film is mostly in low-key, but it keeps the energy level really high. There's action here and there, but some really good thrills as well, and a tight plot that keeps us interested and hooked. The performances are great, as is the script. Overall, a terrific thriller.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

One of the most redeeming choices in the script is not to indulge too much in the ""love"" element. There is just the minimum to fill the Hollywood but not an ounce more, which is perfect for this kind of film.

","Of course, movies about spies being hunted down are not all that uncommon, but ""The Bourne Identity"" and its two sequels, are some of the best ones that have appeared on the screen in years. ""Identity"" is the first, and in my opinion, the second-best out of them all. It has the most originality to it, makes the character of Jason Bourne seem the most clever and even the more vulnerable than he does in the two following films, and is overall, a nifty action movie.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was the perfect choice for playing Jason Bourne, a former assassin from a series of novels that failed in a mission, was injured, presumed dead, and later turned out alive only with amnesia. He soon finds out here's a target for assassination and must try and find the people he originally worked for, find out who he is, and why they are trying to kill him now. Damon is a very versatile actor and is very efficient at the role.<br/><br/>Franka Potente's character, while not a major development or powerful character, was a necessary character to keep the story rolling. The fact is, the movie would have been more boring and less compelling if Boune was completely by himself at first. Potente's character is developed enough just to make the point of her being there, not so that the audience will become attached to her. And I think that was the general idea when they were piecing together the screenplay.<br/><br/>Action sequences in ""The Bourne Identity"" were very clever and ingenious. Like the following two films, Bourne is realized as being like Rambo. He is able to use a variety of tools for his own defense. He can use a gun as well as his own fists, and if he needs a weapon, as he demonstrates in one scene, he can grab a pen and use it as effectively as if it were a knife. Of course, some of his kills were a bit unbelievable and humanly impossible, but then again, it's an action movie. Lots of them are like that and the audience is just to sit back and enjoy it. And the cool thing is that Bourne is, like Rambo, not just a random crazy killer, as we can assume he was before he got amnesia. He tries to spare his attackers whenever he can and only kills when it becomes clear to him, and the audience, that there is obviously no choice left to him.<br/><br/>But what I like most of all about ""The Bourne Identity"", as well as ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is that it ends with several points unclear, making it obvious to the audience that there will be more to come. In each film, many questions are asked, some are answered, most are left unsolved. And in each entry, more are asked, more are answered, and even more are left. It's a representation of how Jason Bourne is thinking as he's put into these situations. And the audience effectively follows him."
"mlcpirates-1","6","0","3","4 November 2007"," over-rated unrealistic
","In the days before Tom Clancy Robert Ludlum wrote the most popular, if fantastical, even slightly ridiculous, spy novels. But of course, times change and there is no way that a movie can come close to covering the complexities of a good spy novel. The Bourne Identity had to be updated because there is no more Carlos the Jackal, (in fact, there never really was, he was somewhat bad at his job- the press actually created a mountain out of a dung heap). Having read The Bourne Idnetity back in the day I had trouble equating Mat Dillon with the title character but realizing they would make the movie according to today's realities I tried to go in with an open mind. However, the movie was just too ridiculous. <br/><br/>(warning a summary and two spoilers)<br/><br/>The movie's premise stays true to the book in that an assassin named Jason Bourne is rescued by a fishing boat in the Mediterranaean. Half-dead, Bourne has two bullets in him and is soon in shape (a few days with scant medical supplies in the movie versus the book in which a drunk ex-British doctor sews him up and gives some good advice while rehabilitating him.) Next we see Bourne, though he doesn't know he's Bourne because he has amnesia, going to the Swiss city of Zurich because he has a small laser pointer containing the bank's address and an account number surgically implanted in his hip.<br/><br/>From there it is a whirl wind adventure through Europe as Bourne struggles to recall anything from his memory regarding his identity. All this man seems to be cut out for is killing. Along the way he picks up a wandering German chick who happens to agree to drive a mad man to Paris.Then he kills a lot of guys.<br/><br/>People have tagged this movie ""relaisitc"". that is both absurd and frightening. Bourne here is so bullet proof he seems like a kung fu movie hero from Saturday afternoons or a James Bond from the seventies. ALthough Damon does not seem to have the mileage to pull off the character- it is Bourne's inability to do any wrong that is too much to swallow. For example, in an old,lone french house in a tiny valley, surrounded by forested hills, the children's dog does not answer a morning call so Bourne, realizing he is being hunted (not so unrealistic) finds a shotgun, does not look outside and study the surroundings, then walks out and shots a heating oil tank and uses the ensuing smoke screen to run into cover towards the waiting assassin. Excpet for the fact, of course, how could he know where the killer was? Another even more implausible scenario was when he was at the top of stairwell being fired at by man coming up the stairwell, Bourne used a corpse as cover as they plummet five or six stories between the stringers of steps. Not only does Bourne shoot the assassin on the way down (at what, 64 feet per second) but he lands on his stomach on the corpse, as if that would break his fall (safety tip: when you try this at home you need to fall on your back, otherwise the force of the blow travels to your spine and blows it to pieces).<br/><br/>The gaps in reality are big enough to accommodate Al Gore's carbon footprint, if you want to see Chris Cooper and Matt Damon in a realistic movie, watch Syrianna. Or see Munich, that movie will show you how crazy the espionage game is. The Bourne Identity may be fun, but it's mental junk-food."

The action alone makes this worth watching.<br/><br/>The story on the other hand is somewhat intriguing as we untangle some of the mystery revolving around Bourne's identity, but the basic premise (which isn't hidden at all in the movie) has a ring of familiarity to it. Bourne is some sort of super-CIA operative who's lost his memory and has no idea of who he was or what he did for a living, but he sure does have some amazing abilities that he hasn't forgotten. As we're told during the movie, he's a $30 million weapon that's malfunctioning. That didn't strike me as particularly original, although it was unclear (to me at least) whether his abilities came from genetic engineering, some type of implant or just incredible training.<br/><br/>Damon's performance was quite good, and I thought Franka Potente came across well as Marie, the woman who helps Bourne and begins to fall for him at the same time, even while becoming increasingly uncomfortable as more is revealed about his past. It's enjoyable and exciting, even if it has a bit of a well-worn premise, and it caught my interest enough to make me want to see the sequels. 7/10"

Being a fan of the earlier thrillers without an overload of gadgets and CGI and especially the gritty 60s/70s Italian movies, I've tended to avoid the blockbuster fare. But, this is good, there are plot holes and a little silliness but who cares when the action whips you along. Maybe this or that is not quite right but do we have time to sit and ponder? Do we heck! No irrelevant love scenes, no long sequences to try and explain how this really is realistic. We don't care. If we get a car chase through the streets of Paris with enough decent dialogue for us to become involved, we'll never complain. I think that possibly shooting so much in Paris also has altered the way the film feels and maybe forced the director's hand a little, thereby making this look and feel a little more European.

I only suspect that her importance increases later, as I see that Stiles is in the later movies as well.

","It is first of all an action film in which the whole action goes wrong because the agent did not do what he was supposed to do, he did not kill his target and he got shot at and he lost his memory. The story is unluckily not entirely clear. He forgot his identity. Fine. He did not forget his physical training. Fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts. But how did he remember he had a bank account in Zurich and the number of the bank account, and what's more why did not the CIA close the account since the operation had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead? This leads to more questions, but that is not really important for the action, though we like it absolutely clean. The message however is not altered at all. The CIA is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through. These killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars. The objective is simple: control the world with puppets who can be anything, democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats, no matter which or their reverses, provided they serve well, otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture. When this film came out the US were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism. The picture of this CIA is pretty terroristic to me. We know now, several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information, though it did gather some, but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say. Is that very democratic? At the end of the film, when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the Senate, we are just relieved because the killing robot agent, Jason Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into. But the story cannot be finished because the CIA cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart, for one simple reason: they do not have a heart. In other words, the cold war is maybe finished, but the terroristic spying agencies, politically correctly named intelligence agencies, are still thriving and well. We have not yet reached the country of perfect transparency and total democracy. And we pretend to give lessons to the barbarians who are not part of our club!

","On the male scale, this movie rates very high. There is plenty of action, violence, killing, and a girl (although there was no token nudity). This was just the kind of movie I could sink my teeth into, but I found the taste of it off just a bit. As amazing as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) was, I simply wasn't behind his character 100%. It is one thing for a random individual to pull off one miraculous escape plan after another, and artistically kill one bad guy after another; but it is entirely different when a character that you love or genuinely sympathize with is performing the same feats. I think that Bourne was just a little to mechanical and lacked charisma or a distinguishing personality which added up to indifference on my part towards his plight. Now, it may be said, ""That's what makes him an excellent assassin,"" and I would agree, but in this particular case, where he was the hunted not the hunter, I was expecting a bit more as far as emotions or even fallibility. <br/><br/>Of course the more interesting part of the movie is when we find out why Bourne is on the run and why he didn't kill his target before he lost his memory.

Matt Damon does a really great job of bring this loner bad ass guy with a heart to life. The action kept me on the edge of my seat and I enjoyed the little romance between Bourne and The German girl.

Of course, the characters ain't poets and philosophers, they are CIA agents, trained assassins, and a German bohemian lady. Then we have the great action and chase scenes.

There is a scene between Matt Damon's character, who has lost his memory, and Franka Potente's character, Marie, who picked him up based on an offer of $20,000, when Marie says he'll probably go inside and then forget she's out there, so she might as well just leave. He replies, ""How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know."" This line shows the backbone of this thriller.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does not know who he is, where he came from, or what he's supposed to be doing. We don't know either. The things he can do, however, beg the question of whether or not he is an average person. Like say, speaking several different languages and knocking two cops out in 5 seconds.<br/><br/>This could have just been an average thriller, but this level of the unknown makes it all the more compelling. We never quite know who anyone is, not Matt Damon, nor Brian Cox, Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Clive Owen, or Julia Stiles; but the relationships are drawn so well that we can guess and infer, and that's all we need in this. The redeeming value in this movie comes from the action sequences and the suspense. Matt Damon's stoic performance anchors everything into a cohesive and coherent picture that never fails to engross.<br/><br/>I think this has been dismissed as just another thriller. I also think it's better than that. Go enjoy yourself and see it."

Jason Bourne wakes up on a German ship to discover he does not know who he is or what he was doing. The rest of the film is to determine his identity... and this is the film's strong point. While action films are a dime a dozen, action films with a good mystery are harder to come by and this one delivers.<br/><br/>Fights, romance (but not too much like James Bond) and intrigue... with a bit of ""Good Will Hunting"" mixed in. What Jason Bourne knows is simply amazing but believable in the context of this film.<br/><br/>One fight scene was strange because it didn't really make a lot of sense... I won't give away the details, but you'd think if you're assassinating someone you'd want to be silent, but this guy makes as much noise as humanly possible. You know what I mean if you've seen it.<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to touch on the women of the film. Choosing the ""Run Lola Run"" (aka ""Lola Rennt"") star as Damon's co-star was the perfect choice. She's beautiful in an unconventional way, and you know she can fight and run when she needs to (though this is hardly shown in the film). And giving her more American exposure certainly doesn't hurt. Julia Stiles, on the other hand, was a disappointment. I love her in almost everything she does... but I couldn't take her seriously as a government agent. Her theater training made me think she was overdoing her part and she struck me as being too immature to handle clandestine actions. Maybe that's just me... and maybe she gets better in ""Supremacy""... but I'm happy her part was so small.<br/><br/>Verdict: ""Bourne Identity"" shines."

The film takes us on a worldwide journey to find out exactly who he is. Being tracked down by surprising characters, Bourne finds clues as he makes the most of this roller-coaster ride using his energy to battle against his hunters in kung-fu style fights, exhilarating car chases, and of course the weapon he uses not so often, a brain.

Unfortunately, the film is not very interested in the true psychology of amnesia; Bourne is far too composed to be convincing for someone who has forgotten everything, and bizarrely, he is able to judge what he learns about himself as aberrant and strange (i.e. he remembers what he was not, and is thus able to compare what he discovers about himself (but has not remembered) to this, which makes little sense). The film has some other annoying features: the C.I.A. is represented as pure evil but also as near-omnipotent; the film is full of exaggerated fight and chase scenes that are less gripping than more realistic ones would be (for however action-packed, you can't help but feel you are watching a cartoon); and Julia Stiles keeps popping up for no reason whatsoever, as if the producers wanted her in the movie even though there is no role for her to play. But on the plus side, the production values are high, a selection of European locations make effective backdrops, the tension is maintained throughout and Franka Potente makes a sexy leading female. And some sequences, like the opening dissection of a wetsuit, are immaculately assembled. Ultimately, this is popcorn cinema, shallow and lightweight; but nicely done all the same."

","The Bourne Identity tells the story of an American spy named Jason Bourne. He is found floating in the ocean and is pulled aboard a fishing boat. He can't remember his name, his occupation, where he lives, anything. However, he possesses amazing fighting skills and he doesn't know how. He goes on a journey to find out who he is and what he did for a living. Along the way he finds out that he was a lethal spy, and now he is being hunted.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is an entertaining action film. The chase scenes are awesome, and the fight scenes are well choreographed and well filmed. Though the movie changes a lot from the book, it still has the same feel to it, and it flows just as well. All of the actors in this movie did a good job in their roles, especially Matt Damon who shows his diversity in this movie.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is a thrilling action movie with a great story. The movie doesn't slow down. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good action movie with a deep plot.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I felt this movie was a bit of a letdown. I'm glad it followed the book and I was hyped up when it came out but I didn't get what I expected. The villains (if you want to call them that) do nothing but fill time. I enjoyed Matt Damon stepping away from Comedy movies (Ocean's Eleven) to play a roll he really looks like but this wasn't very good. I think this current 7.3 rating is just being nice. Glad Ludlum was on the writing team when he died. The good parts were his relationship with Marie and the beginning. This movie kept hyping up a huge showdown at the end of the movie for Bourne but I was letdown as to how short the final action sequence was. They could have done a better job on the ending. Overall if your a huge Bourne Fan this is for you. However like me (A Bourne Fan) I wanted a little more action to it."
"jax713","9","0","1","23 January 2006"," Engrossing, intelligent, and worth buying
","The Bourne Identity, besides being film entertainment of the highest order, enjoys two unexpected accomplishments. One is that it positions Matt Damon as a truly multi-dimensional actor with a creative range usually found in actors raised in classical theater. The second accomplishment is that it has delivered a rather peerless model of what a spy/action movie should look like.<br/><br/>I have rented this movie three times over the years, and continue to marvel at Damon's performance. Granted he has an excellent script, and Ludlum's story is gripping, but Damon hits so many high notes in his characterization of Jason Bourne that the viewer can't help but become emotionally involved with him. We feel his frustration, his helplessness, his confusion, his meanness, and his resolve. Most importantly we feel his burning intelligence grappling with the amnesia that may get him killed and we find exhilaration in his physical and mental strength.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy's script and Doug Liman's direction are both masterful. Everything is believable from the hi-tech toys to the car chase to the fight scenes to the relationships between various characters to the plot development. There are very few visual gimmicks to propel the story and yet the pace never lets up. I found myself wondering what I would say and do in many of the situations and that means the movie drew me in, that I wasn't merely a passive observer. Dialog was real, the subplots were efficient and well-placed, the props and locations added wonderful flavor, and the reliefs were perfectly timed. The cast surrounding Damon is a delicious smorgasbord of ""types,"" with Brian Cox being the only usual suspect in these kinds of roles.<br/><br/>While Ludlum is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to good story telling, the way Damon, Gilroy and Liman brought it to life on screen is quite remarkable. I fully intend to purchase the entire Bourne series if the follow-ups are as good as this first effort. This initial film is worth multiple viewings and deserves a permanent place in anyone's film library."

It seems as if the studio checked, double-checked, and triple-checked the 5.1 tracks just to give the viewer the ultimate surround sound experience!

","What a pity... To waste such a good literary premise by completely uprooting the original and turning the movie into a collage of video spots of various action scenes that make no sense whatsoever and in many cases are totally unrealistic (especially the ending scene). Furthermore, and most importantly, Matt Damon is one of the worst casting choices that I have seen in decades. He has less to do with Jason Bourne than Mickey Mouse or Goofy do. He stars in this film playing a seasoned CIA murderer looking like a confused high school kid on prom night! Finally, as a consequence of not following the book at all, the movie ends up without a storyline to follow, the characters are shallow, empty and therefore the viewer cannot identify and ends up not caring as to what happens to them. Action in itself is not enough to justify the making of a film, certainly not a successful one. Unfortunately, it seems that in Hollywood nowadays, they think it is."

","I read Robert Ludlum's book, ""The Bourne Identity"" at the recommendation of my father. I had never been a huge fan of spy/espionage type stories but he assured me I would enjoy the read. And enjoy I did. I absolutely loved the book and was so taken with the mystery behind Jason Bourne. When I heard that the novel was to be a movie, I waited with high hopes, knowing what an amazing story would be put to screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, I was not so blown away. While I realize it is hard to fit a book of 250 pages plus into a 1 1/2 hr film, I felt that there were so many important things that were left out of the film. The film got turned into just another action movie with cool fight scenes and guns. While I do admit the fight scenes were choreographed well, this wasn't really an action story. So much of the story is about Jason Bourne struggling to know who he is and what he is. It is a mindtrip keeping a reader turning the pages to know what is going to happen next. The film gave the viewer this sense of uncertainty and mystery, but not the way the book does. Something was lost. In the film, the time lapses were too short and the answers are given too quickly. Rather than leaving Jason and the audience guessing and guessing, the suspension got lost in a shoot-out. Nor does the audience really connect with Jason as a character and what he is going through. In the book, the reader really gets inside Jason's head and we are as lost as he is. We discover things as he discovers them. I feel that the film could have done a better job of connecting the audience to the character.<br/><br/>Over all, not a bad film, but if you enjoy this sort of story, please read the book and the ones that follow, the series is purely enjoyable."

","""The Bourne Identity"" was a quite good TV mini-series with Richard Chamberlain that didn't really need re-making. But with all the strife I read about that went into this re-make, it's actually a pretty serviceable Hollywood thriller. <br/><br/>Franka Potente, so good in Tom Tykwer's German movies where she got to do a lot more, has some chemistry with Matt Damon, though Clive Owen, who has a tiny part here, would have done more complexity with the role than Damon does.<br/><br/>But, heck, if the point of having a new hunk in the role is to get women's fannies in the multiplex seats, more romance would have been nice; evidently Damon thought that interrupted the flow of the story so demanded it be taken out.<br/><br/>Well, the story does in fact make more sense than most such Hollywood thrillers.

","This is one of the better action/thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's detailed and balanced and don't get to advanced and hard to follow. The Bourne Identity is a decent and enjoyable movie! One man with no recollection of who he is, is found floating in the Mediterranian with bullets in his back by some fishermen. When he comes back to shore it turns out he is wanted, but he don't have a clue why.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie is that you follow the character Jason Bourne very close. You hardly vet to know more then he knows and so you kind of experience the same confusion he has. Now, while some movies that follows characters this way may get too confusing this don't. Spy/thriller/action movies may have a tendency to get very high-tech with lots of techno-babble and gadgets that can do just about anything. This movie has a great lack of these elements something I find quite nice. It gives you one less thing to focus on and it's not necessary neither as the story is well written and the movie keeps you glued. There is no need for stuff like this to cover a bad story.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Matt Damon does a great job as Jason Bourne and Franka Potente is a good Marie. They are both good characters and you get to know them just as much as you need to relate too them. I think it's a good idea to use European actors to act Europeans and not use American as is seen a little too often. It gives more credibility to the movie. I can say the same for the use of actual locations. Like it! The effects are good. There really aren't many special effects and that's good. Cause this movie don't need any. It however got some pretty nice stunts and driving scenes that fits like a glove! The stunts are well executed and well coordinated. It simply looks good. Many action movies often contains a lot of blood. You'll find blood, but not in the same amounts as in many other films like this. There are also relatively little shooting, never the less this movie is filled with action.<br/><br/>The movie is nice scored, however, you don't pay attention to the music. In the hottest action scenes there are low or no music and in most scenes with music the music is just way back in the background. It's not bad so why they've done this I don't know, but it works. It's like the music only affects the subconscious and does so well.<br/><br/>All in all this makes up a pretty nice action/thriller that is well worth your time."

The action scenes are just a little different from the usual. How did they get so many good actors for a relatively routine story? Free trip to Europe? Like Redford, Damon isn't usually labeled a ""great"" actor, although both have consistently been convincing in entertaining movies. I'm glad they made this movie; the book is too long.

","Probably one of the best action movies to have come out since action was mainstream in the 80's. In this movie we see Matt Damon break out of his cute dreamboat shell and into an action movie specialist. This movie also contains a very special gem, Franka Potente. Mostly known for her role in Run Lola Run, Franka's character in this movie made her into one of the most mysterious, sexiest actresses in Hollywood. (in my opinion) Why she isn't cast in more role is beyond me. This movie is basically about an ex-assassin who is is struck with amnesia after a mission goes wrong. His mission now is to find out who he is. The story couldn't be better. The action couldn't be better. And the on-screen chemistry between Damon and Potente is hot, very hot.

From then onwards Matt Daemon wonders around Europe looking lost, and you realize that Matt Deadman is like Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger in that he's best when he's wondering around a foreign place looking lost. The action scenes come approximately every 15 minutes and are so stripped down and visceral it makes you feel like your face has become a wire brush and you're sweeping up someone's shinbone in a dirty teapot factory.<br/><br/>But the best handled scenes are the dialogue-based ones, where you realize director Doug Liman has taken a leaf out of the Cinema Du Cahiers (Truffant, Godard et al) book and chooses to let silence permeate and the camera drift. This pacing is unusual in action films, and it works to the film's advantage, and you react to the action scenes with genuine surprise.<br/><br/>The film somehow adds up to more than the sum of its parts, it's not that good but somehow leaves the impression that it's a much better movie.

There's a pulsing, tense, driving electronic score with some good strings thrown in that supports the sometimes over-the-top action scenes. We've seen it all before but it's done well and it works.<br/><br/>But at another level we have a story of a guy who wakes up after being pulled out of the ocean (literally born, get it?). This guy doesn't doesn't know who he is, who his parents or family are, where he came from and he can't remember any event in his life he experienced before he woke up. Despite all this, he can read and write, speak many languages and kick butt on anybody who dares to mess with him. He has survival skills to die for. To top it off, he has an led display sown into his hip that a displays a swiss bank account number full of cash and passports that allow him to travel anywhere and assume any identity he would ever need!<br/><br/>So in the process of trying to overcome his amnesia, he meets a young woman who seems to be only marginally better off than he is. She is rootless and currently homeless, living out of her tiny car. She has lived like a gypsy flitting from one place to another in a seeming quest to find out what she wants to do with her life. It turns out that each has something to offer to the other. He has cash, a Paris apartment and an amazing resourcefulness that is a mystery to them both. She has a car to help him elude the shadowy people who are chasing him. She also has an intact memory of her life which will help him in a critical way towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>We identify with the Bourne character because all of us are born into the uncaring world helpless yet with some innate skills. We acquire language and mobility in a way that is amazing and mysterious to anyone who has ever had kids, yet we also need help. Bourne finds himself ""re-born"" into the world, gifted in many ways yet unable to really survive without help. The woman he meets becomes a sort of mother to him and enables him to find his feet in the hostile world where he finds himself.<br/><br/>I think we've seen this sort of story told before in many ways but I credit Ludlum for placing it in the spy thriller context.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, the boy does get the girl at the end of the movie.

As Bourne himself is so damn skilled, he never seems in danger at all so it's not as thrilling as it should be.<br/><br/>The plot comes thick and fast and never lets up, but the problem is there are a few aspects which are decidedly confusing and the ending feels a bit nicey nicey and hollow.<br/><br/>It's a decent enough ride but ultimately I didn't get much out of it."

","I loved it. Matt Damon is very convincing as an action star. The action in this movie really HURTS. There are no overblown sequences like parachute jumping or airplanes crashing into casinos, instead there are gritty hand-to-hand grappling sequences; where Bourne is able to disarm security guards with his empty hands. The first of these scenes is very interesting - it takes place outside, and for some reason Bourne rediscovers his abilities and muscle memory as a killing machine when he incapacitates two night officers.<br/><br/>His boss, Conklin after being disturbed by the unusual turn of events that took place after Bourne failing his mission, decides to call on other hit men to take Bourne out. And with this Tony Gilroy is able to incorporate action and plot, where Bourne easily memorizes a map and drives through the city fleeing policemen. And running in the line of fire of an assassin after he distracts him by blasting a grill with a shotgun. With the scenes of Marie, we get to learn how caring and compassionate and compassionate a hit-man Jason Bourne really is... he cares for the kids; he sacrifices his sleep just to do so. This of course really pays off in the end when Bourne remembers why he failed the mission of Equono Wombosi.<br/><br/>Gilroy's screenplay deviates from Ludlum's novel - set in another era when Carlos The Jackal Sanchez was still a fugitive; Gilroy obviously perceived that none of us can relate to that kind of story TODAY. Instead, he comes up with a very engaging plot about a professional killer with amnesia running from his own co-employees trying to investigate who he really is; why people are after him. And what was that mission he failed to carry out anyway.<br/><br/>Acting is topnotch. So is the direction. There are stylized reverse cut-ins or cut-""outs""? Especially towards the end.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>In 1997, when Oscar winning ""Good Will Hunting"" was released, nobody could have predicted just how well it's two writers and stars will have done in life afterwards. Whilst Ben Affleck would release an inconsistent catalogue of films, it was his friend Matt Damon who would become ever more popular as the amnesiast assassin, Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>Set almost throughout in France, ""The Bourne Identity"" tells the story of Jason Bourne. Being rescued from the sea surrounding Marseilles, Bourne awakes with two bullet wounds in his back, an electric chip quite literally in his shoulder, and a distinctive lack of memory. Traveling around the country looking for clues to his life, Bourne encounters beautiful gypsy Marie (Franka Potente), and the two grow closer as they attempt to escape from the police and assassins who are following them.<br/><br/>Based to some degree on the first book of Robert Ludlum's Bourne Trilogy, ""The Bourne Identity"" is a clever thriller featuring intense moments of passion, ingenuity and characterisation. Whilst far from perfect, the film moves at a suitable enough pace to never really get boring and to keep the audience entertained.<br/><br/>The ultimate beauty of ""The Bourne Identity"" is simply that it has some superb performances. As Bourne, Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant, giving the role a suitable amount of mystery and confusion whilst never saying very much. Bourne, like fellow assassin The Professor (the wonderful Clive Owen), never says much unless he feels it is necessary. As a result, we are given a leading character who shows a remarkable vary of emotions through little speech or facial shape.<br/><br/>Finally, the best thing about Bourne is that he refreshes the slowly dying spy movie category. Whilst recent James Bond films have been pathetic and excessively farcical, Bourne saves the genre by adding a sense of reluctance and realism to the notion of the spy. Preferring to avoid confrontation and seeking a quiet life, Bourne shows an intense dislike for the world of espionage. In contrast, Bond spends a considerable amount of time trying to sleep with female spies, mess with obscure gadgets (all location cars and pens which fire bullets anyone?) and killing as many henchmen as possible. This daft view on spying has slowly ruined an always popular genre, therefore it's satisfying for Bourne to breed new life into it.<br/><br/>In conclusion then, ""The Bourne Identity"" is a quality film. Whilst far from perfect, the film refreshing interest in espionage by treating us to some superb characterisation and some impressive stunts. With a decent plot as well, this film is a suitable introduction to Ludlum's books. Well worth a look."

","""The Bourne identity"" has doubtless good points. It's a modern spy story led by two young charismatic actors (Matt Damon and Franka Potente), there's suspense and mystery, action scenes aren't too exaggerated and violence is very mild. On the other hand the movie has too many slow moments, we begin to understand the plot (unless you've already read the Robert Ludlum book!) more or less after one hour, dialogues are not very well written and the interest is not very high... Sometimes we hope that the action goes faster.<br/><br/>The film is another attempt to recreate spy movies, but the film has neither the sophistication nor the entertainment of the James Bond franchise..."

","OK, this movie above all others has torn me in two different directions. On one side I see this movie and am insulted and angered by the complete lack of any resemblance at all to the book. The main antagonist from the book is completely left out, the movie love interest is a polar opposite to the book love interest, Bourne in the book was at least 15-20 years older than Damon, and..well..never mind. I'll just leave off by saying that the only similarities between the book and the movie were the Character's names and the amnesia part. I've always disliked movies that completely corrupted a book's story. <br/><br/>But if you can disassociate this story from the book, or if you have never read the book then this movie is actually pretty good. It's a thinker as well as an action flick. It's just fast paced enough to avoid falling into plodding along, but slow enough to let you absorb the few facts that the director lets you have. Damon surprised me in this movie as I fully expected him to be pathetic in the Bourne role, but he did quite well given the circumstances. <br/><br/>Now, if I could just decide whether to be insulted or love the movie I would be happy."

It actually corresponded to the book in a reasonable way.  This movie, although it uses the title 'The Bourne Identity' tells a whole different story, with characters that are so substantially different, that it really doesn't have much to do with Ludlum's creation, other than some basic ideas.<br/><br/>If you want to see a rather nice action movie (or have not read the book), you'll probably like this movie.

","One of the notable aspects of this mystery thriller is its good cast, with Matt Damon in the title role followed by Franka Potente and decent supporting roles by Oscar-winner Chris Cooper, the underrated Brian Cox and an underused Julia Stiles. Once again, Damon drives the film onward, playing an amnesiac well-equipped with wall scaling abilities of Spider-Man, martial arts moves of Bruce Lee, and the spy / driving skills of James Bond.<br/><br/>Cool, huh? Of course, there is a flip to that coin, as you will understand when you view the spectacle. Another aspect is the solid direction of Doug Liman, who kept that delicate balance of action and storytelling from veering too much to either side. The production also had good taste to film on location in Europe. Car chases and other brief yet vivid fights highlight the movie for those action fans and enough mystery in the script to keep those brain gears turning. Anyhow, it seems undeniable that Damon can act in comparison to his best friend, Ben Affleck and as long as there is good writing, ace casting, and decent directors (why didn't Liman stay on as director for the sequel?) to follow, I look forward to the next one."

","This is one of the best action films made in the last ten years.  It is the result of a charming and unlikely convergence of capable indie film players. Doug Liman (""Swingers,"" ""Go"") decided that for his third film he wanted to tackle ""The Bourne Identity""  With Liman at the Helm, Matt Damon signed onto a movie that he otherwise would not have been interested in.  The two of them convinced the studio to cast Franka Potente (well known German actress from ""Run Lola Run) as the female lead even though she was not widely known to American audiences.  Add Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Clive Owen, all respectable actors but not glamorous hollywood stars, and you've got talent everywhere you look in a genre that is usually defined by cookie-cutter plots, fluff acting, and over-the-top direction (think: Mission Impossible 2).  Most of the film is shot on location in Paris, and Damon even does all of his own stunts.  <br/><br/>All of this really shows.  This is a mentally engaging film that doesn't spoonfeed you an imbecilic plot.  It is character driven, focusing on Damon and Potente's reactions to an intrigue in which they are increasingly entangled, while the intrigue itself is secondary but solidly put together. It features one of the better car chases in film in recent years (which features an old ""Mini,"" as opposed to the boring BMW commercial in ""The Italian Job"").  No slow motion or shaky cam, just quick, well shot action sequences.  Also, the screenwriters did a great job updating the plot from the novel, which was published in 1980 (the same is not true of ""The Sum of All Fears,"" another movie released in 2002 but based on a novel from the mid 80s).

","Spy thrillers can be either good or bad. When they're just mass produced (see also: The Recruit), they becoming boring, no matter how hard they try. The Bourne Identity is certainly not the elite in spy movies, that's a fact, but it at least seems more sophisticated than others. Loosely (thankfully) based on Robert Ludlum's ridiculously absurd novel, it's what you'd expect from a summer action movie, but it has a little more into it. Not enough to make it a classic, but enough to make it worth your two hours.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) washes ashore with no memory of who he was or how he got there. He realizes that he was a spy for the CIA, but now for some reason the American government is trying to hunt him down. He teams up with Marie (Franka Potente) and tries to figure out who he is, why he's running, and how to defeat his pursuers.<br/><br/>Ludlum's novel was too long, too confusing, had too many characters, and was just plain silly. Thank God the American public is stupid, so the book would be dumbed down for the movie version. There's little development on any character except Bourne (especially not on anyone in the CIA-was that Julia Stiles?), the plot could use some working on, and at times it seemed a little hard to believe. But there's action to spare, and it's all pretty exciting. Damon isn't really the make of an action hero, which works with his character, since he's just supposed to blend in. I just hope this doesn't go to his head and he starts thinking he should be the next Arnie.<br/><br/>The obligatory car chase scene was pretty cool, although there was much product placement (BMW and Minis). It's all pretty standard, but it's not subpar. The rest of the action scenes were pretty intense and exciting, with the screen being used to its full potential. On that note, let me give kudos to director Doug Liman. His choice of shots worked very well, and it was obvious to see what he was trying to achieve in each shot. Why he didn't sign on to direct the sequel, I don't know. But The Bourne Identity is good enough in its own right-what people want out of an action movie, plus the addition of a pretty good character, Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence and some language."

While these were good and atmospheric there was something rather overblown and typically Hollywood about all of them, from very convoluted storylines, to over the top action scenes. The didn't seem grounded in reality. The Bourne Identity does however. It is far more believable as a piece of conspiracy entertainment.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple. It's a one-dimensional story in a good sense, in that it follows a clear pattern from start to finish without digressing too much into other storylines. The sub-plots don't tend to interfere with the main plot. The story involves Jason Bourne. He is found at sea, floating unconscious with two bullets in his back and a laser pen in his leg, that when shone upon a wall for example, shows the address of a bank in Switzerland and also an account number. When he is pulled out of the water by fisherman he is near death but is saved, however when he is recovered, a problem still remains. He has no memory of who he is. He does things instinctively that ordinary people wouldn't, like speak several languages, martial arts, and he wants to know why. So Bourne starts at the bank, the address of which was implanted in his thigh. The plot basically follows Bourne thusly on a quest to discover who he is and more importantly what he does for a living that requires him to be proficient in martial arts, weapons training, escape tactics and also requires about twenty different passports with different names (which confuses him no end). Along the way he employs Marie (Franke Potente) to drive him from Switzerland to Paris (after discovering he lives there). At the same time it turns out that they have been targeted by the CIA for termination, because Bourne as it turns out was a hired assassin who botched a very hush, hush job and so when he suddenly turns up alive (he was assumed dead) they want him out the picture for reasons of national security and to save their own bacon (the planned hit was not authorised from the top shall we say). The way the plot unfolds is excellent. We are always a step ahead of what Bourne knows and there are plenty of twists along the way and the film is excellently placed.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that it evokes memories of spy flicks from the 60's films from the likes of Frankenheimer and great films like the Ipcress File that are far more grounded than escapist spy films like Bond. Director Doug Liman has done a great job here. The film is old fashioned spy thriller with a modern edge to it. The European, wintry locations create a great atmosphere. Particularly in France which really evokes the feeling of a Frankenheimer film. The action is good too, including a superbly staged escape from the Swiss Embassy, which has some lovely intelligent touches (he steals a radio from a guard to listen in on security to keep one step ahead of them while they chase him, and he tears a map of fire exits off the wall a studies it as he goes along). There is also a great car chase, reminiscent of the Italian Job (he's driving a Mini) and once again the lovely touch of having him study a map quickly before he decides to accelerate away from on coming police, there are great touches like this throughout that give us an indication of how a CIA hitman might be trained to think and act beyond an average citizen).<br/><br/>The cast are good. Matt Damon makes a good action man here, particularly as the part requires a level of relatability that you wouldn't get from an action star. His performance is good and as Bourne he is likeable and we are along for the ride as he aims to discover who he really is. Damon is cool here, the part gives him ample opportunity to kick ass and he does with gusto. Also starring is Franke Potente as his initially apprehensive right hand man (or woman should I say). I'm a fan of Potente, I love her accent and she has a great, particularly non-Hollywood, presence. She really caught my eye on Run Lola Run, a great film and she is good here. Also good are Chris Cooper and Brian Cox as CIA big-wigs who may have bitten off more than they can chew and could find themselves in hot water should Bourne suddenly turn up at head-quarters. Hence they go to great lengths to bump him off.<br/><br/>All in all a great old fashioned thriller. It's well paced, exciting, clever and leaves you wanting to see more. The may have given in to a Hollywood ending (the very last scene, the wind-down) but overall it's one of the thrillers out in years. ****"

","This movie has a very interesting plot which kept me on the edge of my seat until the end. While ending was not unexpected the path to it took many unexpected twists and turns. The movie did have its shortcomings. I didn't like the performance of Julia Stiles. She didn't seem to fit the part. There were also problems with realism. When Matt Damon is picked out of the sea, he has no clothes. Yet when he leaves the boat, he has a set of perfectly fitted clothes and shoes. Near the end, there is an explanation of how he wound up in the sea but the explanation was not clear and I never understood why and having a DVD and replaying it, I still could not figure it out. There were a couple of scenes cut from the movie that should have been left in to improve the continuity. Otherwise, it was enjoyable and worth watching."

","The Bourne Identity opens with a body floating in the water. We view this body from underneath, through the water, as intermittent flashes of lighting give it definition. Soon, the stranger is picked up by a fishing vessel and, here, two bullets are removed from his back. A laser-pointer containing a Swiss bank safe-box number is removed from his hip.<br/><br/>The stranger travels to Zurich to retrieve the contents of the safe-box. He finds a bench to sleep on and when prodded by police, he takes them out in a quick series of punches and kicks that surprise even him. Inside the deposit box, he finds all the items needed to be a figure of international intrigue. Inside he discovers his name: Jason Bourne. Other items include passports from several countries, a collection of world currencies as well as a gun. Bourne collects these items (sans the gun) and leaves that bank. He is followed to the US Embassy where the action begins.<br/><br/>Inside the American Embassy in Zurich we get our first view of Marie played excellently by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior). Bourne takes notice, but continues on as he is being pursued. When cornered, Bourne once again finds himself to be a lean, mean fighting machine by taking out several security cards without a second thought. Bourne makes an escape from the embassy that is a nail-biting cinematic experience. This scene, which was free from music or any other distractions, solidified the director's talent in my mind. This guy is good.<br/><br/>Outside the embassy, Bourne runs into Marie yet again. He offers her money in return for a ride to Paris (where Jason Bourne lives). Marie agrees and together they go forward to unravel the mystery. Along the way, we are treated to a glimpse inside the CIA as a man by the name of Conklin (Chris Cooper) begins to track down Bourne.<br/><br/>The film flows briskly and is full of human moments that raised it to a level above and beyond what your typical action film rests at. The casting is excellent across the board (although the use of Julia Stiles seems to have been a waste). The direction, as said before, is excellent. The music adds to the film. Overall, this is first and foremost is a drama about a man trying to discover not only WHO he is, but WHY he is. His past is the only way he can figure out what his future should be.<br/><br/>The film's only flaw is that when we finally figure it all out, it's nowhere near as exciting as the journey there. With such tight drama, carefully executed and believable action (including a nail-biting, classic-style car chase through Paris) one would expect a simple, yet satisfying ending. While we get both, it is just not enough. This flaw, though, is not enough to justify not seeing the film. It is an intelligent, fun ride that demands at least one viewing."

Probably not too believable, but otherwise his acting is actually about on par with his performance in Good Will Hunting. He has the role of Jason Bourne down. Franka Potente is excellent as the bewildered German who gets involved in all of this. The parts of the fellow assassins were completely believable as well as those who work for the CIA. The plot takes several twists, but they are interesting and add a good dynamic to the film. The cinemetography is fab, as are the locations. There are also some great action scenes (a-la the car chase in a mini flying down the steps). Back to the original argument. I do not know why there is such a love hate relationship with this movie but I cant really find much wrong with it at all.

","Bourne Identity is a movie about a dangerous assassin who has lost his memory and gradually recovers. One of the interesting parts is the way he gets his memory back, it's not like we're used to in most of the films, i.e. images from the past coming back, but by coming to realize  his abilities, like fighting skills etc. Another part that makes this movie very nice to watch is that it's located in Europe, which gives it another 'air' than we're used to in Hollywood movies. I personally like this atmosphere very much (like in Ronin). I also found Franka Potente a very pleasant surprise (I haven't seen 'Lola Runs' yet but I definitely plan to now).

His credibility is on par with Miss Piggy.<br/><br/>Aside from the atrocious script, the film also flunks because of poor editing and camera work.  While it is not exaggerated in the MTV style of film, the Bourne Identity can simply be renamed ""The Bored Identity"" because of the poor pacing and failure to create any suspense.  I don't know where Hollywood is hiring these new crew from, but ability is not one of their strong suits.  This probably has Verna Fields rolling in her grave.<br/><br/>Marginal realism is something that Robert Ludlum attempted to create when he wrote the novel.

","I enjoyed 'The Bourne Identity' rather more than I expected. Reviews in the UK had been generally positive, but I expected something pretty formulaic and predictable.<br/><br/>What made the film was the eccentric casting and clever direction. Casting director Joseph Middleton must have had a brief to undermine expectations in the casting of the female lead, as 'Run Lola Run's Franke Potente is a very un- Holywood choice. She convinces me rather more than Matt Damon as Bourne,<br/><br/>which is odd because the part should suit the robotic style of acting he favours. Perhaps the problem is that he wasn't believable when struggling to assert the human being over the programmed killing machine as he struggled to remember who he was. What was funny was glamour girl Julia Stiles relegated to the second division role as agent controller in a dingy hotel room surrounded by monitors. Didn't the producers think to switch around their female leads to improve the audience demographic? Or is there the delicious possibility that<br/><br/>they were duped into approving the casting without realizing which actress had the lead role? Good support from Chris Cooper, a dependable Brian Cox, a<br/><br/>near silent Clive Owen and nice to see Walt Goggins from 'The Shield' in a small role.<br/><br/>On the direction front, I was surprised by how confident Doug Liman was with<br/><br/>the action sequences. These could have been terribly predictable or derivative, but instead he showed real flair - a great Paris car chase led by a battered Mini, some vicious hand-to-hand fighting - and he handled the pleasing European<br/><br/>locations with flair. It had a similar feel to Luc Besson's underrated 'The<br/><br/>Transporter'.<br/><br/>So, in summary this is above-average fare."

The simplified, dumbed-down version of the story seen here is down right painful to those who know the real story. The change to the central premise of Jason Bourne's identity is roughly equivalent to remaking ""Citizen Kane"" and saying ""Rosebud is . . . a flower . . . or something"" (okay, the book isn't as good as ""Citizen kane"", but it's the best analogy I can think of).<br/><br/>That said, had I seen this film without ever having read the book (or seen the Emmy nominated mini series, which may be a little hokey put retains far more of the intelligence of the plot), I have no doubt I would have quite liked this film.

[Cue the haunting overture]<br/><br/>He would've been invisible in the water if it weren't for the flashing distress light on his wet suit.  [Watch out for scenes in the film where the camera pans across, making it seem as though the character just disappears -- you'll understand the importance of the ability of this character being invisible as the plot unravels]<br/><br/>Although passing fishermen come to his aid, when he regains consciousness the character finds he's still in the dark regarding his sense of self.<br/><br/>
He has retrograde amnesia, and is frustrated trying to find the trigger he needs to tap into the temporarily unavailable memory file that stores his true identity.<br/><br/>A series of turbulent events occur that provide invaluable pieces of the jigsaw, but it becomes increasingly evident that the puzzle is far more complex and intricately interwoven than first thought.<br/><br/>As he gets closer to finding out more about his assumed identity, Jason Bourne, it appears as if the character is as cold and calculating as the antagonists he's up against, but we later find out that battling with his conscience was the deep-seated root of his problems.<br/><br/>
Having weathered the tempestuous storm (locked horn battles with Biro pens at the ready, perfectly illustrating that the pen is mightier than the sword, and a nail-biting car chase), Bourne finally gets to step out of the shadows and into the welcoming, reassuring sunlight -- signalling an end to the dark and dreary tunnel he had to travel in an attempt to discover exactly who he was.<br/><br/>Honestly, he does travel in a darkened tunnel (not just me being overzealous with the cliché), and on a train that from the front uncannily resembles K9 -- for those of you who don't know who or, more specifically, what K9 is, then don't worry -- I'm just showing my age.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a really cool film that I would wholeheartedly recommend to watch.  It's action-packed in a realistic way (and thankfully never stoops as low as the murky depths of being OTT), and also manages to add spice with a hint of romance simmering away gently in the background.<br/><br/>Personally, I like the alternative way of travelling downstairs without actually using the stairs or sliding down the banisters (but as always folks, don't try it at home -- or else your neighbours will be really cheesed and with no tomato sauce effects, real blood is just too messy -- trust me!)<br/><br/>Also, it's not just Jason Bourne who has the potential to disappear -- here in the UK, that red bag would've done a disappearing act well before Jason got the chance to reach the bottom of the building [and the likelihood of the CCTV being switched on would be negligible -- ok, so hands up -- is that the cynicism police I see before me?].  A new slant on the film, with Bourne chasing after the thief, (who, for obvious reasons, couldn't be called Amy), with the possibility of ending up in a desert valley bordering E California and W Nevada (where Bourne finally meets up with his long-lost buddy called Gerry AlaCasey), could for all intents and purposes be aptly titled, Run (the fcUK) Jason Run.

Too bad he didn't have several scenes with no shirt.  There are some cool hand to hand combat scenes, but the whole story seemed more like a made for TV movie. I don't know how it could have cost $75 million to make.  I recommend it if you like spy movies or Matt Damon, but if you like really fast paced movies then you may want to skip this."

","I sat at the big screen to watch TBI with the only initial condition of hating that wormy Mr. Ripley role by Damon which, otherwise, gave me the feeling of this guy making serious improvements in his acting. No doubt, I verified this fact in TBI.<br/><br/>Belmondo meets Bond meets Nikita. Wonderful settings (Paris and other locations in Western Europe) host very surprising, realistic and tense action scenes (forget the Seagal-Van Damme standards) on a simple but suspenseful plot (sparsely inspired by the book), with a coolest, superb-shaped and overtrained ""agent Damon"" repelling equally impressive adversaries on his desperate run for the thruth. Franka Potente easily spoils the female directives of the genre with a beautiful raw, casual and nomad-instincful mood which catches you from her very first appearance, while oscarized Chris Cooper seems not to be -imho- the best choice for a boss in the top secret underworld.<br/><br/>Car chases, expert tricks and fair fight scenes on the European background a-la-Besson are freshly amazing. This movie in a word: efficiency.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Before going to see The Bourne Identity at a local cinema, I did the mistake of reading the book. It was a mistake because the movie does not follow at all the real story; the only thing similar is a Super-skilled-and-trained-agent that doesn't know who he is and is being tracked down by some people he doesn't know.  All the rest is changed, and I think its quite sad because I really liked the book and thought(and still think) that it would have been excellent on the big screen. All in all, I've been quite disappointed by this movie, but my friends loved it (they hadn't read the book).  My advice is watch the movie before reading the book and you'll enjoy both of them.<br/><br/>The leading role is perfectly played, but the ending isn't worth a dime (in my opinion).

"humpback","6","0","1","17 June 2003"," Bloodless, no sparks
","Finally caught up with the ""Bourne Identity"" tonight - a movie I had somehow missed,  despite hitting the cinema like once or twice a week, year in, year out - and had definitely wanted to see in the first place, to boot...<br/><br/>
Well in the end, it turned out, I had not missed all that much. The movie does fine in the sheer ""craft"" department, being edited well, suitably convincing in appearances, scenery, gadgets and secondary cast.<br/><br/>Yet it is also as un-innovative as they come, has less surprising plot-twists than your average Disney cartoon and a hero (Matt Damon), which one finds it hard to sympathize with at all. There is not all that much action (it takes like 30 minutes before the audience gets any sizable fight/chase ), and when it takes place, it looks harmless, artificial and strangely unsanguine. For some reason there is very little blood at all in the movie, even when some guy is shot with a shotgun, twice and is then shown in several close-up shots.... No real kicks for the viewer here - while I am not a gore hound, I found it taking the urgency out of the fights. Regretably, the bad guys are of the ""utterly uninteresting"" sort as well - soulless one-dimensional killers, arrogant and conceited secret-service bureaucrats and some shadowy political backers. Nothing new, nothing memorable - everything is conventional, fool-proof and has - one begins to feel with regret - been seen a thousand times before - especially the Paris scenes. Why, oh why, does every Europe-based thriller/spy movie coming out of Hollywood these days have to take place in Paris ? Dear directors, please take the hint - this  makes for an inevitable comparison between masterworks or scenes at least done very well with mediocre and soulless ones  - which may be yours !!!! This severely hurts ""The Bourne Identity"" - there already are several much better memorable car chases through Paris (e.g. Ronin, Kiss of the Dragon etc. ) and there have been more breath-taking furious fights in Paris houses and staircases, too ! The Pont Noeuf or 19th century French townhouses are not new, innovative, location, and neither are the ""Quais"" on the banks of the Seine, with Notre Dame in the background. Been there, seen that... a thousand times !<br/><br/>The fight scenes, and Matt Damon's sparring especially, are unremarkable - an utterly  _bad_ thing for the main protagonist in an action movie - if we cannot root for him (or at least marvel at his prowess ), who else should catch our interest ? Why even tell his story ? His acting is defintely not going to draw us in - he walks about like some wounded puppy, only to turn into a rabid Rottweiler in the fight scenes... and back again, like a light switch thrown. Really deep acting, there. Makes it hard to sympathize with him - especially, as to the audience, it is quite  obvious what he _is_ right from the start, while Mr. Bourne seems to need ages to realize, what sort of life and profession he has forgotten due to the old, trusty plot-saving device of ""amnesia"". Yawn ! This, and the movie's dominant moody blueish light (but this, too, has been done much more effectively before ) makes for a very cool, frigid and emotionally detached athmosphere - not bad in a spy thriller, but a weakness, if you already have to struggle for the audience's interest, due to a witless plot. Let's not forget the rather weak soundtrack, which, if used properly, might have lent some urgency or drama to the story. Again, a failure. Also, ""Bourne"" is as free of humour, as it is bloodless - total. Really chilling !  So chilling in fact, that any attempts at character-forming acting by Matt Damon and Franka Potente must find it impossible to involve the audience - because the audience cannot help but not to care for Mr. Bourne. Mrs Potente, btw, is hopelessly overqualified for her role's acting requirements - which makes Matt Damon's ""light-switch"" acting seem even more wooden and threadbare.<br/><br/>As a resumee - uninspired fights and chases, weak and obvious plot, uninteresting one-dimensional characters, no humour, but at least, well done handiwork on the camera and in editing.....<br/><br/>Well, lets hope there is no sequel to squander money on."

","This is a well-made, well-acted film with plenty of action.  However, what it lacks is any suspense.<br/><br/>Every time `Bourne' is up against some sort of obstacle (human or otherwise), he (and we) discovers that he just happens to have the skill he needs to effortlessly succeed.  We watch a James Bond movie and know he will come out on top, but that is less frustrating, because (1) over many films we have grown familiar with his list of skills, and (2) we aren't expected to take it seriously anyways.  I wanted `Bourne' to just once stumble across his own personal kryptonite or crazed industrialist with a laser."

About fifteen times I found myself angry that Bourne does something that no one would do - and so many small things didn't make sense. <br/><br/>It also feels quite dated - in these times when most Americans hope that the CIA has plenty of assassins (not just drones) to destroy our enemies.<br/><br/>
This is really bad - hokey, unattractive female lead, so many things that cause you to doubt Bourne's intelligence. <br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a good movie of this kind set in Europe - see Ronin - it's much better."

","Robert Ludlum is one of my favorite spy stories writer. Many of his books deal with the issues of memory, and describe common people accidentally caught in spy intrigues webs. 'The Bourne Identity' is the case of such a lost memory case - with the main hero suffering of amnesia and learning fast that his true identity may be one he prefers to keep forgotten.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the complexity of the Ludlum action is badly brought to screen in this film. We never get a good explanation of what really was behind the complex and seemingly all powerful spy organization that tries to eliminate our hero. The action is paced, there are many good atmosphere scenes, a plausible romantic thread, but the logic is missing, and many viewers may be in the situation of not really being able to describe what the film was about, after having seen it. <br/><br/>Still, good entertainment - 7/10 on my personal scale.

I liked the film (as far as I remember), I loved the book and now I'm sort of slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>Right, Bourne 2002 is a solid action movie with a catching car hunt through Paris, nice fighting scenes and some actors I always enjoy to see on screen (Franka and Matt make a matching couple, just look at their profiles...). But - and that's rather a BUT - during the whole film, I was kind of puzzled.<br/><br/><ul><li>First puzzler: The Zurich shots were definitely not made in Zurich. I think I know this town quite well, but where the heck should this have been filmed? It looks kinda like it, but it sure is not. Whereas in the 80's version you could tell it was! (OK, being Swiss I may be a little too sensitive about that...) - Second puzzler: How did Jason Bourne make it to Switzerland in the first place - on a train, without any document of identification? They DO control at the swiss border, you know... - Third puzzler: What about Bourne's (and the professor's) headache? Why mention it anyway, if there's no real point to it in the whole storyline? - Forth puzzler: What is ""Treadstone"" about anyway? And don't expect me to read the book again to answer that! If I spend money for a DVD I might as well expect some conclusion here.</li></ul><br/><br/>I might add some more, but my comment already sounds far more negative than I intended it to be in the first place. So let's bring this to a nice Hollywood-like ending (as in the movie...): Sit back, relax, enjoy the show and ignore the inconsistencies and loose ends. Under these aspects, I give it a 7/10 - but I still like the 80's version better."

All is explained as the plot unwinds, though Matt Damon's ability for dealing with all the obstacles put in his way are sometimes a bit unbelievable, unless you imagine Arnie in the role.

Everything that Jason Bourne ever wanted to know, all of the questions he kept asking himself, all of the answers he went look for, are in the end of the book. They don't even make it into the movie. Up until the scene in Bourne's apartment, I almost believed that they could cram a long novel into 2 hours. From there I don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is not suitable for spy thrillers. Jason Bourne is supposed to be a sophisticated man who could blend into any background, become invisible. Damon can do none of that. He can barely act. The rest of the cast was good though. Julia Stiles as Nicole was somewhat unneccessary though. When she first came on screen I looked at her for a second and knew that she was Julia Stiles.

The camera edits were confusing and changed perspective so frequently that the ""important"" scenes came off as unfinished and choppy; it was also quite evident that Matt Damon didn't really know much about what he was doing, as evinced by the camera shifting angles at key points of contact.<br/><br/>
In addition to the blasé cinematography, the film had all the key elements of cheesiness that are so prevalent in modern cinema.

There were a plethora of completely unbelievable scenes that were clearly only for the purpose of eye candy and were designed specifically for the teenage machismo crowd.<br/><br/>The subplot (notice the singular) was hobbled-together and contrived, as if it were placed at the last minute.

"Danimal-7","Null","0","1","21 March 2003"," A ""suspense"" movie that gives everything away right from the start
","I'm not hard to surprise when it comes to movies.  I didn't guess the ending of the SIXTH SENSE, I had no idea who Keyser Soze was, and I didn't predict the twist in PRIMAL FEAR.  But with the BOURNE IDENTITY, it was perfectly obvious exactly who Jason Bourne worked for in the first five minutes, and in the first ten minutes it was clear what his job was.  I simply can't understand how people could call it suspenseful, much less confusing. Frankly, I don't think Director Doug Liman meant to keep anything about Bourne secret from the audience.  And that is stupid, because whatever potential the movie had to generate tension and suspense depended on us being as clueless as Jason Bourne as to who he was.<br/><br/>Compare this movie to THE MATRIX.  THE MATRIX is a pretty second-rate movie too, but it's good for its first half, for one reason: we know no more than Neo does.  He doesn't know who Morpheus and Trinity are, or what they're up to, and neither do we.  The brief glimpse we got of Trinity just deepened the mystery.  In THE BOURNE IDENTITY, there is no mystery for us to penetrate; we're just waiting for Bourne to catch up to where we already are, which is simply an exercise in tedium.  This is aggravated by the fact that Bourne is pretty slow on the uptake.  By the time he got out of the Zurich bank, he should have realized that there were only two possibilities for what he was: intelligence agent and professional criminal.  The audience, of course, doesn't even have that much uncertainty, since we are shown Bourne's employers early on.<br/><br/>Very little thought went into this movie.  For instance, when Bourne discovers his pile of passports, each with a different identity attached, he should have had no way of determining which one was actually him, since he had no memory.  But he just guesses right, miraculously.  The Swiss police are shown as being unaware that a U.S. Embassy (not present in Zurich anyway) is sovereign U.S. territory.  The Marines guarding the embassy are shown as being unarmed until they get into the arsenal; I've never been to the Swiss embassy, but in Nicaragua the Marines carried their M-16 rifles in the very door of the embassy, and even in the consulates.<br/><br/>The best I can say about Franka Potente is that she managed at times to distract me from the fact that she adds nothing to the story.  This movie should have been entirely Bourne's show, and she's there just to provide a love interest and to be a springboard for dialogue, because Liman is too lazy to provide exposition with just Bourne himself.  Julia Stiles is window dressing; the director obviously hasn't the foggiest idea what to do with his female actors.<br/><br/>Anyway, THE BOURNE IDENTITY isn't a complete disaster. It gets markedly better in the second half; it's no more credible than before, but at least the stupidities, like Bourne's escape scene, have a payoff in thrills.  The acting is good by everybody.  Take a note of the small touches: when Agbaje enters the morgue, his nostrils quiver as the smell hits him, and when Stiles hands over the information to the assassin, you can detect her fear of him even though he is on her side.  And it has a superior car chase scene.  The acting by everybody is good.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is tolerable, but the premise could have delivered a much better film.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation:  Action fans should catch it on TV."

Also, this hero doesn't have to worry about anything, he gets money out of nowhere, meets a beautiful lady as sidekick (with a perfect car for the chasing scenes in Paris' streets) when is time to flee,  Has forgotten everything but knowing how to kill with a Bic pen exactly when the bad guys want to eliminate him.

","Matt Damon is in excellent condition while passing himself off as a spy in 'The Bourne Identity'.  Outstanding in its combat scenes and clandestine action sequences, this film has one problem.  It resembles the feeling you get when you put together a jigsaw puzzle.  That's not a bad thing. However, once you've done the hard work in putting it together, it doesn't quite look like it lives up to all the hard work that's been put into it. Its final resolution comes off as thin, quickly put together in its writing and the DVD features an alternative last scene ending that has more feeling and speaks to the audience without words.  A minor league James Bond at best but still worth a look."

"csm23","Null","0","1","7 March 2003"," Self Knowledge as ""Remembering:"" A Platonic Dialogue Continues
","A question I must answer, every single day of my life, is the most fundamental of all:  Who am I?  Am I the product of my environment, whether good or bad?  Am I defined by what I do?  Am I synonymous with my job?  Is my personality, my very sense of self, God's own caricature, written long ago in the stars and etched in the palm of my hands?  Or, Do I have the willpower to choose who I am?  Can I say who I am without reference to my past, or my occupation?  <br/><br/>Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne, is a man who is faced with exactly this challenge, which is what makes The Bourne Identity inherently compelling.  While watching Jason's attempt to discover himself, to find out who he is, I sit and share his inner trepidation, for one reason:  when he discovers his social identity, Will it be compatible with his natural, instinctive self, the self that has come to him from a near death experience like a second birth?  Or, Will he find out that he's gone off the rails somewhere along the way?  Will he find out that the choices he's made, the life and occupation he's chosen for himself, is in alignment with his uncluttered self?  I identify with the main character because I'm forced to ask myself the same questions.  Is all this stuff I use to describe myself, my personal history, my talents, who I really am?  Does my personal history really reflect my deepest values?  Am I living an authentic life? <br/><br/>
This is interesting stuff, a compelling reification of Socrates's idea of learning as `recollection.'  The main character discovers, as does the audience, that his past life is an identity, a cover story, and not the true Jason Bourne.  It's as if he's playing `What's My Line,' and he's all three contestants.  In this film, Bourne is a hero of self-discovery, and not some idiotic `James Bond' type who can't distinguish his penis from his gun."

The film lacks many of the small details that Ludlum so carefully adds to his writing. What this film has is an excellent cast, Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox and US-unknown Franka Potente. These folks all do a creditable job in this film and the basic story is a strong one, but it just lacks so many details that Jason's story is never told in any depth...of course, in a way, that's the premise of the film.

In all the DVD Bonus coverages I have seen the Directors always say how important casting is. This is where Bourne fell apart.

I found it to be very good, and better than such recent high profile thrillers as ""Minority Report"" and the like. Matt Damon is good as the secret agent found floating in the Mediterranian Sea south of Marseilles and picked up for dead by fishermen. Poor guy, couldn't remember anything about who he was, but quickly figured out he must have had lots of training because his awareness and defense skills were second to none.<br/><br/>SPOILERS - READ FURTHER AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br/><br/>As everything unfolds we find out he was a highly trained assassin with a place in Paris and many different passports under many names. He had been sent by a highly covert operation to snuff an exiled former African leader who was threatening to expose things if he were not reinstated. But, an assassin with a conscience is a handicap and, when he saw the children with his target, could not do it and instead was shot and dumped. So the whole film is his trying to find out who he really is, while his covert organization thinks he has snapped so are trying to kill him. But he is too good, he always gets the upper hand, and there is a great chase scene through the streets of Paris, him driving a red Mini, police chasing in cars and on motorcycles. With Marie (Franka Potente) at his side. About halfway into the film they are alone, she begins to kiss him, and in his memory loss had a moment to try and figure out if he liked girls! He figured it out...<br/><br/>In the end, he is presumed dead, the covert operation disbanded, Marie ends up with a cafe and motorbike rental on a small Greek island, and he finds her. Good movie, good ending. I suppose the reason I liked it so much is the way we pull for the underdog, here both Bourne and Marie, who only want to have a safe, normal life. The DVD picture is excellent and the surround sound is very dynamic and aggressive. Very high entertainment value.<br/><br/>Sept 2017 edit: Just watched it again, still a nicely entertaining movie."

The fact that her brother was killed is no 'biggie'. No, not at all. But I did enjoy it. They had a very intense view. If I never read the book, I wouldn't know and be on the same page as Jason, wondering who the hell is this strange man. Running for his life. I like the way they kept it a brainy novel, to the Hotel, bank, mourge, all the same. Indeed they had to modernize it, for anyone who read the novel. There was no laser, it was a micro filment that can only be seen with a rusty projector. The Doctor's name was all wrong, Geoffry Washburn to Groncial (something like that) is totally wrong. What about wiring the good doctor his 1 million dollars? So many things left out, things that matter. Marie and Jason, never ever leave each other in the book.

","This taut, thoughtful-at-times actioner works a lot better if you haven't read Robert Ludlum's book, or its two sequels, The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Supremacy.  If you have read them, you've probably developed an emotional attachment to David Webb (the real name of the man whose cover identity was Jason Bourne) and his wife, Marie--thus, you'll be offended by the characters played by Matt Damon and Frank Potente resemble the Ludlum players in name only.  Indie director Doug Liman has thrown away most of the book save the title and the basic situation of the main character being an amnesiac who is dismayed at the talents he discovers in himself, talents which point toward his bring an assassin (which David Webb, in the book, is NOT--the reputation of ""Jason Bourne"" as a hit man is a plant.)<br/><br/>The new film sports some good acting from Damon, who is not yet a great or accomplished actor--but may very well be a great actor IN THE MAKING.  From the time of Good Will Hunting and Dogma, he has shown enormous promise and still does.  Franka Portente is a strange mixture (at least to American audiences) of strength alternating with vulnerability; the fact that she's quite good-looking but not a Pepsodent-smile model-type is rather refreshing.  Good support from Brian Cox and Chris Cooper, who seems to be a dead ringer for Lloyd Bochner--remember his legendary line from the Twilight Zone episode ""To Serve Man?""  ""It's a cookbook,"" he screams--and hilariously, his character, apropos of nothing, repeats the line in Naked Gun II.<br/><br/>Back to Bourne Identity:  if you've not read the book, you'll probably like it.  If you are a Ludlum fan, look for the VHS of the 1988 TV version with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith:  not a perfect adaptation by a long stretch, but at least an honest attempt to be faithful to the original."

Franka Potente is certainly going to be on many producers wanted list after this extremely competant performance. It made a pleasant change for the action scenes, of which there are many, not to detract from a solid and well thought out story line. The Main character of this spy thriller behaves very much as you might expect and quickly becomes a believable Spy on the Run who fortunately does not have the ""Invisible Cars"" and ""exploding wrist watches"" that ruin (For me anyway) other Spy based movies. You will thoroughly enjoy this film as long as you dont go expecting Billion Dollar effects and Exotic locations. This Movie does the job very well with its realistic approach to a Man on the Run.

But there is a fantastic surge of excitement throughout the movie. I definitely recommend it, both for the casual movie goer, and for Ludlum fans, even if the plot is very different from that in the book. The characters were handled smoothly. A sense of realism surrounds the entire movie, except for a part in the central theme, which I cannot discuss without revealing the climax. Not that it contains much of a suspense.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne is one character I'll remember for a while. The way he is represented... tormented bullet ridden castaway with one hell of an identity crisis, tortured at every step of revelation. He finds things about himself that he just can't live with, and even reaches a point where he doesn't want to know any more. The plot proceeds so casually and wonderfully, that you can't help but confess,""Well, yeah, I suppose that is the only step he can take.""

"wilder_jw","8","0","1","23 January 2003"," Three surprises in ""The Bourne Identity"" ...
","Disclaimer: I haven't seen the TV adaptation, and nor have I read Ludlum's novel, though I intend to.<br/><br/>Three things surprised me about ""The Bourne Identity.""<br/><br/>First, that Matt Damon could realistically pull off the extreme action. Aside from his age (am I the only one that thinks he's looked 21 forever?), I had no problem accepting Damon as the consummate assassin-avec-amnesia. He WORKED in those impressive hand to hand sequences ... grimacing, sweating, bleeding.  And overall he pulled off the intensity Bourne would have to have.<br/><br/>Second, that the film would be so smart.  Yes, of course there are cliches, but how in the world can you have a spy movie WITHOUT cliches?  What I'm talking about, though, is deeper -- the director of the film consciously chose to believe in an audience willing to think.  For example, in one short sequence, Bourne has found shotgun shells in a strange house, and desperately needs to find the shotgun quickly.  From his POV, the camera flashes to a child's toys, children's books, and immediately Bourne checks the highest spot in the room, knowing that the house's owner wouldn't leave the shotgun in reach of a child.  It's quick -- blink, blink, shotgun -- but it (and many other similar moments) gives the audience a real-time idea of how fast Bourne thinks and acts.<br/><br/>Third, that Franka Potente -- a relative unknown -- could carry herself beside a big name like Damon.  She's very, very good, moving from fear through fascination and desire back to fear again.  (And, as I indulge my sexist self, she's also beautiful.)<br/><br/>I give ""The Bourne Identity"" and 8 out of 10.  It's my favorite spy flick since Dalton's ""License to Kill,"" and I may even like it better."

","When I think of spy films, generally what comes to mind are the James Bond films, the Misson: Impossible films, the Jack Ryan series, or perhaps even James Cameron's take on the spy film genre, True Lies. The Bourne Identity, however, is more like the Jack Ryan series in that it is a serious film. Starring Matt Damon (Dogma), and Chris Cooper (American Beauty), The Bourne Identity is a nice break from the more Â‘over-done' series of spy films. The story centers around a man who has amnesia, and with the help of a young woman, he tries to discover the secret of his own identity. But the truth is difficult to face when he realizes that he is an assassin for the American government.  Filled with great action sequences and some cool car chases, The Bourne Identity proves to be a thriller that not only provides excitement and intrigue, but brains, as well. ***"

","I don't take in action movies very often as action usual takes precedence over script, and acting. The Bourne Identity was a pleasant change. Damon was superb. You could see him scanning the area, anticipating the inevitable attack, but he never acted totally out of the air. No shots fired over the shoulder while making love a la James Bond. With only one exception the stunts and the action seemed plausible. (The latter occurs near the end of the movie and is so obviously a do not try this at home move that it jars, surely there was a better way to get down the stairs.)<br/><br/>This is not to say that this is an intellectual or art film, far from it, but it is marked with excellent acting, and a script that does not insult the intelligence of the viewer. A good night with the DVD (and the alternative ending which demonstrates how in touch the director was, the alternate just doesn't play like Bourne) How can you go wrong with Paris as the major backdrop?"

","I have always liked Matt Damon films and so when i heard the Bourne Identity was coming out i knew it would be a good one. Thank goodness he didn't disappoint. From the outset i watched with a trepidation normally reserved for a well executed horror story. I think it had that appeal because Damon is so convincing as an actor, essentially putting me in his situation as i watch. All the casts performances were believable in how they reacted to unique situations. I find myself criticizing a film mostly because a character definitely wouldn't react in the cliqued way they normally do. So to see Bourne and Marie both as confused as each other whilst in a terrifying chase across Europe, coupled with the complete lack of bond-esqe double entendres was a thoroughly refreshing change. I particularly liked the way the film makers substituted special effects for raw tactical based conflict. I'd even recommend my mum see this film. 8.5/10"

SPOILER. In one scene he grabs a body and jumps over the side of some stairs, then falls about six or seven flights, landing on the body, using it to cushion his impact and then staggers away, unharmed. I'm not sure about that one.<br/><br/>But the action works well enough (even that scene) due to Damon's absolute, no-nonsense approach to the scenes. There are no glib witticisms. No one-liners. Reminded me a little of action scenes involving Steven Seagal (who, let's face it, can't act, but knows how to fight).<br/><br/>Anyway, worth a watch to see what combat sequences should really be like.

","Contrary to expectations, ""The Bourne Identity"" is a satisfying action-spy-suspense film. And it's made as though everything after the 1970s never occurred, a rather old fashioned movie in texture and technique. An over-used device like amnesia should have been a liability but never really slows up the intriguing narrative. Also the audience is ahead of the story when it comes to the mystery of who crossed-up the protagonist, but again it proves to be less of a stumbling block. Doug Liman, as director, keeps things stripped-down and on the ground--as opposed to the improbable comic-strip antics of James Bond--and at least makes the proceedings quasi-convincing. Matt Damon as mysterious-action-hero-in-search-of-his-past is likeable here and does a good job kicking butt. Unfortunately Franka Potente has little to do as does Julia Stiles in an almost throwaway bit part."

For a starter the main character wakes up aboard a French fishing vessel with bullet holes in his back completely unaware of who he is and why anybody would want to shoot him. As the story unfolds the man, played convincingly by Matt Damon, discovers he has almost inbuilt skills in the martial arts and is hounded by the American CIA who have ordered their operatives to kill him. As he makes his way across Europe he hooks up with Marie Kreutz, a Gypsy girl played with by a frantic Franka Potente who helps him discover his own identity. All this unfolds in between a number of innovative chase scenes that occur in some of Europe's most beautiful cities from Switzerland to Paris. The Bourne Identity is a film about choices as the man, who discovers he is Jason Bourne, has to decide whether he wants to continue following the path his life has taken him on or do something different.

Most good films can be capsulized in a 'four word review'. The Bourne Identity's could be, ""Amnesia, Spy, Danger, Love"". Matt Damon is very convincing as the main character who's name may or may not be Jason Bourne) who awakens on a fishing boat with two bullets in his back, and no memeory whatsover of who he is or how he got there, and alas, no I.D. What the movie does extremely well is show how Jason's amnesia has not affected his physical and mental capabilities, just the memory pertaining to his personal life, which must be in a different part of the brain. Jason spends the rest of the movie, running around Europe, trying to find out who he is, while defending himself from known and unknown forces, along with protecting a girl, Marie , played well by Franka Potente of ""Run, Lola, Run"" fame, who's in the game, first for money and then eventually love. <br/><br/>The film has plenty of edge-of-your-seat action, including a great car chase, and plenty of fight scenes, with just the right touch of humor, romance and mystery. On a final note I thought the film-makers did an excellent job of recreating the look and feel of the Eurpopean cold-war thrillers of the late 60's and early 70's, specifically through the mix of cinematography and musical score.

The police never behaves like that (that was closer to the 2nd worldwar gestapo), we don't have french ambulances, the central station is not the same as ""Paris Gare de Nord"" shown in the movie, and the tramways look completly different (although congratulations for getting the right color and destination for the tramway No.10, but just mentionning the fact, that No.10 doesn't pass near any bank in Zurich - they are all located in the Bahnhofstrasse).

I know all other peole around the world don't give a damn about any of these points above. Yet no one would ever have the idea to shoot a film about New York in Los Angeles, that would be a hell of a scandal in the US.<br/><br/>Last but not least, it's not a bad movie.

While the plot may at first seem detailed and complex it is revealed well by the movie as each new element fits into the overall jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>The movie is not weighed down by too many characters central to the plot. The handful of central characters all put in solid performances. Damon is very convincing and shows he is maturing rapidly as an actor.

There are various elements of different genres, or at least styles. Thriller, action, martial arts, conspiracy, all come into play at some point. Rather then a simple, ""They're going to get me, I'll fight back"" film, the amnesia element gives us a sense of really following Matt Damon's character from the beginning of his 'new life'. The action scenes are cleverly executed,and the Mini chase scene was extremely well thought out and filmed. There are several intelligent moments, when Jason Bourne finds a new talent, for example, language, and how he tries to explain his memory loss.<br/><br/>Altogether, this film is solid, and fast paced throughout.

The last bit didn't really feel like a ending at all, but went with the film. I feel that the film tried to be too many genres at once; at some points emotional, at others an action film and sometimes a thriller type affair.

"crashzoom","Null","0","1","24 September 2002"," Somnambulistic spy saga
","In Australia recently to promote his latest film, the would-be espionage thriller The Bourne Identity, toothy superstar Matt Damon was at his most amiable whilst running the media gauntlet. Surprisingly, he was able to maintain his composure even during the most inane of questions. This was especially the case during a press conference via video-link between Adelaide and Melbourne. The Adelaide media contingent was out in force, ranging from the overly earnest scribes of university publications to fawning, bow tie wearing film critics and most unfortunately, ex-footballers who appear hell-bent on turning any `news' story into a footy fuelled farce. Nevertheless, amid this avalanche of absurdity, Damon did make one candid and telling comment regarding The Bourne Identity. `the story itself isn't that original, what makes it unique is its style and execution'. Herein lies the dilemma with this updating of Robert Ludlum's 1980 bestseller (previously filmed as a television mini-series in 1988).<br/><br/>In The Bourne Identity, Matt Damon plays a victim of amnesia who is found floating, near death in the ocean during a storm. What few clues he has regarding his identity are troubling.  There is a Swiss bank security box containing several passports featuring his photograph, his uncanny skill with guns and martial arts and most disturbingly, two bullet wounds in his back. He soon finds himself on the run, attempting to uncover his past before a horde of mysterious secret agents can assassinate him. Numerous shoot-outs and a car chase ensue. Including, what appears to be a fairly lethargic homage (or is it just product placement?) to the famous Mini sequence in the 60's classic, The Italian Job (another film currently being remade!). Fortunately audiences are seemingly spared any computer enhanced fight sequences that are de rigueur in action films. Although, towards its conclusion, The Bourne Identity features a stunt that is so outrageous it may well go down in cinematic infamy.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is obviously hoping to establish a film franchise with his first foray into the action genre. With two further Bourne novels in print and healthy US box office for this installment, it is highly likely that we will see more of him in the role. Hopefully, this will be a character that he can grow into, as Damon (who turns 32 next month) is perhaps currently too young for the part.<br/><br/>Indie director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go) and writer Tony Gilroy have taken Robert Ludlum's cold-war tale and attempted to invest it with 21st Century sensibilities. Unfortunately, beyond the cunning casting of hip Euro-star Franka Potente (from Run Lola Run, wasted as the obligatory love interest) and a contemporary score featuring the likes of Moby and Paul Oakenfold, The Bourne Identity appears hopelessly anachronistic. The `uniquestyle and execution' that Matt Damon spoke of during his interview are sadly lacking. Perhaps the film would have fared better had the original era and East versus West tensions of the novel been maintained.<br/><br/> After the relentless energy of director Liman's cult favourite Go, this somnambulistic spy saga is a major disappointment that once again suggests many filmmakers do their most interesting work outside the Hollywood system."

","Straightforward auctioneer that's not over-indulgent or fantastic.  Having read Ludlum's commercial pot-boiler as in the early 80s as a kid, I expected possibly a louder B-grade flash-bang version of the dull 1988 TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.  I'm glad to say that the film is better although there are many changes to turn it into a ""blockbuster"" action show.  It delivers a quite consistent level of well shot action/violence (Frankenheimer's excellent Ronin with its European setting comes to mind) and easy-to-understand intrigue.  No Bond gadgets, John Woo bullet ballets or gangsta pansy posing.  People complaining about it lacking the depth of the book can't seem to understand the book-to-film transition, and that this is no classic literary tome in the first place.<br/><br/>Despite Damon's natural easy-going boyish charm, his character remains a cold professional throughout, curt in speech and clinical in action, commanding authority even when he decides to bang the chick.  It could have been a Talented Mr Ripley conflict of coldness and vulnerability, but Bourne comes across in the end as lacking any strong characterisation, probably quite apt for a professional killer.  This opens the film to arguments that the characters are never fleshed out properly, which is not important here. The female interest (Franka Potente) grows increasingly irritating as Lola becomes tired of Running.<br/><br/>Being released in competition with another actioneer with a European setting, the flashy xXx with Vin Diesel, the Bourne Identity delivers a professional Hollywood job with a Euro feel, despite the indie roots of the director (Doug Liman).  Probably won't win any Oscars but it sure wins a place in my shortlist for DVD buys.  Well made watchable entertainment."

","Even though the timing wound up being accidental due to delayed opening dates, friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck went head to head with action thrillers in the 2002 summer box office season (both based on famous novels and doing rather well.)  This was Damon's entry and he came off better than expected.  He plays an amnesiac who soon finds out that he has a past full of violence and intrigue.  He's accompanied by Potente, a financially strapped girl who makes the mistake of getting involved, then can't break free of the drama surrounding him.  (Hard to believe but true, these parts were essayed by Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith in a 1988 TV miniseries!)  The film is stylish, nicely paced and, for the most part, more realistic and less showy than it's competitors (although a scene near the end involving a staircase shatters that whole idea and crosses the line.) Damon is comfortable and likable.  He appears to be doing much of the fight choreography and does it well.  He isn't always entirely believable as an amnesiac, but his natural charm goes a long way.  Potente takes a while to warm up.  She is more facially inexpressive than an American actress might have been, but eventually she comes along.  Damon shows little sexual interest in her until she's free of make up and he gives her a short hair cut (making her look a little more like Affleck?  hee hee!)  Naturally, he uses the world's dullest scissors, yet she emerges with a Vidal Sassoonish, up to the minute, eurotrash style.  Damon (looking awfully cute with dark hair and matching eyeliner) for some reason never has to adopt any sort of disguise while he's on the run!  The casting in this film is bizarre. Cooper, though a solid actor, hasn't got nearly enough charisma to pull off his key role.  Owen (who has STARRED in smaller, better films) is barely onscreen at all and not one word of his dialogue is intelligible!  Stiles is ludicrously miscast and unnecessary.  Aside from a very drab start, the film moves and has interesting locations, exciting set pieces and some nice production values.

","Close but no cigar?? This movie could have been great. Instead it assumes the audience of today will not sit for over two hours and are less interested in character interaction and romance than in things blowing up and people getting killed in spectacular ways.<br/><br/>Certainly the film is slick, beautifully shot and edited. The thrills are there as is the violence. But there is no heart to this film. The book excelled in portraying the humanity of the lead character and it carefully developed the romance and the relationship between Marie and Bourne and made that relationship critical to the ultimate success of the hero. What do we get in the movie? A hurried one-night stand, which, although believable in its inevitability, is unconvincing as a harbinger of a deeper emotional link between the couple. The elements are there but they do not come together largely because of ill advised plot changes: she is a street wise loner as opposed to an intelligent academic to whom the world of Jason Bourne is in utter contrast to the Mcgill University depicted in the book. There is an intellectual as well as a physical connection in the book (and the TV movie incidentally). So jettisoning the old fashioned elements of the plot was in my opinion a mistake.<br/><br/>Franka Potente has been quoted as saying that she found the character of Marie in the book to be unbelievable in today's context and therefore the character was redrawn to be more gritty and street wise. How unfortunate! Movies like Casablanca or The Big Sleep or From Here to Eternity and so on are still beloved by movie fans largely due to these films' old fashioned story and character elements. That today's audience will not accept such themes is an unproven assumption.<br/><br/>I will probably buy the DVD and the film may grow on me with time, but right now I think I'll go and watch Peter Jackson's Frighteners and enjoy how he develops both the thrills and the romance between Michael Fox and Trini Alvarado in perfect balance."

The romance did work for me, and I'm looking forward to seeing Matt Damon again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot seemed to meander and the film lacked tension at odd times. While I was glad the film didn't go into silly superhuman stunts (like James Bond does), there was something about the build-up and presentation that just didn't click for me. Could somebody email me to explain it? Is that what the cinematographer does?<br/><br/>For example, when the action scenes were done with a blitz sequence of little half second shots, that was just confusing for me. It didn't work. And, without giving away the ending, let me just say that I was actually surprised the film ended because there wasn't the usual big ""high stakes"" at work. But, it's not nearly as bad as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", which was flaccid.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- action movie buffs, but only on a rainy day, unless you like sort of empty flicks like Ocean's Eleven. <br/><br/>I'll give The Bourne Identity a 6 out of 10. Catch ""Run Lola Run"", which also stars Franke Potente."
"ObiWanDan131","8","0","1","6 September 2002"," The book was amazing, so why did they change the story for the film?
","Do not get me wrong I thought the film was good and very well made but I had read the book, so this means that I know want its supposed to be based on and it was not even close.<br/><br/>The only aspects of the book they kept were Jason Bourne losing his memory, being picked up by a fishing boat, and some of the characters (which were completely different). Like Marie, in the film she is a German gypsy who drifts around Europe but in the book she is half French and Canadian and works for the Canadian embassy.<br/><br/>So when I realised the plot wasn't the same as book I decided just to sit back and enjoy the new plot, and it was fun but it was not as complex and as exciting as the book. The car chase was great and the fight seem were extremely realistic (the cool fight scenes are an aspect of the book ).<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Franka Potente were excellent in the movie, especially Matt Damon who I think would of been perfect also if he was given the complex character of the book.<br/><br/>So if you have read the book then go and see the film because it may not be the same but it still Jason Bourne and what more can I say. If you have enjoyed the film but not read the book then go to your book store now, and buy it because its one that you can't put down.<br/><br/>Film = 7/10   Book = 10/10"

","Audiences & critics have identified Director Doug Liman's new film `The Bourne Identity' as a very well-crafted flick. However, there have been others who have renamed it `The Bored Identity.' I could see why some have said the latter since the film does drag at times. However, I mostly have to agree with the former because `The Bourne Identity' is just one cool amnesiac spy flick. Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne. Poor Mr. Bourne is a superspy who suffers from amnesia on the streets of paris. He teams up with the beautiful Franka Potente and now we have a identity case of 2 innocent fugitives on the run, who are now being chased by everybody and their `bourne' relatives & forefathers. Damon does a credible job as Bourne who is `good well hunted' throughout most of the film. Franka Potente is illuminating as the innocent girl-on-the-run. Potente proves she has a lot acting potential. `The Bourne Identity' is one film that you should identify to see quickly. **** Good"

"LASmoak","8","0","1","25 August 2002"," Not too shabby...
","Not too long ago, when reviewing The Sum of All Fears, I wrote of what we all experience at one time or another when seeing a film based on a book we've read.  As I was leaving the house, and driving across the river and entering the theater to see The Bourne Identity, I was having that quandary once again.  I'd read the Robert Ludlum novel almost fifteen years ago, and I recently re-read it, just to make things even more difficult for myself (I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment).  I'd liked the story.  I'd even kinda-sorta liked the Richard Chamberlain-Jaclyn Smith TV movie version in 1988.  The novel was a little melodramatic in parts, but on the whole, it was an intelligent, involving action story that incorporated techno-gadget spy-toys of the day (late 1970s) in a realistic fashion.  Moving that story forward twenty years while staying true to the source material would be a chal-lenge.<br/><br/>I'll come back to that point shortly, but I also wanted to touch on some of the Develop-mental Hell this film went through in order to make it to the screen, and how all of that affected the finished product.  Those who follow the movie `business' know that this film was shot in late 2000 and early 2001, and meant to be released in the fall of 2001, but 9/11 pushed that back.  Then, after test audience results came back unfavorably, cast and crew were recalled to European locations to shoot a new ending in January of 2002, and the release date was pushed back even further.  It is something of a truism that when such things happen, the movie is almost beyond saving and will probably stink.<br/><br/>Oh, the story.  Man is pulled from the Mediterranean Sea, his body riddled with bullets, a microchip surgically implanted in his hip, and no memory of anything that happened before he was fished from the sea.  The microchip leads him to a bank in Zurich, where the first clues to his identity are revealed, and the more the man learns, the less he likes what it appears he is.  Picking up an unwitting accomplice in Zurich, in the form of a young woman who gives the man a ride to Paris, he ends up implicating her in whatever troubles his past self may have created, and relying on her to aid him.<br/><br/>All that being said, The Bourne Identity, did the one thing that a film can do to avoid the novel/screenplay conflict:  it threw out the book, or at least most of it.  And considering the Hell that director Doug Liman and Universal Studios put each other through, the finished product is a well-made, entertaining and fairly believable action thriller.  Director Liman is known for his first two features, independently produced Swingers and Go, neither or which, unfortunately, I have seen.  This picture was his major-studio debut, and his reputation as a visually and structurally innovative filmmaker gave me hopes of something stylish and gritty, maybe like Michael Mann's work.  My guess turned out to be correct.<br/><br/>The European locations -- Marseilles, Zurich, Paris, the French countryside -- are not shown in their travelogue-esque glitz and glamour.  It's winter; it's snowing and overcast most of the time, adding to the gloom of the title character's situation.  Liman's camera work does not disappoint, and Matt Damon delivers a top-notch performance that will add `action star' to his resume' of credentials.  The `romance' between Damon's character and his slightly-unwilling companion, played by German actress Franka Potente, is well-handled by the screenplay.  There's no roll in the hay for the sake of a love scene here; the film demon-strates how these two people, both cut off from their pasts in manners of speaking, seek comfort from their fear and learn to trust one another.  The action sequences are not the type seen in your average `bullets and profanity' pictures; they aren't gratuitous and, with one exception at the end (yes, in that re-shot, new ending), they're realistic.<br/><br/>Of course, there were three Bourne novels written by Robert Ludlum, and Doug Liman has previously stated that he can envision shooting all three as a trilogy of films starring the Jason Bourne character.  I, for one, cannot see how that can be done, being how the first novel was all but ignored for the making of this film.  But, the James Bond franchise continues to this day, some twenty-five years after the producers of those films abandoned the source material.  Maybe Liman and Universal will surprise us.  However, for this summer, this film is worth your money, especially if you like your action stars not wearing tights or swinging laser-swords."

","This is one of those movies where your perception is shaped by your expectations. I went in simply to see Matt Damon in an action film, so my only disappointment was that fact that I kept feeling like something was missing. In adapting the story from the book, a number of plot lines had to be updated (the book is copyright 1980) or removed entirely in order to make it a more ""modern"" film. My main gripe: In the adaptation process, Marie St. Jacques (Franka Potente) was transformed from a very strong lead female character to a supporting character whose only conceivable reason for being female was to act as a love interest."

"Harrismh","10","0","1","4 August 2002"," An assassin who's MIA in the CIA
","SPOILER----SPOILER----SPOILER<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is a foreign intrigue thriller set in Zurich and Paris. The CIA---if there's one thing it does well it's cleanup a mess---has a problem.  Ted Conklin [Chris Cooper] a CIA handler in Langley has a big mess on his hands, its name is Jason Bourne [Matt Damon].  Bourne, an assassin who's MIA in the CIA, missed his `hit' on an exiled dictator, was wounded and set adrift, and has lost his memory [i.e., identity].  Bourne remembers just enough to be dangerous, turns up at the US embassy in Zurich and all hell breaks loose.  Marie [Franka Potente] an itinerant German working girl lends him a hand and the chase is on.  Bourne can neither hide nor rejoin the CIA, nor can he right his blown assassination attempt.  This situation can end in only one way, or then again maybe two or three ways. <br/><br/>
The Bourne Identity is vintage Robert Ludlum.  There's an exotic [but not improbable] story with fast paced action, suspenseful twists and turns, unexpected bursts of violence and a hero.  Best of all, you'll not have to scratch your head to unravel the plot at the end.  Mat Damon is the real deal as a crafty CIA assassin with all the savvy moves and killer instincts. Among the films highlights is a car chase that would stop traffic [pardon the pun] and is reminiscent of The French Connection [1971] or even Bullitt [1968] with Steve McQueen.  <br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is one of those rare films with perfect casting.  Damon, an improbable selection, can add a page to his resume with a convincing performance; replacing Tom Cruse as an action hero won't be `mission impossible' for Damon.  German-born Franka Potente adds a realistic touch as a hand-to-mouth youth drifting across Europe and always up for a thrill; she sprinted onto US art theater screens in Run Lola Run [1999].  Chris Cox [a personal favorite] is just right as a journeyman CIA operative who's in over his head without a lifeline.  <br/><br/>Ludlum [who died in 2001], a prolific American writer with over 30 best sellers and legion of fans, was apparently not a fan of Hollywood, with only 2-3 of his books on film.  See this one."

","""The Bourne Identity"" is about as action packed, suspenseful a thriller as you are going to find and that's rather surprising, because the plot is not all that original, and not very difficult to figure out, even if you've never seen a movie like this before.<br/><br/>The plot has Matt Damon fished out of the ocean and finding that while he knows how to do all sorts of things, including speak a lot of languages (he's American?),he just can't remember his name or anything personal.<br/><br/>The rest of the tale is the unraveling of his past, which turns out to be all about his work as a CIA assassin. <br/><br/>Director Doug Liman does an excellent job with the almost non-stop action, which is expertly staged from start to finish.  That includes a car chase through downtown Paris which puts to shame the one staged in ""Ronin"" by car chase expert John Frankinheimer.  Liman's work is less precise in terms of the direction of actors, but then for the most part, they don't have all that much to do acting-wise.<br/><br/>Damon is fine as the man without a past.  German actress Franke Potente (the redhead from ""Run, Lola, Run"") is even better as the girl who gets involved with him.  She is actually given a little room to work and she does well, especially in a scene where she witnesses a brutal fight to the death, and finds she cannot just shrug it off as one more day in the office.<br/><br/>Some of the other casting falls a little flat, though.  Chris Cooper, usually great, is somewhat miscast as the head of a CIA black ops group. The very talented Julia Stiles is given little to do as a Paris CIA operative(and looks much too young for the job) and Clive Owen, clearly British, sort of seems out of place as a CIA assassin.<br/><br/>But the action moves so fast that you hardly notice and overall,the picture succeeds very well,even though you pretty much know how its going to come out before the first reel is over.<br/><br/>I recommend the film highly.<br/><br/>But one final thought about it's timing.  ""The Bourne Identity"" makes its debut as America continues to be caught up in the war on terrorism.  That's interesting because this film is clearly about the CIA, which is depicted as a US government agency that assassinates foreign leaders, then blames the crimes on others; murders innocent civilians, and then lies to the American people when its leaders perjure themselves before Congress.<br/><br/>All this at a time when US intelligence agencies are arresting suspected terrorists and holding them incommunicado, at times saying it may not even grant them a trial.  But we are told, trust these government agencies, we can believe them.  They may have blown chance after chance to head off the 9-11 attacks, they may have muffed countless important cases in the past, they may have failed to predict any of the major events they had been looking out for since World War II, but don't worry, they've finally got it all right.<br/><br/>Sorry, the message in ""The Bourne Identify"" rings a lot truer than most of the pronouncements coming from real Washington officials about why we shouldn't mind that they are whittling away at the Bill of Rights. Robert Ludlum may be simply a novelist, but John Aschcroft is a failed politician(he was defeated in his bid for reelection to the Senate by a dead man) and Aschcroft is the one I don't trust."

","""The Bourne Identity"" is a diverting entertainment piece that moves as quickly through the mind as it does across the screen. It says little, and means less, and that, arguably, is what ""action pictures"" are all about: good, ""clean"", violent entertainment with an ostensibly happy ending. ""Bourne"" is mostly comic-book stuff with a modest bite - more a nibble, really - and it's fine for an early summer's ""family"" entertainment. The night I saw the film, there was a young girl, maybe age twelve, sitting with her parents a few seats away from me. At film's end, I didn't have a sense that she had seen anything terribly inappropriate, especially by current dismal standards. <br/><br/>For one thing, there wasn't any sex. The one promising clinch in the film between Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) and Franka Potente (Marie Kreutz) quickly faded from view - shades of the 1940's! - once the embrace got really close and it was apparent that tongues, and other body parts, might soon be involved. In the only other scene where sex seemed likely, Damon/Bourne elects to sleep on the floor rather than share Potente/Kreutz's bed. The efficiently homicidal chap is clearly a Boy Scout under that - well - Boy-Scout exterior. And that's important, of course. Children who attend movies like this must be protected from displays of adult sexuality. Never mind that the set is drenched in blood and littered with bodies at film's end: Hollywood has its values.<br/><br/>Although I really enjoyed the film, I do have a few problems with it.<br/><br/>
The main problem, as I see it, is with the depiction of the CIA, and even its inclusion in the plot. It might have been better if Bourne's controlling organisation had been referred to, semi-anonymously, as ""The Agency"", a ruse that has proven useful in other films of this genre. (""Marathon Man"" comes to mind.) For better or for worse (my own bias is for better), the CIA and its companion agency, the FBI, are in very bad odour in the wake of their colossal failures leading up to 9-11. The once-happy notion that the CIA is populated with hugely intelligent and hyper-efficient guys and gals who never, or almost never, make mistakes has taken a well-deserved hit, and their reputation is basically in tatters. The tragedy of 9-11 more than suggests the opposite, that these two governmental critters are in fact bloated bureaucracies where internal turf battles and self-interested ladder-climbing are more of a preoccupation than actually protecting the nation (and the larger Western world) from terrorism and other international nastiness.<br/><br/>And that highlights the inherent problem with films like ""The Bourne Identity"". Thanks to a moderately vigilant press, and the courage of a few formerly anonymous public servants (who, miraculously, appear to believe that they really are servants of the public), most of us have become more than just a little sceptical of the shenanigans of the CIA and its fellows, with their penchant for covert operations that involve the murder of foreign political leaders they don't like. It's especially bothersome, of course, that last year's brave and treasured ally is too often the current year's loathsome villain. In this context, it's useful to remember that both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were CIA darlings before they ""went bad"", and forfeited their dubious attraction for the strange group of souls who set and abet foreign policy in Washington. <br/><br/>It was fitting, then, that Bourne's CIA chief, Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper) is so unlikeable, and so obviously a villain. When he is taken out in one of the final scenes, it was no surprise, and even pleasing, but that didn't succeed in lifting the moral tone of the film: certainly nothing like the sheer joy that reverberated through the theatre when Dustin Hoffman took out the ""Agency"" bad guy, William Devane, in ""Marathon Man"".<br/><br/>For all of the above cavilling, though, I have no lingering bad thoughts about ""The Bourne Identity"". It was entertaining and I enjoyed it. Matt Damon continues to elevate his career, and his obvious talent combined with refreshingly off-beat looks - faint echoes of a youthful Jimmy Cagney - should fuel the ascent, providing he maintains a reasonable amount of discretion in role selection. (Ben Affleck take note.) And if Bourne's amazing epiphany in suddenly rejecting violence and deciding to eschew the career of an ultra-efficient assassin doesn't really convince, that's okay. We always knew Bourne was really a nice guy under the 9 mm Glock, a sort of Jimmy Ryan/Will Hunting in-waiting. <br/><br/>Franka Potente was an interesting choice for the love-interest role. She's a good actress and I look forward to seeing her again. I admit, however, to thinking several times during the film that ""Bourne"" was a good choice for her major American debut: all that running through the streets in ""Run, Lola, Run"" (1999) must have gotten her into terrific shape for the frantic racing around Paris and elsewhere. <br/><br/>One final question, though. What happened to the Julia Stiles character? Did she live? Did she die? Why, in fact, was she in the film in the first place? It's something of a comedown, surely, after serious roles in ""O"" and ""The Business of Strangers"", to be included in a major film simply as a pretty face."

","Unlike many summer films, The Bourne Identity gets the job done. Indie director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go ) makes a highly entertaining and slick action pic that us viewers need to see more of. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne cool and collective and the story centers around his state of memory loss. As the puzzle is unraveled, Jason starts to learn his identity. The techno beats on the soundtrack provide the appropriate mood for this spy thriller. Great actions sequences and futuristic camera work make this movie top notch entertainment.<br/><br/>8/10"

Heck, he does get hurt!  The movie doesn't insult your intelligence with a bunch of unbelievable decision making.  (You know the sort, ""Don't into that dark room, Buffy!"")  The movie sets up the action that follows by allowing the principals to think their way out of a jam, not just get lucky.  The action, by the way, is great escapism.<br/><br/>The cherry on the top of this confection is the locale.  It is nice to see the ""new"" Europe in a distinctly American movie.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie that has plenty of eye candy, is exciting to watch, has actors actually acting, and is suitable for anyone over, say, the age of 14.

","Remember when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were making films together? It doesn't take much of a memory since they're still at it. Wasn't it just a couple of weeks ago that ""The Sum of All Fears"" came out? CIA thriller, reluctant spies, dead bodies abound... Although I didn't catch that one, 'The Bourne Identity' fulfilled my minimum daily requirements of espionage, intrigue and physicality. And for a dad with two teenagers, I have a very high threshold.<br/><br/> There are allot of spaces to be filled in this movie so linear thinkers beware. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) will be your '30 million dollar killing machine without a clear memory of his past or his life's mission. But he has skills and reflexes to make any killing machine proud and money stashed away to give him time to find out. If his pursuers let him alone, that is.<br/><br/>Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) straddles the line between strong and independent woman and perplexed partner and adventurer. Although this film has many strong characters, Ms. Potente is clearly the highlight. Watch for several connections between her current character and her former role as Lola in 'Run Lola Run.'<br/><br/>Bourne has a weakness that renders him ineffective as an agent, and though his boss isn't clear on the specifics, he knows he's got to 'get him in a body bag by sundown.' Bourne isn't going down without a fight and he seems up for anything they're going to throw at him. And that not only goes for secret government agencies but also the more dangerous Hollywood studios<br/><br/>How much do you think BMW paid to get an old Mini Cooper placed as the getaway vehicle? If a vintage beat up Mini can outpace the French gendarmes, just imagine what my new one can do!"

","First, it helps that Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors. (He's been somewhere near my top five since I first saw him in Dogma, and after that, I discovered that he's a much better actor than that movie allowed him to show.) He's easy to like in any role, and I haven't seen a movie yet that he's been in that I haven't liked. Add to that some great performances by Chris Cooper and Julia Stiles (whose role was not nearly significant enough, but enough to lure me into the theatre), and I think I've found potentially my favorite realistic action movie of the year, assuming nothing better comes along.<br/><br/> But to the movie: The Bourne Identity. I had no idea that it existed until a couple of weeks ago, I had no idea that I would like it until a couple days ago, and I had no idea that I would see it today until a couple of hours ago. But I did, and I liked it, and now I'm almost disappointed that I have disliked shelving Robert Ludlum's books for the past few months. The Bourne Identity is a great story, one worth seeing several times over, and a great movie. Having said that, I may just have to read the book.<br/><br/> In my opinion, The Bourne Identity is one of the best movies of the year, and is easily one of my new favorites. Assuming that that doesn't change, there is a particularly good chance that the DVD will land on my shelf when it is released.

Meanwhile, assassins are sent to stop him before he remembers whatever information he was supposed to have forgotten.

He tries to change the girl's appearance by chopping off her hair, which doesn't change her enough at all, but why bother?  He is obviously shaving every day so he will continue to look exactly like Matt Damon, whom they paid all that money to play the part.  He should be minimally smart and change his appearance when everyone in the world seems to want to kill him.

But, lo and behold, Robert Ludlum's amnesiac assassin is, eh hm, born again. Casting Damon proves a stroke of genius: Just like Bourne himself, we're downright stunned to see this slight, cerebral guy's smooth, killer moves. Ditto for work from Liman, whose ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" only hinted at what he can do with a camera. BELIEVE all those comparisons to ""The French Connection""; the car-chase sequence here is nearly as crafty. This is a thinking man's (and woman's) delight, too.

","spoilers herein<br/><br/>Aside from being a spectacularly average movie, there were a few parts of the movie that gave me pause.  For instance, Matt Damon went to the train station to hide his bag (launching the big chase scene), but it appears throughout the rest of the movie.  I can't imagine Mr. SuperSpy just went back and got it from a place the cops would be watching.<br/><br/>Also, the whole ""what kind of person has two bullet holes in his back, microfilm implanted in his hip, a secret Swiss Bank account with fake passports and bundles of cash, and knows tons of cool secret agent stuff"" brooding in the first third of the movie made me feel that maybe ol' Jason Bourne wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer (I ask you, what kind of person?).  Um, gee Jason, I don't know.  An English Professor?  A dairy farmer?   What kind of short list did you come up with?  (""I think I'm in shipping"")  And then the girlfriend was shocked, shocked! to learn that he's a government assassin!  What did you think, honey, after he disarmed the man with the machine gun and had a kung-fu duel with him and then knew how to wipe down the car they just eluded the police in?<br/><br/>I did dig how Matt Damon was initially surprised at his skills, looking incredulous after his instincts kicked and he hospitalized two cops and after the big car chase.

They've been done to death and yet studios still think they'll be able to get it right by copying the old movies and reviving them.<br/><br/>This movie starts off okay, but it loses its momentum the longer it runs. The first problem with this movie is the story. Once you piece together that Jason's a CIA assassin, the movie just turns into an action set piece flick.<br/><br/>The chase is on, and every fifteen minutes, you get some action. But the in between scenes are what should make the movie count, but unfortunately, they're just boring.<br/><br/>Jason's character has nothing much to say except, ""Who am I?"" And his female partner, Marie, is a little too easily wooed by a killer.<br/><br/>
There is no mystery to the movie, which would've actually helped. The villains aren't interesting at all. You get a vastly under used Clive Owen and ""always playing an asshole"" Chris Cooper. That's about it.<br/><br/>There isn't much suspense in the film, and the only memorable parts are a car chase in Paris, and when Jason uses a dead body to break his fall of about 4 stories...

The fights are well choreographed, and the chase scene--despite the obvious tie-in with the new Mini campaign in the U.S.--was very well done. Had they just made these changes, I think the film would have been truly excellent.<br/><br/>But for reasons unclear (perhaps to draw a wider audience, or for easier international distribution), they dumbed down the plot significantly. The characters are made unidimensional (or non-dimensional, as in the absolute waste they made of Julia Stiles's involvement), and the changes to the plot move it from Ran to Mission Impossible: both required suspension of disbelief, but the latter also required suspension of thinking.

This movie is by far the best movie of its genre that has come out in the last few years.  No recent James Bond movie compares and neither do any of the Tom Clancy-Jack Ryan movies.  Matt Damon is a believable action star (he definitely surprised me since I had my doubts before watching the movie, especially with the martial arts).  This movie actually includes one of the best martial arts fights I have seen in awhile, and I have seen quite a few.  It is one of those few action movies that you actually care about the characters and there is even well written dialogue. *Gasp* witty dialogue in an action movie?

If you are skeptical of Matt Damon, don't be.  He was actually very good and it helps that he is a much better actor than say his friend Ben...Franka was also extremely good and I have not had the chance to see her in Run Lola Run.

I would have liked to have cared a bit more about his character in this movie, it someone must have decided that his situation has made the character somewhat aloof.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit dated. The bad old CIA has a rogue unit that is out of control and will do anything and everything necessary to clean up after a mistake is made. Chris Cooper does his usual fine job here, in spite of being a little miscast as the leader of this unit. He is a salt of the earth character and just not the wizbang bad guy type.<br/><br/>Casting Franka Potente caused her character to be German. Fine. I want to see a lot more of her. She has an honesty in looks and mannerisms that almost (I said almost) stole a few scenes from Mr. Damon. Poor Julia Stiles was wasted here, but I'm sure her turn will come. Somebody had to play this minor but pivotal role, and I'm glad she was the one.<br/><br/>The location cinematography was very easy on the eyes. I would like to know how they shot in some of the more cramped but colorful spots.

","Finally a spy movie that does it right. Matt Damon really pulls it off playing Jason Bourne a operative working for the US government, who is found floating in the sea off Marseille, with a couple bullets in his back. He has amnesia, but he discovers he has many skills and knowledge of how to do many things that seem to be instinctual, but he can't remember who he is or where is from. He is nursed back to health by the captain of the boat, and that is where the real fun begins. Damon plays this role very well, and the girl who gives him a ride to Paris and eventually becomes much more than a chauffer, Franka Potente. With looks reminiscent of a more mature Claire Danes, and a sexy German accent. Every time she says Shiest! I fall in love again. Chris Cooper plays Damon's boss who is now trying to take him out, Chris you may remember as the Former Marine neighbor in American Beauty, he plays his role very well, and his final scene is both ironic and funny. Chris is very believable and a very powerful actor. Brian Cox plays the CIA Chief who seems to not know what is going on.. but there is more to him than meets the eye. Julia Styles is wasted talent in this movie as the operative who runs a safe house in Paris.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good return to the old James Bond type movie without all the witty comments, gratuitous sex and gadgets.

","I was pleasantly surprised at Matt Damon's performance as an action hero.  Though he sports a very young, innocent face he was portraying a human lethal weapon of sorts.  It was at first confusing and doubtful but I found myself enjoying his performance more and more as the movie continued.  Franka's performance was quite good, though a story line where someone falls so hard for someone they not only just met but who is a killer, seemed a bit much.  There didn't seem to be enough time to really explain all parts of the story and I was confused at times.  As it started concentrating more and more on Bourne's fight for his memory and life I started to really believe him as a lethally trained spy.   I would like to see it again to watch the great action sequences as well as understand more of the plot line. It was not profound but pure entertainment.

","I saw the 10:30 pm show of The Bourne Identity on the Saturday night after it opened and I must say, I was very impressed.  The movie grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let go until you see the credits. No bad press from yours truly.  Matt Damon, despite his hearthrob image, plays the amnesiac spy perfectly.  He has the confused expression down and when he fights, you get the feeling he's been doing it for years. Obviously, the use of cut shots and stunt doubles greatly increases the believability of Damon's physical prowess.  Nonetheless, Damon establishes himself as a true physical and mental actor for the first time.  And as for Franka Potente, she shines.  Insanely sexy and intricate, she pulls off a performance that just falls short of Run Lola Run.  The action sequences in the movie aren't too unique but they are well done.  The fighting is enthralling as it is violent and lacks the obvious choreography of a wire fight.  The car chase through the streets of Paris looks way too much like the thrilling car chase from Ronin but it still delivers a large punch to the middle of the movie.  One of the things that makes this movie so captivating is the on-screen chemistry of Damon and Potente.  You can feel their connection throughout the entire movie and their near topless makeout scene will make you turn your head to your signifigant other with a knowing look in your eye.<br/><br/>All in all, i think it might become the basis for spy/thriller/action movies for a while.  It ranks in the company of the first Brosnan Bond, Goldeneye, and Robert De Niro's international thriller, Ronin."

The first 30 seconds of the film roughly follows the book, and then the book goes off on a completely different story.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I think that Bourne is the only character in this movie who is also in the book.  Others such as the doctor who works on him and the girl who ends up accompanying him are sort of in the book, but they have been changed almost beyond all recognition.  Even Bourne himself has been changed drastically.  I'm amazed that they spent the money for the rights to this book and then rendered it unrecognizable by stripping out 99% of the plot and just keeping a name or two.  The book was originally released in the mid-70's, so its not like they were paying for name recognition (such as a Tom Clancy novel).<br/><br/>All that aside, the movie isn't too bad.

","The Bourne Identity was an average movie. It really wanted to be a Ronin-style movie, or something perhaps from Luc Besson, but the feeling wasn't quite there. It's quite obvious that the makers of the film were going for the exotic flavour, as we are shown shots of European landmarks many times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was great, as usual, and Franka Potente was also very good (it's funny, again, we can see that she was cast for that ""European touch""). My problem with the movie, however, was that it couldn't ""plot"" enough. There weren't enough tense moments for Damon's character. There wasn't enough done on the amnesia subplot. In the end, the movie seemed like a movie to show friends to prove you have a wicked home theater system, instead of the intellectual and twisty spy thriller it could have been. Another thing...the film really never stops moving, especially the camera work in the CIA shots...maybe they should've stopped and added more mystique, intrigue, suspense. That's what spy thrillers are about...and this film didn't have too much ""spy"" going for it.<br/><br/>Still, I wasn't bored watching it, and there are a whole bunch of movies that are gonna be coming out that are a LOT worse (blue crush, anyone?)."

"meadowlark","Null","0","1","17 June 2002"," Liman respects the reality of his characters and situations more than one finds in most action-adventure flicks, and he handles all the elements skillfully.
","The Bourne Identity - at the movies Directed by Doug Liman . Written by Tony Gilroy, adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Support from Chris Cooper.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne (Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean by fishermen who at first think him dead. But he revives, and one of the fishermen, who apparently practices surgery as a hobby, digs two bullets out of his back and a small capsule out of his hip. The capsule contains the access number of a Swiss bank account. <br/><br/>Having been deposited by the fishermen on the Marseilles waterfront, Bourne heads for Switzerland and the numbered account. He has lost his memory, although he finds he knows English, French, and German, and in an early run-in with two Zurich cops who are hassling him as a homeless person, he discovers he is exceedingly proficient in martial arts as well. <br/><br/>The next day, he goes to the bank, signs in to the account, and finds in the safe deposit box numerous passports in his and others' names, all bearing his picture. Also, there are substantial sums of money in various currencies, as well as a gun. He leaves the gun and takes the rest in a red bank bag. <br/><br/>His movements are reported back to a CIA operations chief (Cooper) in Langley, who is reeling from Bourne's failure to assassinate an African leader (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who was powerful as Simon Adebisi in the tv series, Oz ). Fearing that Bourne has at the very least compromised the covert op-and may even have turned renegade-he orders Bourne killed. <br/><br/>Seeking his identity and suspicious of what his past must have been, Bourne goes to the U.S. Consulate, where he finds himself pursued by Marine guards. Escaping the Consulate, he meets up with a vagabond young woman, Marie Kreutz (Potente) and offers her $20,000 to drive him to Paris, where one of his aliases, a Mr. Kane, has an apartment. There he finds himself the target of assassins. He doesn't know who is after him, or why, but ironically, the skills he has learned in that very life that now demands his demise, are all that keep him going. That and Marie's little red car.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This one is a boy's adventure fantasy with archetypal subtext. Nearly all the physical action is of the ""don't try this at home"" variety. But it is, for the most part, very well done, almost to the point of being believable. Given that one goes into this genre willing to suspend a whole lot of disbelief, the action is certainly acceptable, all except for one five or six story plunge down a stairwell, which one might accept only in a super-hero movie. <br/><br/>Martial arts and car chases are not among my favorite story elements, but Liman gives us only one, maybe two, encounters that shout ""obligatory martial arts ballet"". Others of his fights are quick and to the point, the way serious martial arts fighting would be in real life.<br/><br/>
As for car chases, although I am no connoisseur, I've always thought the car-chases-train sequence in The French Connection to be the best chase I've ever seen. I'd say that Liman equals that masterpiece when he has the Parisian gendarmes chase Bourne and Marie through the streets of Paris in their little red car. <br/><br/>I find Damon convincing as an action hero, and Potente's character exudes the aura of a side-street, bathed in shadows and mist, which the pursued hero can duck into for respite. I love the way she lets the action come to her and then responds in a spontaneous and wholly believable manner that scarcely requires words. <br/><br/>Their relationship is chaste. They share a slightly awkward hug and kiss at one point. Would one wish for more ""chemistry"" between them? Well, Bourne does have a few things on his mind which are a bit more demanding of his attention than a sexual romp. I guess what I would have liked is for Marie to have mothered him, and for Bourne to have responded to her with more vulnerability. I know that he has had the vulnerability all but trained out of him, and he can't afford to let his guard down, but I would have wished for some embrace of genuine respite in which he accepts and succumbs to his need for her to hold him and make it all better. <br/><br/>Not to get too Oedipal about it, but Bourne has been reborn, having been all but dead and then passing through a symbolic, watery rebirth by which he has shed his past and has a chance to follow his better instincts-once he discovers what they are, for they can only be determined in contrast with what he once was. And Marie does have an accepting, protective attitude toward him, which, under more favorable circumstances, could blossom into the love of a lover. For lovers, at their best, mother each other as well.<br/><br/>I wish Liman had brought out that aspect of their relationship more, expanding the story's human dimension. But even as it is, he respects the reality of his characters and situations more than one finds in most action-adventure movies, and he handles them skillfully. We attended a Sunday matinee that had very few and scattered empty seats. The audience responded enthusiastically, and there was even a humorous scene which inspired communal laughter. <br/><br/>I liked the picture and recommend it, martial arts and all."
"chuckrules","Null","0","1","17 June 2002"," Great Action and not much else
","Those kids from Good Will Hunting are really growing up.  Now that they have grown up they want to go from the cerebral to the action oriented in one bound.  Right now you could go to the theater and find  Ben Affleck playing a C.I.A. Analyst in The Sum of All Fears or you could check out the adaptation of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon as the lead.  I can't speak for the latter but you might want to wait and rent this one. 	Matt Damon plays the title role of Jason Borne.  Borne has a lot of special talents unfortunately he has to learn about them one at a time because, well, he has lost his memory.  It seems that he was pulled out of the ocean with two bullets in him as well as a nice little micro-chip.  The men on this ship thought he was dead but much to their surprise he is still alive and after some quick surgery, healing rather rapidly.  He doesn't know who he is or how he came to be in the ocean.  He does know that he seems to speak multiple languages fluently and that this chip is leading him to an address of a bank in Zurich. 	After getting to this bank, the man discovers that he appears to have multiple identities of which Jason Borne seems the most comfortable.  He also has quite a bit of cash, some weapons, and after being attacked...a good deal of fighting skills he was unaware of possessing.  Borne is forced on the run to discover his identity.  Unfortunately the longer he is on the run, the more people with similar skills pop up trying to kill him.  It seems that a major governmental agency is not happy having supposedly dead agents reappear without contacting them. 	First off  I must admit that I have never read the original book so I cannot comment as to how accurate an adaptation this movie is.  That being said, I will state this is a very uneven movie.  The action sequences are first rate and engrossing.  The speed of them can keep you riveted on the edge of your seat.  That's the good news.	 	The bad news is that the rest of the movie moves as a snails pace and doesn't sustain the suspense in the slightest.  If anything the middle sequences slow the movie considerably.  Also, the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere.  The beginning makes some sense for story purposes but the end just happens with no particular climactic moment.  One minute the movie is going along and the next...it just stops dead in its tracks.  It almost leaves you wanting more with the earnest hope that something else will happen to explain the movie. 	Matt Damon does do a good job in the title role.  He is very believable as someone who has lost all touch with himself and suddenly finds people all converging with his face in their scope.  He is pretty phenomenal in the action sequences and they were quite surprising in their ferocity.  This movie is full of action but make no mistake, it is definitely PG-13 oriented as most of it is bloodless. 	Most of the rest of the actors have meaningless characters and could have been done by anyone.  Character actor Chris Cooper, Lone Star and The Patriot, is wasted as the ""villain"" and Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance, is almost non-existent in her role. 	Did I hate the movie?  Not particularly but I was not totally entertained. It had some great moments but they were few and far between so I give it a grudging **"

Wonderful -- another cliched spy film designed to make one's eyes roll back into their skull because of utter disbelief and boredom.<br/><br/>How wrong I was.<br/><br/>Doug Liman should have been my tip-off.  The indie auteur of films like ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" has always been original and never dull.  And while eyebrows may be raised at the choice to have him helm a big-budget action film, don't worry:  turns out he's the perfect choice to breathe some much-needed life into the increasingly stale spook genre.<br/><br/>Matt Damon (stoic, resolute, in a first-ever true action role) plays Jason Bourne...or does he?  The man suffers from amnesia after being shot and nearly drowned in the Mediterranean.  As events unfold, we learn that whoever he is, he has stashed an incredible amount of domestic and foreign currency in a Swiss bank.  Along with numerous passports, all bearing his photo and different aliases.  And, as it turns out, a gun.<br/><br/>Before you know it, things start to get weird -- he's being shot at, for one, and although he doesn't remember who he is, he seems to be awfully good at, for example scoping out a diner (""I can tell you that man at the counter is 215 lbs. and can take care of himself...how do I know all this?""), or taking out one, two, three men with guns in lickety-split speed.<br/><br/>As Damon slowly unravels the mystery of who he is, using skills he's not even really aware that he possesses, important plot points are also revealed, none of which will be told here.  Suffice to say that the race is on, and Limon stages it handsomely.  The action set pieces are thrilling precisely because of their full-throttle, no BS approach.  For their brevity, they hit hard; no unnecessary pyrotechnics here, which makes them all the more engaging.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also better than it has any right to be.  ""Run Lola Run""'s Franke Potente plays the girl who helps Damon, and she portrays just the right amount of bravery, fear, and uncertainty about the situation and the mysterious guy she's tagging along with.  The reliable Chris Cooper is Damon's nemesis at the CIA, and his hang-dog look is just right for the worn-out, life-long agent who knows that his job and life are at stake in the cat-and-mouse game he's playing.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Identity"" is fun, smart, and is the coolest action film so far this year."

We cannot savour the adrenaline rush of the action - if we don't believe the peril of it's stars.  Damon is just too darn good,  and the rest of the bad guys are just too darn dumb.  The only fresh approach to the formula is the Bladerunner-esque portrayal of the superhumans that are the assassins.  My biggest beef though is the TV ads boasting ""a car chase better than the French Connection"" - or something like that.  Much better work was done with the similarly French based ""Ronin"",  and Willaim Friedkin already did the driving-against-one-way-traffic stunt in ""To Live and Die in L.A."" way back in 1985.<br/><br/>A good job by the director in getting the paranoia under your skin, and a smart job by both Damon and Potente in trying not to fall into the cliche traps too often.<br/><br/>I give this a 6 out of 10."

Why is Prince Scoobydo assassinated when Bourne's boss admits this will implicate the USA since the Prince already made public the first attempt? Wouldn't airport metal detectors be set off by Bourne's bank account ""bullet""? Why surgically put it in his body when it's a visible lump? And why does he even NEED it when he memorizes everything - in case he gets amnesia?! The same question applies to for his fellow spy (who unaccountably committs suicide - another 30 million lost) who keeps Bourne's photo when he should have destroyed it. And if Bourne is a walking weapon, would anyone really trust living with him if he retired? Would you trust your child with him? Mighten he even suffer some post-trauma like a war vet?<br/><br/>Like most contemporary ""action"" films, the director substitutes ""style"" for reality: using a hand-held camera and rapid edits in ""dull"" scenes to create false excitement, flashing bright lights or icons at the camera when switching scenes, an unbelievable car-chase that noone sweats during, or the ridiculously unending, loud ""pow"" fist fights. On the positive side, in contrast, this modern style makes older spy films like ""Ipcress File"" or ""Eiger Sanction"" look even better. Think I'll go rent them."

","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>I must admit going into ""The Bourne Identity"" I had misgivings about Matt Damon inhabiting the role of a super-spy, but less than a half hour into the film my fears were allayed.  Damon has a fine presence as our amnesiac hero, Jason Bourne, and creates genuine chemistry with his lovely co-star, Franka Potente.  There is also a solid supporting cast containing some of our best character actors, including Chris Cooper and Brian Cox.<br/><br/>What does not work in this film is baby-faced Julia Stiles as another operative---a communications expert---but her role is so thin and undeveloped that she's little more than a glorified telephone operator.  The pacing also seemed a bit tepid at times, and there are many familiar spy thriller elements (rogue CIA operatives, Swiss bank accounts, inept assassins).<br/><br/>But in the end ""The Bourne Identity"" is intelligent and involving.  There is a tense car chase which reminded me of another underrated film, John Frankenheimer's ""Ronin,"" as well as several other moments of suspense and intrigue.  The plot is complex without being confusing, but in the end it's Damon makes the film fly.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

What I was on a look out for is a shallow dialogue, thinking the movie will focus primarily on action scenes and chase sequences.  I was pleasantly surprised by the delicate balance of both.  You do have moments where you wonder if the script could have been improved a little bit, because of the improbability of events (I am talking about the obvious stupidity of certain agents that chase Jason and gaps and holes in CIA surveillance in general).  You have numerous questions and concerns as to could that really have happened, but once you get over that little obstacle, be prepared to be entertained.  Go see it in the theaters."

","Matt Damon stars in this action-packed film of man who is pulled out of the Mediteranian Sea by a fishing boat and has no recollection of who he is or how he got in his predicament. In his hip is found a device with an account number from a bank in Switzerland. The man is now on a search for his true identity and finds out more than he wanted to know. I found this movie to be just spectacular, I was upset when they finally made me leave the theatre, I wanted more. I'm a big fan of movies involving spies and intrigue, so when I saw the preview I had to check this one out. Before the movie started I was pleased to see a preview for ""Reign of Fire"", which I plan to see this weekend, the preview was awesome and definitely prepared me for action, which I was wanting to see. In the back of my head I was doubting my reason for coming to see it, it is a movie with Matt Damon, who I only liked in Dogma. But my fear of it being something like a spy movie for teeny-boppers was extinguished. This movie was awesome, it was a film I could watch over and over again. The action was incredible, Matt Damon kicked ass and I don't even like him! The chase scene with the Mini-Coop was pretty inventive, I would have never thought one could race one. Doug Liman used his cast and his locations very well. He showed Paris as Paris, by not putting the Eifel Tower in every shot, actually, I barely remember it being in there at all. Matt Damon was perfect in this role, Franka Potente seemed a little static to me(but I'm used to seeing her in Run Lola Run), Chris Cooper was excellent as the villian, so to say, with his brass, American-style gung-ho attitude which made his performance memorable. The cameo of Julia Stiles though I really didn't enjoy, it was nice that she was in there, but her talents were not really used. I felt that they could have switched her and Franka Potente, now that would've probably worked. Overall, this film was worth it, I definitely classify it with my favourite film of this genre, The Day of the Jackal. Go see it if you, I was sure not disappointed, in fact I've recommended it to everyone I know."

","Doug Liamn's The Bourne Identity, from a novel by Robert Ludlum, is intriguing, has plenty of tense/energetic scenes, and also, slower paced ones made to create a keen semi-spy effect- has originality too, which you wouldn't expect from a thriller from the Hollywood gene pool of late.<br/><br/>Damon is Bourne, or was Bourne, before he was found floating in the ocean and picked up by a fishing boat where he has a couple of bullets in his back and, more importantly, a Swiss bank account in his hip.  This is useful, since the man has Amnesia, can't remember who he is, but can remember all of the old tactics from his past in instinct fashion.  This then sets him off on his mission to Paris, along with gypsy Potente, and the CIA, following his moves.  <br/><br/>You might sport familiar material, but Liman counter-acts with a structure, scene for scene, that keeps constant exhiliration.  Add to that, Damon gives off persistance of character that pays off all the way to the last scene.  A full out action movie that works on kinetic and thinking levels; either 10-15 or possibly 5-10 on my best of the year list.  Grade: (strong) A"

","Where to start off on a movie like this. Matt Damon prooves himself a worthy action star as he runs, jumps, crawls, climbes, punches, kicks and shoots his way to freedom. This could very well be the best action movie since last year when Slyvester Stallone toar up the screen in Get Carter. This movie is what u get when you take Long Kiss Goodnight and mix it with Universial Soilder and add just a bit of Misson Impossible on top with a story that is somewhat similar to that of The Replacement Killers, yes it is that good. Damon is Bounre, or at least he thinks. See he can't remember who he is or what he does but he sure does know how to kick some serious ass. His body is found in the water with two bullet holes in his back and a device in his hip with a saftey depostie box number on it. In the box he finds a bunch of fake passports, lots of money and a gun. Now the real journey begins because someone wants Bourne dead and he is on a misson to find out who he is and who he is running from. Damon and Run Lola Run star Franka Potente have perfect chemestry on the screen and Chris Cooper is perfect as the man who wants Bourne dead. This movie also has one thrill ride of a car chase in it and many great action scenes that with have your blood racing and even though it runs about two hours long it never once becomes boring or over wrote, there are even a few good one liners from Potente. This is the way action movies should be made and I hope to see Damon in many more to come because he is the perfect action movie star. If you only go to see one movie this summer do yourself a favour and make it The Bourne Identity."

You'll get a lot of Ludlum fans getting very anal about the treatment of the book, but at the end of the day you're left with a tight, solid, spy thriller. Very reminisent of the cold war spy films of the 60's and 70's it has a very dark look and feel to it. It also has a feeling of unpredictabilty to it.

","The User Comment currently on the front page for this movie contains the assumption that the film ""Changing Lanes"" is ""brilliant,"" so it becomes clear that some IMDB users will always be insane.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is a thinking man's actor.  Ben Affleck is not.  While the two came together effectively enough in ""Good Will Hunting,"" it's much more fun to watch Damon on his own here, as both Bourne and the viewer find out more and more about just what this man is capable of.  It's not handed to you on a platter, as with most Hollywood fare-- a certain intellectual flexibility is required to watch the character literally start from scratch, and learn what's been hidden in his mind, both physically and emotionally, a little bit at a time.<br/><br/>This is, of course, assuming you buy the brain-free conceit that the character really did lose all his memories, but millions of Robert Ludlum readers (my mother is one, I am not) seemed to buy it just fine.  Of course, the movie doesn't even begin to resemble the book on any level (imagine that), but as a stand-alone story it's a pretty good time at the movies.<br/><br/>A whole lot of great character stuff in Damon's scenes, with two great fights on either end and a well-staged car chase in the middle (though all three are hastily edited).  Chris Cooper remains the most uncharismatic actor I can think of (how DID he pull off ""Lone Star"" anyway?!), but the real stars here are Damon and Potente.  They're given as much character as they can really have in a) a 2-hour movie which also has to have enough action to keep Affleck fans entertained, and b) something Tony Gilroy helped write.<br/><br/>There's something here for everyone, combining the pointless nastiness of ""Changing Lanes"" and the intellectual balsa wood of ""Spider-Man"" into something you can actually leave the theater thinking about-- or not, depending on your taste.  To call it cliche is to not even pay attention-- yes, there are spies, and yes, there's a chase.  But they're handled in innovative, exciting ways, without resorting to the vacant hocus-pocus of ""The Saint,"" or the blind stupid luck of Any Film Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Anyone who says differently must have expected ""Bourne"" to burst into song, because there's really only so many ways you can go in a spy movie, or in a western, or whatever.  Pay attention, people.<br/><br/>8.5 of 10, which I'm rounding up cuz I like Doug Liman.  I really shouldn't grant the .5, because not one character had a sense of humor, and this big international thriller had too many close-ups, as if Liman were making tiny-budgeted ""Swingers"" again.  But I can't help myself, I had too much fun.  Keep at it, Doug."

Was this movie like certain rock concerts, where you have to have already heard the CDs in order to have any idea what they're doing onstage?

The only problem here is that, whereas opera has going for it a genuine kernel of human drama and passion, all this movie has is yet-another tweak to the rather worn and cheap spook/paranoid fantasy ""thriller"" theme. This theme screams alienation so loud that the love interest is inaudible (read:  gratuitous).  These fantasies perhaps only really serve to remind us in that coy, clever, underhanded, and (these days) maddingly prevailing way that democracy really *is* dead in this country.  So just GIVE UP.

I mean it. Real good, sometimes cliched entertainment, the sort that's titled Heart Pounding and edgeofyourseat, fun, it gets you involved with the characters in a way in which, I gotta say, the book never did. Acting is excellent, cinematography is original, really fantastic, gave the film a stylistic twist on the jump cutting of your usual thriller. Now, remember, If this great little movie is cliched, it's because it comes from a book written when spy-thriller cliche wasn't much of a problem. This was the original; the 70's invented the spy novel, and that's where the movie comes from. So not only is The Bourne Identity sleek, told with flair and creativity, it's also got an excuse for it's old -hat plot; that's something most movies don't have, an excuse. The music's great, too, if a little retro-seventies French pop. I've been what you might call a rabid fan of Powell and Gregson Williams for a while, and this stuff by Powell is really good. My mother and I keep comparing this movie to Spy Game, one of my favorites, and I have to say, it really gives Spy Game a run for it's money! It aspires to being less cerebral than that lovely film, but the Bourne ID has enough brains of it's own. It never lost my interest even the third time I went to see it; it drives right along at a glorious pace, propelling you through France with delightful, if not dizzying speed. Treasure a spy movie that actually gets you involved in deciphering the character's personalities, James Bond this is not, and doesn't suffer from the comparison. I probably could find some negative comments to make about it, but I don't want to take the time right now. Just see it. P.S. The car chase you've heard is good, and the best part of the movie really is."
"bopdog","10","0","1","15 June 2002"," Damon and Potente are brilliant! Ludlum's best movie by far.
","I've never been a fan of Ludlum's novels, but I love this movie. I read the first 6 or 7 Ludlum books--- and they all seemed to be the same plot, same characters, same implausible and tedious world-spy-villain conspiracies, etc. Either Ludlum has matured, and now writes better books, or else this screenplay simply departed from his norm and did something different (Ludlum is also credited as ""Executive Producer"" of this flick, whatever that means). This movie version of a Ludlum book has snap, depth, and an interest that goes far beyond Ludlum's 1970s and 1980s work.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is brilliant--- he has a believability and warmth that most other ""action star"" kind of doods sorely lack. Franka Potente really establishes herself as an amazing and wonderful new international star. She spoke English before, in ""Blow,"" but had a limited role in that movie. Here she gets to be the co-star, holds a major role and carries almost as much of the flick as Matt Damon. She is the real deal! Her intelligence, grace, and charm of course always shined through to American audiences in her German language roles. She is equally attractive and compelling speaking English this time. I expect to see much more of her in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie, and a great couple of hours spent in the theater. Top-notch entertainment!"

","I wasn't a big Matt Damon fan but I am now.  I liked ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and went to see it because of Paltrow and Jude Law but I walked away from it liking Damon too.<br/><br/>Now with ""The Bourne Identity"" Damon has definitely found a great role and he plays it very well.  Geez, I was blown away by the quickness of the film. It seemed to pick me up soon after sitting down in the theater and took me for a fine ride.  No gratuitous sex or silly love story-ness to get in the way just good old thrills, mystery, action and outright fun.  I LOVE a movie that makes you jump out of your seat and when the whole audience does it several times you know the movie is good.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend you see this movie.  The car chase scene throughout the streets of Paris is amazing -  no hills like there were in McQueen's Bullit but some fancy car dancing that was a thrill a minute.<br/><br/>Go see it!"

","Yes, this movie's plot doesn't have much in common with the novel from which it takes its name.  Is that a bad thing?  Not really.  It's just a brand identity, an all-too-important reality of today's movie marketplace. This movie takes the basic elements of Ludlum's story - the amnesiac superspy discovering his abilities and his past as he struggles to stay ahead of people trying to kill him - and does something that Ludlum would never have considered in his wildest dreams.  It grounds the story in a physical and emotional reality recognizable from the real world.  Groundbreaking, really.<br/><br/>For those of you (and there seem to be a lot of you posting reviews here) who have a strong if inexplicable attachment to Ludlum's turgid original and are mystified that this version tosses out Carlos the Jackal entirely: pick up a newspaper sometime.  The book was written in the 70s when Carlos -- yes, a real terrorist -- was still at large and his identity uncertain. Ludlum played guessing games about who Carlos really was.  Since Carlos - Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - was captured in the mid-90s and is in prison in France, that wouldn't really have flown in this movie."

","Better than Sum of All Fears in so many ways.  I read the book around 86 or 87, but beyond the general concept I have no memories beyond enjoying it (that was an unintention non-pun).  I still feel Matt Damon was miscast, but he did an excellent job.  The movie had an excellent euro feeling to it that was inspiring and consistent.  The story unfolded perfectly and remained taught and sharp and cool.  I am curious as to whether or not this is one of those movies where the studio tinkered with the director's planned ending because, though well done, the last scenes felt as tacked-on as Blade Runner's sunny drive off in to the credits.<br/><br/>Those things aside, this movie rocked.  It was slight retro-modern with just enough isolation and paranoia to give you that comfortable else-where feeling.  Franka was simply awesome - her and Toni Collette are easily the finest of the least-known actress crowd of today.<br/><br/>Don't miss this movie - especially if you like the euro-feel of movies like Frantic, Ronin and the like."
"Marmaduke Grove","Null","0","1","3 July 2002"," Good: Car chase Bad: Movie
","If you're here you already know that the Bourne Identity is a spy thriller starring Matt Damon in the title role and Potente (god, that's a cool last name, unless you're Dutch or Belgian or something and your given name is Wim) as the love interest and France as the background.<br/><br/>What you need to know is this: this movie has maybe the best car chase scene ever. Now I haven't seen that many of them, but for example, it (and I mean the chase, here)'s so much better than recent 'movies about fast-cars' like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (which does have a cool-ish car chase scene but is largely spoiled by the stupid construction-ramp thing and the fact that he's being chased partially by helicopter) and ""Fast and the Furious"" (which should be burned for the fact that, despite being a fast-car movie it doesn't have a single car chase scene! Like, how stupid is that!).  Oh yes, the chase here is excellent. Over the partly-cobbled streets of old-city Paris (where you feel like you're in a car chase even if you're just trying to drive slowly and peacefully - which reminds me - I'd actually watch a movie of 2 straight hours of a driver trying to manoeuvre in Paris traffic). Damon and Potente are in a little red Morris Mini and the Paris police are on (I think) Citroen Saxo's and cheap motorbikes, which just shows you, the greatness of the cars have absolutely nothing to do with the greatness of the car chases.  The cinematography/stuntwork/cgi or whatever it is here is awe-inspiring to watch as in perfect co-ordination all the cars in traffic seem to be just about to hit and be hit by the little Mini, but not quite, as it accelerates, swerves, dodges and handbrake-turns. Truly the stuff of movie legend.<br/><br/>As I said, the Mini seems to have a character all its own. Too bad that isn't true for any of its human co-stars.  The story here is stupid, the suspense completely lacking (gee, I wonder if Matt Damon is a spy or just some guy who is astonishingly adept at spying behaviour and is chased by the spy agency for no real reason?) and the attention to detail - something that made Spy Game, for example so enjoyable - is completely lacking. For example, in one of the 'climactic' scenes at the end, the time of day switches from total darkness to noon-hour sunshine in a matter of seconds. And 'Bourne' in Cyrillic is apparently L'tsshfum!!? Really, how expensive is it to hire a guy who can read cyrillic? Hell, I would have done it for two bucks.<br/><br/>What else can I tell you? Spy Game is a much superior movie in the same vein. But see this one nevertheless 'cause of the car chase."

Damon and Potente are well matched and do a fine job. She is a German actress who seems to have managed to speak well unaccented American English. The mystery of who the Damon character really is, and how he discovers his special talents, was effective. The fight scenes and supporting cast all were good.<br/><br/>I didn't buy two scenes: Damon's Human Fly act outside the U.S. Embassy, and the Ride the Corpse Down Five Stories (and walk away??) act.

","This movie alone was great. However, i read the book beforehand, and I don't think they should've even called the movie ""The Bourne Identity."" I don't know, maybe movies don't always follow books that well, but they should at least a little. Ok, I admit, he had a chip in his hip with his bank account number, his name was Jason Bourne (it wasn't even that in the book-later you find out that it was David Webb), his girl's name was Marie (even though she had a much huger part in the book), and Treadstone was mentioned. Oh yeah, and he had amnesia. That's about all that is the same. If you have read the book, get ready to be appalled. None of the places he goes to are the same, none of the people, except Abbott and Conklin, and I didn't even hear their names mentioned in the movie, i had to look online. Other than the fact that it had nothing to do with the book (Carlos wasn't even mentioned!), it was a good movie. Damon did the role wonderfully, and looked like he knew what he was doing in the action scenes. He was the perfect ""chameleon,"" as the book says. Could look like a normal person. If you want to read the book, read it, it is wonderful. If you do, be prepared for the movie. I realize they couldn't have put all 535 pages in, but they could've put a lot more.

I will admit that I am not big into spy movies, and most of my exposure to them consists of Bond and Mission Impossible.  If you like Bond and Mission Impossible, you should definitely like this movie.

"slugproof","7","0","1","30 June 2002"," Not that great
","SPOILERS Although I like Matt Damon as an actor (despite All the Pretty Horses), this movie didn't really do much for me.  After seeing the trailers, I thought that it would be a decent movie.  I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, but it was very anti-climatic all the way through.  I'm not really sure if there was a climax in this film at all.  It certainly wasn't in the ending, where you figure he would face off against someone.  But apparently (by reading some of the other comments) they took one of the main characters from the book out of the movie.  One silly thing was, why did he go through all the trouble of cutting and dying the girls hair, and then changing nothing on himself.  Not even a fake mustache or something.  Maybe he figured they would be saying ""That looks a lot like the man we're looking for, but the girls hair is shorter and a different color, so that can't be Jason Bourne.""<br/><br/>With these negative aspects, the movie does have good action scenes, and it was interesting to see Matt Damon in this type of role.

"fred-287","Null","0","1","29 June 2002"," ... but what happened to the blonde chick?
","I went into this one expecting some solid mindless mayhem, good ""popcorn flick.""  (I use quotes 'cause I don't usually eat popcorn at movies since I go to matinees right after having lunch.)  Got that, & then some. Cinematically so far this is my biggest pleasant surprise of the year. Really holds together well.  GRANTED, one needs to accept the premise, particularly the amnesia bit; just out of curiosity, has anyone in history ever actually had amnesia? (Just 'cause there's a word for something doesn't mean it exists; I've never seen a ""unicorn,"" for instance.)  It would've been great if someone in the movie, preferably Franka, had said ""Amnesia? Don't only people on soap operas have that?""<br/><br/>Well, now that I've mentioned Franka: guess it's chiefly due to her that this one works so well for me.  This is a genuine FOX.  Got an immediate crush on her in ""Run Lola Run,"" & thought ""Well it's too bad she can't have an English-speaking film career since she doesn't resemble Sarah Michelle goddamned Geller or some such.""  But look at those eyes, dammit.   Pair her up with a leading man even somewhat bearable, & bingo.  Matt Damon is one of the few young leading men these days about whom the word ""likable"" pops up. Hard to say why he's likable.  ""I don't know about art, but I know what I like...""  There's a kind of grace to him onscreen, an anti-in-your-face quality, it's as though he's embarrassed to get caught getting depicted. (By way of contrast, I wish his buddy Ben Affleck would just go away. Affleck's like a goyisher Adam Sandler, who knows he's annoying & makes it work for him.  Affleck doesn't seem to know he's annoying, which makes it even more annoying.)  This reluctant-hero persona can be absolute gold in the action realm; Steve McQueen comes to mind.  In this movie Damon & Potente together have charisma out the wazoo.  Comes out in quiet little moments; they're in a car together, or a diner, one will glance at the other, whatever.  The scene in his apartment: the two of them generate all the tension; don't believe me?  Imagine the shooting script: ""She comes out of the bathroom, he picks up a knife, he puts it down, she looks around, he looks around, she smiles, he frowns,"" etc.  The actors make it work. Franka even overcomes the flick's chief plot flaw: once he's had his ride to Paris & she's been paid, there's really no reason at all for them to be together any more.  She makes us believe her character knows she should split but just doesn't want to.<br/><br/>Oh, & supporting cast?  Chris Cooper?  Brian Cox?  I think I'd pay to see Cooper read the phone book; that guy owns the screen when he's on it.  His face is like the proverbial car wreck: you can't not watch it, whether you want to or not.  His 3-minute part in ""Money Train"" is acid-etched into my brain for life. Cox?  Sorry Anthony Hopkins but Cox's Hannibel Lecter was far superior, every supporting part he plays is a treasure for me.  ...Plus all those great Europeans; I even got caught up in the card game on the boat at the beginning.  They exude Presence or something.  Even the pain-in-the-ass African character was fascinating, if for no other reason than how shamefully that continent gets ignored usually.  (Less than a decade ago there was genocide occurring there to make Bosnia look like burlesque.  In the media it was a sideshow.  ""If the corpses are black, the world stands back."")  EVERY part in this movie seemed to resonate; the exasperated English friend, the bespectacled sniper, the blonde chick--each seemed a real entity.<br/><br/>But of course it's an Action flick & as such more than passes muster. Sure, there were some random musings here & there, e.g. ""An American guy with amnesia on a French boat arrives in port, why doesn't he IMMEDIATELY seek the nearest Yank embassy?"" or ""Cops are chasing a car--shouldn't they be radio-ing for more cops so that the chasee can't escape merely by shaking those few off?"" or ""All those Marines in the embassy--they weren't allowed to poke their heads out the door?"" or ""Not since Bruce Lee flicks have body blows sounded this loud.""  But what chiefly gave me pause--enough to make it the title of this piece--is the scene towards the end--this isn't a ""spoiler,"" doesn't really affect the action one way or the other--Damon & Cooper & the blonde chick are in a room having the big showdown.   She's seen constantly, up to a certain point--then she's just not seen any more. We don't see something happen to her in the room; we don't see her leave the room; I think we never see her again.  She had had enough screen time that we're led to believe she's at least somewhat significant to the proceedings--certainly we see what happens to certain characters with much less screen time--but she just kinda evaporates.  So what the hell happened to her?  I even checked under ""Goofs"" before beginning this piece, thinking maybe it was just a continuity problem. But bottom line: see the movie, it's fun.  I may even want to see it again, before I groaningly drag my butt off to see ""Minority Report"" with Spielberg apparently having decided he wants to be Stanley Kubrick the rest of his life.  (I'm not sure even Kubrick wanted to be Kubrick.)"

","There are two kinds of ""good movies"": ones that expand moviedom by carving a new niche or genre, and ones that are quality additions to existing niches and genres.<br/><br/>""Bourne Identity"" is the second kind of movie.<br/><br/>Some viewers here have complained that this movie is a rehashing of existing formulaic spy plots, and that it's predictable.  Well: I counter those comments by accusing these viewers of being fools to expect otherwise from a spy thriller movie. <br/><br/>In the same niche as ""Ronin"" and ""Mission Impossible I"", the Bourne Identity promises good kick-butt action and adrenalized narrative.  The Bourne Identity also delivers exactly that.  There are no attempts at cultivating a complicated character narrative, nor are there Spielberg-esque attempts at social or political commentary.  This movie is about 115 minutes of fun spy action.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS MOVIE:  the hand-to-hand combat scenes were tremendously choreographed; the rock-climbing scene on the side of the building is a memorable demonstration of good climber form; car chases were delightful, and flavored nicely with European scenery; Franka Potente is a well-chosen female supporting character, and she avoids falling into an archetypal girly-girl role; the movie is paced well, and visually narrated well.<br/><br/>LOW POINTS OF THIS MOVIE: almost no comic relief... just when a good chuckle would relieve some tension, the tension just keeps building; a couple of scenes were muddled with the obscured camera angles.<br/><br/>

","I saw this movie today.... it was somebody else's choice. How lucky I was. It is thoroughly entertaining and elegant. There is no room for pretentiousness. The relatively fast pace never loses momentum without relying on video-clip type editing which I usually find so annoying. The script is well written, reserved and stripped down to essentials without lapsing into Mamet-styled affectations. Paris looks beautiful in any season.... but one rarely gets to see it so beautiful in winter. It's great to see La Defense on film after so many years of it being there. The acting is superb: the movie is cast from strength. Matt Damon proves to be a very convincing action hero.... certainly stronger than Keanu Reeves or Tom Cruise. His reserve gives the character strength and the right degree of remoteness. His natural charm is held in check. This man is a killer for hire, which in itself assumes a certain insularity in dealing with the world. Everybody else is fine. The score is particularly interesting... relies a lot on clever use of percussion..... my theater had great surround-sound.... it makes a difference.... it reminded me of Stewart Copeland.<br/><br/>The movie conjures an atmosphere of cold objectivity which fits the story perfectly.

","In an era when we've been begging for a decent James Bond flick, this movie comes along and shows that Hollywood can still make a great movie about spies and intrigue with a minimum of explosions and special effects.  Damon portrays a spy who has lost his identity and has to find himself without the use of a bunch of silly props and gadgets. I also like the chemistry between Damon and Franka Potente. Unlike a lot of the stupid, helpless women we have to endure in thrillers, Potente brings a smart, clever presence to the movie. This film is also beautifully filmed, with fine, sweeping images of the Alps, Paris, and the Cote D'Azur and excellent editing. My only complaint: a couple of the fight scenes were hard to believe.

","A friend of mine (gay male) says he could enjoy watching Matt Damon reading the phone book. This movie is for people who demand more, but not MUCH more!  Matt's hair is now brown instead of blond, and he now goes for a whole movie without flashing his big white teeth in a pretty boy smile. He is trying to look like a tough competitor for action films, so all the roles don't go to his pal Ben Affleck or to Tom Cruise.  Does it work?  Sure, Matt is a fine actor, and great to look at, too.<br/><br/>
      ***Possible Spoilers***  This movie is supposedly based on a Robert Ludlum book.  The script was probably good when it was written, but as it got doctored up and edited to bits, it's a ridiculous mess.  That is why I prefer independent films, where the writer is often the actual writer-- rather than having a whole crew of hacks deciding what the story will be. <br/><br/>
     The story, as far as I can figure, is about a CIA assassin (Matt Damon) who goes onto a yacht to kill an African man with a French accent, who is some sort of leader of somebody and has an attitude problem that makes someone else want to kill him. Anyway, the assassin gets shot and tossed in the ocean, where he is rescued by a boatful of extras and stuntmen who look vaguely Eastern European.  Oddly, the same extras and stuntmen are used much later in the film to play CIA agents who come to attack Matt Damon in his hotel room.<br/><br/>
    The whole idea here is amnesia, which as far as I know, only occurs in movies. The assassin can't remember who he is or why people are chasing him. The people chasing him, as it turns out, are his employers, and the audience can never really understand why they are chasing him, either.<br/><br/><br/><br/>   The CIA has imbedded some sort of little capsule, the size of a little vitamin pill, into the assassin's skin.  When it is excised, the capsule shines a little light that projects the name of a bank and an account number.  How convenient!  Matt knows what Swiss bank to go to, and his account number.  He goes there and gets into his safe deposit box to find a big pile of money and a bunch of fake I.D.s.  This would make his life a lot easier, except he packs the  stuff into a red bag, which makes him easier to spot wherever he goes.  He can get a car, hair dye, scissors, etc, but cannot seem to locate a different bag in all of Europe.  When police are chasing him and calling out ""Hey, red bag!"", that would seem to be a clue to get a new bag.   Matt, the assassin, aware that the CIA is trying to kill him, sets up a meeting with his CIA boss out on a bridge in Paris.  Why?  To kill him?  To be killed?  We don't know or care!<br/><br/>
     In this movie we see Matt climbing on a rusty fire escape, down the outside of a smooth brick building, driving in a clever chase scene where his vehicle is a pokey little car, fighting off and shooting lots of guys, blowing things up, etc.<br/><br/>
  The women's roles in this movie are hilarious!  Franke Potente gets to stand within arm's length and watch as Matt fights a CIA goon to the death. It never occurs to the goon to harm her, and she does not appear afraid, she just stands there and watches!  Later, the same thing happen with Julia Stiles just standing there!  Apparently, women in this movie are invisible and invulnerable to harm.<br/><br/>   This movie is goofy, mindless fun, for those who want to see beautiful grayish cinematography of sights in Europe.  It is sure to be a big hit in Europe!  It is surely not Oscar material, or even anything you will want to see twice, unless you are fixated on Matt or Franke."

","This film is strong because Matt Damon delivers. The knife fight scene in the first half of the movie is thrilling and fast-paced. The car chase and the other combat scenes are just as compelling. However, there are a few pervasive shortcomings in the film. The first has to do with casting. Why was Julia Stiles in the movie? What purpose does her Character serve? Maybe she was trying to break her typecast as a lead in teen movies, but this role affords her but the most vapid of lines. The second casting question mark comes with Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. He is absolutely brilliant in Oz, but really does not fit this role. This is a perfect segway into the second error of 'The Bourne Identity'. The plot is thinner than dental floss. The beginning and the end of the film pass by in a flash, leaving the viewer confused and disappointed. An example of this comes at the beginning of the film and its introduction of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character. Who is he again? I was not quite certain of this. I still to this day cannot decide whether he was a political hotshot or religious figure of some sorts. Another example comes at the end of the film, but has its roots all throughout. What is Treadstone? Is in an implant, a mind-control device? It is left vague. One could always use their imagination, but this vaguery does not bode well for the film. Treadstone, whatever it is, is quickly put under raps at a congressional hearing. It is over in fifteen seconds without any explanation. That was easy. The plot focuses solely on action, but great action movies have stronger plots than this movie has. Plot is essential, and one will find strong plots in such movies as Timecop and Bloodsport: these films have story lines to them that evince stark fluidity and lucidity. Overall, the action sequences were strong, and the movie does make for good entertainment. Matt Damon and Franka Potente have great chemistry and I hope to see them in a film again. , and the movie does make for good entertainment.

","*Possible Unimportant Spoilers*<br/><br/>In this summer of the ""Good Will Hunting"" boys becoming spies, Matt Damon's venture here as Jason Bourne is far superior to Ben Affleck's turn as Jack Ryan in ""The Sum of all Fears"". Damon even compares favorably to the last few James Bonds (although this could be due to the Bond ""formula"" getting tired).<br/><br/>Damon is a different kind of spy. Not since Connery has Bond been as dangerous as Jason Bourne. He is made all the more dangerous by the fact that he has amnesia. He doesn't know how or why he knows how to do martial arts or how to assess possible escape routes when entering a new place, he just ""does it"" like reading or writing.<br/><br/>And it's this ""unknown"" element which makes ""The Bourne Identity"" so intriguing. How do we even know we should be on Bourne's side? We know as little about him for the first part of the movie as he does, and yet there we are watching him on as he thrashes two Parisian policemen in a park or tears through a U.S. embassy. Should we be hoping he escapes or gets captured? I guess for the sake of entertainment we want him to escape or else it would be a rather short movie.<br/><br/>The supporting players don't particularly shine or stand out here. Chris Cooper makes a decent adversary for Bourne, although it would have been more satisfying to see a bigger ""name"" actor in this part. Franka Potente is simply there as an ally/love interest for Damon, her part could have been played by just about anyone. Julia Stiles is Julia Stiles, unlikable as always. She's only on screen for about 10 minutes total (thankfully), and Cooper's character seems as dismissive of her character as I am of her as an actress.<br/><br/>Let me stop being negative though because I did very much enjoy this film. The fight scenes are well done, if short (save for one lengthy, brutal encounter in Bourne's apartment) and there is a fantastic car chase. The movie takes place almost entirely in Paris which, of course, makes for some beautiful shots of the city. I may be the only one that says this, but I think ""The Bourne Identity"" stands up rather well when compared to this summer's other big man-on-the-run picture, ""Minority Report"". Both received 7's out of 10 from me."

"brizl47","8","0","1","24 June 2002"," A cool thriller
","So, a man is picked up at sea with two bullet holes in his back and a laser chip in his hip.  Quite a premise and one that Robert Ludlum took to three books in the 80's.  Ludlum's character Jason Bourne comes alive in this well directed and excitingly acted film. The story and action are updated for the current time, but remain true to their original intent.<br/><br/>While this is an action film and there is a villain (the inimitable Chris Cooper of ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Lone Star"" to name a few), the real conflict resides in the character of Bourne himself.  He has no memory, but knows how to do all sorts of cool and scary things.  He can recite the license plate numbers of the six cars outside the diner, and he can also use a gun and his body as lethal weapons.  In the skilled hands of Damon, Jason Bourne takes on a vulnerability that is appealing and confusing when set against his obvious talent for murder.<br/><br/>When he inadvertently hooks up with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), the story twists and turns to its inevitable conclusion.  No one ever accused Ludlum of being the great American novelist, but his stories are packed with suspense (the audience jumped in unison about three times yesterday), and are clever and fun.<br/><br/>Doug Liman uses Paris beautifully - making that great City a part of the story.  The cinematography is wonderful in bringing us into the hushed halls of Swiss banking to  a farmhouse in the countryside with the same loving care.  The camera wobbles and dives and gives the viewer an unsettled feeling -- not unlike that which Bourne himself must be feeling.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie and think there will be sequels, since Bourne is a complicated protagonist and we still want to find out what the heck Treadstone is!"

"NashvilleNeckrub","9","0","1","23 June 2002"," Solid.
","The one thing I could say about this movie that would sum up exactly why I think this movie ranks with ""The Ipcress File"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" as a stellar example of the spy genre: It was made for grown-ups.<br/><br/>
Granted, it's got some great action scenes. It's got a subtle but definably techno soundtrack. And it stars two young faces ready for the top story on ""Entertainment Tonight"". But it also has a brain. It has an economy of style that has rarely been seen in a mainstream thriller since the 70's. And it has a director that does not treat his audience like five-year-olds, reading them a story to shut them up so that he can get back to the other adults.<br/><br/>
This isn't an epic. You are not going to be shocked by logic-bending twists and turns. You are going to see a sophisticated story, well told, excitingly staged, and convincingly realized by its' cast. There are no cavernous sets - this takes place in the real world, or at least an excellent reproduction of it. The CIA office is not a pristine, sterilized environment where higher-ups glare at a Jumbotron with the world map on it and slam their fists on multi-million dollar control panels. They work out of a cramped office with two-year-old computers, paper maps, and wood-grain panelling on the walls. They do mot have the time nor the inclination to renovate.<br/><br/>
Doug Liman does the entire production an incredible service by treating his characters like real people. Their reactions make sense. Their dialogue comes out naturally. There is chemistry between the leads, because it is allowed to happen, and is not forced. Franka Potente and Matt Damon both bring an incredible presence to this movie - you want to see what they'll do next, even if you may be able to predict it - you still want to see them do it. Chris Cooper and Clive Owen (in a disappointingly small role) also keep their ends up.<br/><br/>
And the action. Oh, man. These scenes are brilliantly shot and tightly edited - Doug Liman throws you right into the middle of deft hand-to-hand combat, Parisian car chases, and beautifully choreographed gunplay. These scenes alone are enough to recommend this movie.<br/><br/>
I'm in my mid-twenties - I am very used to having movies targeted to my demographic. Most of the time, filmmakers are willing to do anything to get asses in seats - pounding, up-to-the minute rock soundtrack, transparent comic relief, T&A. It's not that I'm offended by these things - they have been known to turn out decent movies using this criteria. But it's nice, every once in a while, to have a movie that doesn't meet me halfway. It makes me feel like they trust me.<br/><br/>9/10"

"Chris Knipp","Null","0","1","25 June 2002"," The Bourne Identity is good dirty fun; it's not mindless, either
","A certain well-known American movie critic has said `Bourne Identity,' Doug Liman's entry in the big budget spy film world, is `unnecessary.' `Unnecessary'?  I think it's very necessary to have a good crisply made action movie with cool romantic locations, a tough, inscrutable hero, a durable female sidekick, and a bang-up conclusion.  We need good entertainment that pretends to be no more.  What a relief `Bourne Identity' is after the laborious disappointments of `Minority Report'!<br/><br/>Bear in mind, though, that the same thing has been done before in a TV miniseries version of Robert Ludlum's 1980 novel made in 1988 and starring Richard Chamberlain.  And bear in mind that the novel is 22 years old. And the depiction of the CIA as invincible and potently evil is laughable post-9/11.<br/><br/>I guess you have to go back a while to find fun these days.<br/><br/>Matt Damon comes through beautifully in this movie.  He has a tautness and an edge of insecurity that are more than skin deep and the physicality to do his own stunts. He wasn't quite right to play Tom Ripley, but that wasn't his fault.  Here stripped of identity he does fine. I tend to think of him as best cast as a bellhop, but he's earned a second chance. There's a chemistry between him and Franka Potente that isn't hurt at all by Bourne's coolness toward Marie.  Chris Cooper as the CIA headman is a stereotype but Brian Cox as his boss has a sphinxlike vulnerability Â– it helped a lot that I knew him best as the charming creep in `L.I.E.'  All the bit parts are well played here.  The CIA sequences are overblown and silly, but they keep the energy and excitement high, and their occasional shrillness is counteracted by the intimacy and edge of fear in all Damon's scenes with Potente. I love the minimalist dialogue between Jason and Marie. The Stoic ideal is not dead.<br/><br/>As many car chases as we've seen in our lives, this one through Paris in an Austin Mini-Cooper beats all for clarity, neatness, and speed.  The choice of the tiny but ultra-maneuverable British car was brilliant because this is a vehicle that really can get between the cracks.  Here as elsewhere the humor is subtle and not broadcast in our faces.<br/><br/>I wish Liman had stopped jiggling his camera so much.  Even when Marie's reading a paper, the camera shakes like a man with palsy.  So her French sucks; she isn't 85.  But these quibbles subside as the action surges forward.<br/><br/>Is this a meaningless story? Hardly.  The mystery of identity is one of the eternal questions of philosophy.  Here it's just played for fun, but it still can make you think.  According to the old Latin rule dulce et utile, the sweetness makes it useful, i.e., this movie instructs while it delights."

","I saw ""The Bourne Identity"" the second week after it opened, and I have to say I was really surprised by how good it was. It was more realistic than other movies of this type, and I like that it didn't go nuts with the violence and explosions. This movie proves that you can make a compelling and thrilling action movie without excessive use of pyrotechnics. Matt Damon (Who really looked like he could have been through Military training) gave a great and believable performance, as did Franka Potente (So much better for the part than a Denise Richards or Halle Berry say), Chris Cooper and that guy who played the sniper (Whom by the way, like Liev Schreiber in ""Sum of all Fears"", is an interesting enough character by themselves that you almost want to see an entire movie about their past adventures). I think the makers of the next James Bond and Mission Impossible should look at this movie and take notes. And no you don't need to have helicopters with giant saw blades, explosive bubble gum, goofy gadget inventors, or nuclear bombs with the nicely exposed wiring and red LED readouts that will be diffused at 00:00:01 to have an exciting action/spy movie.

","The Bourne Identity starts out promisingly.  Its premise, that a secret agent/assassin has amnesia and is being hunted by his former employers, is good if unoriginal.  The setup to the movie promises a lot more than the actual film delivers.  Despite some entertaining action sequences, the movie falls flat on its amnesiac head.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does decently well in his action hero role though he does smarmy and sarcastic a lot better than cool and calculating.  Franka Potente is the only real acting bright spot in this film.  Her character seems to have some depth and you get the sense that both her decision to stay with Bourne and her later decision to leave involved genuine inner conflict.  In the one quasi-love scene, she provides all of the sexual spark in her seduction of Bourne, who midway through the brief scene seems finally to recall what sex is.  Julia Stiles' agent should be fired for allowing her to play this bit part with no real connection to the story.  She has one line that begs for some kind of dramatic flair.  Instead of delivering her line in the manner of a scared communications agent about potentially to be killed by a rogue agent, she asks ""It's Bourne, isn't it?"" as though he were dropping by for tea.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is not the acting.  It's the script, which spares the viewer the inconvenience of tidying up its loose ends. It introduces the plot as good action-thrillers generally do, that is, with snippets of important characters in already developed situations and vague hints that their interrelationship will eventually explain the genesis of and real issues involved in those situations.  But we are never really given any idea why the characters want the things that they want.  We know that there is a deposed leader making trouble for the CIA; we hear of an expensive agent-training program; there are headaches.  But we never get any well-developed sense of how they connect.  The list of plot problems/holes is endless.<br/><br/>The ending is thoroughly disappointing.  The explanation of Bourne's amnesia is almost silly and absurdly foreshadowed earlier in the film.  The gun battle at the end is boring.  I did learn something though.  Apparently, if you get on top of a dead guy, you can plummet anywhere from seven to ten stories without incurring much in the way of injury. The end of this film is unique in the action-thriller genre precisely where you would want it to conform.  There is no real Woo-style action grand finale."

Not even able to remember his own name, he is further shocked by the two bullet wounds on his back, by his ""sudden"" ability to speak numerous languages, and by his Swiss safe deposit box, where he hides a gun, several fake passports, and stacks of money from multiple nations. The subject of an aggressive international manhunt, the young man is widely persecuted, yet his instincts soon reveal physical, combative abilities that repeatedly secure his escape. Constantly on the run, a chance encounter with Marie (Franka Potente from Run Lola Run) proves troublesome as she compulsively decides not to leave the fugitive's side.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity tries to create suspense by assigning its character the difficult mission of piecing together evidence that may reveal his true identity and bring back his memory, while simultaneously establishing the convenience of being assumed dead by his enemies. However, when dangerous enemies discover Jason Bourne is alive and launch their searches, the plot degenerates into a series of persecution scenes that sacrifice further character development in favor of thrill-seeking action. In this manner, the film's most valuable players --""Ted Conklin"" and ""The Professor"" find no truly meaningful place in the film. (The most extreme case of lack of character development, however, is seen in Julia Stiles' ""Nicolette"", whose role as Conklin's secretary is limited to functions that are inconsequential to plot, such as answering phones and taking notes. What a waste) Yet The Bourne Identity's greatest flaw results from the film's ambition to exploit its main character's extraordinary physical abilities (to escape danger), as it inappropriately assigns almost ""superhero"" attributes and produces unintended, awkward comedic effects. All in all, although The Bourne Identity does establish an extraordinary problem (amnesia) for its extraordinary hero (a secret, government agent), the film fails to explore more intriguing narrative possibilities regarding the psychological effects of its character's identity crisis."

Matt plays Jason Bourne, a man who can't remember who he is yet he has all these terrific fighting skills.  The fighting scenes in this movie rivaled those Gladiators and Them!  I was very impressed.  Has Matt Damon been practicing to take over the aging Peirce Brosnan??  The girlfriend he has is great (run lola run).  Also, the chief is really convinving as the man who wants to get Matt Damon.  He's played be Col. Fritz of American Beauty.  All in all, a good movie.  Don't try to figure it out too soon...and don't expect to have a few questions answered...just sit back and watch Matt Damon deliver the goods as he has in every movie he has been in so far!!"

","The Bourne Identity has things going for it as far as direction goes, acting, and even some action sequences, but the problem with the film in a closer inspection is that it has all really been done before.  You've got the assassin on the run from his former employees and he tags along with a woman whom he just met.<br/><br/>Only twist here is that the assassin (Matt Damon) has amnesia and cannot remember who he is.  That's the most original thing about the movie, and it gets its entertainment from there, but the movie has the incredible cliches that come with a movie that does not have the amnesia twist in the story line.  When it gets to the end, the movie seriously goes on auto-pilot ""Airplane!"" style.<br/><br/>I liked the performances.  It's always nice to see Chris Cooper play the antagonist, and Franke Potente is cool as always, but what is with Julia Stiles?  I didn't even know she was in this movie, and I can see why.  She doesn't do anything.  She answers and transfers some calls.  That's it.<br/><br/>Matt Damon proves to be a good action hero here, but something a little more original would do better justice.  Even director Doug Limon proves he can handle the genre well, but this hardly does for action films what ""Swingers"" did for relationship comedy.<br/><br/>Do I recommend ""The Bourne Identity""?  On its entertainment factor, yes.  I wasn't bored while watching it, so it's a good cheap seat movie, or if you've seen everything else.  Other than that, go see the brilliant ""Changing Lanes"" again."
