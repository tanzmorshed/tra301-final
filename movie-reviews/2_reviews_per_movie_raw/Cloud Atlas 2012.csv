","There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.<br/><br/>It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts. <br/><br/>It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen."

","""Cloud Atlas"" is nearly three hours in length, but I wasn't bored for a minute. The film alternates between six very different stories quite seamlessly, creating an exhilarating experience. It's part sci-fi, part historical drama, part love story, part comedy. Any number of things could have gone wrong with the film. All the different genres it brings together might have failed to coherently mesh. But they did, and it's something to see.<br/><br/>The film takes us on shipboard in the 1800s, where a young man forms an unlikely bond with a stowaway, a runaway slave. It tells the sensitive, melancholy story of a promising young composer in the 1930s – separated by prejudice and misfortune from his lover, a man named Sixsmith. It also brings us to 1973, where an intrepid reporter finds herself caught up in a web of murder and intrigue. In the present day, the film offers up the comedic tale of a publisher on the run from a gang of thugs. Plunging into the future, it shows a dystopian vision of Seoul, South Korea that is comparable to ""Blade Runner"" and a primitive post-apocalyptic Hawaii.<br/><br/>Linking these stories together are the simple thematic elements of love, compassion, and a love for liberty. The correspondence between the composer Robert Frobisher and Sixsmith depicts the plain beauty of love as well as any film I have seen, as do tender moments between the central characters of the portion of the film set in the futuristic New Seoul. Even in the blatantly comic segment with Jim Broadbent as the publisher, a deep passion for freedom and human dignity shines through.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job in their multiple roles. You can care for Tom Hanks one moment as a villager in a future Hawaii, and then revile him in the next scene where he plays a truly despicable doctor. The best performances are given, however, by Doona Bae and Jim Broadbent. I think they surpass all the rest. Bae plays a ""fabricant"", a kind of clone designed to serve humanity. Her gradual awakening to her own self-worth, to the subjugation of herself and of her people, is beautifully and movingly conveyed. She is heartbreaking in this role. Broadbent is equally excellent as the publisher Cavendish. His expressive face and popping eyes are ideal for comedy – and he's hilarious. But he's more than that. Broadbent infuses the character with a sense of sorrow and weariness at key moments. Cavendish has depth, a history, regrets from his past. Broadbent brings all this out brilliantly without losing his comic touch.<br/><br/>Everything in ""Cloud Atlas"" comes together to create a film I found thought-provoking and highly entertaining. I don't hesitate to recommend it."

","Kudos to all the filmmakers for adapting this famously ""unfilmable"" novel in such an inventive way. There are SIX separate timelines that switch after every scene, but instead of the plot, the narrative continuity follows the theme of the film. Once you clue in to that overall theme, it is no longer confusing when the story jumps from a runaway slave in the 1800s to a post apocalyptic future battle between some of the last humans remaining on earth.<br/><br/>All this audacious style and structure makes Cloud Atlas a curiosity to say the least, but the film is lifted to the realm of ""Masterpiece"" by the all-star ensemble cast. This impressive collection of actors fires off amazing performances like the Expendables 2 fires off high caliber bullets. I mean this will long be considered one of the greatest acting clinics ever filmed, and a high point in some already outstanding careers, as the end credits alone are astonishing to watch.<br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that transcends the simple elements of stars and plots and special effects, and boldly assumes to take the cinema to another level of storytelling, much like Avatar took film to a new level of technology a few years ago. The ambition, the technical brilliance and the passion that was put into this film makes it one of the great epics of our time."
"LetwitJr","8","527","730","17 September 2012"," A powerful adaptation to a beautiful novel
","I was lucky enough to get last-minute tickets for this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre was packed and we were thrilled to see it although we did not entirely know what to expect. I had read a part of the book but never found time to finish it.<br/><br/>The very opening of the film is mesmerizing and sets pace for all that is to follow. Six stories are intertwined to create one magical ride through time and space, as all stories move forward as one. To those who haven't read the book, I expect you might find the movie confusing at first. It seems unclear at the beginning (and for most of the first hour and a half at least) what all these characters have to do with one another. The end ties it up quite well, but for a three hour film, you might find you've spent a bit too long grasping at straws. Just let it go and enjoy what's before you; It will all come together in the end.<br/><br/>An important aspect of the film is that actors play different characters throughout the film, finding themselves in different stories and eras. Often it works. The futuristic plot with Jim Sturgess is one I particularly enjoy. But sometimes, it feels like they're incorporated just a tad bit much. Tom Hanks' role in the editor's story seemed huge and important and first but it seemed we were supposed to forget about it. As I walked out of the theatre, I felt I had seen not only Cloud Atlas as a whole but a series of other films as well. <br/><br/>I think maybe for a film such as this one, actors who weren't as known would have been better. It may have been easier to believe in all their different characters and forget who they were. But as far as their performances went, well they were great. Tom Hanks shines from the opening sequence to the very end. Halle Berry was adequate for the journalist and Hugh Grant... actually it seems he's playing himself in this one too. But the true star as always is Hugo Weaving. He steals the screen whenever he appears and is mesmerizing both as the devil or a regular assassin. <br/><br/>The costumes and make up went from absolutely stunning (it may take you a few minutes to recognize actors sometimes) to somewhat distracting. Changing the race and age of an actor has got to be challenging but it's still hard to forget who they are. I expect the film will get an Oscar for this however, as I don't think anyone will beat them in this category before winter comes. The score was also incredibly powerful and beautiful and helped set the tone for the movie greatly.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas will take you anywhere and everywhere. It may surprise you by its sudden burst of violence, sometimes exaggerated and almost funny, sometimes cold and raw. You might cry at times, as the characters make choices and sacrifices. One story is particularly funny and had the theatre laughing quite often. <br/><br/>All in all, Cloud Atlas is no ordinary film. It's a voyage that will take you to places you didn't expect. Don't try to understand it, just let yourself go and you'll find you understood what it was all about. If you're looking for a linear plot, then this film isn't for you. But if you want to experience something different, then by all means, buy a ticket for Cloud Atlas when it comes out. I know I'll be seeing it again."

","I didn't find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly the best thing the Wachowskis have ever done. I'm not sure how the directing duties were distributed, so I'll uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons there, but I don't often leave a film adaptation wanting to read the novel afterwards, as I did after seeing this.<br/><br/>Visually stunning, epic in scope, a strong score; the sort of film that you're constantly amazed was ever made and happy it was. Equal parts comedy, romance, thriller, and dystopian speculative fiction, it really is an astounding mix of disparate elements. <br/><br/>The biggest overall failure was definitely some of the make-up effects - trying to turn Doona Bae into a believable red-headed Caucasian woman was simply distracting - but the overall art & sound design was incredible.<br/><br/>If I could turn channels while watching TV and switch between stories and narratives as seamlessly and as deftly as the editing in Cloud Atlas, it would honestly be hard to go back to simply watching one show at a time.<br/><br/>Truly a marvel of multitasking on so many levels. Great stuff."

","The last time I felt like this after seeing a movie was when I saw ""Inception"" on opening night. I realized I was seeming something that was different, creative, and classic.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is an amazing piece of film. Even the harshest of critics cannot say that this film is not ambitious. But I think that 99% of the people that see this film will appreciate it. I'm NOT one who tends to like films that are overly ""artistic"" (I hated ""Tree of Life"", for example). But while the overall message of the film is hard to put into words, it is easy to understand. The film is very watchable, and the nearly 3 hour length seems to fly by. The stories are sharply written, and for those who are afraid of getting ""lost"" while viewing, no worries ... you'll enjoy seeing clues that link the stories, but even if you miss the clues you still will see a story that is well explained and easier to consume than an experimental art film.<br/><br/>I am absolutely shocked that the reviews from the ""experts"" have not been more favorable, and the lack of box office sales is a crime. Please go see this movie - if you can see one film this year, this is the one!"

","Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging, difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically dense it wants to tell you something through plot, characters, dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film, much longer and denser than much of what is available today. ""Ambition"" defines this film. <br/><br/>In just under 3 hours, six radically different stories are told, and they appeal to a broad audience: a 19th century tale of unlikely brotherhood, the letters of a gay composer to his partner in the 1930's, a San Francisco- set conspiracy in the 70's, A hilarious account of an old publisher's woes. A Blade Runner-esque clone's struggle for freedom, and the survival of a tribe after 'The Fall'. Genre conventions are toppled, as these stories with different tones are juggled in short intervals, leading from comedic highs to shocking drama in minutes.<br/><br/>But as with the characters, these plots are connected thematically, and clever wordplay and visual imagery links the stories, such as the end of a monologue referencing ""the gates of Hell"" and cutting to a shot of the gates of a building that, for Cavendish at least, is the gates of Hell. Each of the stories has strengths, a few have faults, but together the medley is incredible. <br/><br/>I found that while the earliest two stories began slowly and plainly, they developed very well and provided fantastic drama, especially the 1849 story. The Nuclear thriller was strong, Halle Berry is great and there are some real twists, and I also loved the 'Dirty Harry' and 'China Syndrome' vibes, but comedy bled into it from the 2012 story which diminished the climax. The 2012 story is hilarious, and its first scene is a standout; Tom Hanks is incredible as Dermot Hoggins. Although while the story is interesting, it doesn't fit quite so well thematically- it's almost too light. Listening to the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet' fits with all the stories, but can't resonate with Cavendish's. The future Korea is visually stunning and communicates its themes well, certainly the darkest plot, but the action can get over the top (Yes, I know who directed this) and there are some horrible clichés. But that scene of horrendous dialogue, the weakest in the film, can't derail a great piece. Lastly is the bleak, Hawaii- set post-apocalyptic story. It was my favourite, possibly because I'm a sucker for anything involving apocalypse. But Hanks and Berry are fantastic again, the barbarians are menacing and scary, and the story is cool. It also concludes the film perfectly.<br/><br/>I've only talked about the plot! The actors really steal the show. In the credits, each actor's name is placed with a clip of every one of their characters everyone in the theatre stopped and stayed. People play characters you had no idea they played. A few highlights: Sturgess' lawyer and the slave Autua, Frobisher, Hugh Grant's sexist nuclear boss, Cavendish and Hanks' Hoggins. Doona Bae as Somni and Hugo Weaving's ""Old Georgie"" round it out- the latter is truly a demon. Much credit has to go to the makeup, literally making actors disappear into their roles. There is a huge number of transsexual and even race-bridging roles- it's worthy of note that Lana Wachowski was at one point Larry Wachowski. Also deserving of praise, and possibly Oscars is the large scale visual effects that cover hundreds of years and look so believable. Sound quality is top-notch as well, listening to Old Georgie is chilling, as is the vision of Korean diners, and well... the whole future.<br/><br/>But all this plot serves a purpose, and Cloud Atlas intends to tell you things. Freedom is possibly the biggest theme, as well as the idea that our actions affect others greatly throughout time: we're part of a large human network. Really though there's so much to talk about you should just see the film. There are small stumbles every so often, but the structure hides them very well. No one story takes more time than others, no one character takes more time than others, and the structure and pacing drives the film forward briskly. It's a shame this film hasn't been better received commercially, because it's a phenomenal achievement, interesting sci-fi and drama, and as of now, the best film I've seen in 2012. 8.8/10"
"angry_foamy","9","325","499","18 October 2012"," Quite the Epic
","My wife and I were able to see an advanced showing of Cloud Atlas last night at The Chicago International Film Festival. I will say that I was thrilled to see this movie from the moment I saw the initial trailer release. I am a huge fan of movies that are epic in nature and are rather daring by taking on the task of time lines that may span a millennia.<br/><br/>I will not provide any spoilers but I will say that the film is truly grand in scope and as you may have deduced from the trailer, the film time span passes through hundreds of years and includes many characters and story lines that are interwoven or overlap.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about the performances in the film. From top to bottom, everyone displays amazing performances. Hugo Weaving obviously is a show stopper in several scenes. The make-up and costume design will throw even the seasoned film-goer off as the transitions made by these characters are nothing short of spectacular. I cannot see another film coming close to being in the same category for the Oscar in Costume and Make-Up.<br/><br/>The visuals and the score of the movie were the biggest takeaways for me. There were moments that reminded me of Blade Runner mixed with Out of Africa. There are a large number of stories within the film, some large and some small, but many strong enough to be individual films themselves. That being said with the long running time of the film, almost 3 hours, coupled with the multitude of story lines and the very numerous edits, the film can be a daunting task for even a seasoned viewer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fighting to pay close attention to every detail to the first hour of the film to understand what was happening. The first 10 minutes alone caused me some confusion.<br/><br/>This film will not be for everyone due to its complexity and length, but for those who are true fans of films this epic in nature will truly appreciate the film. I very much look forward to another viewing of the film and encourage everyone to see the film at least once.<br/><br/>Cheers"
"MediaboyMusings","8","282","444","25 September 2012"," Daring and quite impressive
","""Impressive"". That's the best description I could come up with after being asked by my brother and sister-in-law about my thoughts on Cloud Atlas immediately following the film's second-ever public screening we'd just attended. Not a very incisive assessment, I'll grant you, but my head was still spinning as I tried to make sense of what I'd just witnessed over the film's jam-packed two hour and forty three minute running time. This may be one the most ambitious and epic films I've ever seen, demanding rapt attention from viewers as they're taken on an odyssey that spans the globe over 500 years and hopscotches between numerous interwoven story lines that incorporates just about every film genre available, featuring actors playing several different roles each. Cloud Atlas is based on British author David Mitchell's best-selling 2004 novel and was a huge challenge for the filmmakers to adapt and finance (its estimated budget of over $100 million also makes it the most expensive independent film ever made). The architects of this beautifully twisted madness are directors/writers/producers Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) and The Matrix's Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (Lana was Larry until a gender transition that was completed about five years ago). The Wachowskis, notoriously press shy, were surprisingly on hand (along with Tykwer) to introduce the film's second screening the morning after its star-studded TIFF world premiere on September 8th at the Princess of Wales Theatre. <br/><br/>A movie this expansive should have a massive cast, considering how many characters appear - not so in this case, though. Principle actors Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and Xun Zhou each take on multiple roles that plays loose and fast with the actors' ages, races, and genders (Susan Sarandon, Keith David, James D'Arcy, and Doona Bae also have smaller roles). Having so many dimensions to explore with all of their characters must have been acting nirvana for this lot. For the most part, they pull off the various requirements of the roles, many of which require a significant amount of prosthetics and makeup. Several of the roles were so well disguised that I was completely clueless that a certain actor had played the role until the end credits visually made some of the big reveals (learning that Berry played the white Victorian housewife and Grant a war paint-layered native completely floored me). Sticking around until the end is an absolute necessity for Cloud Atlas - the oohs and ahhs from the sold-out audience as they discovered who actually played some of the parts was a wonderfully unique filmgoing experience for me. For all of the positive aspects that the race bending and gender bending idea brings to the film, there is the faint whiff of novelty attached to it. Things do get a little silly when you have Weaving seemingly playing an Asian character whose makeup produces more of a Vulcan look (which may have been intentional, as it's for a sci-fi sequence that takes place somewhere in the 2300s), as well as in full drag playing a Nurse Ratched-like character. The latter obviously has parallels to Lana Wachowski's own life and although the nurse character provides some decent laughs, I was a little hung up on how it seemed one of the character's main functions was to generate laughs purely based on the surreal sight of Weaving playing one truly ugly looking woman. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. <br/><br/>Weaving does provide one of Cloud Atlas' most memorable roles, as the seriously creepy Old Georgie, who terrorizes one of Hanks' many characters. Hanks does some of the best work I've ever seen from him, playing four different characters that range from an unscrupulous doctor in the 1800s to going far against type with maybe the film's standout character, a modern-day thuggish British writer named Dermot Hoggins who gets the ultimate revenge on a critic for a bad review. Berry is excellent with her predominant roles playing an ambitious reporter in 1970s San Francisco and a political figurehead (from what I could grasp) aligned with one of Hanks' characters in the far future, in one of the film's few story lines that doesn't quite work. Also great is Broadbent as both a composer and playing a man tricked into living in a retirement home, who provides the film's best comic relief. <br/><br/>The weighty Cloud Atlas principle themes of philosophy, reincarnation, oppression, and destiny, along with the film's highly challenging pace and complex non-linear storytelling construct will overwhelm many - that's okay, however. I was lost a number of times - not Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy-level lost, mind you, but definitely out of sync with what was happening on screen. This is the type of daring film that demands multiple viewings to completely grasp the filmmakers' grand scope and there's nothing wrong with a little audaciousness from Hollywood once in a while. Even with a big-name cast, it'll be very interesting to see how the otherwise difficult-to-market Cloud Atlas will fare at the box office come late October."

","Cloud Atlas may seem odd upon first glance, having the same actors/actresses play different characters but when I watched the trailer, I was intrigued. And then when it finally came onto Netflix, I ignored the mixed reviews and watched anyways.<br/><br/>I. Loved. This. Movie.<br/><br/>When this film ended, I had a smile on my face. People were complaining that the story was really hard to follow while for me, I found it kinda straightforward and easy to understand. This is six films wrapped into 1; A racial drama (1849) about the bond between a Black Stowaway (David Gyasi) and a Young Lawyer (Jim Sturgess), Another drama between a Gay Composer (Ben Whishaw) and a Greedy man (Jim Broadbent) who demands all the credit to himself for the piece that they have written together (1938), A Noir-Mystery about a reporter (Halle Berry) getting caught up in an Oil scandal (1973), A comedy-escape story about a writer (Jim Broadbent) being tricked into admitting himself into a nursing home run by a cruel nurse (Hugo Weaving) (2012), A Sci-Fi story about an Fabricant/android (Doona Bae), who is convinced to broadcast a manifesto by a rebel (Jim Sturgess), and a Post-Apocalyptic story about a tribesman (Tom Hanks) who helps a member (Halle Berry) of an advanced society reach a communication station to send an SOS to off-world humans. The acting was great and there are so many good actors/actresses in the movie that I can't mention them all. To make matters even crazier, they use the same actors/actresses in each timeline which was weird yet felt really cool, considerong this was a movie about decisions impacting the future. The makeup is so perfect that I didn't notice the other actors/actresses in their roles at one time. Visuals and Sound are great for a movie with a budget that is smaller than Alita: Battle Angel and the music is perfect for each story. And finally, the main message is very positive while the ending felt kind of uplifting. In short, this is one of the best movies I have seen if not, of all time.<br/><br/>Is it worth a watch? YES. Ignore the reviews and watch the movie and you won't be disappointed by this epic tale. 10/10"
"bshears99","8","260","424","10 September 2012"," A bold, audacious tour-de-force in cinematic storytelling
","This movie is a fusion of several genres (drama, adventure, sci-fi, comedy, romantic tragedy) as well as an attempt for an art-house cerebral movie to attain commercial blockbuster status. In my opinion it mostly succeeds, but finding a large mainstream audience is its biggest challenge to be met (at this point, before wide release).<br/><br/>Imagine taking six short (but big-budget) films with different stories and directors and combining them into an anthology feature, united by a common theme and cast of actors in different roles, and then editing the entire thing out of sequence. The ""nested"" narrative of the book has been re-arranged for the sake of the visual medium of film, and after first being introduced to the 6 worlds, it's not that hard to keep track of who's who, what's what and where & when. Frankly, it's a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for Best Editing - it works very well considering the challenge of making it flow coherently. <br/><br/>The cinematography, set & art design, music score and performances range from good to great. The make-up in some cases created a distraction (a Korean woman transformed into a red-haired Caucasian; Hugo Weaving as a buxom female nurse) but it adds a bit of fun to the experience. There's a smörgåsbord of material here for most people: human drama, mystery, violence, sex, adventure, farcical comedy, gloomy sci-fi and occasional romance (both gay and straight). It's 6 movies for the price of one! Just be ready to spend almost 3 hours in your seat and suffer a bit of whiplash as the transitions can get frenetic at times, with multiple cliff-hangers happening simultaneously. Like a good roller-coaster, it has its lulls and rushes. Some might find the finale a bit conventional, sappy or anti-climactic. But there's no denying this is a big, expensive gamble on the part of the Wachowskis and their producers. Hopefully it'll achieve the kind of success they got with the first ""Matrix"" and not the fate of the abysmal ""Speed Racer."" (PS I saw the film at its world premiere at TIFF.)"
"DragoonKain","6","28","40","18 May 2013"," A Potentially Great Film Ruined By Poor Structure
","I never read the book, but was intrigued by this movie because I had heard the book was very good. I don't have as much time to read as I used to, so I watched it, sort of liked it but found it kind of tedious to get through due to all the jumping around from story to story. Seeing the different actors as different characters was more distracting than anything, and the film was paced too quickly allow the average viewer to pick up all the complexities and themes the author was likely trying to convey.<br/><br/>In the end, I found that it had a couple of good and original story- lines (particularly the Escape from the Nursing home plot, and the gay composer plot was good) but I found the other stories to be of the mostly bland and formulaic sort we've seen many times before (ie. guy finds out slavery is bad, investigative reporter uncovers a plot by an evil corporation, bladerunner/soilent green hybrid plot, and a fairly standard post-apocalyptic adventure story plot). While all of the story lines were entertaining, you never have enough time to become invested in each story or characters because the movie constantly jumped around between the six different plots. Yes, there are six different plots in this two and half hour movie, and therein lies there problem.<br/><br/>After having watched the movie, I looked up the plot of the book because I was curious to see how the author handled the story. According to Wikipedia, In the book:<br/><br/>""Each tale is revealed to be a story that is read (or observed) by the main character in the next. The first five stories are interrupted at a key moment. After the sixth story, the other five stories are returned to and closed, in reverse chronological order, and each ends with the main character reading or observing the chronologically previous work in the chain. Eventually, readers end where they started, with Adam Ewing in the nineteenth century South Pacific. Each story contains a document, movie or tradition that also appears in a previous story. It shows how history not only repeats itself, but also connects to people in all time periods and places.""<br/><br/>For the life of me, I can't figure out why the directors didn't structure the movie this way. It would have worked far better. The audience would have been able to become more immersed in each story- line, and the connections between each plot would have been more apparent. As it stands, upon one viewing, it seems more like a mess that tries too hard to be clever. So then you might say ""you have to watch it more than once to 'get it'"". I don't want to have to watch a film more than once ""get it"". I paid close attention the first time. I'd rather spend my time doing something other than watching an average movie more than once. It's a sign of poor story telling if you make it so that you have to watch a film more than once in order to ""get it"".<br/><br/>This film could have been so much better if it was structured like the book and took its time to actually tell the stories and develop the characters. Instead it was paced like an action movie. I felt like I was watching Inception at times (another annoying film that you ""had to watch more than once in order to 'get it'""). Perhaps it was structured this way due to a limited running time. But why even attempt to merge six completely different stories into a single movie in the first place? It would lend itself much better to a mini-series. Game of Thrones is the perfect example of a book adaptation that proved to be an immense success when told at a television show's pace. I feel like this movie would have benefited greatly if it was separated episodically like that.<br/><br/>Before you respond to this with elitist statements like: ""I got it first watch, you're just too dumb to understand catch all the intricacies,"" or ""the average viewer is a moron, that's why they need all the themes and messages spoon fed to them. This film treats the audience like it has intelligence and allows to viewer to draw their own conclusions."" I just want to pre-emptively say ""no you're wrong"". The reason I think this film was a disappointment was precisely because it treated the audience like morons who just wanted to see fast paced action with no deep exploration of the themes or characters. It didn't give the audience a chance to think about any of the themes because it was too busy rapidly jumping between story-lines focusing more on action scenes rather than any sort character development. Supposedly the Tom Hanks soul goes through a whole redemption arc that I never caught because the film never actually focused on it. I haven't even read the book, yet, on first viewing, it felt like none of the major themes of the book were explored with any sort of depth. It's a shame because it seems like the book is a good one worth reading. I'm probably not going to read it now though since the movie spoiled the plots for me.<br/><br/>That being said, I would say this film is worth a redbox rental at least. It has some good acting and some nice cinematography and special effects. It looks very pretty. The action is also quite good, although I wish there was a little less focus on the action, and more of a focus on the philosophical themes and characters."

It tries to have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or other via corporate corruption, musical composition, the slave trade, science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.<br/><br/>The white actors acting as Asian and vice versa are distractingly comical although I understand there is a reason for it.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why it wasn't a box office success and didn't receive any major nominations.<br/><br/>Skip it."
"bethdixon02","1","359","641","2 January 2013"," Disappointed
","Oh Hollywood, thank you for your use of music. It's the lube you use as a courtesy while you attempt to mentally rape me. It's the way you can make the emptiness seem profound. It's the way you make me feel as if I've learned a secret of life while being indoctrinated to the insidiousness of big oil, the heartlessness of corporations, the racism of Christianity, the crushing of the weak by the rich, the need for an anti-Capitalist revolution and the beauty of gay love. Your music is the cherry flavoring of the poison you have once again spoon fed me through my entertainment, a power you abuse without apology. The idea of Cloud Atlas, that people are bound through lifetimes, is one that I'm not sold on. Conversely, the common binding of the same stale ideology through reincarnations of cinema, sold with the power of music, that, you have once again demonstrated.<br/><br/>As much as I wanted to like this film and as much as I had hoped that this film would be creative and inspiring, I just found little of value here. This is just another demonstration of one of thousands of Hollywood propaganda pieces designed to brainwash the masses through your entertainment and push a liberal agenda.<br/><br/>The gist is nothing deeper than the idea of reincarnation and soul mates. There is really nothing new that this film adds to any schools of thought and it contains no idea that you didn't already more comprehensively examine when you were 19 and stoned.<br/><br/>The changing of stories is also nothing new to the movie industry. I've heard people describe the movie as difficult to understand or complex, but it's not. Memento was a pioneer in this realm and uncreative Hollywood types have been milking the technique for all it's worth ever since. Been there, done that. When stories start skipping around like this you should realize it's multi-threaded. At that point pay attention and just go with it and hopefully the director ties everything up well at the end and you don't realize that you've just wasted 3 hours with no payoff. <br/><br/>Multi-threaded stories are pretty common now. It's how Hollywood makes you think with a structure rather than a worthy plot. It's how they create a sense of complexity out of a void and in this scenario makes it next to impossible to care about any of the stories or characters. <br/><br/>The stories were boring, the acting was nothing special at best and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. At one point a gay man kills himself. I really don't know why, nor do I care. I know from the music that the film wanted me to care and to be emotionally invested, but nope, couldn't care less. The guy that committed suicide seemed like a self centered egomaniac douche and if there was any characteristic of him that would make me care about him, I didn't see it. I think the only character that I remotely liked was the escape slave, but perhaps just the idea of escaping made me happy after two hours into this film. <br/><br/>As stated above, the music is fine enough and gives you the sense that you're growing as a person, but when you actually think about it, there is nothing new, ground-breaking, or even particularly interesting going on here. <br/><br/>I really thought that there was a distinct chance as I was watching, that the film would take all the little pieces of crap, stick them together and I would be amazed by the brilliant piece of art that was revealed. Nope! It was just a bunch of crap stuck together. You were expecting some genius ending that unfortunately no one had the talent to produce. Kinda like ""Lost"". With Lost JJ wrote himself into a box he did not have the talent to coherently write himself out of, but at least Lost was interesting along the way.<br/><br/>I read another review that stated that there are a lot of people who are praising this movie because they're afraid that others will think they're stupid for not getting the movie. I think that is very true because I have yet to hear one rational explanation of why this film is not horrible. Here's the bad news, they are stupid. Not because they are so dumb that they don't get it, but because they're so dumb that they don't realize there's nothing there to begin with and they don't possess the mind to question it. I know Tom Hanks is in it. I know Halle Berry is in it. (SPOILER ALERT: I am about to reveal the most mind-blowing aspect of this film.) Tom Hanks and Halle Berry can be in a crap movie! <br/><br/>This film is best watched with subtitles as the clarity of the words is not great in some parts and is obscured by dialects in other parts, including the ebonicy dialect that adds nothing in the post apocalyptic story between Hanks and Berry. Not only did that one particular dialect add nothing, but it subtracted and distracted from the story with how silly it sounded. It honestly reminded me of Jar Jar Binks and nothing good reminds you of Jar Jar Binks!<br/><br/>Personally, I found my mind drifting and contemplating much deeper topics such as how much money you could make if you actually went to Hollywood with the skills to make someone look old rather than plastic. I'm looking at you too Prometheus! Some of the makeup jobs looked quite atrocious.<br/><br/>If you think you might like a film made up of a nougatty center of liberal brainwashing with a coating of stale ideas then by all means see this movie. On the other hand if you can tell the difference between deep sounding music and actual depth, then you'll probably be disappointed too."

","I'm going to buck the trend here and instead of extolling the virtues of this wonderful spiritual journey through time and space, I'm going to call it an undisciplined, self-indulgent, incoherent piece of claptrap.

"bengoldenberg","10","144","249","30 October 2012"," - Spoilers - Attempting to explain Cloud Atlas.
","Before I start – this review is more of a study and thus is, by nature, full of spoilers. I'm worried that people might not appreciate the interconnectedness and message of the film and brush it off. I actually thought I was going to hate it going in, wasn't sure after almost two hours, then I realized I was in love. So I would suggest, if you plan to read on, see the movie first. One critic, Joe Morgenstern, from the Wall Street Journal spouts ""This would-be epic is beautifully photographed, elegantly crafted and adventurously cast. Unfortunately, though, it plays like a gargantuan trailer for a movie still to be made."" Morgenstern obviously did not understand the movie. How can he call something elegantly crafted and then claim it has poor structure ""gargantuan trailer"" in the same breath. Okay whatever, I don't need to diss critics – Cloud Atlas does that in one of the earliest scenes when an outlandish Tom Hanks, playing an lowlife writer who's just published an autobiographical work tosses a critic off of a building. I will say this though. Cloud Atlas is epic. It's more than epic. It's length and pacing are deliberate – you are supposed to be tired when watching it – this is a story that spans generations – if it was an hour and half it would not resonate. The beauty of the filmmaking is that these guys guys and gals get it. Zack Snyder – a talented artist – tried something similar with Sucker Punch, but ultimately failed big time. He focused too much on the visual crap. I loved the story of the girls in the home – but the action stuff was hokey, repetitive and trite. He thought we would eat it up, but the audience has seen it before. Then there's Cloud Atlas, we follow several story-lines ranging from comedy to drama to three days of the condor'esque paranoia, but when it comes to the action, effects, fantasy and hard sci-fi they do it lightly, sprinkling the massive work with seconds here and there. Just enough to leave us satisfied, but little enough to not overwhelm or undermine the complexity of this literature. I'm paraphrasing an incredibly powerful line from the end of the film here: ""You can't make a change you'll just be a single drop in an entire Ocean."" ""What is an Ocean but a countless pool of drops?"" This is the controlling idea for the movie: Can one man make a difference? Cloud Atlas believes so. Follow this single drop and watch how it ripples. Tom Hanks drops the critic off of the roof to his death. The death leads his publisher on a hilarious journey where he is wrongfully placed in a mental institution. The journey leads him to write an autobiographical novel in kind, but as he is a talented writer (obviously one who has been neglecting his talent) writes a good book. The book is turned into a movie where in the future a small clip of the movie incites a revolution which makes a person into a pseudo-Deity. This one bizzar drop – or act led a ripple which caused a revolution hundreds of years in the future. In other words, an single persons actions can have god-like effect. Then comes the theme of art or creating. Hank's character was writer. Cloud Atlas was a musical work. Letters between lovers. A Dairy and a video made by a rebel. A made-for-TV type movie based on a book. Each one of these creations of art pass through time connecting people and inspiring them to create ripples: In other words by creating even, the most insignificant works, people might find inspiration. Hell, I felt like writing this review just from seeing the movie. Maybe my review will lead somebody else to write a song, which will in turn ripples. The concept of re-incarnation. Each actor plays myriad parts over a vast amount of time and space. The argument of good vs. evil is explored here. The Hugo Weaving character is almost always evil in the physical sense – Hugh grant in the sense of conspiracy (Basically if your name starts with Hu – you are a bad guy). Keith David is a rebel. Halle Barry represents curiosity or investigation. These characters are archetypical and live within each of us – the most interesting is Tom Hanks who plays both good and bad characters. In his futuristic storyline – he has a personal devil (Weaving) that tells him to do bad things – but he does not! This is because inside us all we are capable of good or bad, it's the decisions we make that define us. In his future story-line he chooses to be good. Ironically V for Vandetta – also written by the Wachowsky brothers has this similar theme of standing up to the man. An incredibly simple scene sums up the entire film. In the comedic story-line, near the end, the old escapees are in a bar having a beer when the cross dressing Weaving (who made it big as a cross dresser in Pricilla Queen of the Desert) arrives to take them back to the oppressive old age home. The little old man, who barely speaks a word (the little voice) stands up and incites a riot. Just as Halle Barry reveals a report that ends a conspiracy or Doona Bae's viral video that incites an uprising that saves the lives of millions. The message here is a little voice can incite a thousand little voices. One singe drop. One single ripple. One perfect movie. If the message of Cloud Atlas is true then I hope that the creation of this film will inspire a million voices to make a million ripples. I for one am inspired. I will add to this review as I let the ripples spread in my mind. For now that's all I got."
"VKirilova","1","430","781","21 November 2012"," A Pretentious Cliché
","Now... forgive my hateful language but I am still recovering from the ridiculous boredom and anger that I experienced last night. I should start by saying that I spent the night trying to think of something good about this movie. I failed.<br/><br/>This was the most pretentious, most cliché film I have seen in a long long time. This idea with telling different stories serving a single purpose which would ""form the big picture"" is so overused. And it might have worked with some other films but in this case it's just ""oh c'mon, seriously?!"". The cast is awful. Don't get me wrong I usually like Tom Hanks and I loved Ben Whishaw in The Perfume, but the acting in Cloud Atlas is literally scandalous. Now about the movie itself. It is crystal clear what they tried to achieve. It should have been some sort of a revelation which would explain life itself. In reality it is simple, shallow and ridiculous. It doesn't raise questions or make you think. It doesn't even try to show you the answers. It just tells you stuff with a dramatic slow preacher-like voice and wannabe interesting accents. Honestly this parody of a movie felt as if you caught a sub- sub-sub-cable 22h lame melodramatic TV show crew, you gave them a giant budget and a camera (and Halle Berry for publicity) and they took the opportunity to spill every single stupid, random and clichéd thought into a three hour nightmare."
"virindra","1","269","482","2 December 2012"," Three hours of beautiful crap.
","I have seen the preview of this movie and was disappointed that Halle Berry was in this movie. She is a very boring actress who always plays a confident woman and in this movie she was not different than that. But Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving made me watch this movie in the cinema. I did not know it would be a three hours hell.<br/><br/>The movie is very beautiful made. What more can you expect from the Wachowski brothers (or brother / sister, I got lost there). The movie switches from the one parallel universe tot the other. In the preview the only thing the actors and actresses said was that the story is very complex and everything will come together at the end. Like boring the preview was, so was the movie. We got to see three hours of scenes going from story to story and back. Only to tell a simple story what the whole movie was really about. Yes, you get to know what the movie is about at the end, but it is very disappointing.<br/><br/>Acting was bad. Make-up was awesome. The actors and actresses were pimped up very beautiful. Sometimes the actors and actresses had to speak words of the English language in a different way like we are used to. I could see they had a bit of trouble there and that really stole the magic of the movie.<br/><br/>Some people left the cinema before the movie was over. Most people, like me, stayed. Maybe because we hoped the movie would get better, or the urge to know what this movie was about, or maybe not letting our money we paid for the movie wash down the drain.<br/><br/>One big advice: don't watch it in the cinema. It's a waste of your money. It's nothing like the matrix, what in my opinion was a great action movie."
"the_cyberpunk","3","193","345","28 October 2012"," Long-winded new-age mess . . .
","I'm not sure what to say about this film. It was attempting to be all things to all men . . . literally, but failed so miserably I cannot conceive of how it is regarded highly by anyone who saw it. The only thing more embarrassing than the pacing, directing, editing and performances in this film was the make-up, which especially when Hugo Weaving appears dressed in drag as a middle aged nurse reminded me of a less convincing Mrs. Doubtfire. Hugo's transformation feels uncomfortable and half-hearted, designed for cheep laughs because the audience knows this is a man who is far more comfortable in a g-man suit and shades and not in knit-sweaters and comfortable shoes attempting to capture the nuances of Nurse Ratched. If it weren't for the fact that each story is edited together and connected by some goofy new-age reincarnation mumbo-jumbo it would amount to little more than a series of fairly pedestrian clichés in genre-fiction. The fact that the same 15 or so actors (about 2 or 3 of whom are better actors than this film allows) are jumbled between the plots makes the film even more difficult to enjoy. Imagine you're being served a 6-course meal, and for some reason the chef has decided to use the same 6 ingredients in every course . . . Including the ripe old cheese that was Tom Hanks in this film. The worst performance by far was turned in by Doona Bae, whose character seems to be built around 95% hairstyle, 2% skimpy skirts, 1% never having shoes on for some reason, 2% passively reciting her lines in a sort of monotone sigh. A scene where she is supposed to be giving a speech that will cause a revolution in her world sounds like it could have been read from a cue card by a shy 9 year old, this even after her character has only recently found out that her sisters have been getting ground up into juice boxes and fed to her. The scenes set in Neo-Seoul (apptly named since the Wachowskis directed this sequence) are nothing new. A futuristic dystopian cityscape has been done so many times since Blade Runner did it best 30 years ago that there's no wonder left in seeing them, especially since no-one has successfully improved on the original. There is of course plenty of martial arts, gun-fu, and even a Neo in Neo-Seoul, but the effects look rushed and unconvincing. At nearly 3 hours this film is a ponderous plodding mess that needs to be put out of its misery and converted in to a drinkable form for those who enjoyed it, so they can simply sit there and consume it without taking up theatre space from better films. They can put Deepak Chopra's name on the box to help sales."

","""Cloud Atlas"" was the longest three hours I've spent in a movie theater in a long, long time. Twice I had to hold myself back from walking out. The theme, if you can finally figure it out, is that love and relationships endure throughout time and the heroes or the spirits of the heroes keep showing up in different times in history. But rather show things in some sort of sequence, the movie cuts back and forth from time and place without any warning. You have to keep track of about a half dozen different stories, multiple characters played by the same actors and finally you just throw up your hands and give up. Even if you could figure out the storyline, there's nothing original about it. Oh, and bring a translation book since about 25% of the dialog is in some sort of pidgin-English invented for the movie.<br/><br/>I don't mind movies occasionally trying to shake up the traditional narrative; ""Memento"" was an outstandingly original twist on the conventional storytelling. But ""Cloud Atlas"" is not only confusing, it's ponderous, grindingly slow, gratuitously violent, self-important and dull. It cost $100 million to make and it'll no doubt enter the ranks of one of the most expensive flops in movie history. It's not even forgettable---the story is so unintelligible that you really don't have anything to forget when you leave the theater."

And then I turned it off, i wanted silence. As far as silence goes for a crowded town.<br/><br/>People who've seen The Matrix (a.k.a. almost everyone) and V for Vendetta, both of them, should know - Whachovskis show ugly, ""harsh"" scenes to give a meaning. This is just one of the reasons why this movie isn't for everyone. In the relatively short time that a movie can offer, you are presented with nearly all the troubles society has had over last 2 hundreds of years and, perhaps, a few ahead. Racism, homosexuality, stealing, ideals, religious guidelines, lack of knowledge about other parts of the world, the ""what does make you a human"" question and so on. Only to get rolled over fast. Cloud Atlas introduces you to all these... things... and what they cause. Never once giving an answer. And there is no time to do so, for that matter. Needless to say, people who are susceptible to these things, would either not want to deal with them or want the movie to expand on them. Neither one happens, some people are left with some emptiness.<br/><br/>And some people who claim themselves ""intelligent"" will work their negativity on these thoughts. I had no troubles with all the various ideas thrown at me. I was slowly getting drawn into the complex maze this story offered.<br/><br/>So - negative feedback is understandable. But I, like I said before, enjoyed this movie very, very much. Half to two thirds of the movie you are trying to grasp where the movie is going, only to realize that it is not linear, some stories hold little to no importance. And near the end you realize - it is good exactly the way it is.<br/><br/>I'd give the movie a solid 10, the first one in over 5 years. But I do see where the negativity can come from - and I can respect that. Also I do see a few things missing. Like, how did the journalist know of the composition when she wasn't there? Perhaps it was answered in the book. But I, while understood 99% of what the movie was trying to convey, didn't see the answer.<br/><br/>Overall - if you like to get yourself challenged, if you like a taste of sci-fi as far as ""potential things"" go, if you aren't easily offended by some... controversial, yet pretty simple ideas, you SHOULD watch this movie. Now. <br/><br/>But there isn't a 100% warranty that you will like it."

","The fact that you are interested in watching this film and that it was even made should be heralded as a collective success, because Cloud Atlas is a thought provoking film. Your personal and collective philosophies will be challenged, and your emotions will be engaged. Each of the six stories address mankind's struggle against seemingly inexorable systems/oppressors, and resolve that love can help us overcome the worst hell. Cloud Atlas also requires that you have a super-trained memory because the six story lines are jumbled and unnaturally presented. I don't mind a thinking man's movie, just as long as my brain doesn't attempt to shut down after being exhausted by the editor's brutal film gymnastics.<br/><br/>Three of Cloud Atlas' story lines are wildly entertaining. That also means that three are also lacking. If you are willing to accept that you may have to either take a notepad with you to keep track of the story lines and trudge through some uninspired acting (sometimes Hanks & Berry are flat), or commit yourself ahead of time to watch this film twice, then go out and purchase your ticket. Otherwise, wait for the film to come out on Netflix."

To all of those who boast this movie is ""The best movie ever created"" or ""a most inspiring masterpiece"", your reviews, to me, are incredibly naive. If you can actually decipher this movie then sure I suppose I can see where you get your ""masterpiece"" view. What's happening here though is that you are focusing purely on 'the story' and completely forgetting that it's a movie. You are finding some sort of poetry that makes sense to you and inspires you. Where you are naive is when you say 'the movie' is what is great. What is great, in reality, is the story. You would be just as well served by reading the book. The movie, however, is so horrible it's painful. If the movie was a Shakespearean play performed in Shakespearean times then I can understand how people could enjoy it. It honestly views as a play on a stage. The made up languages, accents, and ways of speaking are so outlandish it's impossible to follow, and horribly acted... The feeling of the movie is fake and incredibly laughable; especially when it's clear that the director was going for realism and suspense but failed so very horribly. If you are looking to be inspired and want to see what people are talking about with their 10/10 reviews then I would suggest you read the book.

A masterpiece of a new kind has been created with Cloud Atlas. The ongoing impact of kindness and evil is portrayed with such perfection throughout past, present and future. Watching this film just makes me want to be a better human being. We can all be better. And cloud Atlas leads the way not only how we can be better, but also why. The messages throughout the film are truly spine tingling. We are bound to one another. Every action we take has some sort of meaning in another world, another dimension or another time. Ultimately we must avoid making choices which we cannot live with. In a day and age ruled by corruption and evil it is so timely to have a genuine reminder that there is more to life than simply being selfish and caring for yourself only. This film gets points for being both entertaining and educating, but you must be prepared to surrender your attention for the entirety of the long film as otherwise you may find it ''boring.'"
"damittaja","9","12","17","11 February 2013"," An engaging movie that requires that the viewer wants to think about concepts
","I went to see the movie with mixed expectations. I had read reviews beforehand that warned of a messy plot line with multiple stories. I was positively surprised on how untrue that was. The stories play well out in terms of pacing and characters. There are a lot of them in total, but each part (or you could say ""act"") has only a couple central characters, like you would expect from any typical story. The different stories are very easy to follow because they are so different, yet they are the same on many levels. I specially like how the film expects you to think. You can watch this movie just for the visuals, but to really appreciate it, you need to think what happened and because of what. Some reviews I've read say that the stories are not connected. I would say that if that is how you feel, you did not pay attention at all and were expecting the movie to give everything pre-chewed to you. Instead the movie expects to you to fill the missing bits, notice references between the stories and to imagine what has happened between the transitions from one story to another. There is even an exchange of lines in the movie which can pretty much be summed up as the characters saying to the audience that we won't tell you everything, you can imagine and fill the blanks yourselves. The movie has a message and after you've processed the stories, it should be quite obvious. It might not be exactly the same message as I got, but still. Music and sound effects were good, not exceptional or bad, but satisfying and did their part well. The locations and visual effects were really nice and at times stunning, fitting for the events that transpired and interesting. Acting was good, the characters were played well and the actors fit their roles neatly. My only criticism is about the masking - same actors played different roles and genders, and the masking department had not been up to the task at all times. Or maybe it is that I perceive female actors playing male characters and vice versa a bit hard to digest due to the different body/facial structures of genders. I would recommend the movie if you want to see something that requires paying attention and ability to concentrate for nearly three hours, but in exchange gives food for your thought and imagination. Don't watch this if you just want to hang out with friends and chat at the same time."

The main theme is how your environment and the people in it effects you an the other people around you. It correlates how how history repeats itself by showing you the past, present, and the future.

A lawyer in the south pacific who attempts to help an escaped slave who has stowed away on a ship in the nineteenth century. A young man who has gone to Scotland in the 1930s to help a composer write again and to compose his own work. A reporter in 1970s San Francisco who finds herself in danger when she uncovers a plot by oil companies to stop alternate power sources. A man whose brother has him put in a secure facility in present day Scotland. A cloned slave, known as a fabricant, is taken from where she is kept by a man hoping to overthrow current system and becomes a symbol of that revolution in 2144. Finally in the far future a tribesman Pacific island is haunted by a vision of a demonic character and helps a woman from an advanced civilisation get to the summit of a 'forbidden' mountain. These six stories are told in an overlapping manner; a scene from one then from another; sometimes it is just a moment in one story other times we stay with one story for quite a while.<br/><br/>When I started watching this I thought it might just be long and confusing with the cast playing multiple characters in the various stories; sometimes these characters are of a different race or gender. Thankfully once the stories had got going I was gripped; the way we constantly switch from one story to another meant no story got boring; nor did it create the confusion it might have done. As the stories progress it becomes apparent that there are connections between then sometimes thematic sometimes involving the same characters or the effects of their works and lives. The cast does a great job playing the multiple roles; sometimes I didn't recognise actors under heavy makeup until the credits showed who played whom. The way it is spread over many centuries means at times it is a costume drama, other times in is futuristic sci-fi and others it is post-apocalyptic sci-fi. There are thrilling moments, tragic moments and even some very funny moments. This certainly won't be for everybody but I'd recommend giving it a go; I certainly enjoyed it far more than I expected."

","In his dialogues ""Meno"" and ""Phaedo"" Plato expresses the idea that ""humans possess knowledge from past incarnations and that learning consists of rediscovering that knowledge within us"". That is what the process of Anamnesis is. And I am very much fond of it. <br/><br/>That is exactly why I think that the movie (and the book) ""Cloud Atlas"" is a masterpiece of both cinema production capacity and storytelling. And not only that, it is a perfect stage for the manifestation of acting talent. That is something which Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy and the rest of the cast undoubtedly possess. <br/><br/>We as mortal people tend not to believe in the eternal and transcendent features of our words, actions and essentially of our souls. And that is understandable. One cannot see beyond his judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. This marvelous mosaic structure of the plot seems at first very hard to cope with. But here come Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis to direct it well enough that it all blends in. The pace of the events in the plot move like a train - first slowly, but then it all speeds up until the characters, the stories and the genres interflow into one parable about love, freedom and the consequences of every choice being made. <br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" is not only about the immortality of the human soul. It is presenting us the gifts of life that make us human - the values which stick us together around the globe. Such a daring and visual (what incredible make-up and costume artists!) masterpiece does not defy only the usual structure of the narrative, but also (more importantly) our understanding of what is the answer to the eternal question - ""What is the meaning of my life?"". And at the end of the movie we desire to receive a revelation, but instead we get ""a look in the mirror"". This movie is complex in its form, but simple in its substance. Life is what you make it and it's YOUR own choice to make it through violence or LOVE."
"summerloud","10","9","12","15 September 2013"," in some ways better than the novel, in some ways worse, but a very beautiful adaption
","after recently finishing the novel i decided to give this movie another watch. i watched it in theaters when it came out and liked it a lot, and my opinion of it improved even more with the second watching<br/><br/>why this bombed at the box office i cannot understand. special effects, cast and acting are awesome, and while i like long movies in general i have yet to see another movie that seems so short and without any lengths even though being 3 hours long. <br/><br/>time just flies by as you watch a mesmerizing whirlwind of character archetypes playing out their roles again and again through different times. compared to the book, the repetition of motives and actions by the same kind of people stands out even more in the movie, thanks to the nice trick of using the same actors for same personalities through all times.<br/><br/>the movie heavily changes the plot line in many of the sub-stories, which was a necessity since the novel would have been impossible to make into anything less than 8 hours long otherwise. some of the changes are made out of necessity of shortening and simplifying individual plot lines, some of them actually improve the story by adding even more deja-vues and connections, like Vivian Ayrs the composer living in the same house later used as aurora home for the elderly, instead of living in french- speaking Bruges like in the book. adding another language would have been pushing it too far anyways, since the movie is already demanding with its multitude of dialects spoken throughout different times.<br/><br/>some changes seem a bit forced however, such as the oil industry instead of nuclear power being the big evil in the 70s plot line, a change that ended up not making much sense at all, and just served to push an agenda, like the inclusion of global warming in the Neo Seoul plot line. the post-apocalyptic plot line in the far future gets changed the most, and ends up making not much sense at all (why do the Prescients not just fly up the mountain? why do they not use their advanced weaponry to help the valley people fight the Kona? why do they need to send a signal for help to colonies? the whole concept of outer space colonies saving mankind from earth makes little sense scientifically), however i have to say that the book had its logical flaws as well, and these can be overlooked in a work of this scale.<br/><br/>one of the main topics of the book, the rise of a corpocracy and the description of the future in Neo-Seoul, was basically dropped from the script in favor of more action, a decision i find understandable since there is not that many chances to have special-effects-laden action scenes in the other plot lines, and which ends up working okay in my opinion.<br/><br/>the topic of slavery is even more pronounced than in the book, and although i disliked that the movie chose to simplify here and stereotypically show white people as the enslavers of Atua in the earliest plot line, instead of Maori people like in the book, this can be excused with the necessary streamlining and simplification of all plot lines.<br/><br/>all in all, this was a way better movie adaption of a nearly unadaptable book than anyone could hope for. i liked both the movie and the book, they both have their strengths and weaknesses. the book might be overly long at times, while the movie might sometimes be overly simple and not making much sense. but overall it is a masterpiece, and way better than anything anyone could expect from the Wachowskis after they totally botched the matrix sequels.<br/><br/>why it gets so much hate is clear as well: it offends a lot of people with its esoteric concepts like re-birth, and maybe even moreso with homosexuality and trans-gender themes. but if you are not a close-minded bigot, and are not annoyed by the constantly switching between plot lines, i see absolutely no reason why you should not love this movie."
"erblinnushi","10","21","33","30 August 2015"," One extraordinary and beautifully written piece
","This is my all time favorite movie for many reasons, but one that I am always so passionate about is the content, the writing of this movie. Every line sounds like a poem, and touches you in some way. Very powerful! The acting is also very strong. The actors expressed their emotions and made me believe that they are really going through some sort of emotion. The visual effects are impressive, and the credits will surprise you with what you will come to find out. The story and just the meaning of it, still to this day, I think about and every time I watch it, I learn something new, which is really awesome. My favorite quote from the movie will definitely be: ""Our lives are not our own, past and present, from womb to tomb we are bound to others, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future"" !!! Genius!"
"gbest-gb","10","13","19","2 December 2013"," Great movie that made one big mistake.
","This movie will be a cult classic and would have done much better with the critics but one of the most entertaining events in the movie (in a dark humor sort of way) was when a critic gets thrown off a high rise to his death. I,m going to read the book because the movie intrigued me. I don't pretend to understand movie world politics but it is clear to me that this movie got the shaft. With proper promotion it could have done much better at the box office. It has action, humor, romance, gore, and heart. The acting is great and the pacing is spot on (I was into it the whole movie). Cloud Atlas is a intricate piece of movie art that stands heads and shoulders above the formula fluff most movies are."
"rv78","1","98","185","8 November 2012"," Atlas? No...AT LAST... THANK GOD it was over!
","The first 30 minutes of the movie were confusing. At about 60 minutes is got a bit interesting and I was looking forward to seeing how it would end. At 90 minutes I wanted it to wrap up. At 2 hours I REALLY wanted to leave. By 2.5 hours my legs were restless, and the other couple we were there with was also obviously giddy to depart. After 3 hours when it FINALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY ended, I was THRILLED -- not with the movie but to get out of there.<br/><br/>Over the years Tom Hanks has made one good decision after another. This movie was not another good decision for him or Halle Berry. I understood the symbolism of how the character's decisions impacted prior and future reincarnations. This was obvious rather quickly. Jesus Christ famously told his important thoughts 3 times... but 6 times was at least 3 times (and 60 minutes) too many! The highlight of this dreadful movie was the character escaping from the mental institution for the aged in about the middle of the film. His ""soilent green is people"" comment foretold the conclusion and supposed climax of the film. Yes, we not AT ALL surprisingly learned the genetically engineered race of nubile Asian sex kitten waitresses were raised as mere protein to be fed to later generations of entertainers/waitresses once they passed their 12-year adult shelf life. I GOT IT! We ALL got it.., how did anyone not see this was coming? But, I did not need to hear her give the same speech over and over throughout the film from different angles and through different media. BTW, I also found the make-up rather disconcerting, and the odd Cajun-esque/Gaelic brogue of the future more than annoying, and also rather unnecessary. <br/><br/>BUT, AT LAST... the movie was over to the groan of the audience. Frankly, I can't understand how so many people seem to like this terrible film! We go to the movie theater every Wednesday, and in a year of mediocre and bad movies, this monstrosity is likely the worst! I rate it a 1 on this scale... but 10 rotten tomatoes on another."
"jessemorrison99","2","108","206","29 October 2012"," While watching, you'll constantly be asking three questions: Who? What? And why?
","The Good: The music was very well done. Also, most of the acting was right on. There was one performance, however, that was stiffer than Kristen Stewart's corpse. <br/><br/>The Bad: This movie breaks the fundamental rules of storytelling. Now, this could sound like a good thing, had it been done well, but it wasn't. I'm all for breaking the rules. That's how movies these days stand out from the dozens of remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels. But this one didn't work. Imagine for me this if you would: Take one random episode of each of your 9 favourite TV shows. Now cut each one into sections of less than 60 seconds, then splice them all together in a seemingly random way. This is an accurate representation of the three hours that is cloud atlas. Does that sound like an appealing way to absorb 9+ different stories? All being inter-cut with one another until it's impossible to keep track of them? It also doesn't help that each character is played by the same actor. I know it's supposed to be their ""past lives"", but it just makes it more confusing. <br/><br/>Now I'm not going to jump on the love/hate bandwagon. There were good things about it, and bad things too. The idiots will say ""It's stupid!"" and the film snobs will say ""Your IQ is low if you didn't get it."" I understand that it was about a grand scale idea that our past lives affect our future lives, and vice versa. That's all good, but I think they could've gotten that point across with a less confusing movie. Honestly, I'd rather have watched a 3 hour movie about any one of its many sub-plots rather than all of them edited like this.<br/><br/>The shooting star birthmark held some significance (don't really know what exactly), but with all the dozens of characters, I can't remember for the life of me who had them and who didn't. Go into this movie expecting this: There is no one plot, there are several. However they're not depicted one after another, they all happen simultaneously, and it's your job to keep track and remember every detail. Hint: you won't."

","Based on the David Mitchell novel, ""Cloud Atlas"" boasts a triumvirate of writers and directors. German Tom Tykwer and the sibling team of Andy and Lana Wachowski served as screenwriters, producers, and directors. Tykwer, an accomplished composer, also wrote original music for the movie along with Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek.<br/><br/>It's incredibly challenging to write about this enigmatic film without giving anything away. While I still won't reveal details of the plot or actions of the characters, ""Cloud Atlas"" cannot be reviewed without some discussion regarding what it's about, and that's no easy task.<br/><br/>Pigeonholing a film into a specific genre is something I generally frown upon. After all, it's Hollywood that loves catchy terms like romantic comedies, spy thrillers, and murder mysteries. In the indie world within which my sensibilities lie, movies mirror real life -- funny, sad, tragic, poignant, mysterious and puzzling and absurd, often within the same scene. That's the kind of authenticity that can set the heart racing.<br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" unfolds as a historical narrative set in the 1800s. Suddenly it morphs into a 20th century period piece. It's at turns a pensive drama, detective potboiler, action/adventure flick, political thriller, dark comedy, and pure sci-fi. Then it cycles back again. The plot continually interweaves all the above -- six multiple story lines, all set in different eras with different characters. The only thing connecting these apparently disparate narratives is one curious conundrum that stares the viewer in the face, ""What does it all mean?""<br/><br/>The cast is an ensemble within an ensemble, with many stars playing multiple roles across various story lines. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, portraying three to four characters each, are clearly the names which dominate the scoreboard but every actor went well above and beyond for this production. Most play more than one role, even different sexes at times. This is the stuff of awards. But just mentioning what their roles are would reveal more than I already have, or am about to, so it will be left to the astute viewer to discover who's who.<br/><br/>The production values on this omnibus cinematic achievement are stellar. That this is an independent film and not a Hollywood movie is incredulous at times. Each of the half dozen narratives has its own lighting scheme to match the era and mood, with a color palette befitting their respective landscapes -- earth tones in the early pre-industrial periods, primary colors in the present-day segments, and grayscale in the future, back to earth tones again in the great beyond.<br/><br/>The camera-work is also story-dependent. Small wonder it ""only"" took two cinematographers, not six, to shoot this film. Frank Griebe and John Toll are staring Oscar in the face with this superior display of visual genius. Every possible photographic technique is used here, capturing extreme closeups and sweeping landscapes, often in the same shot, yet the work is never self-indulgent art for art's sake.<br/><br/>As literate as it is, the script doesn't take itself as seriously as many viewers will. While filled with platitudes and truisms, there's also quite a bit of comic relief at much-needed intervals.<br/><br/>Despite the multiple parallel narratives, each piece has its own distinct mood. ""Cloud Atlas"" is triumphant in its ability to integrate every inch of the emotional continuum. There are overt tonal changes across the story lines that, on paper, would appear to be an almost insurmountable task. Yet the filmmakers accomplished this by carefully sliding from comedy to dark comedy to drama to historical drama to mysterious present-day curiosity to scientific achievement leading to the wonders of the future and science fiction, cycling back again, never shocking with abrupt awkward transitions that would require some severe mental adjustment on the part of the viewer.<br/><br/>This subtle ebb and flow is not unlike the composition of a symphony, literally echoing that being written throughout the course of the movie itself -- the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"" -- which also happens to form the basis of the soundtrack. It's an original piece composed for the film and its creation is the subtext for one of the story lines. Life imitating art imitating life. These movements, to continue with the musical metaphor, are accomplished by editors Frank Griebe and John Toll through long dissolves whenever possible, blending one narrative into another, a useful device that, again, relieves the viewer of having to put together the puzzle pieces (""Where are we now?""). This frees up the mind to contemplate the overall messages being imparted by the action instead of straining to understand the visuals (a la Inception).<br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" is one of those films that you think you get...then you revise your thinking...again, and again, and again. It's about slavery! No, wait...it's about the Holocaust! Or is it both? Aha, it's about prejudice through the ages -- against dark-skinned people by whites, against Jews, homosexuals...that's it, yes. It's about discrimination, bigotry, racism. But wait, no...there are themes of past lives and reincarnation here. The sins of the fathers are visited upon the sons. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. That's it! No, wait...what's going on here? Aha I get it now...it's about love! The next decision we make changes the future. You come to a fork in the road...do you build? Or destroy? Will your next act be of criminality or kindness? This choice can change mankind. Yes, that's the idea. Everything that occurs is the result of individual decisions. The ocean began with one drop. Is that what ""Cloud Atlas"" is about? In the end, the answer is...all the above. But it can all be summed up in two simple words: Eternal Recurrence. That's it. (Really, that's it.)<br/><br/>Look up ""epic"" in the dictionary and you may see the poster for ""Cloud Atlas"" staring back at you. Quite possibly you'll also find it under ""M"" for ""masterpiece."""
"pambosk","10","27","45","26 January 2014"," its about time
","Its films like this that make me still go to the cinema. Its films like this that makes you not give on Hollywood....just yet. You can go numb with the next so call blockbuster. Spiderman, Ironman, and the list goes on. Then when the returns start to go down, why not reboot the story from the beginning. Science Fiction, Westerns and Comedies rarely get Oscars, and Cloud Atlas is no exception. Doona Bae was really great in this film, all the actors were. Hugh Grant also really came out of his skin for this one. All the actors who we thought that had done what they could, were all great, i salute them all. Lets have more of this type of film, i don't just mean SF but good solid storyline films. Bravo"
"travinorbit","10","14","21","14 May 2014"," Couldn't move a muscle until the end credits stopped rolling
","I don't often get deeply affected by movies. More often than not I get up when the movies done, sigh, think to myself 'well that was nice' and carry on.<br/><br/>But Cloud Atlas left me speechless and unable to move. It has a dizzying and profound power that stayed with me, and I couldn't spoil it by bombarding myself with any other stimuli or conversation. I'm often one of 'those people' who turns their phone back on as soon as they walk out of the cinema, but I forgot I even had one.<br/><br/>It may take some people a while to adjust to the film's sporadic jumps between story lines, of which there are a few. You start following one set of characters, then suddenly you're following someone else, and it takes you a while to see where the thread that connects them lies. <br/><br/>It was genius to have the same actors playing many different roles. It becomes a game, trying to guess who's playing who. The make-up is incredible, often making the actor almost unrecognizable.<br/><br/>If you enjoy movies a little more cerebral, a little more thought- provoking and perhaps a little challenging, this is a must see. <br/><br/>Tom Tykwer, you're brilliant!"
"enrike_hockey_15","8","10","14","12 March 2013"," It's fantastic
","The atmosphere and the summary of Cloud Atlas would be impossible to describe. If I tried you wouldn't understand a word I said. I just want to say that this kind of movie is worth to watch as it has a particular plot since it is divided into several branches which developed as the movie goes a long.<br/><br/>I just recommend the Cloud Atlas because it's a movie that's very interesting to watch and makes you think. I would also recommended because the movie(even though it almost last 3 hours) is surprisingly fresh and outstanding. Although I do recommend to watch it alone and to be concentrated to be able to submerge into the plot."

","This is the one movie which I feel directors and writers have given full justice to cinema. This movie is not about celebrities but its about actors.
Same actors playing different roles and sometimes even different genders is simply superb. The makeup artists, the whole crew did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>The story is the protagonist here, and does not remain constraint in the boundaries of film, but the story stays with you for a long time after the film is over.<br/><br/>Best part is, either you are going to hate this movie to its core or love it fully, there is no middle ground. Hate it or Love it, this movie bounds to get some reaction out of its viewer.<br/><br/>This is not popcorn cinema where you watch a film along with other tasks you may perform. This movie is like a meditation where you have to keep your focus.<br/><br/>Dont leave this movie in between, before making any opinion , make sure you watch it till the end."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","15","23","18 September 2015"," Just simply amazing. Redefines what you can do in telling a story on film.
","The Wachowski's Cloud Atlas... Where do I even begin. It's by far my favourite film of 2012, a rousing, titanic epic that's so ambitious it seems to transcend the boundaries of cinema and go to places I've never seen the medium venture before. A film usually transports you to one setting, and captivates, you at least for a while there, if it's lucky. This one transports you to freaking six, wildly different, equally transfixing periods of time in history, each one compelling in its own way. The excellent group of actors all play at least 6 different characters, all reincarnated into different timelines, crisscrossing each other's paths, fighting here, and maybe becoming lovers there, hundreds of years down the road. It's a monumental concept that could have wildly gone off the rails and become bombastic. Despite its lofty ambition, it wields itself in a fluid, cohesive manner, every moment, interaction and intersection of character and fate in service of its momentous, forward moving, intricate chain of events that just demands multiple viewings. I've seen it over five times and still am discovering secret wonders that one only begins to unearth upon careful inspection and loving care in observing its wonders. It's over three hours left long, and yet doesn't drag for one single second, every moment a cog in its own grand design, every detail speaking volumes. The actors are to be applauded endlessly, some of them leaping right outside their comfort zone to bring the tale to life. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry take centre stage and frazzle us with performances that have to be seen to be believed, each portraying different people, Hanks from a psycho Irish boxer, to a sly 1800's doctor, to a creole speaking nomad in my favourite of the stories, so far in the future that technology has fallen and humans resort to earthen, primal ways (cue the welcome Waterworld references). Berry rocks it mostly as Luisa Rey, an intrepid, 1970's reporter laying waste to a corrupt oil executive with nasty plans played by a deliciously smarmy Hugh Grant. Grant is a prick in every single role of his, and you haven't lived until you've seen him play the face painted chieftain of a cannibalistic tribe. Ben Withshaw plays Robert Frobisher (among others), in the 1930's, my least favourite of the segments, a composer responsible for the haunting sextet that gives the film its title, with tragic aplomb that meets the tone of his composition. In a fascist, neo futuristic South Korea, a replicant slave (Doona Bae will bring you to tears) discovers her true purpose, awakened by a freedom fighter played by Jim Sturgess (you'll cry for different reasons when you see the makeup job to try an make him look Asian lol), who also plays an 1800's lawyer on a dangerous voyage home across many seas to meet his beloved (also Bae, in ginger getup). Hugo Weaving particularly stands out as always, playing everyone from a devilish Willy Wonka, to a brutal Korean secret secret police operative, and a role so fitfully hilarious I won't spoil it for you here. Jim Broadbent gets the comic relief in a powerhouse as Timothy Cavendish, a rapscallion publisher who finds himself on a heartwarming odyssey across the UK that brings to mind lighter moments of Monty Python, and is a highlight among the episodes. Starting to get the picture? I could literally got on for pages about how many different people the fearless actors play, but I want to leave it to you to explore the absolute rush of cinematic enjoyment that this is, an emotional blast of adrenaline powered storytelling that flows like galaxies above us. I could also be a moron and try to dissect the themes for you, but I'll instead leave it to one of Susan Sarandon's incarnations, prophetically and eerily imparting to us: ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."". Or as one of Hank's incarnations goes: ""Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the Theory of Relativity and Principles of Uncertainty: phenomenon that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday I believed that I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment. At each point of intersection, each encounter suggests a new potential direction."". Like I said, I could ramble forever. Just trust me when I say, it's a special, special film. One that's daring enough to function on its own wavelength that some may not quite be able to tune in to, but for those that can, or choose to, it's a profound work of art that, like I said, transcends the notions of what is possible with this medium and makes us feel something that reaches past the blink of of our mortal lives here, into the deep pool of our ancestral thought and memory, and gives us a glimpse of what's beyond, the hypothetical 'bigger picture', if you will. Or maybe I'm just senile. It's up to you to watch this and decide."

"PlugInYourBrain","9","11","16","9 May 2013"," A refreshing movie that breaks new ground
","Cloud Atlas is an interesting and unusual film.<br/><br/>It's disconcerting to watch at first, because you're not sure what it is you are watching. A love story? A period piece? It kept jumping between timelines, so it took my mind a while to work out what was going on. You also see the same actors playing different roles and this threw me too. I thought they were the same person, though eventually I realized they were entirely different characters. Once I understood what was going on I was able to enjoy three long but never boring hours.<br/><br/>I haven't seen anything like Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>It jumps between six timelines telling six different but intertwined stories separated across sometimes vast gulfs of time. I could easily describe what the movie is now, but I think it's more fun if you discover it for yourself. It isn't perfect and parts of it could have been better done, but I am very glad to have watched it. It's not a movie that dumbs itself down for the viewer. It's rich, intelligent and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Most actors play multiple roles in this film. They are all good, and Tom Hanks in particular is outstanding. Too many established actors get lazy and fill their bank account by playing the same role over and over, so it's great to see Hanks break new ground to deliver a deep performance I wouldn't have otherwise thought he was capable of. Korean Actress Doona Bae too is wonderful. So too were Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving. Even Hugh Grant. Yes, Hugh Grant.<br/><br/>For the most part the editing works well. We never get bored, and a distressing scene in one timeline is balanced by a lighter scene in another.<br/><br/>Professional critics didn't condemn Cloud Atlas but didn't praise it either. I think it's different and it wasn't the usual 'tick the box' review they are so used to. e.g. 'This is a good cop movie. 3 stars' 'This is a really good cop movie. 4 stars.' Well to hell with them. Perhaps they can think and earn their salaries for a change.<br/><br/>It's a triumph Cloud Atlas even got made. The major studios wouldn't back it, so it was produced and financed independently. There were three different units filming at once. The movie was moderately successful at the box office, though I'm not sure it has yet broken even. But it's got all the makings of a timeless cult classic so with its video release I'm sure in time it will come to be appreciated. Credit too goes to Hanks who even though only an actor here, spurred on the producers and cast to get it made despite the continual setbacks. Some of the other actors too were told by their agents the producers didn't have the money to pay them, but they got on their planes and did it anyway. Far from the usual paint-by-numbers formula movie making, this was a labor of love.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas isn't without its flaws. A wider audience would have slid into the movie far more comfortably if they better explained we were watching multiple timelines and that the same actors were playing entirely different characters. Better editing would have removed some of the confusion, and the birthmark was silly.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie is the very poor 'Yellowface' make-up. Some Caucasians are made up to look like Asians, but it is unconvincing and distracting. They don't look, move or talk like Asians. If you've spent time in Asia you'll know what I'm talking about. Obviously the producers don't. I don't think the producers were being racist when they did this, but I don't think it worked either. At they knew to stay away from 'Blackface.'<br/><br/>It's an emotionally intense three hours covering many characters. My favorite was Tom Hank's Zachry in the last time period. I loved the way he the others communicated in a dialect that was both futuristic and yet very easy for the audience to follow. ""That's fair buy. True-true?"" (trans. ""I think I've got a point."") Some professional critics complained about this. What do they expect? That in a thousand years people will still speak North American dialect as today? Talk about laziness and a lack of imagination.<br/><br/>The movie delivers as happy an ending as is possible for such a long and heart-wrenching journey.<br/><br/>I'd like a break from remakes. We need more brave movies like this that show us something new. Kudos to all involved."

","This movie is nearly flawless. The acting, the cinematography, the settings and the plot are just mind blowing. I had no idea how amazed and touched I would be by seeing this movie. The plot is six very loosely connected stories throughout human history; some in the past, one in the present and some in the future. Each story is completely different from the others in theme, feel and and even genre. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and cringe as it takes you on an exploration through the decisions people make and how those decisions make ripples throughout space and time. This is like no movie you've ever seen before. Most characters, or ""souls"", never change throughout the story, but there's one who transforms from a murderous thief into a civilization-saving hero. It's so beautiful to see this transformation and it really effected me. I pulled many things from this movie and found there to be some really deep, meaningful statements about humans, our history and where we might be headed. History repeats itself. There will always be evil men and the death of innocence, but through all this horror and oppression, it is possible to change and understand. This movie was a flawlessly directed masterpiece. Just watch it."
"ericjcant-1","4","3","3","29 May 2020"," Movie Hell. Six stories told in ten minute segements over three hours of time.
","Cloud Atlas is the story format I would envision if there were movies in Hell. Ever tried watching six different movies in ten minute segments over three hours of time? It is annoying and tedious, and even if you make it through, the idea of ever having to watch it again sounds like work.
Some find Cloud Atlas to be impressive if for no other reason than it has a lot of stuff in it. If I didn't already make it clear, Cloud Atlas rolls together six different alternating stories, and despite what some would lead you to believe, they have nothing in common except that they use the same actors. This is supposed to suggest some sort of parallel worlds of reincarnation, but the roles have nothing in common. They are totally different people with no correlation to each other. So why is this even a point worth making?
Each story presents a different conflict, whether that be in the form of slavery, sexual oppression, oil companies, racism, money, or tribal barbarian hordes... basically whatever the author could think of at the moment, and he came up with six. I think liberation from oppression is supposed to be the transcending factor here, and the movie tries to neatly wrap everything up with a narrative message at the end, essentially telling us that people who fight oppression are good and people who create oppression are bad, and that our actions effect the future of our reincarnated entirely different selves and other actors who are rotating through different character roles of different stories. I'm going to be blunt here; as it is portrayed in this movie, this is a dumb concept, because if one incarnation is an oppressed gay composer, and another is an abusive villain who has no awareness of his other selves, then contextually it doesn't matter... no more so than if you had the an actor play Captain Hook in one movie and then later plays Sneezy the Dwarf in another. You have one actor playing two different roles in two different movies. So what? And even if you want to fall back on the theme of oppressed vs. oppressor, then drop the pretentiously complex method of using six stories and just find one good one. You might find yourself asking, why didn't they just play each story all the way through one at a time? I have no idea. Not complicated enough maybe?
The individual stories are not bad, but the directing is poor, especially in the first hour, as every story feels rushed and insincere, and all the characters lack tonal believe-ability.
Cloud Atlas isn't bad, it just isn't good either, and it seems to want to be more than it is. It also makes sense that the Wachowskis wanted to make this film as there seems to be a lot of characters randomly smoking pot."

","I am 100% sure that there are intellectual and acadamic approaches to looking at Cloud Atlas and it is a kind of film that creates visual feast in the eyes of the audience. I believe that this film should be watched once to appraise the senario and another time to appraise the filming techniques and the messages. Cloud Atlas is like nothing I have ever seen before , it is a blend of reality and imagination and its importance is unquestionable because it carries characteristics of art , philosophy and politics. Cloud Atlas is a voyage that will take you to many places you do not expect. It sometimes made me cry when I saw the characters' struggle with life but sometimes it made me laugh when some characters mocked with life's games and live their own life in accordance with their games. It is a little bit difficult to completely understand the movie at first so it is better for audience to let themselves go so that they find themselves in the movie and then they completely will get the main points.Cloud Atlas is a movie that requires us to pay a lot of attention to figure out what is happening . For example when I first watched this movie , I had to stop certain scenes to comprehend what was going on but in the second time , I could understand the points without difficulty and i realized many allusions which I could not see before.. It is a kind of film that worthy of discussion and dissection. With its actors , make-up techniques and changing characters Cloud Atlas is an example of courageousness and uniqueness. These six different stories in the movie is woven each other. These stories symbolize our lives and the lives of others. Everything we do , everyone we meet and the decisions we make shape our future , our future lives and the future lives of others. This quote summarizes my thoughts::'' Our lives are not our own,from womb to tomb we are bound to the others, past and present. By each crime and every kindness , we birth our future. ''"
"simplyerii","10","5","6","2 December 2018"," An enigmatic tale for the curious
","I'm not one to write reviews unless I feel that the movie is deserving of it. After stumbling across Cloud Atlas while on a search for something worth watching, I must say that it is simply put, an enigmatic tale for the critical thinkers and the self-aware. It took me 2 days, yes, 2 days to watch the entire movie due to the amount of movie breaks I took. Each scene was an orgasm of mind blowing dialogue and mystery which had me pondering on some of life's greatest questions. The what ifs. What if we really had the answers to most of the rhetorical questions we often ask ourselves like..""What is the meaning of life? Why am I here? Where do I go after I die? Is there even such a thing as a past life? and if there were, what could I do to make sure I don't repeat the same past life mistakes? Of course to the logical left brain thinker this could only mean one thing..there is no such thing. You might even be considered crazy. However, If you're a dominant right brain thinker, like me, one who considers themselves a think outside of the box individual, a wanderer, a free spirit, or even philosophically speaking, a mystic, then this movie is for you. Beware though, because you might have even more questions after watching than you did prior to watching and then just consider yourself one of the lucky ones, or rather the ""blessed"" to have experienced such a tale in this age of the enlightened."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","13","20","11 January 2013"," It must be applauded for merely having the audacity to tell such a story.
","I confess that I was never the biggest fan of Andy or Lana Wachowski, best known for their genre smash hit The Matrix, perhaps the only film they'd ever directed that I actually like. However, what they cook up along with co-director Tom Tykwer is a beautiful mystery of a movie that I'm confidant will be talked about many years from now. There is no one definitive story to Cloud Atlas (Based on the 2004 novel of the same name), instead, it's a collection of stories set in different time lines ranging from 1849 to 106 years after apocalyptic events, utilizing an all star cast to wonderful effect.<br/><br/>Despite a very lengthy runtime of close to three hours, Cloud Atlas is surprisingly easy to watch all in one sitting. It's a clever movie that mixes in a little bit of everything. Dark humor, moral dilemmas, romance, action, conspiracy, heartbreak, sweeping imagery, it's got something for everyone. How these individual segments connect to each other is a very provoking thematic detail that Tykwer and the Wachowski's love examining. It's not always done to uniformly astonishing effect, but it is ambitious in how it raises enough questions and answers, but still leaves plenty to the imagination.<br/><br/>One element that I applaud is the decision to go in a sort of Angels In America route by having actors play multiple roles. A talented ensemble cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and many others are consistently excellent, some more entertaining than others in segments. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the special makeup effects for the players. Not all the creations are excellent, but much of the work is so impressive that it renders an actor completely unrecognizable.<br/><br/>It's a shame that it didn't get much of an audience at the box office, though, because it is one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences you could hope for. A lot of it is uneven, I'm not gonna lie, but these three directors, and their unique voices, should be applauded merely for having the audacity to adapt such an ""unfilmable"" novel to the screen. With repeat viewings, and staying power, this could become a beloved classic years from now.<br/><br/>**** / *****"
"rbferre","9","13","20","29 December 2012"," I will need to watch it again
","Just watched it last night, and I have the impression I will need to watch it again to fully appreciate it. My first reaction was that this was an over ambitious project, and we should give kudos to producers/directors who decided to go for a movie with a $100M budget that does not really fit the typical model to guarantee their box office return.<br/><br/>It is not a movie for all kind of audiences as it is not easy to follow (although I think the editing helped us a lot) and the fact that different accents and dialects are spoken make your job a bit harder.<br/><br/>Having said that, it is a terrific idea, fairly well executed, with good performances by all actors (except Hugh Grant who just played...Hugh Grant as always). The only negative comment I have is that in a 3hr movie you should not leave with the impression that characters were not developed well enough. And I definitely felt that way in some of the stories (for example the first story we spend too much time watching the doctor trying to poison Burgess, while that time could have been employed better to develop the slave character). As a result of this underdevelopment, the film does not achieve the emotional level it aims for.<br/><br/>But clear correlations (and other not so clear which is good) among the stories exist to make the overall arch work effectively. References to older sci-fi movies are there, as a way to honor them. I thought this was also great. FInally, it is a sci-fi movie, yes, but which puts humanistic views in the first place. And make us think about souls, karma, God, cause- consequence. In one of the first scenes of the movie, it is said something like: ""If this was all created by God, what are the things we can and can not change? "". We are still trying to answer that question."
"AVass0812","1","93","186","29 October 2012"," Cloud Atlas should have stayed in the clouds....
","There is no simpler way of stating this. This movie was terrible. I lost 3 hours of my life watching this expecting something that was put together by the same group that handled the Matrix trilogy would be good, not great, but good. Nope, nada, nothing. Everything was wrong from the way the different time line stories were told, to the casting (who ever thought that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry would work together well on screen was high as the clouds). I honestly heard several people groan aloud and mumble ""where is this going?"". To my amusement, I shared in the same feeling...where was this going? I was awaiting for some sort of pivotal reconciling of all the different stories but nothing. Each ended as ridiculously has they began. It would've been better if it was like the Matrix and a ""re-set"" was done by the Oracle and the Director. Don't waste your time to see this. The acting was sub-par. In some instances it was quite comical to see Tom Hanks playing different parodies of himself. I honestly thought I'd see his character from Bosom Buddies showing up, but that was left to the antagonist character (aka Mr. Smith from the Matrix). Sad, just sad."
"jaychou_21","9","30","54","16 December 2012"," Tremendously overwhelming
","It is quite impossible to put into words how moving, breathtaking and thought-provoking this film is. Stupendous, ambitious and profound, ""Cloud Atlas"" is a once-in-a-lifetime movie of epic proportions.<br/><br/>Comprised of six interrelated stories from different times and places, the movie is about how people's lives are connected with and influence each other. It shows that an act of kindness goes a long way, and contemplates how our actions and decisions could eventually change the course of other people's lives. It is, in a way, an illustration of the six degrees of separation that fleshes out karma and reincarnation.<br/><br/>The film is structured as a sort of mosaic - the fragments of each of the six time periods scattered all throughout the movie, revisiting each narrative to propel the story into one humongous piece of art.<br/><br/>The complex story lines require utmost degree of attention and a deeper level of appreciation to be fully understood. In the long run, the perplexing narrative is not as complicated as it seems.<br/><br/>Though most people would find this three-hour mental exercise to be too confounding to the point of being burdensome, the attentive and emotionally attached will be gratefully rewarded. The film's metaphysical elements mixed with its sprawling visuals, awe-inspiring script, heartrending music, astonishing cinematography, amazing cast, and superior technical values offer a peculiar blend of cinematic nirvana, something I would call a beautiful entanglement that is better left untangled.<br/><br/>I expect this film to be in strong contention for the Academy Awards, particularly in the Make Up and Special Effects categories. I'm hoping though that its stars won't be overlooked, especially the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The actors play a multitude of contrasting characters it's like you're watching a grand stage play with extreme makeovers and multiple costume changes. The make-up was so well done you wouldn't recognize Halle Berry or Hugh Grant in some of their minor roles. (Make sure to watch the closing credits and you'd be pleasantly surprised to find out which characters each actor portrayed.) The ensemble cast is spectacular, and I'm particularly smitten by Jim Sturgess' and Doona Bae's performances. Their Neo Seoul love affair alone is enough reason for me to watch this movie again.<br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" is unlike any other film. It goes beyond your average movie-going experience as it defies cinematic conventions, transcends real-life preconceptions, reintroduces obscured emotions, and permeates the subconscious, leaving you tremendously overwhelmed.<br/><br/>With a $102 million USD budget, ""Cloud Atlas"" is one of the most expensive independent films of all time. It deserves not only to be seen, but more importantly, experienced. Go see this whenever you have the chance. You may not make any sense out of it, but the mere act of witnessing this out-of-this-world splendor is a dreamlike memory to behold."

","Were I to worry about our future, it would be less about all the horrors that await than our ability to reason about them. There is a rather short tether between this and wonder about what we are doing to long form narrative. My own story about who we are and where we came from rides on the back of long, complex multidimensional stories. It isn't language so much that drives evolution but what wonders we build with it. In my life I have witnessed our expected length of concept shrink from hours to minutes or even seconds. I blamed TeeVee, then internet trends.<br/><br/>So when I see a film constructed like this, my first suspicion is that the writers and viewers have entered into a pact: short episodes, high visual richness with an engaging, somewhat amusing hunt to find the celebrity behind the makeup. This would be a pact built on laziness and worlds too simple to live in: good guy, bad guy, savior. It would be a pact that allows us to use the length of sitting to convince ourselves that we understand stories like the grownups do. This is my first thought coming in and it puts me on guard.<br/><br/>And this is in spite of the presence of Tom Tykwer, who made ""Heaven,"" one of the most inferentially complex long form constructions I know. Here he directs three 15 minute films. Two are trivial. The 1936 era story is in fact structured after the fashion of Kieslowski, and could easily have served to make the rest matter if they had similar anchors in the world, anchors of unknown loss. God I wish he had written the whole thing.<br/><br/>The 2012 story is pretty darn good, too. Not because of what it contributes, which is just comic relief, but in the way it is told through references to other films. Included is the very cool notion that the film we see is the source of another, written by the guy within both. (We see a bit of this film in a later episode, shoehorned into the plot.)<br/><br/>These are just two out of six. The last two chronologically overwhelm the rest with childish simplicity, and manic emphasis. So it lacks many of the things that matter to me when I come to a film for sustenance. <br/><br/>But holy cow the art of how they are edited together is astonishing. Often I have some inside information about the process, but I have been working other things recently. So I just do not know whether the director-writers knew what they were doing ahead of time or some internal genius sorted it out. No matter; this is good craft and if you are in the mood to be swept up by it, it will work for you. It did for me.<br/><br/>Others have successfully pulled off this strategy of short episodes additive in some way to give us the value from long form. That value, by the way, is to be sufficiently incarnated in the thing that when changes in it occur, we change.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

It even goes as far as to lavish film critics and film elites everywhere. But I have to admit even... I... love Starbucks. So punk rock, anti-modernist, or hippie roots aside, this is still great coffee despite it's single flaw of domination.<br/><br/>If you don't know by now Tom Tyker of Run Lola Run and Perfume worked on this film.

So I encourage you to not shy away and look deeper as sometimes the best artwork has the most meanings.<br/><br/>On 9 stars: I couldn't give this the supreme ten star rating because there are some occasional scenes where the make up is a little fake. I just couldn't get past it. To be fair the ""bearer of the flaw"" makes up for it but to say why would give away some excitement.

Thematically speaking, the film adaptation of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas is about as spiritually and richly provocative as could be imagined. <br/><br/>With tour de force performances from every one of its actors is not merely a gimmick. Rather, the multiple roles are meant to illustrate the core themes about evolutionary nature and the actors do so in an exemplary fashion. This is a new form of storytelling that deftly weaves together six different plot lines across the same number of genres including adventure, romance, thriller and comedy. <br/><br/>The science fiction cyber-punk aspects also admirably blend across 1849 through 2346 far more effortlessly and seamlessly than one would think possible. <br/><br/>""I will not be subjected to criminal abuse,"" proclaims several of the protagonists. Each character's struggle for freedom is punctuated by their present day and past actions. <br/><br/>Whether or not Cloud Atlas gets a sufficient mass audience to feel the same way will depend upon many things. The world has become much more cynical. As villain Hugo Weaving says, ""There is a natural order to this world, and those who try to upend it do not fare well."" Indeed, this point is well-documented throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we belong to others.

To my knowledge, this type of storytelling hasn't been attempted in film before.

"cloudatlasfans","10","15","25","18 January 2013"," Cloud Atlas is a timeless rare, unique, beautiful, epic masterpiece!!
","Cloud Atlas is structured like a Russian nesting doll, with six interconnected narratives - spanning from the 1800's through the 1930's, the 1970's, the present 2012, the future 2144 of Seoul, and after the fall of the civilization in 2321, that invert and converge like a palindrome. Each story is so unique with its own rising action/climax/conclusion, yet they all connect through different themes.<br/><br/>These six stories have amazing connections that appear to be individually based, but grow in momentum to form one giant philosophical idea. Cloud Atlas explores the idea of an eternal soul that reincarnates through time and space in different parts of the world - no matter of race and gender - but based on the past actions, reborn and rejoins with lost loves, and remedy wrongs from the past. Everything is connected in Cloud Atlas, every line and detail - in one way or another. It's an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future.<br/><br/>People worry that the movie is confusing. It's not if you just get the concept: the same actor playing one soul in multiple parts, in different time periods. Because the concept is that what you do in a past life, is connected to consequences that might happen in your future life. (Many people who have seen the film didn't know the actors played multiple parts. That's definitely a proof of outstanding, brilliant makeup!) When you know all characters the same actor is playing, it will be easier to understand why the soul has been reincarnated into this person. It's not race-mixing, transsexual for fun. There's an important reason. The more times you see Cloud Atlas the more details and hidden messages you'll notice/discover and realize how all the stories and everything are connected to each other.<br/><br/>But I would also say it's a brainy movie for already open-minded human beings with a heart and some kind of depth in their bodies. It's definitely nothing for dumb, ignorant, narrow-minded people who can't think for themselves. It's a rare, unique, epic, beautiful, piece of art - in which you must be able to pay attention to details. The others better be sure to get the next Fast and Furious or Transformers movie, or just stick to their Twilight collection.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a movie that lets you reflect about your own actions, life, existence. It is an epic story of humankind in which the actions and consequences of our lives impact one another - throughout the past, present and future.<br/><br/>Regarding the Oscars 2013: I am so angry, disappointed and sad. Where the h*ll are all the Oscar nominations for Cloud Atlas?! It should at least have been nominated for Best film, Best directors, Best adapted screenplay, Best actors, Best actress, Best editing, Best cinematography, Best sound, Best visual effects and definitely Best original score and Best makeup! This is bullshit. That dumb, narrow minded, ignorant, shall...ow, senile academy jury is a joke.<br/><br/>The academy really had the chance to prove that they appreciate and reward good film making. Bringing something giant like Cloud Atlas to the big screen was bold, ambitious and not easy, but they succeeded on all levels. Cloud Atlas is a groundbreaking, rare, unique, beautiful, epic piece of art, and a film like this hasn't been made before and won't for many years to come. Cloud Atlas deserves so much more recognition and love.<br/><br/>Snubbing Cloud Atlas - one of the most bold, challenging and imaginative films of the 21st century is scandalous and awfully embarrassing. Shame on you academy! This is a joke. The end.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas has a blockbuster budget but is an independent film. That's why the marketing has been very lame and almost non-existent. Many people in America and around the world haven't even heard of this film! In my opinion the film opened in theaters to early after the trailer was released. A film like this needs time. If Cloud Atlas had premiered now - 6 months after the trailer was released in July last year. More people would have heard about this film, seen the trailer and go see it! Anyhow, even though it has gotten some negatives reviews by narrow minded critics, it has also gotten many incredible reviews. There are so many people who love Cloud Atlas, and it's a film that has touched so many people around the world in a way like no other film has done before - even changed people's lives. That's one of the best rewards a movie can get.<br/><br/>One more thing: Even though Cloud Atlas didn't get the Awards or Nominations it deserves, it will be that one film that I will forever hold dear to my heart."
"zetes","10","37","71","4 November 2012"," An enormous, ambitious film
","An outstanding achievement. I haven't read the novel (though I ordered it immediately after coming back from the film), but one can tell from the film that it was a behemoth as far as it came to the film adaptation. It's surprising that any director (or even any three directors) would see it and say, ""Yeah, I can do this."" Or that any studio would say, ""Yeah, that sounds like a good idea."" Judging by the box office, perhaps Warner Brothers made the wrong decision, but the directors have tackled their endeavor with vigor and produced a monstrous, beautiful, jaw-dropping film. The story covers six different time periods, from the mid-19th Century to who-knows how long after the end of human civilization as we know it. Each tale was at some point written down, and the characters in the next timeline are inspired and influenced by those stories. The novel is told in a sort of Russian nesting doll fashion, where the next story opens in the middle of the previous, and eventually get closed up at the end. The Wachowskis and Tykwer have taken Griffith's Intolerance as a model and have the stories flow in and out of each other. I can't say which one works better, but the film's version works wonderfully. I loved the ways they find links between the stories, themes or images. The best thing is all six of the stories are equally as wonderful, so I was never thinking ""When the Hell are we going to get back to the sci-fi story?"" or whatever. I was involved with the film from alpha to omega, and never for a second felt like it was too long (or even too short). There's also the gimmick of having the main cast appear throughout each of the stories (which is unique to the film version), often playing different genders and races. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are arguably the stars and probably have the most roles. South Korean actress Bae Doo-na is most memorable in her role as Sonmi-351, a fabricated human being in the 22nd Century. Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant, among others, also play multiple roles. The fact that this worked at all is amazing. That it works so well is a miracle. Definitely one of the best of the year."
"Hellmant","10","37","71","2 November 2012"," It keeps building and building until by film's end I was totally in love with it!
","'CLOUD ATLAS': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>This enormously ambitious epic Sci-Fi masterpiece is the type of life changing experience that's so inspirational and emotionally moving that it will forever change the lives of anyone who views it. That's my opinion but that's how I feel about all of my favorite films. This movie, like a lot of great films, is adapted from a book (of the same name). The book was written by David Mitchell and released in 2004 to high critical praise. It was admired greatly by Natalie Portman and brought to the attention of directors Andy and Lana Wachowski on the set of 'V FOR VENDETTA', a film the three were working on together in 2005. The Wachowski siblings loved it so much that they bought the rights to the film adaptation and promised Portman a lead role as a character named Sonmi-451. Portman had to give up the role, to actress Doona Bae, at the last second due to her pregnancy. An all star cast including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Keith David, Susan Sarandon and Hugo Weaving (a Wachowski regular) joined Bae in the cast (all playing multiple characters of different races and sexes). The Wachowskis teamed with German director Tom Tykwer (of 'RUN LOLA RUN' fame) to both write and direct the film. It consists of six interwoven stories that span from the 1849 Chatham Islands all the way to a future post-apocalyptic Earth. The Wachowskis directed three stories and Tykwer directed the other three (from a co-written script) using entirely different crews on different sets but with the same actors. The stories play out simultaneously in the film jumping back and forth constantly while only developing each one for minutes at a time (if that).<br/><br/>In the earliest story Sturgess plays Adam Ewing, an American lawyer who travels to the Chatham Islands in 1849 (from San Francisco) to finish a business deal for his father-in-law (Weaving). While there his heart goes out to a tribe of slaves, especially one who stows away on his ship (David Gyasi). The second story focuses on Robert Frobisher (Whishaw), a poor English musician in love with another man (D'Arcy) who's hired by a famous composer (Broadbent), in Scotland in 1936, to serve as his amanuensis. While working for the composer he develops his own musical masterpiece he calls 'The Cloud Atlas Sextet'. The third story tells the story of a journalist named Luisa Rey (Berry) who's assigned a story on a nuclear power plant in San Francisco in 1975. With the help of a nuclear physicist (D'Arcy playing the same role from the prior story, when he's much older) she uncovers a conspiracy plot involving the power plant and is marked for murder. The fourth story stars Broadbent once again, this time as a publicist named Timothy Cavendish (in 2012 United Kingdom) who's on the run from the mob friends of an author he published (Hanks), recently incarcerated for murder. He flees to his brother (Grant) for help and ends up locked up in a nursing home against his will, which he's bent on escaping from. The fifth story is set in future Korea in 2144 focusing on a clone named Sonmi-451 (Bae). Clones like her are slaves genetically engineered to serve in fast-food restaurants until they're no longer needed and killed. With the help of a young rebel (Sturgess playing an Asian, which has drew controversy) she escapes and brings about a revolution. The last story has Hanks starring as a tribesman named Zachry living in a primitive post-apocalyptic future, on an island in Hawaii, after most life has been wiped out. One of the last of the technologically advanced past, named Meronym (Berry), visits his tribe and saves his niece from dying (of illness). He agrees to guide her through the mountains to a post known as Cloud Atlas, where she can communicate with others who have left the planet. <br/><br/>I at first did not like the way the stories jumped around so quickly. I didn't think it left the viewer enough time to get to know the characters and storyline of one story before jumping to another, making it much more confusing (than if it had been told in a more linear fashion). By the films end though the non-linear style was much more of an advantage to the movie in pacing, excitement as well as emotional involvement. For a good half of the movie I was disappointed in it because it was impossible to follow and a little boring. As it kept moving along though it got more and more interesting and exciting and kept building and building until by film's end I was totally in love with it. The conclusion is such an emotionally drenched and inspiring finish that it makes the entire, nearly three hour movie, pay off. You also understand the film a lot more, from beginning to end, once it's finished. It still requires multiple viewings and I'll probably see it at least a couple more times. I'm sure upon repeat viewing I'll appreciate the earlier, slower paced, scenes much more (that's the sign of a great movie). The acting, cinematography, makeup, set design, effects, directing and writing are all top notch. The score is also amazing (by one of the directors, Tykwer, as well as Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil) and probably the best I've heard all year. For me movies are all about moments (just like life is). I go to movies in search of great moments and that's what makes it stand out or not. Those moments also make everything else in between that much more important (just like life as well). This movie is full of many great and beautiful moments and that's why it's such a beautiful and important film!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QlrJnwsHOM"

","I watched Cloud Atlas with high ambitions... 7,9 out of 10 from almost 70,000 viewers seemed to be a very good start. ""Directed by Tykwer and Machowski and with starring names like Tom Hanks, Hally Berry and Hugh Grand it has to be a masterpiece"", I thought to myself. (I must note here that I haven't read the book.) I couldn't be more wrong.. It goes on for three hours of uncontrollable blither, without actually having anything to say.. I was firmly disappointed by the stories, the plot and even, the act which was overall abstruse. The ideas the director was trying to pass were timeworn and unoriginal. During the unbearably continuous movie, I was trying to find even one good thing in it. I found nothing. I cannot see the reason why so many people claim it to be a masterpiece and a classic. In my opinion, this movie has been an absolute loss of my time."
"JonathanWalford","7","47","94","8 December 2012"," Highly entertaining Pseudo-intellectual mess
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film while I was watching it, but as soon as I left the theatre and began thinking about the plot, I became aware how the filmmakers had cobbled together the story from the book and left far too many plot holes open and used too many gimmicks. <br/><br/>""Intellectuals"" who think this film is a masterpiece will argue that you can't compare the film to the book, while using the book to shed light upon parts of the film that don't make sense without the background story from the book. Some say the film is about reincarnation, and that is how the film was sold in its promotion, but this is not the case because there are overlapping characters. The author of the book who said the only reincarnated character in the story is the central figure of each story and appears with a comet-shaped birthmark, except that two characters with that birthmark are alive at the same time.<br/><br/>I wouldn't normally give such a low rating to a film that, although flawed, is entertaining, but the film is getting obscenely high ratings from followers who won't look at this film critically, and find meaning where none exists. The simple message of this movie is that throughout time humans have and will continue to prey upon each other, in one way or another. This is a simple, straight forward thought and flows through all six stories. Looking for anything more meaningful than this is a waste of time and repeated watchings of the film, or reading the book is not going to make it more meaningful."
"siradamhenry","10","21","38","20 December 2012"," Still entranced one month after viewing
","This is one the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Obviously, this movie is not for everyone. By this point in time, word is out that this movie is incredibly complex, difficult to absorb, and unlike anything you've ever seen. This is a large part of the reason the film ""flopped"" and is considered to be a waste by many (meanwhile Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise continues to gross in the billions). From a film-student critical analysis, the movie fails because of it's refusal to adhere to many of the standard movie tricks that keep the viewer oriented...or even interested. The movie has no discernible rising action, the movie has no climax, and the movie certainly is void of any traditional resolution or conclusion.<br/><br/>The reason I feel that this movie is such a triumph is the same reason I feel I lead a fulfilling life. I strive to live in the moment...to view my journey in life as exactly that: a journey. Life is about experiencing, not arriving at a destination. Sure, Cloud Atlas's six stories very cleverly interweave similar events ands themes throughout; a reason why repeat viewings are not only advisable but absolutely necessary. There is also the fascinating acting and makeup from a set of actors reprising similar characters in each of the six stories. This feat alone is awe- inspiring as to how perfectly executed this was. MY point is that these stories are told with such mastery that the movie succeeds so completely if viewed from the perspective that it isn't necessarily going to ""arrive"" anywhere. It doesn't have to. I found myself hoping that the movie would never end, that the stories would just continue being told and experiencing all these beautiful moments...as that is where the most true joy of life itself comes from: experiencing this moment.<br/><br/>There is so much to be said thematically about these stories and the artful way in which they are told and then retold: human kind's triumph of it's kindness over greed, karma, the desire to be free, the tragedy of bondage, the inevitable progression of technology and it's consequences, the existence of deities, the urge to survive, and most of all, love. I am writing this having seen the movie only once. After a second viewing I suspect I will take notice of even more clever connections between the stories and characters, and the same for my third viewing and so on.<br/><br/>Anyone who dismissed this film as ""overly-complicated"", ""confusing"", or ""disorganized"" has simply not yet arrived at the realization that life isn't about some grand finale. Learn to be present, then you will see the genius of Cloud Atlas, and hopefully, life."
"yellowporpoise","9","20","36","15 November 2012"," Wonderful movie
","During the first 20 minutes of the movie, I had no idea if this evening would end with a big disappointment. I have seen the different threads of the story developing and needed time to get used to it. But I am glad, that I did trust the directors, that they would know where this journey would lead. After the screening, no one was willing to get up. They all waited till the end of the closing credits. It was a weird but great movie experience. As far as I thought about this movie yet, everything made sense. Not on the first glimpse, but on the second or third. It is a well elaborated story and it is amazing, that all those story-threads, time lines and so on, fitted together. Some directors are over-challenged with two separate story lines. At the end: I did not like the part with the devil. It reminded me of ""Faust"" and could have been illustrated in a different way. Over all a great movie, that will be watched again by myself. <br/><br/>Btw. In Germany six year old could have watch this movie, if accompanied by their parents. This is not appropriate, because of the blood and brain splattered on the wall and the cutting of throats, the sex scenes."
"johannesmilling","9","17","30","27 January 2013"," A rare piece of intelligent greatness
","I just finished watching this not more than ten minutes ago, and my heart is still pounding. To me this was one of the most intelligent, well-made and inspiring films since... well since ever. It's almost reluctantly that I don't give it a full ten, but I may up the score after a few more views. Because this is a film that I need to watch again. Not simply to grasp some of the many, many well-hidden details, but also because I already want to see it one more time.<br/><br/>So where to start? If you don't mind letting go of the conventional way of being told a story, where scenes follow time rather than purpose, this is a movie for you. If you try to connect the dots from the beginning you will simply become confused. The story doesn't unfold until the end, and this is one of the things which make the movie so very rewarding. I could sense the impact it would have on me throughout the film, only to have my wishes realized once it reached the end.<br/><br/>Visually it's stunning. The make-up is as good as it gets. Not because the make-up artists succeed to hide the true actor behind the make-up, but because they transform the actors while allowing the viewer to see which other characters he or she are playing, thus being able to connect them to one Another, which in my mind is essential to the movie. And most actors do play a multitude of parts in this film. The rest of the special effects also serve well to bring to life the creators vivid visions without stealing the show or wrecking it.<br/><br/>In addition to great storytelling and visual effects, the film has a message (or messages) more daring and relevant than almost any recent Hollywood release. I'm not entirely sure that all of the messages will reach all the viewers though, so I find myself torn. On one hand, I love the fact that the morals aren't being handed to you on a silver platter. It makes me feel like I have accomplished something. On the other hand, some of the more important morals may go unnoticed for some. There are however more obvious points which can hardly be missed. But these are somewhat more conventional. Sorry for being vague, but I don't want to say any more to spoil it. :) <br/><br/>I feel I have already taken up too much time. The film may not be for everyone. But give it a chance. Those of you who will like it, will probably also love it, and may find yourselves truly affected by it as I have been."

Each story is so unique with its own rising action/climax/conclusion, yet they all connect through different themes.<br/><br/>The more times you see Cloud Atlas, the more details you'll﻿ notice and realize how it's all connected to each other.

"billygoat1071","8","16","28","6 December 2012"," Extravagant Pieces
","As seen in the five minute trailer, Cloud Atlas is clearly about reincarnation. It is connected in six stories, in six eras, with six different genres. It begins with Adventure, Drama, Thriller, Comedy, Sci-Fi Action, and lastly Fantasy. The film also runs in almost three hours. It sounds like it's gonna be an epic thrill ride. To be honest, I'm not familiar with David Mitchell's book that this is based on. Some might not expect that all the stories are told in a complex way. They are not back to back segments. Though, they can be all pretty entertaining and gorgeous to look at, but it will still give you a strange mind perplex.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is not subtle enough for its concept but you'll still get a mind perplex effect after seeing it. The stories are not told in an easy back-to-back manner. Each stories are told simultaneously for one scene to another. The film has three directors. The Wachowskis has the fantasy, adventure, and action stories. ""An Orison of Sonmi~451"" is a pure ""Wachowski"" with their trademark visual designs and action scenes. The intro of the story is intriguing then further more it gets coated on the clashing chases. The ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"" sequence is fantastic to look at with a strange camp and whimsy that is so fascinating.<br/><br/>Tom Tykwer takes the non-fantasy dramas that also posses some great performances. ""Letters from Zedelghem"" is ought to be depressing. The merit there goes to Ben Whishaw who placed genuine emotion to the tale. ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" segment is fun, mostly because of its quirky direction and Jim Broadbent's delighting portrayal of the character. It's funny because of all the climaxes, this one has the most exciting.<br/><br/>For the rest of the performances, Tom Hanks usually appears as a Scottish/Irish scum, but he finally plays his earnest self in the rest. Hugo Weaving effectively uses his villainy menace, no matter what race or gender he is in. Hugh Grant has the same feat with Weaving but in a more tool type.<br/><br/>For its filmmaking, it's undeniably incredible. The costumes, makeup, and visual effects made everything so magnificent. These things alone can already make this film worth a watch. The music score is stirringly magnetic. The visuals are breathtaking. The makeup is a bit silly but still great.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is indeed extravagant. It's watchable as long as if you can take its peculiarity. It's large and long, but it will still take a bit of thinking about the connections of the stories. The entertainment and fascination is unobjectionable. The technical achievement is remarkably amazing. The filmmakers did their job well enough by their ambition. It seems like it's a serious challenge to make a film like this. Cloud Atlas is thoroughly strange but it's quite marvelous."
"Matt_Layden","9","16","28","7 November 2012"," The Best Picture To Not Win Best Picture This Year
","How does one describe Cloud Atlas? Indescribable is a good place to start. Here we have the most ambitious film of the year, probably of the decade (yes, I'm including you Avatar) and there is simply no way to describe it. What I can tell you is that the film explores 6 different stories spanning a vast amount of time and space. Connected to each story is the soul, love, death and life that encompasses us all. Cloud Atlas isn't here to obey narrative structure, classically filmmaking nor does it try to please the masses. It's simply an experience, a dream like experience that will stay with you long after you witness it. <br/><br/>The Wachowski Siblings and Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) embark on a journey and ask us, the viewer to go on that journey with them. This journey isn't supposed to make some kind of logical sense, or have a sense of familiarity. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. Our lives in this world are small in nature, big in scope. If you want to witness something fresh, exciting that pushes the boundaries and makes you think, then see Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>Prometheus was suppose to be the film of the year that made us ponder about our existence and what lies beyond our own world. It failed. Where that film fails, Cloud Atlas succeeds. Abandon the idea that the film is 6 stories and accept that it is one. Each segment blends itself into the next. Some people will try and fail, to see literal connections between each one. We are connected by love, life and death, wanting to see more of a connection between each segment will have you hating everything. This film is not a typical film. We are not given ten minutes of each segment before going onto the next. The film is not told that way, instead it is brilliantly edited to the beat of a heart, the notes on a music sheet, the breaths we take. It's flawless in its presentation. <br/><br/>Can a killer in one story, be a hero in another? Played by the same actor, is this the same soul? There is without a doubt, one image that connects every segment. It's a birthmark in the shape of a shooting star/comet. Is this the same person, reincarnated in the next life? The film won't answer your questions, it doesn't want to, or even need to. <br/><br/>Having those actors play several roles is an inspired choice. Half the joy of the film is discover who is playing which character. By the credits, all is revealed and some are a shock to see. The make-up effects are astounding. Well recognizable actors disappear behind the make- up, changing sex or race. One hiccup, if I may say, is that we still cannot age our actors correctly. Hugh Grant looks like he is wearing a mask, instead of playing Jim Broadbent's brother. <br/><br/>Clocking in at just under 3 hours, the film may seem like a chore to get through, especially considering the amount of stories and characters is has to cover, but not once did I ever think the film was too long. Some stories do drag more than others, but never once did I think it was boring. We are too busy interweaving through time to be bored. If you are looking at this movie in terms of acting, writing, directing, you are looking at it wrong. <br/><br/>Will there be another film like Cloud Atlas? Maybe. But the general movie going public isn't ready for a film like this. This is a polarizing film, it has to be, it needs to be, otherwise it doesn't work."

","This is a remarkable movie that is completely actor driven. This movie showcases the talents of all the principal performers. Each one plays multiple roles, some cross-racial, others cross-gender. Their performances are uniformly great. This has to be Tom Hanks' best movie in years, and the same goes for Halle Berry. The story itself is unique and complex, which is both good and not so good. Good because it tries to show the interconnectedness of human beings that transcends time; not so good because in trying to tell such a story, it seems to bite off more than it can chew, meaning that the story after awhile becomes a little mushy. Nevertheless, that's a minor drawback that does not in any way detract from the magnificent performances of the actors throughout the film. To me, a story should have a tight structure; in this movie the producers have opted for a broader approach, which though impressive never quite achieves the level of spectacular. The reason for that is not because of the story itself but because of the structure of the film which is rife with parallel editing which does not quite succeed in keeping the story on track. Hence the storyline unravels. But with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry each doing six rolls, one still leaves the theatre with a feeling that this movie is a unique cinematic event."

","With a tone of told-you-so pomposity, ""folly"" is the go-to term used by professional critics with regard to risky big-budget films with disappointing box office returns. Cloud Atlas is no folly. Yes, it is vast in architecture and ambition, but it is also profound and lyrical. I wonder if those journalists who dismiss it as pretentious and/or shallow and focus on mocking its prosthetics shouldn't revisit the idea of what film is for, and remember the art of suspending disbelief in the service of the imagination.<br/><br/>David Mitchell's novel (which I've not read) has been adapted for the screen by three writer-directors: Andy and Lana Wachowski, of The Matrix and Bound fame, and Tom Tykwer, most famous for the films Perfume and Run Lola Run. (Like a modern-day John Carpenter, Twyker also worked as composer on Cloud Atlas.) Together they've created a three-hour movie composed of myriad stories spanning different time periods. The actors - Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Wishaw, Jim Broadbent et al - each play different characters throughout these stories, regardless of age, race or gender. It's a conceit that works because it is a film about the connectedness of humanity, and it embraces its own preposterousness with a consistent joviality.<br/><br/>At three hours, the film is never dull. In fact, if anything, I felt some sequences could have done with some fleshing out. Perhaps a five- hour director's cut is on the cards. The stories are spliced together, often overlapping in dialogue and incident, and the effect is beguiling yet coherent. A portmanteau film is only as good as its weakest story, and thankfully none of the stories are weak. Even the most generic fable - ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing"", set upon the high seas of the pre-Thirteenth Amendment Americas - gets its moment, providing the film with its affecting finale.<br/><br/>As the stories unfold, one becomes aware that they not only linked by blood but also by theme: the freedom of the individual against the backdrop of the freedom of civilisations. A shambling breakout from an old people's home (with Hugo Weaving as a Nurse Ratched-esque overseer) is offered equal triumph to a hoverbike escape from a 22nd century Neo Seoul in the throes of a fascist lockdown. The secular free will of our species - what some would call a ""human spirit"" - transcends time and space and the arbitrary genetic borders it is in our nature to overcome.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is the kind of rampant, deliriously overreaching cinema whose story is felt as much as it is followed. You'll find flaws abundant (the filmmakers do trample the line between ideas and gimmickry at times), but every one is vanquished by a shot or line or scene that lands perfectly on its feet. Besides, with a tapestry this broad and elegant, it's not about the individual stitches, it's about the dazzling whole."

"master_radmore","1","42","86","2 November 2012"," Lack of skill and competence from the Director!
","I'll start with the positive: Overall the acting was of a good standard. The concept of the story line had so much potential! Now the negatives: From beginning to end I was frustrated, annoyed and confused. I have never walked out of a film before, but this was nearly the first. Frustrated because the director thought it was OK to randomly skip between the past, present and future with no introduction or lead in. Trying to follow the story of maybe 10 characters who apparently have a connection throughout the film required photographic memorey, they just simply did not. I was annoyed with the fact that the Director obviously thought he was doing a good job. Confused. Now I like films that have confusing and somewhat difficult story lines (Inception, Shutter Island and The Matrix etc), I am often explaining the story to my friends in the cinema, and I always walk away happy from them because I feel the Director had done a excellent job in bringing the story together in some form of conclusion or hidden finale.<br/><br/>The random story lines do not link up at all. They are completely random and have no form of sequence or chronological order. Nothing that held maybe a ounce of importance in the film was explained or introduced with any calibre. The fact that the main actors played different roles and characters throughout the film was a complete flop. The fact that the characters spoke some unknown made up English dialect made understanding some dialog just aggravating.<br/><br/>100,000,000USD! - Should have been invested in re-newable energy & fighting cancer!"
"aequus314","1","40","82","19 January 2013"," Unless you want to spend $12 on mind rape in the cinema, don't bother.
","First off; the novel by David Mitchell must be reviewed separately because the recording arts (cinema) must be differentiated from the representational arts (literature) by virtue of medium and also, I haven't read it.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas will divide audiences into three camps; you will 1) like it for it what appears to be profundity, 2) dislike it for what appears to be complexity or 3) dislike it for what appears to be intellectual dishonesty. <br/><br/>Just to be clear, its directors have rebutted those belonging to the second camp with responses that imply ignorance on the part of viewers and critics. But their reactions cannot be further from the truth because this film, is not as abstract as they imagine it to be. <br/><br/>Since Cloud Atlas is adapted from a novel; those who believe (or argue) that if, a work of art has reached full artistic expression in one form, an adaptation will inevitably be inferior The Coen Brothers' 2007 masterpiece No Country For Old Men and Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange are proofs that such belief simply isn't true--it can be done.<br/><br/>**************************** <br/><br/>This convoluted mess can be summarized with voice overs from three characters: Isaac Sachs (Tom Hanks) on determinism, Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) and Sonmi (Doona Bae) on consciousness in the realm of quantum physics. <br/><br/>The execution is so pretentious that it makes The Man From Earth look like great cinema, and reduces David Hume's lifelong inquiry into causality resemble middle-school homework. I am surprised that it is written by creators of The Matrix. <br/><br/>Andy and Lana Wachowski claimed their vision of Cloud Atlas is ""cinematic art"". And if their claim is true, then Cloud Atlas is poor quality of the elite abstractionist tendency. <br/><br/>The gist of it is: interactive collaboration between both parties (artists and observers) is critical. And with Cloud Atlas; attention is solely focused on the directors' obscure vision and fallacious theme (debunked in causal determinism inquiry), with no heed whatsoever being paid to observers who reward their so called ""art"" with viewership. The Wachowskis are making mockery out of 1) cineliteracy, 2) rigorous directors (Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Jean-Luc Godard, Michael Haneke) and 3) movie goers who actually respect and love film aesthetics. <br/><br/>The snobbery so implicit in Cloud Atlas reeks of bad manners and ethics.<br/><br/>**************************** <br/><br/>Basically free will is impossible unless Isaac Sachs is conjuring the universe as he lives, or he is (and everybody else are) all part of the same consciousness experiencing different strands of existence simultaneously. <br/><br/>This is the whole shebang of what Sonmi blabbers about in the last act but here is the clincher: the disappointing thing about Cloud Atlas-- unlike films that attempt to explain the WHYs with coherent rhetoric and narratives(Synecdoche New York); all they ever do with this adaptation is regurgitate pop-philosophy by having characters echo WHAT their views on causality are, and CONCLUDE with deliberately vague gibbering without so much as a credible premise USING CINEMATIC LANGUAGE.<br/><br/>This film is not the least bit original, inventive or thought provoking--it is offensive that its filmmakers imply artistic inferiority in those who dislike it.<br/><br/>**************************** <br/><br/>Besides its core message on causal determinism (cause-effect), there are a few points worth noting. <br/><br/>Number One: Story begins with montages that defy linear timelines for no good reason. For better examples, see Memento and Amour for how timelines are manipulated to advantage. Save yourself the effort of trying to understand the structure because no thoughts were being invested to its form and function. <br/><br/>This film's (jagged and broken) non-linear editing is a cop-out passing off as being ""abstract""; for the challenging task of fusing six stories in one graceful, coherent tapestry. <br/><br/>The real shame is; if done right, this tapestry serves as symbolic simultaneity between two entities--the consciousness and the cinema. <br/><br/>Potential in an elegant rhetorical device is squandered blindly. <br/><br/>**************************** <br/><br/>Number Two: Dialogues, especially the ones set in post-apocalyptic earth (Tom Hanks and Halle Berry) are written in seemingly undecipherable connotative symbols. By that I mean: 1) centri = centre and thus ""eurocentric"" = centered on Europe, 2) pute = think and thus ""impute"" = to attribute, to think of as. <br/><br/>No prize for guessing what ""cog"" actually means. <br/><br/>This pattern manifests again in the third act of Neo Seoul segment when The Archivist lambastes at Sonmi, and spouts new terminologies such as ""corprocrats"", ""psychogenomicist"". But don't be floored, the gesture is Cloud Atlas's idea of creative ""originality""--a reference to emerging transdiscplinary trends in the sciences. <br/><br/>**************************** <br/><br/>Number Three (Ockham's Razor Fail): Install a dictionary app on your smart phone before watching because they wrote the script using thesauruses--opting for redundant ten dollar words over simple vocabulary.<br/><br/>****************************<br/><br/>Number Four: See Carlos Castaneda and Alexander Solzhenitsyn for uppity parallelisms in this film if; after all the negative reviews from respectable critics, for one reason or another, you find yourself with three vacant hours insignificant enough to exercise mental gymnastics in futility. <br/><br/>Unless you want to be mind raped, this film isn't worth a damn.<br/><br/>****************************<br/><br/>Bottom line; big, relative, complex, transcendental subjects (physics and philosophy) are best reserved for directors with wit enough to shoulder the ethical weight of exploring such life changing themes. Why let the promise of visual effects and Hollywood casts seduce you into enabling such film making tactics? Wait for it to air on TV if you are genuinely curious about the hype this film has been generating.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is an annoying metafilm about metaphysical philosophy. The result is epic tomfoolery."

In between, I endured three hours of dross. My wife quit after one hour but I foolishly stuck with it in the vain hope that something meaningful might eventually be revealed. The most meaningful revelation was in the closing titles, when I realised I had failed to spot that Nurse Noakes was Hugo W.

World cinema is full of truly great movies, and I was lucky enough to watch two of them on the long trip from London to Australia. Unfortunately this stood out as the exception.<br/><br/>The use of interlocking themes is not new, and there are numerous excellent examples, but in these the links make sense, and go beyond recycling a set of big name actors with elaborate make-up and prosthetics, or speaking silly invented languages. Such movies need to be tight, engaging, compelling, and not a weary yawnfest.<br/><br/>Ultimately, making this rambling assembly of disjointed half-baked ideas at this huge length was a total indulgence by its directors. Why did it receive zero Oscar nominations? Because the Academy is not composed of complete idiots, that's why, OK?"

","This movie really does have something for everyone. However, many will be turned off by one or both of the movies difficult aspects. 1. The movie is too long. At almost three hours, this can be a tough one to sit still for, especially due to... 2. This movie has six stories. With so much going on, it's difficult to want to miss anything for fear of not seeing a critical plot point. This being said, everyone should see this. Whether it be the stories, the characters, the settings, the CG, the makeup, or the actors, there will be something you can not only like, but appreciate about this movies. The stories are interconnected more through concept than through actual relation to each other in their worlds. Each exhibits themes of freedom, interdependence, discovery, achievement, and love. The stories, while all different, share these themes together throughout the movies. I won't spoil any but my personal favorite was the one about the aspiring composer. Probably the most breathtaking part about the movie is the actors and their costumes. Each of the main actors plays at least one role in each section of the movie, if not more. Some have subtle changes, like altering a hair style or type of clothing. Others are incredible changes, crossing the boundaries of ethnicity, race, and even gender. At the end, the credits show which characters each cast member plays. If you can identify half of them throughout the movie, you've got keener eyes than me. I would love to go on and on, but again, you need to see this for yourself. Please don't give up on it due to the length. I know it may seem confusing, but don't try to rack your brains too much. Again, the stories are not intertwined as much as you may think. Focus on the concepts, not how one story has an effect on the others."
"bh-runner","3","30","60","12 November 2012"," The film turned the novel's nuanced exposition of the human condition into a sentimental bowl of mush
","The film is a valiant attempt to wrestle the complex web of stories in the novel into a film that holds the viewers attention, builds suspense, preserves the story lines and drives home the philosophical themes from the excellent novel. It was largely successful from my vantage point, having read the novel beforehand. My strongest objection to the film is that it sentimentalizes many of the characters and stories from the novel, and in doing so, interjects the idea that ""love is all you need"" (I half-expected Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe"") to break out in the Beatles song at some point). So if you like philosophical musings, and don't mind a sprinkling of sugar on them, and you're good at following multiple story lines (6) as they zip in and out and back again several times, then you might enjoy this film. The spoilers follow as I list the film's transgressions against the novel for those who are interested:<br/><br/>The film turned Robert Frobisher from the brilliant misfit and scoundrel in the novel into a devoted, fawning apprentice, whose suicide was prompted not by the inevitable tragic and overwhelming humiliation he brought upon himself, but by his accidental shooting of his mentor. <br/><br/>Timothy Cavendish ends his part in the film in the arms of his first love, whereas the novel doesn't even hint at such an ending.<br/><br/>The most blatant and grievous corruption of the novel takes place in the story of Somni-451. In the novel, the government cynically uses her in an elaborate scheme to set her up as an example of what happens to anyone who challenges the system, and though it turns out that she was wise to their deception the whole time, she plays along so that she can express her outrage and her principles in the hope that it will make a difference after she is dead. It's a thrilling story of deception within deception within deception, but the film turns it into a mushy love story with grandiose tragic heroes. Yuck.<br/><br/>The novel's post-apocalyptic story of Zachary ends with a bunch of primitive people staring at a hologram of Somni-451 telling her story in a language that they can't understand - the world ends in a whimper. But the film turns this ending into mush, as the hero Zachary is rewarded with a passel of grandkids from his union with the hot Prescient woman. <br/><br/>All in all, this added layer of sentimentality in the film left me very unsatisfied and with a slightly acrid, saccharin taste in my mouth."

At leas I don't think so, this is a love or hate movie, I loved it and I don't care. The movie was , emotional and just damn brilliant. Easily the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>How do I talk about this movie? how? I do not know how to, it's hard to describe it. It is something you have to see for yourself. It's basically about reincarnation and how what we do with our lives, affects the future and how everything is connected. It literally goes deep into the philosophy of human nature, if philosophy is your thing look no further. The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer all did a phenomenal job on it. <br/><br/>The film is strange, quirky and yet beautiful, not to mention it was interesting seeing how the actors and actresses played all these multiple roles. It was also quite clever. The movie has action, romance and humor.

"xamtaro","9","4","5","19 September 2013"," Magnificent
","Cloud Atlas is possibly one of the trickiest movies to review. Here is a case of either you ""get it"" or not. It is by no means a typical drama. Here is a movie that encompasses so much of the emotional spectrum, transcending the very genre of what a movie is meant to be like.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis (creators of the Matrix Trilogy) deliver yet another thinking man's mind bomb via this narratively faithful but structurally different adaptation of David Mitchell's award winning novel. In the novel, each of the 6 interconnected stories are presented as a tale within a tale; the first story taking place in 18th century is presented as a lost diary that the protagonist of the second story finds. Likewise the second story is presented as a series of letters read by a supporting character in the 3rd story. What the Wachowski siblings do instead is present the stories as running parallel to each other, joined by thematic similarities within their narrative. Themes of love, loss, hope, despair, revelation, rebellion, defeat and triumph connect the scenes from each story which in themselves influence on another.<br/><br/>Yes, those initiated to non-sequential storytelling would be left lost. Each story follows a set genre style too. At one moment we follow a 19th century lawyer named Adam Ewing on his journey home to england from America, his fateful choice involving a stowaway slave.. The next we hop to 1936 as Robert Frobisher, a bisexual aspiring musician starts working on his masterpiece, the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"" while his mentor seeks to claim credit for it. Then we get a great tribute to pulp spy thrillers in 70s and see the exploits of reporter Luisa Rey as she tries to uncover a conspiracy involving nuclear research and runs into some people seeking to silence her. Punctuating these more serious stories is the present day comedic ordeal of elderly Michael Cavendish as he is tricked into ""incarceration"" at a spartan nursing home and how he continually tries to find a way to escape.From the present to the far future, a clone slave named Somni bears witness to untold horrors in a so called Utopian world, thus fueling a rebel movement through the power of the media. And finally, during earth's last days, an era where cannibals rule the land, one unlikely couple seeks to escape their fate.<br/><br/>For fans of the Wachowskis' work, there are many similarities with this and the Matrix. In all those stories, the central theme involves an imposed restriction and how an individual tries to break out from that restriction. Their act of defying the status quo would echo in the years to come and live on to inspire other such acts. Similar scenes are thus thematically juxtaposed and infused with bits of philosophy, not unlike The Matrix trilogy. Slavery, a desire for the truth, breaking free, futile rebellion, defeat but ultimately vindication. That similarity is most apparent in the Somni story, which could just as well be ""The Matrix ver 2.0"". With startling special effects, tremendous amount of thought which went into replicating the environments, tone, clothing and designs of each unique time period.<br/><br/>The all star cast brings their ""A"" game to screen delivering award winning performances. Even though we have so many characters to follow, the emotional connection is formed almost immediately. Adding an element of fun to this movie is the ongoing game of ""guess that face"", as the actors play multiple roles across the various time periods. Sometimes they even play against type and against gender. Accompanying this time spanning epic is a emotionally powerful music score by Tom Tykwer, Johnny Kilmek and Reinold Heil. It is a simple melody which, like the movie, is performed in a variety of styles that matches the tone and time period of the scene.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas will draw you in and thrill you as much as baffle you. One can only hope that the DVD or blu-ray release comes with both this ingeniously structured theatrical cut and ""regular cut"" which places the stories in chronological order (for those who can't follow flashback/flashforwards). With all the spectacle of a big budget blockbuster and the overall feel of a complex artsy film, Cloud Atlas is ambitious in challenging the norms of filmaking. Hopefully, its success will inspire generations to come."
"Fredcusimano09","10","4","5","7 September 2013"," Excellent film that surprised me by its quality and shocked me with its intelligence.
","I had no knowledge of Cloud Atlas until the winter of 2013 when I read a story in The New Yorker magazine about the film. The article piqued my interest but since it was an older issue I had already missed the release date and the movie was no longer playing in theaters. While at the beach this summer and with nothing else to do on a rainy day, I watched it out of boredom. Words that described how I felt when it was over included amazement,joy,and utter fascination. I can't remember when I last saw such a compelling and thought-provoking movie. I was mesmerized for the near 3 hour running time and watched it again the next day just to hear the incredible lines and experience again the flow of the stories. This is movie-making at its best and will transport you to other times and places. Great story (ies), superb acting, wonderful music, amazing make-up and sets, etc., etc. Cloud Atlas has it all. The mark of a good film, in my humble opinion, is its ability to stick with the viewer when it's over and make them think about the story. However, a great film induces thoughts that go beyond the story. Great films will motivate the viewer to extrapolate themes and characterizations embedded in the film to other aspects of their life. They'll make you apply those themes to your own existence. Cloud Atlas did that for me. I'll never forget it!"
"matsnowie","9","4","5","5 September 2013"," Hard to sell, hard to describe, because it's hard to reduce.
","""Remarkable,"" ""Convoluted,"" ""Entertaining,"" ""Sprawling,"" ""Masterful,"" ""Transcendant,"" and ""Guaranteed to divide."" Those are the words the critics have been using about Cloud Atlas. I prefer what was said by the film's three directors, Tom Tykwer, Lana Wachoswki, and Andy Wachowski, when they premiered the six-minute first trailer: ""It's hard to sell, hard to describe, because it's hard to reduce.""<br/><br/>Based on the highly-acclaimed (and highly-recommended) novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas is not one 3-hour movie much like the novel is not one 500-page book. It is actually a collection of six 30-minute movies spread across time, space, and genre. These short films have been chopped up and spliced together with interruptions and mid-sentence stops, with voice-overs carrying across multiple stories, and with connections both explicit and implicit. It is an ambitious and unusual film, but unlike other attempts to create grand scope and provoke philosophical debate, Cloud Atlas is also wonderfully fun and entertaining. Tree of Life is an attempt to interweave different eras and themes, but for all its artistic quality it is still a cure for insomnia. But Cloud Atlas' directors (creators of The Matrix and Run Lola Run) are eager to entertain, and for all the ambition driving the film it never forgets to tell a good narrative.<br/><br/>The ambition of the project is only clearer when the cast is considered. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant are among the main cast, and every one plays at least three parts. Several of the actors, including Tom Hanks, actually play six parts; one role for each section of Cloud Atlas, playing different personalities, different races, and even different genders.<br/><br/>In these six sections the film covers all the major genres and time periods: a dying doctor on a pacific voyage in 1849, letters from a composer to his lover in pre-war Europe, a conspiracy thriller in the 1970s, a modern-day comedy of a publisher committed to a nursing home, the future rebellion of a clone in Korea, and the post-apocalyptic survival story of a tribe living on Hawaii. Taken alone, any of these stories would be worthy films, but taken together they become part of a larger work that is offered up to the audience for their interpretation.<br/><br/>Unlike in the book, one of my favourite sections is the earliest, the 1849 travel of Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) as he is being cared for by Dr. Henry Goose. The eccentric doctor is brought to life by Tom Hanks, and is one of the best examples in the film of how the casting adds new levels of enjoyment to the stories. Like a blockbuster adaptation of ""Where's Waldo?"" it is a lot of fun trying to spot all the famous faces hidden under the make-up. At the end of the film the credits include the answer-key with all the actors' characters showing up alongside their name, and its likely that a few will come as a surprise.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a film like The Avengers in that the people who like it and the people who don't like it will probably be saying the same thing; ""So massive,"" and ""Too massive,"" are reviews from personal taste. I've met people who hate Casablanca or The Fighter, but praise Valentine's Day for its originality, and I think those people are idiots. But that's my personal opinion. It's impossible to make a film that everyone likes, and Cloud Atlas is not for everyone. It is 3- hours, after all, and there is violence and romance alongside foul language and futuristic slang. Fans of Hugh Grant may find it difficult to see the rom-com leading man in the same light after seeing him play the warrior chief of a tribe of cannibals. But, for the other side of the audience, this film includes Hugh Grant playing the warrior chief of a tribe of cannibals! Depending on how you approach that line (exclamation point or period) might tell you if Cloud Atlas is a film you will enjoy.<br/><br/>The best I can say is that I enjoyed it. When I wasn't enjoying the characters and their stories, I enjoyed the filmmaking. When I wasn't enjoying the filmmaking, I enjoyed the music. There was never a moment where I felt the film was dragging too long, skipping over something important, or failing to hold my attention. It is a sprawling epic in the best way, and I highly recommend giving it the opportunity to surprise you.<br/><br/>http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2012/11/published-in-navigator.html"

The acting is at its premium as it features several talented actors, including Hanks, Weaving, Halle Berry, and Jim Sturgess just to name a few, who melt into each of their several characters that encapsulate six time-lines spanning from 1843 all the way to 2346. There are several small details, including the comet-shaped birthmark and lines like ""but what is an ocean but a multitude of drops"", that will reward the viewer with a sense of accomplishment if they pay close attention to such details. The rapid pacing of the film is squandered by the presentation in which it presents several time-lines at once and not present each time-line one at a time. The means to present the adaptation of the book in a movie format is understandable, but it should not have to compromise the core structure that the book previously had, which would have made the film more presentable in a similar style to ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>The general arc of Mankind, which transforms from a group of people that is willing to con their way into riches to a group of people that is willing to save its own kind in the most troublesome of times despite the temptations of society, is remarkably portrayed by Tom Hanks. The same can be said for the portrayal of Society, wonderfully acted by Hugo Weaving, which has an order to keep in spite of the many rebels that attempt to break the many conventions of society as it merely watches itself crumble in its own shambles of lies, secrets and eventual pending doom in the 2346 time-line.<br/><br/>For the casual viewer, the cluttered presentation can be troublesome at times as the viewer has to be in a mindset to ""watch a book"" and not watch the film for fun. However, for the thinking and logical man, this type of audience will be highly engrossed by the many themes and subtle details of the film and will be left to ponder about topics that include Reincarnation, Karma, and Salvation needed to break conventions of society and its natural order that society (or Hugo Weaving) needs to be preserved.<br/><br/>I will give this movie a (Bowl of Caviar) out of 10."

"divinours","8","4","5","25 March 2013"," Commendable adaptation
","Having read the book, I was on familiar grounds from the start and could probably better appreciate the movie's qualities than spectators who had to adapt to the storytelling concept 'from scratch'. That being said, having read the book also lowered my expectations somewhat, since no movie can ever rival a book for such things as, e.g., philosophical reflection or character development - and this is particularly true for a novel such as Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>There is some ""dumbing down"" of the book's message. The book reflects on the nature of Man, and on how mankind's strengths and weaknesses bring about a never-ending ebb and flow of civilizations that, despite their apparent differences, are built on similar patterns of power and control. The movie translates this into how people exist for and through others, in their time but also in the past and future. The book also introduced connections between protagonists (the birthmark, elements of a storyline mentioned in other ones) so the movie's message, though over-simplified, is adequate. The same can be said about the other liberties the directors took with respect to the novel - they can be understood in the light of the target audience (broader for a movie than for a novel) and the medium. Only the Frobisher story, one of my favorite in the book, badly betrays the novel, making Frobisher's suicide seem pointless. Then again, the epistolary style of the corresponding book part and Frobisher's bittersweet reflections are not easily translated into film...<br/><br/>Apart from that, the adaptation of this reportedly unadaptable novel is commendable. The directors' choice of interweaving the story lines deviates from the novel but works very well, with neat visual analogies between plots. Clearly, lots of thought has gone into the subdivision and alignment of story lines, giving the movie a very polished feel. The actors are perfect and the makeups are an impressive achievement (some of the Male/Female-Caucasian/Asian morphs look weird but are still quite believable). The entire movie is very beautiful and atmospheric; the Matrix-inspired action sequences (mainly in the Sonmi subplot) and comic relief (Cavendish subplot) are not overdone as I feared they would be.<br/><br/>All in all, a great (if not perfect) adaptation of a difficult book. After all, taking liberties also shows you've understood the work and gives the reader-viewers food for thought!"
"ligonlaw","9","4","5","3 February 2013"," Some Movies Are Challenging. This is one of them.
","Films like Vanilla Sky, Mulholland Drive and Cloud Atlas challenge the viewer. Cloud Atlas is not a single narrative. It is a very complex layering of six stories. Adding to its complexity, the principal actors play several roles. The stories do not appear to be connected at first, except that you are seeing some of the same actors. '<br/><br/>The movie is long, almost 3 hours, and for the first 90 minutes, you want to get your mind around where all these stories are going. You want to know how they are related. It isn't possible. Cloud Atlas is a challenging film because you must take it in without thinking too much. The stories are interwoven and are related tenuously, but you cannot put the connections together until after the mid-point. <br/><br/>As we revisit these stories, the structure takes shape for us. Cloud Atlas is unlike any film I have ever seen. Kieslowski's trilogy ""Blue,"" ""White"" and ""Red"" dealt with the interconnectedness of people by telling stories about people who lived in the present day, but in different communities. Their lives touched on the periphery. Cloud Atlas deals with a metaphysical connectedness of people through time. The universe exists today as the aftermath of a large explosion which took place 13.7 billion years ago. Everything around us flows from that event. Similarly, everything in Cloud Atlas is related through time because of the repercussions of events in our past. There is a strong theme of reincarnation running through the stories.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film and an epic achievement, but it requires the audience to work a little. This should have been one of the 10 best for 2012."

"graves-michele","10","16","29","15 November 2012"," A delightful visual retelling of a kick-ass novel
","It's delightful watching the visual story of David Mitchell's novel ""Cloud Atlas."" While the screen cannot capture all of Mitchell's beautifully worded phrases, interesting word selections, and piercing observations; the film is an enjoyable rendition of a complex novel.<br/><br/>Mitchell creates an ascending and descending ladder of stories that travel though time from the 19th century to far future. It's six stories in one, each with a distinctive style and voice. The stories are successively more engaging coming to a head with ""Sloosha's Crossin' An Ev'rythin' After,"" a delightful, fearless romp of language and sound.<br/><br/>The movie offers a satisfying treatment of ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,"" a darkly humorous tale, with Jim Broadbent well-cast as Timothy. It falls flat, however, on its portrayal of ""An Orison of Sonmi."" Mitchell's futuristic world takes digs at consumer culture, corporate entitlement, and the treatment of a labor class. On screen, it looks a lot like Blade Runner and devolves into stereotypical sf and tiresome running and shooting. Doona Bae is perfectly Sonmi-451, however.<br/><br/>The novel addresses slavery, exploitation, classism, status, societal structure, and utopian theory and offers the reader lots of room to interpret and explore. The movie distills all this down into a repeated theme, ""from womb to tomb we are all connected."" It's pat, but retains beauty.<br/><br/>The movie well-displays the interconnections between the characters, their various incarnations, and the karmic outcomes of their actions — good and evil. The film technique of fading in and out on visually similar themes works perfectly for this. It's particularly pleasing to watch with the novel fresh in mind. The movie also uses quite a few lines directly from the novel. Quite satisfying.<br/><br/>The choice to cast the same actors in multiple roles is interesting and certainly appropriate to the theme and style of the story, but it's also weirdly distracting. Tom Hanks is most enjoyable as the outraged author of ""Knuckle Sandwich,"" Dermot Hoggins, but seems a little older than the novel's Zachry, while Hugo Weaving is delightfully villainous in any costume.<br/><br/>For a great double-feature: Watch and read Kazuo Ishiguro's ""Never Let Me Go"" (2010)."
"endymion82","10","15","27","26 October 2012"," Beautiful, Funny, Moving, Thought Provoking, Flawed
","Saw a midnight showing of this film and was up all night thinking about it. Now, almost 12 hours later, I am finally forming some thoughts about it and I have to say: the majority are positive, and the whole of me really thinks everybody should see this movie, if only because it will give you so much to think about.<br/><br/>From a review perspective, there is a lot that is good: the visuals, the pacing, the bulk of the script. As a fan of the book, was there stuff I missed? Characters, episodes, conversations- sure. But I get that it had to be cut down and re-shaped to make it work as a film, and I think it does work. In some ways it is even more powerful, helping to bring home a lot of the inter-connected elements of the novel's nesting stories with an extra dramatic punch that only something like film can really provide. If there are occasional mis-steps, they are in moments when it gets a little too heavy handed and for me this is really confined to the ending- the final moments of both Zachry's and Adam's stories feel just a bit too layered on, almost as if the film makers were afraid we wouldn't get it. Ironic, since the film demands so much from its audience (it's in no way a passive movie experience) up to that point, and maybe the intention was to, in some ways, ease the audience out of the three hours of wildly engaging cinema they had been subjected to.<br/><br/>The performances run the gamut from decent (Tom Hanks) to solid (Halle Berry) to good (Keith David, James D'arcy) to inspired (Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess)to the brilliant (Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, Doona Bae). Is the make-up occasionally distracting? Yes, but often it's supposed to be, with the men of New Seoul, for instance, looking utterly strange and phony next to the all-too-human female fabricants, and the ridiculous 70's haircuts slyly reminding you that Luisa Reyes' story is told through the eyes of a precocious young novelist. Sometimes the make-up is startlingly good- Broadbent, for instance, is completely unrecognizable as the 19th century ship captain, and Xun Zhou disappears into her role as Tom Hank's sister in the far far future. Like every other aspect of this movie, it's one more piece of a puzzle that is by turns utterly sincere and completely tongue-in-cheek.<br/><br/>And in the end, that's what allows this movie to transcend some its flaws: for every mis-step, there is a bullseye, and it leaves you wondering if even some of the ""mistakes"" or ""oversights"" are part of the equation, intentionally done to make you think harder about what you just saw. Some of the stories feel dense and rich, some feel shallow and pulpy- but all of them are compelling and watchable and leave you wanting more. The over-all impression is one of a myriad of complex and diverse indivdiuals, who in their brief moments all contribute to a larger impression of humanity as a whole, of life as an experience, of the universe and history composed of many tiny points of light, each intrinsically valuable, but only truly catching your eye for a moment, usually as one falls to its death, or breaks from its fixed place to wander. The statement is deeply compelling, but what is more remarkable is how each element of the movie structurally upholds that core statement, as no one person or tale is allowed to upstage another (though of course, some elements will call stronger to some viewers), but the piece as a whole could not be as effective without each of them.<br/><br/>It's a remarkably ambitious work of art, in both what it is trying to say and how it is trying to say it, and it's not for everybody. That, for me, makes me like it even more: it seems rare that such a big budget, star spangled film should take so many risks, and be so uncompromising. In light of that, I think it's something people should see, even if they hate it. Liking a work of art is less important than if we're stimulated by it, and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film and not having something to talk about afterwards."

"SandeepLoyalka","8","14","25","31 October 2012"," Staggering achievement!
","First of all, let it be made clear that any attempt to effectively summarise 'Cloud Atlas' is futile. It is a film that is grand in vision & scope. It is a film that tells 6 stories spanning the years 1846 to 2346, with the same actors taking on different roles across the 6 segments. The actors play different ages, different nationalities & in some cases, different sexes! If there are any overt connections between the roles being enacted by a particular actor, they are definitely not apparent on first viewing. Perhaps repeat viewings may help in deciphering if there are, in fact, any connections at all! The first 20 odd minutes of the movie are often confusing as the various stories gradually unfold. Once past that initial hurdle, however, the film hits its stride magnificently. The 2 sets of directors - the Wachowskis & Tom Tykwer - deserve accolades for successfully conceptualising & executing what must have certainly been a logistical nightmare to shoot & edit. Despite its inordinate length, 'Cloud Atlas' is almost always absorbing. Special mention must be made of the immaculate art direction & breathtaking cinematography, which make every frame of the film come alive in impossibly beautiful ways. The actors are all, without exception, first rate. This is a film that is an acquired taste, pushing the boundaries of conventional cinema in hitherto unexplored directions..."
"kfielding-525-303667","1","33","68","13 November 2012"," Deceiving
","This movie is deceiving. A movie goer expects an adventure and leaves with bloody shock after shock AND the writer's opinion about painful prejudice. Furthermore, if you're not confused, then you didn't watch the entire movie. Note that the folks you rated it high said, ""What can I say?"" or ""I don't know what to say."" Nobody really can explain how bad it is. This is nothing at all like the Matrix (which was great!)<br/><br/>I was somewhat surprised that only three people walked out of it. I should have, but I stayed for the entire bother. Sadly, it only got worse. I'm shocked to see the rave reviews and can only conclude that people give rave reviews on a movie that is hard or impossible to comprehend). Worthless is closer to a reasonable review.<br/><br/>The good: Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. That is ALL!<br/><br/>First of the bad: themes about love, especially sexual love, and reincarnation are prevalent anchoring the theme in the love in two homosexual males' love affair. The other homosexual appearing love is unrequited. Finally this love affair ""reincarnates"" in to a love affair of orientals, with whites(?), and black/white love affairs between each other throughout centuries. Male:male/male:female love making is too explicit. Oral love making is also suggested. Way too ""B"" movieish in all the sex.<br/><br/>The theme of ""love never dies"" is there, but it also suggests that love, no matter who it is that gives it or between who, is still love. And all love is great. But nearly all love affairs are doomed. <br/><br/>Demons (and a ""white"" devil) and spells and powerless incantations try to influence people to do wrong or help people survive--all to no avail. All love affairs are illegitimate and cause society's (and the white devil's) anger. Helping another person is for sexual favors, and men dream of sex with Halle Berry/black women. There are numerous suggestions in the film, and one leaves wondering what other suggestions have been planted in one's mind after the movie.<br/><br/>Prejudice seems to stand in the way of love (relationships that are illegitimate according to the society). The movie suggests that all people are equal in love but that men are more loyal in love and that all men seem to be smart while some women are pretty dumb. Men are all actors in the game of life and hopelessly and powerlessly in love only to lose it. Women sometimes get the point of life. Love that is abnormal to society is denied and abused. Illegitimate lovers sadly but generally can anticipate death. There is no place on earth to avoid it.<br/><br/>As disconnected as the above is, you will find it is a perfect descriptio of this disconnected film. A genius would find this film nothing but a dying person's flash of memories before death.<br/><br/>The writers have a throat fetish since dying from blood loss through the throat is common. This throat issue may be a fear of the writers, a wish that they could kill their current lover, or just an enjoyable thought to the writers (who seem to enjoy violence just for the sake of violence). It is disgusting, exhausting and the blood letting is exhaustive since many are extinguished through the throat method.<br/><br/>The one, very frustrating, part is that some speakers speak in a double/baby/ignorant talk that is hard to understand. This complicates things when the movie goer tries to understand the ideas pushed down one's throat throughout. When they speak this ignorant speech faster than normal, it is harder yet to understand. Not to worry, you can be sure that someone is trying to get around society's prejudices and have societally ""abnormal"" sexual relationships to their demise.<br/><br/>The move takes several scenes from different times (several hundred years), and runs them simultaneously which can become confusing. Splattered blood is repeatedly shown. Some ""people"" are treated like and die like cattle.<br/><br/>Orientals are particularly hard hit in the movie. Fake Orientals are a bit overdone. People are harvested for food throughout the movie for yet another pointless suggestion that the movie wants to make--possibly anti-meat and pro vegan since the most violent seem to eat people.<br/><br/>If you like to watch people die by bleeding to death from a wound to the jugular vein, homosexual love making, a more unusual position for heterosexual love making (including Oriental breasts), prejudice from groups toward smaller, somewhat helpless groups, killing for cannibalism, and abuse by the ruling powers in the world, this is the movie for you! If not and you'd like to be entertained with something more ""normal,"" you might want to skip this movie. <br/><br/>Both of us felt it was a movie we wish we hadn't seen. We like entertainment and not mind twisting, gut wrenching opinions by writers. There is little ""normal"" about this movie. We resent paying money to watch numerous agendas that are shoved down our throats (the throat idea is evident throughout the movie). We prefer paying for entertainment that is interesting. I don't mind blood letting, but after several blood spattering deaths, it begins to get distasteful and overdone.<br/><br/>This is also the first ever movie I made sure I reviewed. Save yourself some time, money and mind twisting. <br/><br/>Please, directors, don't push your ideas over on us movie goers. I resent paying money to see a preacher--especially one that preaches ""prejudice is all around"" century after century. We know. Let's see something either uplifting or entertaining in movies. I'd rather go to church for a preaching. At least I get to choose what type or preaching I get, and preachers don't have an armload of agendas to get out in one, two hour period. Way too much!"

During the drive they kept saying that they would sleep throughout the movie because it was too late and the running time was too long. However, I took them along with me, hoping that they wouldn't sleep through it. The movie started and I must say that the first 20 minutes it feels quite slow. However, things begin to speed up after that and that's when the fun starts. The Sonmi-451 segment is fast-paced and visually amazing. The whole city is stunning to look at and the story progresses quite fast.<br/><br/>'The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing' is a bit slow. However, many will find it interesting. If you are looking for comedy, then 'The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish' is for you. The directors give everything to the audience in this movie. You have your mystery, your period drama, sci-fi and comedy, all in one movie. You will find some of the stories boring, while some you will enjoy. This depends upon the kind of genre you like watching. <br/><br/>Owing to the fact that the cast is amazing, the performances are awesome. Every actor delivers and you will feel that they really got the concept of the movie. The makeup is the 'fun' part of the film and you will enjoy trying to figure out the actors playing different characters while donning various get-ups. <br/><br/>Is this movie for everyone? Well, I would say that it isn't. Many people won't like the way the directors shift from one story to the next and so on. Many people won't even be able to find the 'connections' in the six stories. However, I would say that such people will enjoy the film if they stop thinking of finding connections. Just think of this film as six independent stories regarding the struggle that six individuals have to go through. If you don't want to think too much then don't. The film is enjoyable even if you can't figure out what the story wants to convey. <br/><br/>Should the directors have done something that could have connected to a wider audience? The answer lies in whether or not they wanted to make this film into a blockbuster or if they wanted to do something completely out of the box. The directors have displayed their skills and the actors have conveyed that they are able to tackle an array of different characters without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>I'm just happy that my siblings didn't sleep through the movie. They watched the whole thing. Yes, they didn't quite understand what the actors were saying, especially in the 'Sloosha's Crossin' story. However, they were still able to understand the film.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a spectacle when it comes to the visuals and the acting. Every actor has so much to deliver in as each character. Give this movie a chance. Watch it with an open mind. The film is able to deliver a lot for the amount you have paid for the ticket. I don't know if it will be able to attract any Oscar buzz. However, I feel it will be considered, in the years to come, as a movie in which the directors tried to bring something different to the big screen."

","Thirty years ago I staggered out of a movie theater on the opening afternoon of a new movie that I thought had brilliantly pushed the boundaries of what film could do, only to discover over the next week or two that critics had largely hated it. That, of course, was Blade Runner. Time will prove the critics just as wrong about this one.<br/><br/>As you no doubt know by now, this movie intercuts between six separate stories: three in the past, one in the present, two in the future. I don't know why anyone would find this confusing or hard to follow, though. All but one of the six stories is told strictly chronologically, and that one is still easy to follow because it begins with an interrogation and the rest of the story cuts between the interrogation and (the vast majority) the story being told to the interrogator.<br/><br/>Each of the stories packs an amazing amount into 25-30 minutes. The actors do uniformly terrific jobs of quickly establishing an emotional connection, so there's someone to care about in each one. Almost all contain thrills and excitement. One is very funny, in a wonderfully character-driven way. Some elicit tears of grief, some tears of joy, and none of it too predictably.<br/><br/>The switching between the stories is astonishingly effective; this is simply the best-edited movie I've ever seen. Even in the third act, when we're cutting between six different climaxes, there's not a moment where you feel taken out of the larger story by a less-than-perfect switch between two of the elements.<br/><br/>There are devices knitting the stories together explicitly, most notably the casting of actors in multiple roles and a birthmark that multiple characters have. You actually don't need to follow any of that on the first viewing, though. And that's because the stories overlap thematically.<br/><br/>STRUCTURE (not plot) SPOILER<br/><br/>The one thing I did get on the first viewing is that each story becomes a story in the next story chronologically. The protagonist of the 2nd story reads the published diary of the protagonist of the 1st. The 3rd story heroine comes into possession of and reads letters written by the 2nd story hero (which in fact tell the whole story). Her story is witnessed by a young boy who apparently grows up to be a thriller writer, and his novelization of those events is read by the protagonist of the 4th story, who is a publisher. He writes a memoir of his story, and it's turned into a film which is viewed by the characters in the 5th story. And the 5th story becomes very important in the 6th story in a way I won't divulge. (Furthermore, the sixth story is being told to others in a very brief framing story which doubles as the sixth story epilogue.)<br/><br/>END SPOILER<br/><br/>I'll be seeing this again in the theater and devouring the Blu-Ray when it's released. And right now my list-making brain is tentatively slotting it in as my 16th favorite movie of all time, after On the Waterfront, The Wizard of Oz and Dr. Strangelove, and ahead of Inception, Blade Runner, and The Seventh Seal.

","""Cloud Atlas"" is one of the most overrated and pretentious movies that I have ever seen. With the available budget, the producers should have chosen a great screenplay but it seems that they prefer to invest in marketing instead <br/><br/>Great cast, make-up and special effects are the best this flick can offer. Unfortunately the story is confused and the awful screenplay is a complete mess, maybe based on an acid trip. But many viewers write telling that they like it (there are reviews telling that this mess is a masterpiece – I am not sure whether they are ironic) and the money certainly returned to the pocket of the producers. Last but not the least, I loved the review that says ""It's like Dune if it was directed by George Lucas not David Lynch"". My vote is three.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Viagem"" (""The Trip"")"

","So much hype! Well IMDb ratings has it over 8 while it totally bombed in the box office.Reviewers say that the photography is excellent, well, why waste your money, since you can see better photography in Nat Geo HD. <br/><br/>All those giving high ratings are probably the pseudo cinema goers. The makers had made the Matrix series, somehow they were more inspired by the 2nd and 3rd part of Matrix than the original. Complex story (like Inception or Shutter Island) is one thing, but trying to make it just so that it seems complex is actually a foolish thing. Every story told even how complex it is should hold the audience in the seat, I took 2 breaks of 30 mins each, that much appealing was the screenplay. And the movie is for 2 and a half hour. You can walk out and walk in anytime and you would still be there. <br/><br/>Several stories and all of them had Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, why? Ummm probably saving money or maybe just trying to put up a pseudo complex story. I would probably watch those kiddish vampire movie series compared to a movie which had Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, it is that bad. Even Sucker Punch or Tron Legacy would probably deserve half a more star than this."
"DodgerTheQuadruped","10","16","30","1 November 2012"," Connect with Cloud Atlas
","""Cloud Atlas"" is humanity. And there is no singular answer for humanity's emotions and actions. Directors Tom Twyker, and Lana and Andy Wachowski understand that nugget of knowledge so profoundly that many critics have mistaken this honest exploration of human nature for pretension. If you don't initially understand this film, it is not because its creators are pretentious. It's because this film does not seek to answer questions, but leave you with them. Questions you, perhaps, have not even thought to reflect upon and questions you certainly should not be able to find answers for with ease. Take what you will from this film. It lays forth a cornucopia of offerings.<br/><br/>Following the stories of six characters, ""Cloud Atlas"" delicately weaves what could have easily been six clashing narratives into a gorgeous cinematic tapestry. Not one story feels like a superfluous thread, for without one, this tapestry could not be sewn. This is not six stories passing in the night; this is one story that happens to be told across six separate timelines. Twyker and the Wachowskis have done the seemingly impossible, blending six genres into one cohesive category that defies definition.<br/><br/>The best part of this grandiose tale is that it does what the best cinema should: it asks you to participate. In this case, you are invited to find yourself in this grand scheme of connections. With such a diverse cast of characters, all personalities reside within this film: I'm a Rufus Sixsmith myself; I've known a Robert Frobisher; I've been lucky enough to run across those who will become Adam Ewings, Luisa Reys and Sonmi 451s; multiple Autuas have picked me up when I'm down; I've had the misfortune of crossing paths with Dr. Gooses and Old Georgies; I've even been so lucky as to hear the predictions of an Abbess. You are not simply watching this film, you are a participant.<br/><br/>One will find themselves so easily entwined with these characters thanks to the film's incredible cast, not one member of whom lets this picture down. Advertised as the lead, Tom Hanks is given some of the most varied characters and does something audiences never expected of him; he plays bad quite good. Three of his six characters are deliciously rotten, and Hanks sinks his acting chops right into the roles, just as much as he does for his assigned heroes. Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, Xun Zhou, James D'Arcy and Doona Bae (famous in her home country, but a true revelation stateside that will have audiences begging her to sit and stay awhile) all leave equally huge impacts, while Susan Sarandon, Keith David, Hugh Grant and David Gyasi leave their marks in subtler, but no less powerful, ways. You will want to spend more than three hours with every single character.<br/><br/>This is also due in part to the film's make-up design, creating the illusion of a cast triple the actual size: Halle Berry hides away as a male Korean doctor, a White Europen Jew, and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it island native; Doona Bae spouts out lines in Spanish and English as if she's been speaking both for years; Hugo Weaving plays a menacing female nurse straight out of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""; these examples are just an appetizer of the aforementioned cast members and, indeed, the cast as a whole. Every actor present joins in the fun, giving the film a secondary puzzle of Where's (Insert Actor's Name Here)? that runs parallel to (and strengthens) its reincarnation theme.<br/><br/>With the impressive investment from cast and crew to explore such an intriguing concept that will be one of those everlasting questions of humanity, it is a shame that critics and audiences alike laughed at the make-up as if it was done by children, criticized the character acting as if it has ended the careers of all involved and dismissed the supposedly lofty ideas as arrogant drivel. Like similar grand films that ""Cloud Atlas"" is in league with (""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Citizen Kane"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz""), I have little doubt that this movie has the potential to be industry-changing and will one day be seen as a benchmark in cinema history (hopefully not as the last film of its kind). No studio today would dare to be so experimental with their storytelling, and they weren't, with Twyker and the Wachowskis raising funds from independent sources. Much like the film's character, Luisa Rey, who suspects that a new technology has been setup to fail so big corporations may continue business as usual, I would not be surprised if a few critics were reimbursed to label this film with that cursed word, ""pretentious,"" turning away potential audience members with an accusation all-to-easy to make on what is a thought-provoking narrative in the company of only a handful of peers in our era of cinema.<br/><br/>Three hours, in the scheme of your life, is not a lot to give, especially for such an exhilarating roller coaster as this film, the likes of which you will likely not see for quite some time, if ever, should ""Cloud Atlas"" fail at the box office. The film will, I fear, become a victim of its own ideas, lost amongst thoughtless, studio-mandated movies that are simply easier for casual filmgoers to choose because they don't ask us to question one thing about who we are and how we live our lives. We have become the customers of Sonmi's Papa Song in 2144 Neo Seoul, not giving a second thought to the entertainment that is served to us. But recall, ""Cloud Atlas"" asks for our participation! You can be Sonmi 451, Adam Ewing, and Luisa Rey. Wake-up to realize that art and entertainment can, and should, be one, and that this entertainment can belong to us as much as to those who made it. We, the audience, are Adam Ewing's multitude of drops that will build a new ocean of cinema."

","The movie's premise was how one life connected with another life and the smallest of actions had a ripple effect throughout your next life and the ones to come.  We began with a scene from the mid 1800's.  Was that Tom Hanks?  Yes!  Wow!  The make up and dentures were amazing.  In each subsequent scene, all the main characters from Tom Hanks to Halle Berry and Hugh Grant, were transformed through make up.  In fact, I didn't even realize one character was the same actor throughout the movie!  ""Cloud Atlas"" jumped back and forth from 1849, to a post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the very distant future then back to the 1970's, and then to a few other time periods as well.  This was definitely not a linear story.  But as the story unfolded, you were able to find the connections between these characters and see how they had evolved (or not) as they lived each life.  I don't want to say much more than that, as I love to really put pieces of the puzzle together while I watch a movie.  I will admit, however, that I didn't catch everything intended.  Reading interviews afterward was helpful and gave me that ""AH HA!"" moment.<br/><br/>This all-star cast didn't let me down.  As each of the actors portrayed multiple characters, they deftly delivered their lines and conveyed their station and destination in that life.  Hugo Weaving's characters were so typical Hugo Weaving.  That's right, he played the evil guy.  Shocker.  But he's great at it!  Hanks, Broadbent, Berry, and Grant changed ethnicities and personalities throughout the 500 year period.  Again, the make-up was spectacular.  I would be shocked if it didn't win several awards, including the Academy Award for Make Up.  An unknown actress to me, Doona Bae, was a standout performer.  Although I wasn't thrilled with seeing this Korean woman attempt to become a red-headed Caucasian with freckles, she gave her performance the depth that it needed no matter who she became and in whichever time period.  I can't explain how her meek and mild manner was more powerful than any other actors', but it was.  She drew me into her mind to help me understand her plight and her destiny. It was also interesting how in the future they spoke a bit differently.  It sounded a bit like Cajun mixed with English and although I couldn't always understand every word they said (or even full sentences sometimes), I still comprehended the overall meaning.  That was a difficult task to successfully undertake!  True-true!  (See the movie and you'll get that!)<br/><br/>Now, with all that being said, I just wasn't hooked as I watched the movie.  Maybe it was just too long...2 hours 52 minutes...but I think it had more to do with knowing the characters.  With the exception of Doona Bae who played Sonmi, I really didn't identify with or really know the characters which meant that I didn't care about them.  Perhaps it was just too much information to convey in one movie.  Perhaps, as I believe one of the directors suggested, it would have been great as a long-running HBO series.  That might have been the ticket for me.  So many events occurred with so many long-lasting events that effected the future that it would have been great to really get to know these people.  When you're watching a movie and you're not connected to people and not caring what happens, you then lose interest.  That's what happened to me.<br/><br/>As with many of the Chicago International Film Festival films, the directors were in attendance for the screening.  Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, and Lana Wachowski took the stage to introduce the film and then graciously answer a broad range of questions following the movie.  Lana Wachowski explained, as she took the stage with the credits still rolling, that the movie was actually a sociological experiment on bladder control!  They all realized the length, but in no way could it have been shorter and still convey the necessary information. The siblings who were also responsible for ""The Matrix,"" explained that the making of this $102 million INDEPENDENT movie took 4 years.  There were at least a dozen times that financing fell through at the last minute and the directors had to put in everything they had personally to finance this project.  What a risk they took, but as they repeatedly stated, it was a project that they believed in and loved.  Regarding the overall message of the movie, Lana Wachowski articulated that the emphasis was on the ""act of optimism"" in the world:  that no matter how horrible things become, there is always someone who is there to make the world a better place.    As an optimist myself, I will conclude this review with my favorite quote from the movie.  ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops.""  We all matter and everything we do, both big and small, does make a difference."

I have to say most movies in my top 10 of all time come from indescribable moments of wonder, mystique, and amusement of genius emanating from the collaboration of forces to produce the work.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece in every way. I love everything about this movie. From the variety of tone, genre, time, and even the underlying theme of reincarnation...which to note, I do not accept as truth.

"frenkjoshua","10","5","7","29 May 2015"," Such a beautiful film
","Such a beautiful, moving tribute to the concept of reincarnation and what we reap in future lifetimes, sometimes referred to as ""cosmic justice"". Anybody who approaches this film with an open mind and heart will be highly rewarded with a thought provoking and moving tale of how our decisions echo across time and may sometimes even intercept our reincarnated future selves. Even better, it achieves this without being preachy, condescending, or even without relying on what I refer to as new-age frou-frou.<br/><br/>It is a very deep tragedy that this film went flying over the heads of so many at the academy. Not only that this film SHOULD have won best picture in a landslide, but how it didn't win best cinematography is a real head scratcher. It didn't require a deep love of this film or a deep understanding of it's complicated subject matter to objectively notice how breathtakingly the DP's artistry is displayed in scene after scene. I personally found it to have the finest cinematography of any film I had seen since Schindler's List. I'm further befuddled by the lack of recognition that Tom Hanks gave in what I view as a superior performance even to those he gave in Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan. I view this as the second finest performance of his career after his groundbreaking role in Philadelphia. I find even more perplexing the lack of Oscar (not even a nomination, as with the others) for Jim Broadbent and Doona Bae's equally stunning performances. The exquisite subtlety Doona Bae gave is exactly the sort of thing that the Academy usually likes to reward. Again, head scratching."
"DeeKyuBee","10","5","7","10 April 2015"," The film that started my philosophical interest.
","If there was ever a film that I could say got me into analyzing and figuring out the deeper meanings behind a film, it would be Cloud Atlas. Welcome ladies and gentlemen and today I'm going to be writing my very first review which would be for Cloud Atlas if you haven't guessed already. I remember a year ago looking into this film on a top 10 list and it really intrigued me. Something about the style and look of the film caught my eye. I did some research about it and found out just how complex it was. The film is about 6 interconnected story's about different people in different locations and different time periods.<br/><br/>The film even before watching the actual movie just hooked me. Its story was so complex, interesting, and thought provoking I wanted to figure how the story's are all connected. If I were to describe how the film is connected I would have to say the characters souls are connected. Your probably wondering what I mean by that, Cloud Atlas's main cast each play in the same stories. The difference between the actors characters is... pretty much everything except for the characters souls. For example, Tom Hanks in the first story (in chronological order of the time periods) plays a greedy doctor and is the villain in that story. In the sixth story however, Hanks plays the main protagonist and is the hero of that story. That example I just showed you tells you that the soul of Tom Hank's character is reincarnated. If there's anything to describe the interconnections its that the soul gets reincarnated into another body. Not all the characters change from bad to good however, some stay good throughout the whole movie some stay bad throughout the whole movie. The film has such amazing visuals and a great set of characters. The movie talks about slavery, good and evil, and how our choices and actions affect the future. It grips you right in the first 10 minutes or so when they show you one scene from each story in chronological order.<br/><br/>If you want to know my obsession with Cloud Atlas I basically watched the trailer nearly 20 times, it was so engrossing. It took me a while to seek the film out and while I was doing that I looked at charts and graphs to see how all the characters were interconnected. The main reason this film spoke to me so much was the fact that it got me into complex, thought provoking films, it is the film that started my love for incredibly deep themes. I owe so much to Cloud Atlas, I bought it on Blu-ray and in total I saw it 3 times and I wish to see it more times. Its also a film that whenever I watch it I always love it and I always take something new out of it. I have no problem giving Cloud Alas my highest rating and I'm looking forward to making more reviews. Thank you for reading my first review. Thank you and Goodbye."
"mothersbrewtea","10","5","7","2 December 2014"," Best Film of the Year, Astonishing, Breathtaking, Moving!
","Warning, Spoilers!! A dizzying, three-hour adaptation of David Mitchell's era-hopping 2004 novel, it spans time and space to tells six separate but interlinked tales that begin in the Pacific Ocean in 1849 and conclude in post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the 24th Century. Cloud Atlas is one of the most structurally deft and brilliantly edited films in recent memory, with the Wachowskis bringing the visual panache of The Matrix and Perfume man Tykwer his feel for character and drama. With actors popping up everywhere and even changing race (at one point James D'Arcy goes Asian), the emphasis is on universality and interconnected souls. It's a gimmick that can distract and introduce unintentional humour. There's never a moment where Cloud Atlas drags; the decision to constantly cut between stories (a technique handled differently from the novel) works extremely well, and even though some moments are many times better than others, the film sweeps along on its own batty momentum. Mostly Cloud Atlas will keep you enraptured, for its sheer dexterity alone. Attempting to summarise Cloud Atlas in a paragraph is nigh on impossible, with the opening half hour skipping along with the dizzying momentum of a haunted television - the channel keeps changing, and you can only guess what you'll end up seeing next. My Favorite movie from 2012 and most likely no other will top this any time soon! I truth be told saw this in the Cinema 4 times and at home another 4! Film making at it's best!!"
"g-bodyl","9","5","7","22 April 2014"," At Last.......2012's Most Ambitious Film!
","Before delving into my review of the film, I must say there need to be more movies made like Cloud Atlas. There need to be more intelligent and thought-provoking films being made. That being said, this is a film that's hardly seen on-screen, and the box office failure is evident of that. But one can respect the grand, ambitious project the Wachowski's siblings made. Despite losing what exactly was going on at times, I kept on getting more and more involved in the film. I loved the scope and style of it as well as the themes being conveyed.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Siblings directed a film that has many things going on. It's essentially a story that weaves together the past, present, and future and how each event is somehow connected with each other. That being said, there is no use trying to describe the plot. But there are religious themes at play here, especially when it comes to reincarnation.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is brilliant and everyone is on top of their game. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job and shows off a wide range of acting skills. Halle Berry, who I generally dislike, managed to impress me. Jim Broadbent is amazing and pulled off some extraordinary skills. Hugo Weaving is just good at being a bad guy. Jim Sturgess was very good as well. Everyone pulled off a great feat of playing multiple characters very well in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is probably the most ambitious film ever made. I'm sad to see how it failed at the box office. But this one story that is told very well on the big screen and it's backed up by a grand scope, impressive visuals, superb acting, and impressive directing. I can see why this film would be so decisive, but it shouldn't be. An amazing film with open-minded concepts. I rate this film 9/10."
"gameplacereviews","10","5","7","5 March 2014"," 6 stories spanning hundreds of years Cloud Atlas is an amazing epic.
","Cloud Atlas Director: Lana Wachowski, Andy Watchowski, Tom Tykwer. Actors: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving...<br/><br/>Watch Cloud Atlas; I think that this is the most touching, thrilling, and gut wrenching film I have seen in a while. The thing is, you will connect to this movie, and the emotion from it is immense. I am still feeling the emotional resonance of the film a day after I watched it. It spreads six stories, all good in their own way, and features so many genres. It is a romance, action, sci-fi, murder mystery and comedy all at the same time. The point of it is to show you that everyone and everything is connected in some small way or another. The six stories are all incredible in their own way. But there are a few that fare better than others. The Somni-451 sci-fi story and the dystopian alien story were the best in my opinion. The other stories are great but these stood out so well. The Somni-451 section is full of emotion and has a one of the most gut-wrenching twists I've ever seen. And the acting. There are a bunch of actors playing multiple roles and still hitting all out of the ballpark. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving. All of them are good. The directing for a movie like this is spectacular. It must be hard for the directors to have to switch genres for almost every part of the movie, but it is executed so well. Then there is the effects. While this film is very much a marvel of storytelling as it balances the stories quite well, it is even more of a master of the visual aspect. This is the Wachowski's, makers of The Matrix, contribution. Of course the effects are top notch. They really are. In the science fiction future story especially, the effects are amazing. In the 1970's one there is still a good amount of flair. The thing is that this movie has a visual flair to it. It is a colorful film that handles it's effects well. Also good is the action. Whenever the action is going on it is simple but thrilling. Actually I must say that this has to be one of the most thrilling films I've ever seen, and it means so much to me.The costumes and the cinematography are incredible as well. The future looks slick and beautiful, the 70's seem closer to home. The way the camera weaves itself around the scenes and the action. Lastly I want you to know that this movie evokes emotion a lot of it. I cried at the end of it. That was mainly because I was so caught up in the awesomeness. I give Cloud Atlas a 10 out of 10."
"drmnc1","10","5","7","9 February 2014"," An outstanding masterpiece (unfortunately under-appreciated)
","I know all the pedantic writers and proofreaders will be criticising me for my terrible grammar when I say ""outstanding masterpiece"" because the word masterpiece already implies that the film is outstanding, but that is how highly I feel about this film. It truly is one of the best films ever to hit the screen. Having seen some of the reviews of Cloud Atlas, I feel sorry for those who fail to appreciate the ideas and complexities of Cloud Atlas, as their complaints are usually dripping with dogma and ignorance.<br/><br/>How this film was not nominated for a single Oscar is the most outrageous scandal to plague the film industry. When compared to the likes of The Life of Pi and Zero Dark Thirty, there is now at these films stand up to Cloud Atlas - it makes anyone wonder whether the nominations were rigged. Beautifully shot, outstanding score, and completely original, Cloud Atlas really should have been up contending (and winning) the Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Picture. I truly am lost for words how this film came to be so grossly unappreciated by critics and viewers alike. It is shameful that Cloud Atlas has seemed to have flown under the radar unrecognised and unloved by a thankless audience. This film is both artfully enigmatic and simple at the same time. It feels as if I understand the film inside-out, but also as though I will never be able to fully comprehend it. That is the true beauty of Cloud Atlas, and yet this is the element that goes unappreciated or misinterpreted by the many critics of this film.<br/><br/>One of the most original films to hit the screen, Cloud Atlas recounts six stories encompassing a range of characters through six different timelines. From the bowels of an American slave ship in 1849 to the struggling descendants of a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, this three-hour epic evokes deep ideas and issues that you can be sure to be thinking about for weeks to come. Watching this film with family or friends is highly recommended as I know personally it was one of the rare films that incited deep discussion between viewers of the concepts and ideas portrayed in the film. The beauty of Cloud Atlas is that there is enough subtlety that every individual interprets the film differently, and there is no right or wrong.<br/><br/>All six stories are delicately interwoven by a common theme - the concept of freedom. Whether they are a journalist in possession of a potent secret being doggedly pursued by a deadly hit-man, or an elderly publisher tricked into a care home and terrorised by a tyrannical nurse (played by Hugo Weaving(!) - this particular story was very funny), all were in some way trapped: physically, mentally or otherwise.<br/><br/>The cleverest aspect is that various actors/actresses play multiple characters thought the eras - the idea of them being different reincarnations of themselves generation by generation. Each actor plays a definitive role throughout the film that is their persona, and this only enhances the relationship displayed between each story. The stellar cast of well known names (Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Halle Berry to name a few) pull out faultless performances, fitting seamlessly into each role they are given.<br/><br/>Each story performs a unique function of its own: one makes us cry, one makes us laugh, one has us gripping onto the very edges of our seats; a comedy, action, tragedy, romance, sci-fi all combined beautifully and masterfully into one dazzling film. <br/><br/>An exceptional and unique jewel of a film, this movie is seemingly incredibly under- appreciated at the 7.6 rating it currently holds. This film mysteriously missed out on a lot of awards and deserved, and does deserve far better. Those who fell in love with the film as I did will look back on it as a truly unparalleled classic for generations to come."
"bob-rutzel-1","9","9","15","15 May 2013"," Connections Are Us
","We follow 6-stories that seem to reflect reincarnated people with the same birthmark and this is supposed to be proof of that. The main theme is: ""our lives are not our own, we belong to each other, past and present"" as stated by Doona Bae's character Sonmi 451. This is to say we are all connected. <br/><br/>We see slices of life within these stories and it takes a while to make some sense of things we can relate to. We go on an ocean voyage where a doctor is trying to get the key to a strong box full of gold; a gay composer writes letters to his friend and contemplates suicide; a murder at a nuclear power plant; a publisher as a prisoner in a nursing home put there by his brother; a Korean rebel – Sonmi 451 - in the future, who may be the key to saving the world; and we see Zachry (Tom Hanks) a Polynesian tribesman who has contact with Meronym (Halle Berry) who is from another planet. <br/><br/>Many of the stars in here play a character in all six stories. You can make a game of it trying to decide which stars you recognize with all the makeup, prosthetics, wigs and costumes. Here are some of the other names: Jim Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, James D'Arcy, Hugh Grant, David Keith. <br/><br/>The acting and visuals and CGI are most impressive. What was annoying was the pidgin English dialogue when in the tribesman Zachry stories. Oh, they sounded good, almost poetic, but we came away with: Whadee say? Whashe say? See? When Zachry needed to know the truth about something, he would say: Tell me the true true. Okay we got that, but that was the easiest of all the pidgin English we heard. <br/><br/>The only story I found most interesting was with Doona Bae's rebel character Sonmi 451 who was protected by Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess) who behaved like James Bond in his efforts. He knew Sonmi 451 was the only one who could save the world, a world gone mad with oppression. Later when she was captured and her Interrogator says to her that she must have known she could not win and why persist? Sonmi 451 agrees but says the truth must not be hidden. The Interrogator then says suppose no one knows and she replies: someone will come along and know. She knows she will be killed and she is not afraid because ""death is just another door opening."" <br/><br/>As far as I was concerned the other 5-stories were okay, but not as important as Sonmi 451's story. Why the title Cloud Atlas? The theme here is that we are all connected as are clouds we see and sometimes we see images, and stories within these clouds. <br/><br/>This movie is about 3-hours long and we don't get bored, but we wished some stories were shorter than they were. In those stories the birthmark was the only thing connecting all to reincarnation, but there was no apparent connection to the story of Sonmi 451. Unless one could take a giant leap and say that oppression was in their future. Maybe I missed the birthmark on Sonmi 451.

"MartinHafer","7","8","13","26 July 2014"," It's one of the most unique films I've ever seen.
","At nearly three hours long AND with a strange and difficult to comprehend plot, I can see exactly why ""Cloud Atlas"" lost a ton of money. In the States, it only brought in about $27,000,000---yet cost $100,000,000 to make. Much of the high cost is undoubtedly due to the cast--as the film boasts some famous and high-paid actors (including Tom Hanks and Halle Berry). It's a shame really, as the film does have some nice thing to offer...though overall, it was a problematic film to watch.<br/><br/>The film consists of many different stories that all occur many different times in history (both in the past and very distant future). And, instead of being told in sequence, they are interlaced throughout the film. Why and what these plots all have to do with each other is something the audience is left to discover or create within themselves. However, many will get frustrated because for some time, the film doesn't give you a lot of clues at to what it all means. <br/><br/>Despite being confusing and hard to grasp, the film has several things I loved. The stars of the film all play multiple roles and you'll see many of them in many stories. This provides the actors a chance to show off their talents--especially because many times they need to effect accents and/or play the opposite gender!! Yes, most of the main cast members play men AND women. Now this never would have worked if the acting was bad and the makeup was bad--but they really shine in this film. I was blown away by the makeup and thought several of the female characters were women when they weren't--it was that convincing. Additionally, while I was a bit cold about the overall film, I did appreciate how novel the movie was--very, very unique. <br/><br/>So how might I have wanted the movie to be instead? Well, the many stories frustrated me because some of them were really, really compelling--and seeing only bits and pieces of them was annoying. I really wanted to see the whole story of many of the stories and could have seen the filmmakers making four or five films instead of just one. I particularly liked the stories about the replicant as well as the one where Hanks played a thug author (his acting was really nice here). <br/><br/>My advice is that this film demands a viewer who is very, very patient, content with ambiguity and who wants to see a nice experimental film-- warts and all. Worth seeing but odd to say the least.<br/><br/>NOTE: Parents, this film is NOT appropriate for kids. It clearly earns its R rating for some extremely graphic violence and sex. While the sex is sometimes steamy, the violence is what troubles me most for anyone crazy enough to let kids watch this one."

","I honestly don't know if ""Cloud Atlas"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's easily one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>There's not much more for me to write here, because it either speaks to you or it doesn't. Most critics and several viewers have lambasted it (Ebert excluded - it was one of the last movies he gave 4 stars before his passing, and his review is spot on, IMHO). It tanked at the box office, it was nominated for no Oscars (not even Visual Effects or Music!) and it generally made barely a blip on the cinema landscape. It is a challenging movie - intellectually, structurally, and emotionally. You might be up to the challenge, and you might not. Maybe a dull action machine like one of the ""Man"" movies is more up your alley. Or a turgid melodrama period piece, or a cheesy Rom-Com that holds your hand and tells you what to feel. Maybe a film that almost demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate doesn't appeal to you. And that's fine, I suppose.<br/><br/>But if you like to think, and to feel, and are generally capable of appreciating a work of art, watch ""Cloud Atlas"". You might not love it, but if you're capable of even moderately complex inquiry, I guarantee you will always be engaged. And maybe, like me, you'll find yourself enthralled. <br/><br/>Isn't that why we watch anything?"
"cinemafilm","10","8","13","16 May 2013"," Very Important Movie About Evolving Ideas
","I just watched Cloud Atlas again and now consider it my favorite movie from last year. It's truly a great adaptation of a great novel, turning what is a quite dense and demanding literary work into a supremely entertaining and sprawling movie. The intelligence of the novel is undiminished and its ideas are now so much more accessible.<br/><br/>What is the movie about to me? It is a rhapsody on how the most important job anyone can have is that of a ""writer."" Great writers, pretty good writers, terrible writers, insightful writers, insanely wrongheaded writers, really anyone who writes is a creator of the new genetic material (memes) that have been directing the evolution of the human species for thousands of years. We evolve very slowly, if at all, biologically. But we evolve at lightning speed, especially now with the Internet, by way of ideas. I placed writer in quotes because the novel/movie considers it quite broadly to encompass oral traditions, musical composers, and even filmmakers along with traditional writers as creators of ideas.<br/><br/>Everything good and everything bad that has come of humanity on Earth so far has been the result of ""writers"" adding ideas to the great conversation and having those ideas propagate from person to person and generation to generation, sometimes taking on meaning far removed from the author's original intentions. If we wish the future of this great conversation to take more good turns than bad, it is up to all of us to become ""good"" ""writers"" in our own ways.<br/><br/>The movie tag-line is: Past. Present. Future. Everything is connected.<br/><br/>But, what is it that connects everything? Richard Dawkins wrote of ""bio- morph space"" (how all the species connect together and change through time) in his book The Blind Watchmaker. Dawkins had previously written about human evolution now occurring primarily through memes (ideas that survive and reproduce) rather than genes. What Cloud Atlas maps and shows as relating all humans throughout history and into the future is idea-morph space, or how all ideas connect together and change through time.<br/><br/>It especially makes two points about the evolution of ideas: 1. That religions evolve from ideas that become texts that become sacred texts, sometimes severed from the very intent and purpose of the earlier texts and ideas (very similar to the movie Zardoz where the sacred religious text of a future society turns out to be a tattered copy of (The Wi)zard (of) Oz.) 2. That the changes in matters of human rights are a perfect example of the evolution of ideas through time with Black History in America and Women's Rights taking center stage. Curiously, LGBT rights are a key element of an early story, but are left unresolved, curious because Lana (formerly Larry) Wachowski is one of the key writer/directors of the movie. (Identity is toyed with and questioned continuously throughout the movie though by way of using makeup to have actors play a variety of characters of different ages, races, and even genders.)<br/><br/>You know how it's often said there are no new stories and no new ideas? I think that is largely true. The same ideas recur throughout human history, sometimes coinciding with the zeitgeist and becoming popular, sometimes not. The truly new ideas are like random gene mutations, total accidents maybe, or something out of dreams that just happened to occur at the right place and point in time to survive and spread from person to person and down through the generations instead of being laughed at and forgotten--or crushed because it is a totally inconvenient idea for its time and place."
"Al_The_Strange","9","8","13","20 April 2013"," ""By each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.""
","The name says it all: this film, like its respective novel, features a nebulous high-flying narrative that drifts from one era of human history to the next. The film covers six different narratives in six different settings with six different characters. These narratives may seem totally unrelated, but there are very subtle connections that infer a cosmic unity.<br/><br/>The original novel had all these stories nested, but the film lays it out as a long-running montage, which will come off as seeming totally random, and maybe even ""messy"" to many viewers. Each story offers a little bit of everything: there's drama, romance, comedy, and action to be had. The most visually impressive scenes will likely be the Sonmi-451 segments, which depict a dark dystopian future where corporations become a ruling power, and they produce mindless clones to serve consumers. This story will come the closest to being Matrix-esque, thanks to some impressive special effects and thrilling chases and shoot-outs. Sci-fi fans may also dig the Sloosha's Crossin' sections, set in a post-apocalypse Hawaii, showcasing the encounters between natives and stellar explorers (and some bad run-ins with mean and nasty natives). I never was a fan of the Adam Ewing section of the book, but the film brings it to life vividly: this is a section that focuses on a pre-20th-century explorer going to Hawaii and back. The Letters from Zedelghem section offers the most drama: a story about a young man moving in with a famous composer, hoping to make it big. Half-Lives offers the most intrigue, as it follows a reporter investigating a conspiracy, and ultimately a death, surrounding the invention of a super-duper power reactor. Then there's the Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish, easily the funniest part of the whole thing, which tells the story of a publisher on the run who winds up incarcerated in an oppressive retirement home.<br/><br/>Like I said, it all seems random, but in truth, each story is interconnected. Scenes from all six stories are cut together, but the film attends to all six and gives them each the right amount of attention to make them complete. Certain things get altered or dropped from the book; the film definitely loses some of the background detail and information surrounding the characters and events (chief among them, understanding the world of Neo Seoul, the story behind Louisa Rey's father, and understanding the rivalry between Frobischer and Ayrs). Such changes are necessary to squeeze everything into the film's roomy 171-minute runtime, but the film does cut out some of the pathos and logos of each story in doing so.<br/><br/>However, the film does excel with the themes of the book. Thanks to the way it's put together, and the ensemble cast, the film underscores all the connections between the six stories, emphasizing the themes of past lives and the perseverance of the human spirit. Part of this is pretty dark and bleak, with elements of cannibalism present in all stories; the point of all six is that the strong will always prey on the weak, and at least three of these stories hint at a literal cannibalism to emphasize this. At the same time, the film has a brighter side, which actively asserts that love is a binding force that transcends all of space and time. Key themes of death (and possibly rebirth) emerge as well.<br/><br/>This entire piece of work is neatly established with superb photography and editing. The editing can be especially inspiring, since there are quite a few scenes where characters will give a profound monologue during a montage of scenes from all the stories. Acting is great, and it's especially ingenious how each cast member plays multiple roles across all the stories to further emphasize the connections of each story. Writing is good; a lot of it is the exact same as the book, with just a few necessary changes and bits of exposition to make the best possible adaptation. This production uses some very interesting sets, props, costumes, and special effects. What music is used is not bad.<br/><br/>The randomness of this film may throw off a lot of viewers, but there is a certain method to the madness. I almost wish the stories were presented as a straightforward one-after-another or nested fashion, ala Sin City, but the film has merit as it is. I personally favor the film for bringing the book to vivid life and making a lot of its ideas and subtleties more visible. Above all, it is evenly-paced, entertaining, and well-made. I'd recommend checking it out at least once.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Stories: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"dario_malic","9","8","13","12 December 2012"," A multitude of drops
","Every once in a while there comes a movie which strives to break the boundaries of cinema and storytelling and go beyond the limits of our imagination. Those movies provide unique viewing experience and leave marks on your heart as well as your mind. Just from watching the extended trailer (probably the best I've ever seen) it was apparent that the latest work from directors Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer falls into that category. It is a movie called ""Cloud Atlas"", just like the book written by David Mitchell which it's based upon.<br/><br/>The movie contains six interwoven stories spanning from 19th century to distant post-apocalyptic future and converging into a timeless message about love, justice and the importance of human actions. It unravels thematically rather than chronologically, showing similar situations in different stories as though they all take place simultaneously. That resulted in a lot of short scenes and required extensive editing which, although it finely underlines common themes, will no doubt prove to be too demanding for part of the audience. Another thing which could be confusing for some but really works to the movie's advantage is the casting of the same actors in a multitude of different roles. Although the characters are different, there is a common denominator to the roles played by the same actor. Sometimes it's a stereotype like in the case of Hugo Weaving who plays a villain in every story, and sometimes it's a more nuanced trait like with Tom Hanks whose characters follow their own interests whether motivated by love, greed, or self-preservation, heroes and villains alike. The casting, consisting of the actors of both genders and all of the races where each of them plays characters of both genders and all of the races, has a special and unique role in this movie carrying in itself one of the messages the authors wish to share. The one of equality between all human beings. Considering all that is said about the casting it's obvious the actors had to be in their top form, and fortunately for most of the parts they've been. It's worth pointing out Hugh Grant and Tom Hanks doing great job in roles completely against the type. Hanks is a little less convincing in his standard good-guy roles, trying maybe too hard to make a difference between them, but that doesn't diminish the great work he's done here.<br/><br/>As in acting, we can see oscillations in other areas such as make-up and prosthetics. While some of it looks great (Hugh Grant as a Kona Chief, Hugo Weaving as Old Georgie), some is disappointingly poor (Caucasian actors as Koreans). The same disbalance is found in the music, with great main theme and not so interesting rest of the soundtrack. Trying to cover as many genres as they could (thriller, romance, history, comedy, sci-fi, drama, adventure), the directors made a commendable effort, and even the single comedic story, which feels a little disconnected because of its tone at first, greatly fits in the overall movie. There are many other things making more sense after watching the movie for the second time, and some completely new revelations too. At first I thought some stories were weaker than the others, but now I manage to see them as one, just as the directing trio, and the author of the book of course, imagined it.<br/><br/>The main message of the movie is that of the importance of battle against oppression which, at least that's what the authors believe, is never in vain, for our every action leaves consequences we're not even aware of. The oppression is always that of people in power over those they consider less worthy, whether because of their skin colour, age, sexual orientation, social status or just because they are weaker. It's a story well known in today's world. We see the same thing happening all over it. Thus the message is as important as it can be.<br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" is probably one of the most ambitious movies, if not ever, then certainly of this century. It connects what seems unconnectable in terms of genres, stories, characters and messages. It brings together art and entertainment in a glorious fashion, engaging all of our senses and making us think and feel at the same time. It acknowledges the obvious but still gives hope. It tells us it's worth being ourselves. And I can't think of a greater thing a movie can do.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","Technically brilliant, beautiful, challenging, intelligent, and narratively complex, but perhaps not quite as emotionally satisfying as it hoped to be. Maybe just a little too big for itself, but I wish I was 30 years younger so I would have time to watch it a few more times in my life. <br/><br/>I love films like this. It's why I go to the movies; to be taken someplace else, to another time and another place, where I hope to see something that makes me think and feel about my life and my place in the world a little differently. Regardless of the few shortcomings which I'm sure other people have raged on about, if you enjoy looking for both the bigger picture and the smaller, more intimate moments in films, Cloud Atlas will certainly have you covered."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","14","26","26 June 2013"," Crumbling under its ambition, its misses are big but its hits are also big.
","When I was a very young writer, the generation spanning saga was always an object of my naive ambition. Granted, it was soon abandoned when it seemed impossible and I imagine many young writers have the same idea at least once when they have an idea that never seems to end. I didn't realize the concept had actually been achieved to somewhat positive acclaim until I heard of this film. Regardless to say, I was intrigued. And my high expectations for Cloud Atlas didn't come from the people involved or the story/ies itself, but the ambition of the concept and the potential for true technical feat despite the love-or-hate it reputation the film was starting to gain. I had an open mind. What surprised me first was how the film is structured. It races through all the 6 stories at once, showing what seems like a 30 second to 2 minute segment of one story then cutting to the other. This rocket pace is really hard to follow at first (even if it offers the potential for clever parallels in transitions) and it begins to feel like there's about dozen stories but it soon becomes easier to digest once the first section, ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewin"" gets into the meat of its story.<br/><br/>The thing with a film like this with its ambition is that it's constantly building up to a grand conclusion and a grand purpose for all of it's 3 hour running time, which is really make-or- break if it doesn't live up to that every second of the way. I can completely understand why this is a love-or-hate film as it doesn't exactly deliver what it promises. Its weakest spots in the first act are very awkward to watch and this is mostly due to the hammy performances of Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent (""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" is a real weak link in general) with make-up and costumes that are very hard to take seriously. I actually stopped watching the film 20 minutes in with no intention of continuing later but I decided to persevere and give it a chance just to have an opinion on the whole thing by taking the sillier moments as tongue-in-cheek humour. But when Cloud Atlas gets going, it is an absolute boulder of escalation. When momentum builds between several stories at once, it's pure involving cinema. Not necessarily original ideas, but a blend of genres and styles that creates something exhilarating. And just like a boulder, this momentum doesn't stop easily and takes up a good long stretch of the film. Even if I'm not clear on what's going on or not enjoying what is going on, it certainly keeps me engaged.<br/><br/>While the film struggles with creative payoffs to each story and relationship (even spoiling itself with a bizarre reference to a classic sci-fi film), the best payoffs are the end results of the parallels between the supposed ""reincarnations"" when the choice of recurring actors becomes very clear, essential and poignant. But what is the grand purpose of the film? In a film with seeming randomness but ostensible intention, there must be a point and the answer is that it's entirely political and about the evolving moral standards of society. It's about persecution of race, homosexuality and the elderly and then more vague ideas and criticisms on fuel consumption and generation and the pitfalls of capitalism and religion. Despite these bold intentions, it is very emotionally engaging, and that is due to the standout performances by Halle Berry (who is nomination worthy here), Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy and Doona Bae, who bring a grace to their roles that is so desperately required rather than the needlessly animated attempts by Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent, whereas Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant and Jim Sturgess are more-or-less serviceable and only sometimes invisible. <br/><br/>Its technical feats are, like the stories and performances, hit-or-miss, the biggest hit of which is the rich and cinematic score, which is probably the film's finest achievement and guides us through the film better than the editing itself. The visual effects are okay, they're best when it's the vast landscapes of the last two stories rather than the action sequences where the characters don't appear to really belong in the scene. The costumes and makeup, while impressive for their variety, are much better when they're subtle. The first three stories are much superior to the last three, albeit much less ambitious. They're key to providing the 70s thriller atmosphere of perhaps the best story of the six, ""Half Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery"" (which must be on a par with ""Letters from Zedelghem""). Otherwise many of the transformations are quite bizarre and look like spy disguises (particularly Doona Bae in the first story and Hugo Weaving in the last). Cloud Atlas is an interesting film, and unlike most viewers, I'm in the middle of the love-hate, as the only thing I actively dislike are half of Tom Hanks' characters but there's plenty to really like. It's not exactly art, but it's certainly got meaning and heart and is epic in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>7/10"

","How does someone even BEGIN to look at CLOUD ATLAS? It's the only movie of its kind. Nobody has EVER tried to do what the Wachowskis did here. And that, of course, attracts me immediately.<br/><br/>But how do I review it? <br/><br/>Let me tell you a story. The sensation I felt at the climax of the film surpasses everything else about it. Looking back, I can say, what the movie is, to me, is the construction of a rope.<br/><br/>A rope is not a single thread. Instead, it is several threads woven together, to strengthen the overall might of the rope itself. By itself, a single strand could break, but bound with others, a rope gains strength, depending on the might of the summation of its strands instead of the durability of one.<br/><br/>This is CLOUD ATLAS.<br/><br/>I realized this the first time I saw the film. Each of the stories presented has a feel, and, moments in each of the stories has a parallel with the other ones, creating a narrative that, by themselves could be construed as confusing or uneven.<br/><br/>But if you surrender to the flow of the film, you can feel the river of time that guides each story, and recognize the patterns that, like Louisa (Halle Berry) says in the film, repeat themselves over and over. And each thread draws closer and closer to the point where they all come together, and create the rope that is more than just the summation of the plot, but also a reflection of life itself.<br/><br/>When Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) explains to Sixsmith (James D'Arcy) that boundaries are illusions, as a speak-over that ties all six stories together, I sincerely felt that time itself was nothing more than an illusion. This feeling perpetuated itself BEYOND the boundaries of the movie theater I was in, and for a moment I felt enlightenment I haven't felt in a long time when encountering a piece of art It felt that all six tales were happening simultaneously, that all of the stories were moving at the same time, even though the characters were different. It's a feeling I cannot expect everyone to share But it's what I felt. That time really is an illusion. And it's because time IS an illusion that it keeps repeating itself, over and over, again and again.<br/><br/>Nobody delivers a bad performance here. In truth, the actor that deserves the most credit here is Tom Hanks, and not just because he is one of the finest actors to walk the planet. No, it's because his character, beyond all others, transitions from antagonist to protagonist through the scale of the movie. That, at one point, he is the villain, and, by the end, he is the hero. It suggests that, even though time may be an illusion, that progression is not. That all of us are heroes and villains. That everyone is everything, at one time or another.<br/><br/>Even Hugo Weaving, who plays a villain through most of it, has a moment where he is merely a character (the critic that visits Vivian Ayers house, or Boardman Mephi, in future Tokyo, who seems to me as less of a villain than just a man who chooses not to fight the system).<br/><br/>Also, I have to give a shout out to Mr. Hugh Grant, who performs amazingly here. I didn't even realize it was him when I first saw him, and his ability as an actor shines here. It is a shame he should be punished for being human when he has such incredible talent.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that requires your brain. It requires multiple viewings. It requires you to think outside the box. If you cannot do that, don't bother. If you want everything spelled out for you, I suggest you steer clear. This one's not for you.<br/><br/>But if you want to see one of the most beautiful, original, creative, amazing pieces of art ever put to the silver screen, and can handle the concept of not being able to understand everything on the first shot, this movie is definitely for you. In my humble opinion, EVERYONE should see it, even if you find that you hate it. It is at least worthy of a viewing, regardless."
"filmfanperspective","10","6","9","5 May 2015"," A film for the ages (*****)
","Is it rational to think that right now, writing this review, I have been influenced by a decision made three hundred years ago? Is it rational to think that my praise of this film may, somehow, effect an individual hundreds of years from now? Of course not, but Cloud Atlas is not about rational, logical thought, nor is it a standard film. If I have interpreted the film accurately, it is about possibility, dreams, risk, chance, fate, our connection to each other, and the inherent responsibility of our choices. It is about how our actions, small as they may be, can have a ripple effect on people, places, and things. Rarely does a film come along that actually makes the connection between ethereal, spiritual thought and precision film making, yet Cloud Atlas, with its' sublime color pallet, rousing score, and honest delivery, now exists as the supreme triumph of both in my eyes.<br/><br/>When a work of art speaks to you on a deep, personal and emotional level, I think it becomes increasingly difficult to argue its' merit. Cloud Atlas is the prime example of that conundrum for me. It may just be the greatest film I've ever seen, but I don't believe for a moment that I can sway a regular moviegoer to my way of thinking. What I can say is that three directors collaborated to create a deeply soulful, spiritual film, spanning all genres, inspiring all emotions, and touching on all of the things I love about seeing a movie. It is perhaps the most unusual film of our time- it seemingly came from nowhere, had an extended trailer, opened wide in both 2-D and 3-D, defied convention, bombed at the domestic box office, and practically begged viewers to see it as multiple copies collected shelf dust. <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas could have been an expensive disaster, making no sense and cementing (in my head) that the films of the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix trilogy) and Tom Tykwer (of Run Lola Run and The International) are no longer appointment viewings. Instead, this beautiful and occasionally brutal film exceeded my expectations, in both tone and execution. The broad story spans roughly 600 years, from the days of seafaring clippers to a possible post-apocalyptic future. From a sick lawyer that tries to overcome his inherent racism to a grandfather finally able to find ease with his tumultuous life, we're treated to a multitude of relationships, past, present, and future. A journalist strikes up a relationship with a scientist, and in the process uncovers a massive threat. An understudy to a great musician puts music to his words, creating the timeless title sound. A genetically engineered waitress breaks code and inspires the world as a result of the kindness of a rebellious stranger. A post-apocalyptic forager must overcome his hallucinations and simple upbringing to get humanity to connect again. How the directors were able to weave this plethora of story lines and characters together and still have it make narrative sense, I'll never know. What I do know is that it works, just like a random collection of notes strings together to form a symphony. What this symphony wants to tell us is that the evil of then is the evil of now, and in the future. The love of then, now, and in the future is the same. It is simply up to us to find our common threads, learn from them, and decide which true fate we want for ourselves and humanity.<br/><br/>I would ask the skeptical to allow for the possibility that what happens in this film could be a reality. If you can separate the rigidity of our regular lives and the realities that we're ingrained with in this world, Cloud Atlas can stir that sense of hope and purpose within you. I feel it gives a voice and a narrative for what I believe is missing in many of our lives- a connection to the universe, and some meaning to what we do. In other words, it does for me what organized religion maybe should do. Interestingly enough, I've found myself not standing alone with my love for the film, and my thoughts for it. Those that like this film appear to share a kindred spirit, and an optimistic outlook on what we as a species could do. I say this being fully aware that I'm placing these opinions and feelings on the film, and it is altogether plausible that the original author and the directors had no intention of speaking to us as I've interpreted. I'm not buying that for a moment, however.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is too soulful, too all-encompassing an emotional tale to simply be meant as a popcorn film. Consider the fictional ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", as it has been wonderfully imagined in the film by composers Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and Tykwer himself. Imagine it as a tangible, audible thing that we can hear, a real thread of sound that permeates time and space. Think of what a thing of beauty it would be, how that shared connection can link all of us together, our decisions, or triumphs and failures, our ups and downs, and how it would mirror the greatest of symphonies, the most resonant of sounds. It is a timeless piece, something I would never tire of hearing, as if the memories of a thousand souls were wrapped up in the single stroke of a piano key or the bow of a violin. I love this film, for everything it says to me, and for what I hope it will say to others once they see it. If nothing else, my hope is that viewers allow the film to wash over them, and not give in to the pessimism and preconceived notions of what a 'Wachowski' film might be. You may be pleasantly surprised."

","Based on what was a considered an unfilmmable novel Cloud Atlas is a large, ambitious film that took both the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer to adapt and direct. Cloud Atlas tells six different stories, set from the past to the distant future, all linked by universal themes of truth, justice, life and events from the past effect the future. The framing device is that all the characters are reading about the previous events, whether it's a diary, letters or a recording. A particular strong ideas was how the main character from the Seoul Dystopia is worshipped by a primate tribe as a God in a post-apocalyptic future. There are many links to the different time periods, from the cast, the music and small things like characters having birth marks, showing the contentions between the characters. The Wachowskis' theme of racism shows it head in their stories.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is bold film, running for 2 hours 45 minutes and is visually stunning. The scenes of the various stories were perfectly edited together as different characters had to go through similar events. But some of the stories worked better then others and I personally thought the strongest stories were the 1973 nuclear thriller in San Francisco, the futuristic dystopia of Neo Seoul and the post-apocalyptical future. But the story starring Jim Broadbent as a man hiring in an old people's home felt out of place, being too humorous and just a mix of a Guy Ritchie gangster film and The One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest."

","Someday Cloud Atlas will get the respect it deserves.<br/><br/>A completely original film. Doona Bae steals the show, in her first English speaking role: An incredible performance. One of the greatest casts ever assembled. Hugo Weaving, Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, Xun Zhou and many more all playing a wide variety of characters, races and genders. There is nothing not to like about this film. At over 3 hours long, I was sorry to see it end. It never lost momentum. <br/><br/>The movie flips from 6 different times over and over. sometimes in rapid succession. In most other film, this would be annoying, but in Cloud Atlas, it really works.<br/><br/>The special effects are very convincing, and the dialogue, was obviously written by intelligent people. Both creative and thought provoking.<br/><br/>I am so sad, it never got the recognition it deserved. I think. this is one of those films, which will stand the test of time."

","A great piece made buy two of the most high rated directors ""the wachowskis"". The film is brilliant but it does have few blunders.It starts with a very special but also confusing opening title, and it ends while giving you the same feeling, feeling lost in the middle of a massacre, chaos, like a meaningless dog chasing its own tail trying to teach you something but won't, which only causes more and more confusion.<br/><br/>The reason that people think that this movie is worthless, is because they have gotten lazy, intending not to think, not to solve riddles by themselves. <br/><br/>If movies are puzzles, the society wants to see the puzzles solve by themselves, which most movie are like this these days. But Cloud Atlas is much more different. In case of puzzles, this film gives you the pieces but wants you to put them together buy yourself, using very intense and masterclass dialogue the film gives you clues on how to solve the puzzle, which requires thinking and sharpness. Also, there are some unbelievably great performances, especially form Tom Hanks, Hugo weaving, Helle Berry and Ben Whishaw.<br/><br/>Indeed, its a mess but has a pattern to it, and you have to find it yourself. the movie is not a masterpiece (but its very close to one) because I believe ""the Wachowskis"" were focusing too much on the details that they forgot about some very very basic parts that every movie has.<br/><br/>So, if you are about to watch Cloud Atlas for first time, make sure you paying enough attention while watching, if you don't you'll get lost."
"spradley-3","9","6","9","8 February 2014"," Wow - blew me away!
","Let me start by saying this is not the kind of movie I generally watch. I'm all for the mindless action, occasional drama genre. So why did I even pick up this film? It was at the library, I looked at the actors and thought - OK. I didn't know anything about the film when I started watching it. I'll also share that I am not the type of viewer that concentrates on movies (on DVD). I multi-task - emails, etc. - while I 'watch'. Luckily, I also had 'subtitles on' (some parts are hard to understand).<br/><br/>While the film was slow in getting started, there was something about the timeline stories that caught my interest. The characters are well- done and I wanted to find out what happened to them in the different 'times'. It was obvious right off that the characters move between timelines. This has been done before but never 6 at the same time. What was done exceptionally well was the way the movie built momentum as it neared the end - in ALL six timelines - frantically switching back and forth. So you're watching, waiting to find out what happens in your favorite timeline - you will have one or two - and things are happening fast and furious in all 6. My three favorites were 'Adam Ewing - the lawyer on the ship', 'Somni 451 and Hae-Joo Chang' in the future and the composer, Frobisher. Jim Sturgess was fantastic as were Doona Bae and Ben Whishaw. The sensitivity they brought to their characters was truly exceptional. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are not my favorite actors but were OK in their parts. The comic relief of Cavendish was done well but I have to admit, I had no idea how any of it worked into the timeline threads until I read about the story online and re-watched the movie. Yes - it's complicated, yes - it was not done as well as it could have been - but it has never been attempted before - to do 6 timelines, with actors moving between sets and locations like this. It was a remarkable feat of film-making and gave me a new appreciation for how difficult it must be keeping all that straight! <br/><br/>I feel that the critics of this movie were expecting something simpler, more action- packed and more main-streamed. I usually do, too. However, there was something different about this movie that drew me in and made me want to know more about how it was made and the actual plot between timelines. It is not light watching and it's long, you'll probably want to watch it again. <br/><br/>Turn subtitles on - it'll be easier to understand because of the pigeon English being spoken in the far future. I understand the film didn't do well when released. I hope it gets more acclaim in subsequent views because it deserves more accolades than it received. It will have you thinking about it for days after viewing."

","Awesome movie!! Tom Hanks was brilliant. Haley Berry did a very good job. I was shocked that it didn't win an Academy for best picture, but I'm sure it's because it wasn't violent enough to interest the public in that way. I haven't read the book but I will now that I know there is one. The story is amazing and I loved how it showed our human relationships and how they are such a binding force in the way we live our lives. The acting was phenomenal, you have to be pretty well rounded to pull off multiple characters and succeed in doing so, and not get stagnant. Sometimes the movie was very hard to follow but it was so engaging that is was not hard to stay interested. There were moments when I felt lost but all of the questions were answered by the end. Definitely a must see for people who like movies that have substance and aren't just about killing other humans. A must own and watch over and over again."
"Bob_the_Hobo","10","6","9","3 July 2013"," An Unforgettable Experience
","We have all heard that our actions in the present will impact the actions others will make hundreds, thousands of years in the future. ""Cloud Atlas"" defies that idea by replacing ""others"" with ""we"". Over six story lines spreading from the historical African slave trade all the way to a post-apocalyptic future, people cut from the same mold make decisions in their present that effect who they are to be in the future. The Wachowskis and Tom Twyker have engineered a thrilling, romantic, truly unforgettable epic.<br/><br/>Screen writing is without a doubt the most difficult aspect of making a film. Everything hinges on how well the plot hangs together, how the lines create conflict and chemistry and make these essentials go together seamlessly. The authors of ""Cloud Atlas"", who also directed the piece, had a blueprint in David Mitchell's book, but still had to adapt a Star Wars-like future and an early 1900's English countryside into the same film without the plot falling apart. The Wachowski's and Tom Twyker have done exactly so, which is reason enough for this film to succeed. <br/><br/>The actors, including Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon along with Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and the underrated Keith David, all perform with downright majesty considering the complexity of the as many as six characters each play. It takes true talent not just to eloquently read lines but also to understand the director's vision, and each performance fits like a glove into the world each of the six stories has created. ""Cloud Atlas"" is the top of the list of ensemble films. <br/><br/>The best line of the film comes near the end; ""From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth out future."" We would all be well to remember this."
"greenwoodair","9","7","11","7 January 2014"," this is why I love films
","A wonderful piece, even better than ""the Matrix"" series in terms of humanity and complexity. It's not easy to tell such a long story (actually a few stories) in three hours, at least I found it hard to get everything straight during my first watch. I was deeply impressed by the extraordinary acting ensemble and touched by the story though when I stepped out of the cinema. It's a much better experience when I recently watched it again: some lines truly resonated with a reverberating roar in my heart, like the following one I understand now the boundaries between noise and sound are conventions. All boundaries are conventions, waiting for the truth in it. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive doing so. Moments like this, I can feel your heart beating as clearly as my own, and I know that separation is an illusion. My life extends far beyond the limitations of me.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching over and over again."

","wow what a film... so glad i finally locked in this modern feat proving an instant masterpiece... the Wachowski brothers are back with their best effort since the original Matrix film, possibly even surpassing it's predecessor with it's ambitious overlapping narrative form, yet somehow stringing together different time periods, a juxtaposition of characters or a common bond / theme rolls throughout each part... it's like watching 5 different films at once, with their stories unwinding in a similar way... stating that there is life after death & we keep making the same mistakes until there's an urgent call for change, for revolution, for love, for all eternity... <br/><br/>this is not an easy watch with a running time of 172 mins, but i urge yourself like i did to pick a time that you are prepared for a ride like no other... a brilliant screenplay impeccably delivered to the screen by these 2 brothers, proving there is still hope for greatness out of Hollywood & original stories / concepts... <br/><br/>the film reminds me of are Wong Kar Wai's ""2046"" and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" in narrative structure, but taken to new heights with the way the stories transition and interweave... yes it's a long film but i couldn't see this cut any shorter from an editor's perspective, it was perfect in it's delivery by close that left me with chills... it's a film you'll get a lot more from with repeated viewings, like the Wachowski brothers ""The Matrix"" did all those years ago... but this time upping the anti with this feat of writing / directing that is extremely rare nowadays<br/><br/>however reading figures of opening weekend and sales since then makes me think this $100M+ film may not break even, so do your part to check this film out, hire it or buy it... even if u refuse to pay for media nowadays, d/l & watch it then decide weather it's worth owning... cause if u have an intense experience like i did, ull be hanging to watch it again on Blu Ray - <br/><br/>9/10 and added to my ""Masterpiece Collection"" list"

","Did I miss something? Maybe I did, but maybe thats the point, maybe this movie is an all you can eat buffet and you take from it what you want. Complexity walking sideways down a linear path that leads to where you were always never headed. Its like the film makers took a thousand piece puzzle and delicately cut each piece into smaller bits, tossed the lot into a blender then calmly placed each bit on the table randomly. The pieces fit together and the picture is complete, but the image in front of you doesn't matter anymore, watching it all unfold is the joy. <br/><br/>For me, great movies leave me feeling different afterwards. Somehow they touch my life and I am no longer who I was, even if this feeling dissolves after a few hours I can't go back to the world I was in before. I didn't feel like this after Cloud Atlas, I felt it most the way through. <br/><br/>The film is just shy of 3 hours but you won't notice thanks to the perfect tempo and structure. You will not rest, you will not desire rest, you will saviour every scene as if it's the last. The characters are brilliant and the dialogue is varied and important. The score. So much happens that I can barely recall half of it, no doubt snippets will find my thoughts throughout this week. I'm going to bed after writing this in the hope that my subconscious makes sense of the things my conscious could not. <br/><br/>Will your life be changed after watching this? No, of course not... But if like me, you long for that abstracted personality inside you to breathe life into you once more, this film has, well, bags of it!"

","What a wonderful movie this is: exciting, suspenseful, poignant, funny, and moving all at once. Loved it. Notice how Tom Hanks goes from a villain to the savior of the human race about 300 years of reincarnated lives. Very buddhist idealogy. My favourite is the struggling composer who must write a great symphony before leaving the world. Watch carefully the arc of the characters played by the same actors - Hugo Weaving goes from assassin in the earlier timeline to the devil in the final segment. Round and round, the stories give an impression of an endless cycle of interconnected lives. This is one of the best movies of the year. Give the film score an Oscar already!"
"GlennInWinnipeg","10","7","11","15 December 2012"," Matrix went religious - this one went political.
","This is simply an amazing movie on so many levels. Editing -- it must have been a nightmare to do and I cannot find a fault in it. Bravo.<br/><br/>Papa Sung's bar is perhaps capitalism. Perhaps we are all working in that bar as slaves for those literally feeding off our labours. You go to work with the promise that if you give to the company you will be rewarded with ""accolades and awards"" and a promising retirement? <br/><br/>If you liked the original Matrix -- for the beauty and storytelling (and many messages) -- you will love this one. It you do not like thinking, and just want a feel good movie buzz -- this one will seem long.<br/><br/>For me, I think it was outstanding and will watch it a couple more times. Which was the exact feeling I had with the first Matrix.<br/><br/>Remember is uses arc storytelling, which is a bit like a soap opera with several story lines running at the same time and you jump to each.<br/><br/>The directors said the INTENT was to start off with the viewer feeling confused and lost as the 6 different story lines have sharp disjointed cuts and one wonders what is the connection. I know many people in the theater I was in had already given up in the first 15 minutes and were busy with their cellphones or chatting or whatever. As the movie goes along the stories are edited to show they are the same story really .. for instance in the future they are on that narrow expandable bridge and it cuts back to the ship and the guy running on the narrow beam. Just perfection.<br/><br/>This movie is not junk food -- designed to give a rush with no mental activity - just stimulation. Go watch a contrite love story or action movie for that. But for those who like to participate and to be pulled into a movie, this one is truly amazing."

"neil-476","8","11","20","27 February 2013"," Enjoyable, but requires effort
","I'll try to keep my synopsis simple. There are six stories, each taking place in a different era: <br/><br/>1. A trader in the 1800s becomes ill on a voyage home; <br/><br/>2. A young homosexual in the 1930s becomes amanuensis for an elderly composer; <br/><br/>3. A journalist in the 1970s investigates shady goings on involving a nuclear energy company; <br/><br/>4. A writer/literary agent in the present day encounters the results of financial imprudence; <br/><br/>5. A genetically engineered waitress in 2144 is liberated from servitude, but there are consequences; <br/><br/>6. A goatherd in a feudal-type village After The Fall is called on to help a visitor from a technologically advanced area. <br/><br/>Each of these stories has one or more links to others: sometimes the link is an artefact of some sort, sometimes it is a family connection, sometimes it is thematic. As if to reinforce this, the same actors play the principal characters in each story.<br/><br/>The stories are not told sequentially (ie. one after the other). They are told chronologically, however, and the cross cutting between them makes for some interesting choices: sometimes the cut is simply to maintain suspense, but sometimes it is to point up plot similarities, or thematic, or visual, or bridged by sound. I was very impressed with the editing; it was easy to follow the narrative of all six stories, and each of them had plenty of drama and interest (my favourites were the two in the future, though there was moderate audience laughter at the present day story).<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about the actors playing multiple parts. I can see why this choice was made (and the make up is superb throughout), but sometimes it is distracting trying to figure out who is playing what.<br/><br/>I was very taken with Doona Bae, playing genetically engineered Sonmi - she conveyed enormous emotions in a performance which required her to appear almost totally unemotional.<br/><br/>This film is going to require repeated viewing to get the most out of it, but that's fine: three hours zipped by before I knew it."

It is also clear that it is destined for a place among the nobles of cinematic history. Bravo does not suffice. I'll leave the reviews up to the pros, but for my humble part let me just say Cloud Atlas is a labyrinthine and magnificent spectacle, adventurous, humorous, ingenious, layered, insightful and moving. Very moving. But be warned: take care of nature's call before you sit down. You can't afford to miss a moment. And forgo the popcorn. You'll be too busy following the story to eat it."

You don't know if they are related at all. <br/><br/>However, cinematography is great, acting is great, makeup is great except getting Weaving and Sturgess to play Asian.

"hellraiser7","10","14","27","28 October 2012"," Time Passages
","Individuals actions and decisions throughout the ages are strange things because it always seems to be the littlest things that lead up to something more and turn into something even more as time goes on. Is it really just free will or is it a higher purpose that guides us as if it was written in the stars. This is just one of the mysteries of life but also this move.<br/><br/>It's one of those films you really don't see every day, the film is practically a puzzle within a puzzle, it's one of those ones where you have to watch again just to uncover more. And I love those kinds of films because the enigma is part of what makes the film a rich experience.<br/><br/>The characters I think our great there are a lot of them because there are a lot of stories; their not the deepest characters but you do know enough to care about them and what they do knowing the decisions and actions they execute will lead to something. I liked the performances of the actors and actresses Tom Hanks, Hale Berry, Hugo Weving, Susan Surandon, and others, what was great about their performances was the fact in each of the stories they all played different characters which to me is a great but fun acting challenge and they all passed. From the different accents they had to execute but physically the different make up they all had to wear and the make up work is perfect in some of the other stories some of the actors are literally unrecognizable you really would think they were different people.<br/><br/>But most importantly I really love the story structure because it's something truly different. All of the stories are linear but there is a multitude of them, all in different settings and are told at once and not in any particular order or time. Each of them are connected and unconnected in a way, they also seem to be a Chex Mix of genres all to make a tasty snack. One story is a drama, another a suspense thriller, another some tomorrows world sci-fi, another a mix of both post apocalyptic and final frontier sci-fi, and any other genre or sub genre you can think of. There all about something and yet at the same time their not I'll leave it up to you to make your own conclusion about that but I think that's the point.<br/><br/>Two of my favorite ones no doubt are the two stories that take place in the future, what can I say I'm a sci-fi fan. One story which is a tomorrows world story is great I really love the production value that was put into that, most of that was CGI but it was used well and with great detail, it's a future obviously reminiscent of ""Blade Runner"". But what I liked in that story was the concept was really dark as we see it's a future that has completely sold out their free will, enviorment and morals toward consumerism, greed and gluttony. The technology in that story is fascinating the use of touch and hand motion screens and others things. I like the main character whom is sympathetic and out of her element as well and the significant other helping her, it's almost reminiscent of the sci-fi gem ""The Fifth Element"" which also had the same dynamic.<br/><br/>And the other which is the post apocalyptic/final frontier sci-fi story. Really like the look of the post apocalyptic world where it's looks and feels almost alien because of how different it is from the way people talk which is almost a Cajun like tone and certain customs. I like the chemistry between both Tom Hanks and Halle character, how conflicted in emotions both are, but also how both sort of represent they classic dynamic of nature and technology, old and new contemporary wisdom.<br/><br/>I've said enough, Cloud Atlas is a journey throughout the ages you never know where it begins but you don't want it to end.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

I have been minimised to a stupid consumer. In essence the whole movie is a simple demonstration, or, to be precise, an illustration of certain ideas which are imposed to you. I had no space to breathe. It was decided for me what I had to think. Brilliant directing and acting of some nice stories was lost in the whole material. All six parts do not hold together and do not form the whole in spite some narrative connections. They try to say so much that at the end they say very little. There are no discoveries. All you need to do is open your mouth, they will chew it for you and place it directly in your stomach.

","Probably the best movie of the year. Finally something original, well made movie. I did not feel even once that the story was driven by cgi, or the sake of cheese story telling. <br/><br/>Its a very complex tale, but on the other hand its quite simply. the thing which can make it complex, if You try to place all the characters in each time period of the story. Like oh there's Hugh Grant in 1800, and here's Hugh Grant in 1930 and that's most be the same character. No, not at all. The way I understand it, the only continuing character is the one with the falling star, and dose not matter how plays the character, as long as the mark is there. The rest of them are filling in characters. And by that I don't mean they aren't important, or relevant to the story, they just simply not the same person in the next life, even if they played by the same actor, or have similar character base. So just keep Your eye on that star, and float with the story. <br/><br/>Another reason why its complex, and simple on the other hand. Is because its tells lots of human behavior, emotions, reactions. How we impact each other. And things like friendship, betray, greed, loyalty, braveness, and the list is quite endless. But the golden role of the over all story remains the same, keep Your eye on the falling star, and experience how one soul can experience different life's, hole different surroundings. And even a drop of the ocean can leave a significant mark, since after all the ocean is is build up by millions of drops. <br/><br/>And of course while its fairly simple to understand the main line, I bet if You watch the movie over, and over. You will found more and more small bridges linking together the different time period's, which You might miss at the first watch. <br/><br/>Don't go expecting You will see classic plot flow, like the hero's gather trough out a journey so in the end they face a challenge which was building up from the beginning of the tale. Its a very different plot telling. How ever its true that each reincarnation sorta face the dark side of humanity in different forms, and trying to leave his/her mark in history. <br/><br/>But in the end the only thing which really matters, that I cant say anything bad about the movie. Infect I can only say good things about it. Go watch it, its worth it."

Actually no, hell seemed like a better option than watching this movie. I honestly envied the guy who shot himself in this film because I was pondering that myself. My friend and I were ready to walk out and almost wished we had. And what makes us even more upset is the trailer was completely inaccurate. It makes you think this is an action film.

","Most films exist purely for pleasure, to occupy your mind for a couple hours: take you to another world, let you forget about your problems, and you leave the theater $11 a seat poorer (not to mention what you spent on consumables), yet no richer for the experience. You paid for nothing more than a memory that, more often than not, is not particularly memorable.<br/><br/>But every once in a while you do see something extraordinary. Something that makes you want to tell all your friends about the movie you just saw, and look askance at someone who says they didn't like it, as if to say, ""What movie did you just watch?"" Or, perhaps, ""Oh, I'm sorry, were you expecting Transformers 4?"" What Cloud Atlas does that is most impressive, to me, is that it asks us, as an audience, to expect more from our movies. Most of the movies we consider great have done this: Citizen Kane pioneered, among its almost innumerable technical advancements, non-linear storytelling; Psycho had the guts to kill off its main character 1/3 of the way into the movie, setting up similar shocks in future films like Alien and Scream.<br/><br/>Perhaps Cloud Atlas's closest comparison, however, is 2001. Both were ravaged by some critics and fiercely embraced by others. Both asked questions about the universe and our existence in it without giving us answers, asking us only to ask questions of ourselves. Neither have neat endings that wrap everything up. Cloud Atlas will probably fair the same as 2001 commercially: that is to say, make little at the box office but have a long and rich life on video. (2001 ultimately played long in theaters, but in today's industry it's unlikely Cloud Atlas will have the opportunity to stick around as long.) <br/><br/>This film is a singular experience. I can only speak about it in hyperbole, a language previously unknown to me. People will be watching this movie and discussing it for decades. People will become filmmakers because of this movie. It will be taught in film classes. I know I myself will see it at least twice more in the theater. And thirty years from now we'll look back at the list of films that were nominated for Best Picture for 2012, and we'll say, ""I can't even remember half these movies.

Could this ambitious film work as well as it seems or will it end up being to convoluted and confusing? <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas follows six intertwining stories featuring stories of an ocean voyage across the Pacific; letters from a composer to his friend; a thriller about a power plant murder; a nursing home escape; futuristic Korea; and the tale of a tribe living in post-apocalyptic Hawaii. To say this movie is ambitious is an understatement. It has so many layers to the story, yet somehow works perfectly. This film plays like six separate films merged together with various common elements. The performances are all brilliant across the board, with Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving really standing out. Hanks was the most unexpected, but not his acting as he has proved himself as an actor, but more the various roles he took on. Most of these are not ones you ever imagine Hanks to play and he killed every one of them better than the next. Weaving on the other hand is known for playing some out there characters and delivers like never before with every one of his characters he brings to life. Jim Broadbent delivers the most humorous of all the performances as well as the most memorable. The rest of the cast delivered so much to the overall execution of this film especially with the unexpected characters they portray. At times there are some of the actors that you will not even realize they were in the scene or the character you are watching. This movie is amazing to watch and is way more of an experience than just a film. Rarely does a film deliver almost every genre into one piece without becoming so full of itself and confusing, but here it brilliantly tells these stories effectively keeping everything needed in tact to deliver the message it is trying to convey.<br/><br/>There are few movies that come along that truly feel epic, but Cloud Atlas is defiantly one of them. There are some moments where the make-up effects don't work near as well, mostly just coming off a bit strange, but if you let it go and buy into the film as a whole it will not deter you from the glorious nature of it all. This is an experience the few films are able to deliver on such a grand scale. It will be interesting to see what everyone takes away from the story itself and its' message as it seems to be touching on everything from love, oppression, reincarnation and more. Everyone should open their mind and let the experience of this film flow into your brain, you will not be disappointed."

","Like ""Matrix"", ""Cloud Atlas"" is pretty good at disturbing our borderline between real and imagination. Watching this movie might make you think ""Wow, maybe THIS is how reincarnation works"". It's easy to say ""No"", of course, but who knows? Maybe we are living under the strict control of gigantic artificial intelligence and there maybe another world beyond our reach. Maybe we are given birth to this world again and again experiencing our own lives.<br/><br/>And I think that's the best thing of this movie. It's not just somebody's imagination. It can reach OUR imagination and make us think even if you are not a fan of sci-fi stories.<br/><br/>It's not a simple entertainment, I admit. Sometimes you might get confused following the storyline, but let me just say ""hold still a bit"" and then you could experience something you never forget.<br/><br/>This is the movie you definitely want to watch in theater."

","I'd heard about Cloud Atlas a few months ago and I love thought provoking films so I watched the trailer and I was hooked already. I watched the film today and it completely exceeded my expectations! Everything about it was amazing; the acting, the stories, the visuals, the art direction, everything was perfect to a tee.<br/><br/>This film will tick every emotional box, it will make you laugh, cry, fear, hate, love and will have you on the edge of your seat. The complex, slow burning story is pulled off very intricately with pure excellence. Also to add the excellent musical score which adds more to this atmospheric epic. This film can pretty much interest all genres as the time periods vary from colonial times to post apocalyptic futuristic metropolis. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend anyone who loves something unique and with a star-studded cast. This film really should have been submitted to the Oscar Nominations, it's such a shame that it isn't nominated for any."

","Don't listen to the naysayers. Although it is difficult to put together all of the segments of he movie, the segments of this movie are so interesting and inspiring in themselves that the movie is fascinating even if you can't form a mental synthesis of all the stories. I particularly liked the future world represented by Seoul, Korea. Without giving away the plot, suffice it to say that the combination of spectacular special effects and the ultimate underdog versus establishment storyline make for an exciting and enthralling viewer experience. The Korean actress Doona Bae as a ""fabricant"" is so convincing and likable that she steals the show. The interplay between this story and the story with Tom Hanks and Halle Berre in the ""valley"" in the post apocalyptic world is shocking yet totally plausible. This is not an ""easy"" movie to figure out and definitely not formulaic. Perhaps reading the novel, which I have not done yet, would clarify a lot. But the fact that I want to read the novel is indicative of the movie's strange and gripping hold on the viewer."

","You can hardly talk about this film without giving spoilers. If you ever had any doubts about Tom Hanks as a superlative and versatile actor, this film will settle it. Watch the ending credits to see who played what because it will blow you away. Hugo Weaving does what he does best. As everyone who's read reviews knows by now, the film involves six interlaced stories from the mid-19th century to several centuries in the future. The stories are linked very lightly. There's no ham-handed reference in one story to a previous or future story line. At most there are hints. A journal and letters from one story turn up later, and so on. The pace is vigorous, and the stories, though not tightly linked, flow smoothly from one to the other; the action in one makes sense in view of what just happened in another, and so on. Even thinking about trying to keep this straight makes my head hurt. There's action, good special effects, and richly satisfying conclusions to most of the stories, but not uniformly happy. Unlike Roger Ebert, I don't want to see this film again. It would ruin the experience of watching it unfold for the first time."

","First and foremost this movie is not for everyone. It was evident when by one hour 25% of the theater became empty. But what they missed!!! Its a 3 hours movie (not very uncommon in bollywood) and every minute was different from the other. It was like watching a very Indian classical concert where they start off slow and then keep building the flow and then break the walls of the music theater with their crescendo at the end. Its not a movie with linear plot, a very complex story spanning between centuries and places and if someone asks me what the story was, honestly I wont be able to narrate (they can read the book though which is a masterpiece). The visualizations were amazing be it in the ship or Neo Seoul, the sound effects completely shook hand with the visualization. The acting was great, costumes were great (seemed a little fake at times). The fight sequences, romance (both varieties), music all were well so well mixed in the film that it was like a nice giant cocktail. If you are a fan of movies where you can not decide which genre it belongs to then you should just not miss it."

I also did not know what I thought about the close to 3 hour running time and 3 directors working to assemble this truly epic endeavor. <br/><br/>Let me tell you that they did it. <br/><br/>Not only do they somehow achieve not feeling like their is too much going on or that parts of the movie should be eliminated, but each actor/actress really transforms from character to character and you feel something for every single one. <br/><br/>That is freaking impressive. <br/><br/>But what's even more impressive on this sucker is that you get sucked in during the 1st 10 minutes (unlike the book in which I put it down after 30 long pages) by the way they introduce all 6 stories up front, switch between them in an almost seamless fashion, and reduce the whole meaning of these stories down to a paragraph at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Gosh, the level of mastery here makes me want to vomit. <br/><br/>If I resist the urge, let me finally ad the cinematography, acting, and makeup should all be nominated for Academy Awards.

"seamancup","1","11","21","10 February 2013"," Epically pretentious drivel
","Seeing as most people seem to adore this film and have the opinion it's real high-brow stuff I'm sure most of these clever geniuses will claim that I never really ""got the movie"". Because surely that would be the explanation for not liking this epic feat of artistical splendor, right?<br/><br/>No, I ""got the movie"" just fine. I could understand the connections between the segments and could follow the narrative stream just fine. I got that it was about the various struggles and hardships of being human and what that means. I just plain out didn't like most part of it. To me the movie, apart from being ridiculously owerblown and pretentious in this statement, seemed void and lacking of any cinematic quality in any way. The director clearly hasn't an artistic bone in his body and the result is a tediously outstretched and really very confused hodgepodge of terrible science fiction on the one hand and pretentious uninspired period drama on the other and with a more or less comedy piece set in present day thrown in the middle of it all for good measure. With such a magnificent chaos of directing the 3 hours of the movie seem to go on for almost as long as the 1000 years of the plot. Now the present day segment (the one with the cockney Tom Hanks and the nursery home bit) I actually found to be quite entertaining and it is the sole reason for me not trashing the movie completely. A good nod should go to Jim Broadbent who really shone in all of his roles throughout the film, but especially here in this segment. However one brilliant actor can't redeem a movie that's so severely lacking elsewhere.<br/><br/>So to sum things up (as I really don't want to spend an entire night writing a review for a movie I didn't even like): One of the segments was fairly amusing, yes. However the rest of it was just awful pretentious drivel either as a tediously lacklustre pretentious period drama or otherwise a flat out B quality science fiction flick. Grade: 2 whatevers out of 10. <br/><br/>Now if you really wish to see a ""philosophical epic"" currently in theaters, go see ""Life of Pi"" instead, it's a great film. Cloud Atlas is definitely not."

","Cloud Atlas is quite the exhausting film - Long, Boring and disconnecting. Most of the six stories are quite weak and the switch from one story to another is random as opposed to seamless.Some of the stories are weak and fail to capture any emotion.Like many adapted movies, many events in this movie remain unexplained, for example, the comet birthmark in all the characters. These stories weren't intertwined intelligently enough. Acting was good but left you feeling helpless with the amount of times each character appeared in a completely different form, gender, race etc. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks' Character's ""new English"" in the post apocalyptic world is almost undecipherable.Hence a lot of the message is completely lost during his narration.<br/><br/>This was a rather difficult book to adapt and the directors clearly showed that.

","Oh boy, I would like to divide my comment into:<br/><br/>The Good. The actors perform quite good their roles, although everything is flipping so fast that I didn't have time to be involved with any them. I really liked the science fiction scenes of the city, avenues of light, customizable small apartments, flying vehicles and that stuff.<br/><br/>The Bad. Well, here we go... The stories are FULL of clichés at the extreme that you know what the actors are going to do and tell, quite predictable. Among them the story of Matrix is once again chewed out...the resistance against the system, Morpheus (with a touch of African-Malasian), Nero (with an Asian-Scandinavian outfit) etc etc. Come on guys!, let go that period of your life move on!, no body wants to hear over and over again the same stuff, with time it gets boring, really. <br/><br/>All the stories contain unnecessary portrays of violence, hate, anger and fear. In my opinion they could had spared some to reduce the final running time without affecting the...he...(scramble) ..plot.<br/><br/>It is suppose all stories are somehow connected... well that was a nice try but at the end I gave up, I got the feeling as if I was changing among channels on a TV. And three hours of that BEWARE! <br/><br/>The worst. Now you are telling me that THIS three hours of nonsense cost the incredible amount of 100 000 000 USD!. With the same funding you could support for 10 years an army of highly specialized scientists (in any top-research institution of your choice) to solved REAL health, environmental and energy problems. This movie itself is an example of how resources are wasted in modern times. And on the first place WHO provided the money?.<br/><br/>I am wondering where all that money went, and after reading the comments at IMDb I just got the idea that perhaps, just as a strategy to enhance marketing, a group of people got a little cash stimulus to write GREAT comments to support this charade. Who knows, concerning profit everything is allowed (the movie tells us that!).<br/><br/>Final word. As always time will tell what movies will become cult movies. From the Matrix, after 14 years, still I recall its incredible scenes and plot. As for Cloud Atlas in no time it got erased from my mind FOREVER."

The challenging accents for the actors were equally challenging for the audience to understand, even those with an ear for unusual language. In regard to the length, it appeared that a lot of people had the 'oh my that was 3 hours' response rather than the 'that was 3 hours long?, it didn't seem like it' response. Although the makeup will be touted as nothing short of phenomenal, the closeups revealed obvious flaws and tells of where the actor ended and the makeup began.

","I wanted to enjoy this movie, but the 1849 scenario set in the ""Pacific Islands"" (Huh? Which ones?) depicts African slaves working on a plantation under brutal subjugation by English overlords. It turns out the ""African slaves"" are actually supposed to be Maori who, if you don't know (as the supremely ignorant filmmakers clearly didn't), are not Africans but rather Polynesians (Pacific Islanders) and were certainly not enslaved as depicted in this movie. And I don't care if this is based on a work of fiction because it was surely the filmmaker's (and not the author's) choice to cast African actors into Pacific Islander ""Maori"" roles. And don't tell me there weren't any Pacific Islanders or actors who at least look Polynesian.<br/><br/>So it's not surprising that they are vague about the exact location of these islands, which gives this particular story a broad-brushed, white-man-enslaving-generic-dark-men, so who cares if its complete b.s? feel. It took me completely out of the movie. There were never African slaves on a Pacific Island who were called Maori and who were forced under whip to work on plantations. This movie is so DUMB! I hate that it only adds to the general level of ignorance, and disrespects the very existence and identity of Polynesians and Pacific Islanders. WE are NOT Africans-not that there's anything wrong with that. And we deserve to be portrayed as ourselves, and not as Africans.<br/><br/>In this day and age, there is no excuse for the level of ignorance perpetuated by the filmmakers in their portrayal of this slice of ""history,"" fiction or not!

","The title says it all. As a viewer who didn't read the book the movie was an utterly nonsensical, unrelated chain of events pieced together in a total lack of coherency. The sad thing was after three hours of patience and expectations that this horrid parade of unrelated fragments (by the way, most of them are quite cheesy and cliché) would somehow connect the result was a ludicrous campfire scene on a distant planet where ""old"" Tom Hanks with an awful makeup was pointing out a blue planet -yes ""a planet"" among a star cluster- in the middle of milky way, in order to show where he'd come from... Speaking of the makeup, the work on ""old"" Hugh Grant's face was so amateurish that the poor guy had difficulty in moving his lips when talking.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I've been always leery about sci-fi movies and this one was no exception. However, after seeing the cast, I was a bit optimistic that Tom Hanks, Halley Berry and other big shots would be careful about their reputation before undertaking any risk with their careers. I still think they are. It is quite possible that after reading the book (I'm giving them at least this much credit despite this shipwreck), they mentally connected all the gaps in the scenario with dotted lines and were duped into thinking that this was going to be a good movie. However, for someone who has no idea about the book the gaps are simply too large to bridge.<br/><br/>Despite the seemingly complex plot and background, I don't think that overall job in this movie was as difficult as C. Nolan's Inception. The latter did a wonderful job by tying all the loose ends very cleverly. The producers in this movie apparently thought that casting the same actors in different roles (with bad makeups) was enough to connect the events.

And the acting in the movie was good but all was wasted on a script which failed miserably to explain whatever concept they where trying to portray on screen. There was a lot of time lines shown, with the same person appearing overtime as same characters. But this excessive use of time line confuses the viewer. The story goes on and on without focusing on any particular theme and leaves you frustrated as to what is being shown. <br/><br/>There might be a good philosophical message embedded some where in the movie, but the movie leaves you so confused that you just want the torture to end.

And the make-up artistry they did on them was notable. <br/><br/>But the rest and the overall was shallow and confusing, and ultimately: boring. One waits for a message, and waits for hours, but when something like a message comes at the end, it's unbelievably sugary and trivial. The final scene made me really cringe with shame.<br/><br/>I give three points because some of the acting was really good, notably Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>P.S. I was so upset about the film, and curious, I got me the book. And I like that better. I think the film has unnecessarily disrupted the longer story lines of the book, and thus has made the film quite incomprehensible for all who have not read the book before. And one other thing: I saw the film in the German language version, and that version is a complete disaster. It even fails to convey the political point of the ""Sonmi 451"" storyline, that she lives under a ""Corpocracy"" and that the only opposition to that is the ""Union"" aka ""Trade Union"". The German version does not realise the Trade Union angle, and so fails to make this story comprehensible and relevant.<br/><br/>I realise some films are made even worse through some of their different language versions. I think ""Cloud Atlas"" is one of them."

","I have Cloud Atlas a couple of times since it's release, and recently gave it another viewing. Cloud Atlas really is a film like no other, a sweeping epic all about people's lives are all connected throughout time. There are many talented actors/actresses in this film, all who play multiple characters across multiple story lines. Each storyline takes place in a different time, from the mid 1800s, all the way to a post apocalyptic Hawaii dated as ""106 Winters After The Fall"". The film explores a lot of themes of life such as love, loss, conflict, conspiracy, greed, and what it means to be truly free. All of the actors give truly excellent performances in the film, and are believable in every one of their roles.<br/><br/>The only storyline that might prove difficult in the viewing is the post apocalyptic storyline, in which the locals use this ""valley speak"" which can be a challenge to comprehend without subtitles, but other than that the stories are all very well done. While all mostly serious drama, there is one storyline which provides the film's comic relief, known as ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"", with Jim Broadbent at it's center, and Hugo Weaving as the tyrannical (and female) Nurse Noakes, and it involves four elderly folk in a daring escape of a nursing home. My other personal favourite storyline is one which takes place in a dystopian Korean city known as ""Neo Seoul"", and involves a rebellion against a totalitarian government. Not to say that the other stories are any worse by any means, of course.<br/><br/>Simply put, without giving too much away, Cloud Atlas is an amazing film. It can make you laugh, make you cry, and make you cheer in excitement. I rate this film a solid 9/10."

","OK, so I haven't read the book. But that shouldn't be necessary, I paid to watch a film after all, so I shouldn't have to read a book to understand what is going on.<br/><br/>So. What we have here is 6 separate stories. And that's the crux of the problem, they are just that, 6 completely separate stories, there is no connection between them, no tying up of loose ends, no sense of closure or completeness. The film makers try to link the stories together by utilising the 'ingenious' mechanism of having the main actors play different parts throughout the 6 stories but really, come on, Doona Bae for example is a beautiful South Korean woman but made up as a white woman she just looked plain weird. I would rather have had 6 interconnected stories played by 6 different sets of actors and have some kind of ending that actually connected the 6 stories than this pile of steaming crap. Yes, I get the reincarnation angle, the repeating cycle of good versus evil and oppression of the good, blah, blah, blah. But did it really need 3 hours of boredom to convey this simple message. I actually felt sorry for the actors, there's nothing wrong in their performances it's just that frankly you can't polish a turd and that's what this is...a big old turd dressed up to be something more than what it is! Shame really."
"secondtake","7","12","25","5 November 2012"," It's grand, funny, deep, and ambitious. But it's also weirdly flat, the meanings thin and obvious.
","Cloud Atlas (2012)<br/><br/>It's no secret this is an ambitious film, over two hours long with three directors and scenes set in six distinct time frames over several centuries. It's also widely known that the main actors, a half dozen in all but famously Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Hugh Grant, each take on roles in the six different periods, with outrageously effective makeup that amount to disguises, at least from the viewer's perspective.<br/><br/>What remains to be seen is how any one person will respond to the film. Me? I watched it all with interest and found parts, or aspects, fascinating. But I was never really swept away, rarely did I care overly for the various protagonists, and never did the philosophical message mean beans to me. It's dumbed down a bit, a little like ""The Matrix"" which has such ambitious meaning to go along with all the technical feats. <br/><br/>The grand themes, which will take a good hour to have any inkling of, center around being noble and good in a world where much or most of society is against you. That's appealing--the main characters are fighting evil in the good old Hollywood sense. As you see the rise of one of these characters into a semi-god like figure (she is worshipped in the futuristic sections), you are expected to follow and appreciate the clap-trap pseudo-religious cant that comes from this woman's mouth. I liked her, don't get me wrong, but the writing is a bit childish.<br/><br/>What hurts the film even more is the thing that's supposed to make it so amazing and fresh--its construction in many pieces. To be clear, this isn't a set of six movies, one after another. No, we shift time zones often, sometimes in a matter of moments, often to great confusion at first. As you watch you learn how to watch, which is good, and you recognize better the different situations. But as vigorous and enlivening as this is (you really have to stay alert) it isn't really always for effect. I mean, there are reasons often for why we shift from one time zone to another, but not always in a satisfying way, It's more like the director(s) are trying to keep the audience from getting lost.<br/><br/>You might also get a little tired of the clichés that are used in each of the situations, but in fact each individual story has its interest. Some of the scenes are downright comical, practically slapstick. Others are horrifying, ranging from a personal drama and tragedy in the mid-1900s between two composers, one of them gay, to a future-based band of primitives who are being wiped out by violent huntsmen with colorful face-paint. You can see how there are clichés in the wings, ready to flourish with the right viewers.<br/><br/>The theater I saw this in (with digital, not film, projection) made it all look very good, if a bit sterile and ""perfect."" There were twenty people there and none of them left halfway. It's not a movie you necessarily abandon once you plunked down your tenner. But it will put some viewers off.<br/><br/>What saves it is significant. The acting is exaggerated and fun, and sometimes quite breathtaking in its deception. And the whole filming experience is so wide-ranging and ambitious you can't help but be impressed by all the work, and all the ideas at work. See it? If you liked ""Melancholia"" or ""2001"" or ""Tree of Life"" or other films of that sort, that look fabulous and deal with deep issues, you might really enjoy this. But don't expect your life to be changed. It's too trapped by its big intentions to ever wrestle free and be a true work of art. <br/><br/>And besides, it's been decades since a good movie has been made by committee."
"Essex_Rider","10","4","6","7 January 2014"," Unique, special and simply wonderful!
","There are so many elements to this movie that could have steered it off course, so many story lines that could have gone wrong. In fact, they blend together so beautifully that I felt I was a part of something so special and so unique. I think that in years to come, this will be praised as the seminal movie on which many others would be judged. It is so special it cannot really have a genre. From the evil Dr Goose, to the touching love story between Robert Frobisher and Rufus Sixsmith, to the realisation of Somni-451 on seeing how her 'sisters' are used as protein after being killed with a smile. The sacrifice made by Sumni is almost a futuristic crucifixion and Doona Rae played this part so beautifully, so tenderly, it really was heart wrenching. There are so many outstanding performances it's hard to pick one that truly stands out as all the characters were so outstanding, but I suppose I should say that Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent and Doona Rae really glued to movie together, but in saying that, Halle Berry was also outstanding, as was Hugo Weaving, Ben Whishaw and James D'Arcy. I cannot rate this movie highly enough, and I think it must remain top of my favourites for many years to come."
"arunsrid","10","4","6","5 January 2014"," Easily the most amazing piece of film-making in recent times
","Was searching for ""psychological science fiction"" movies in google, when I stumbled upon this gem by the Wachowskis. The first 10 minutes got my attention and I immediately realized (at the 11th minute) that this is one of those movies which I will see again and again. It is difficult for me to say that I understood the film completely, but you do not always have to understand a movie to admire it (this is not a math test), sometimes the emotions that you go through and how the film makes you feel can make you a crazy and ardent fan. I respect and adore films which present a new thought process especially about the 'dharma', 'karma' and 're-incarnation' that spans centuries. This is one such film. <br/><br/>As you might have seen the character names listed in IMDb, the same actors are re-casted as different characters in 6 different periods of time (whether or not the same person re-incarnates again repeatedly is entirely upto the viewers perspective). It is impossible to identify some of the actors in their characters, till the credits roll in the end. As for the performances in the film, everyone has given their heart and soul - that much I can say Tom Hanks, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving and the lot. The complexity, length, multitude of story lines and dynamic editing are stupendous and is one of the best movie watching experiences in the last couple of decades. (Try to watch with headphones if possible to enjoy the nuances in background score).<br/><br/>I do not wish to reveal much but this movie has got everything (science fiction, drama, history, spirituality, romance (straight and gay), revolution, soul, god, battle, humour, satire. I've already seen the film 3 times and each time it was a totally different experience and each time I discovered something new about the film (and about myself). I will definitely see it more number of times.<br/><br/>You will not regret seeing this film, even if you don't understand it.<br/><br/>Cheers"

","This is an absolutely beautiful movie. If at the beginning it can be a bit confusing, mainly because there are several stories with different time-lines and with different characters yet the same actors, soon it becomes easy to follow and feel each story and main characters.<br/><br/>One of my favourite features of this story about how one soul lives so different lives, is that as stories change the same actor would be a character of a different gender, different race and absolutely different personality yet these stories and characters would be so united.<br/><br/>Another excellent feature (among many others) of this movie in music.

"ryukdeath23","10","4","6","3 December 2013"," A Modern Classic!!!
","When you hear Cloud Atlas you ask: What is it? Is it a fantasy film? Is it a romance film? Is it a comedy film? Is it a Sci Fi Film? Is it an epic film that combines six stories into one? All of those answers are true.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a mesmerizing three hour cinematic masterpiece written and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski (The Matrix) and German director Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola, Run) and based on the novel by David Mitchell. The original novel is one of the most challenging books I've read in my life and if you want to enjoy the film entirely I suggest you read the novel first. But anyway, Cloud Atlas is a film that you can see either you've read the novel or not. <br/><br/>The film presents us six stories: An American notary who travels in a ship in the pacific islands in 1849, A British bisexual composer who starts working with his idol in 1936, An American journalist who is seeks answers against a nuclear reactor conspiracy in 1973, A British publisher who lives the ordeal of his life in 2012, A female clone who tells her story to an archivist in a futuristic Korea in 2144 and A Valleysman who tells or ""yarns"" his story during the final days of planet earth.<br/><br/>Now when you see this kind of plot or plots, you will be thinking: This does not make any sense. And that happens in the first hour of the film, you are completely lost but something keeps you watching the film. In the second hour everything will start making sense and in the final hour you will see how this masterful stories are masterfully ended.<br/><br/>I was never bored with Cloud Atlas. Despite its length, I always felt engaged with the film and here is the proof of why I was never bored with this picture:<br/><br/>1. The editing is perfect, you can almost sense that the events in the movie are happening simultaneously.<br/><br/>2. The make up is so well done that I couldn't recognize several of the actors, or I recognized some of them but they looked entirely different. One clear example is Hugh Grant's character the Kona chief or Jim Sturgess character of Hae Joo Chang. 3. The acting is impressive. The idea of several actors playing several characters is challenging, but the directors cast the right ones to do the job. The actors really impressed me, some of them play both men and women, Americans or Europeans or Koreans, young and old etc. Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent are some of the greatest actors in the world, and although they are stars we can't just ignore the rest of the cast composed by: Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Keith David, Doona Bae and so on... In my opinion, Doona Bae is a breakthrough character, her performance as Sonmi-451, (who I think is a futuristic representation of Jesus Christ), is flawless. 4. The Production Design and Effects are impressive, they are so great that you can see that Hollywood isn't the only one who can make big CGI in the industry. (Remember this is a German film). 5. The cinematography is incredible that easily adapts itself to each story. 6. And finally the music. The soundtrack composed by Tom Tykwer, Reinhold Himel and Johnny Klimek is in the lack of a better word: Perfect! When you thought each of the story would need its own music, what these three minds create is chamaleonic music that blends n perfectly with all of the stories. The Cloud Atlas Soundtrack is an album that you should have in your home.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is an impressive film. I am always angry because critics and moviegoers didn't appreciate this extraordinary film. I highly recommend Cloud Atlas, and like the great Roger Ebert, I call this one of the best films of 2012. Only 2012? I think this is one of the greatest films of the 2010's that someday will be deemed like Watchmen, Fight Club or Dark City as one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas shows us that a good story in film is far from dead."

However, I would guess that no one really knows.<br/><br/>To me, it wall about Freedom, and the lengths people will go to achieve it or hold onto it.<br/><br/>This film is actually six films. It had a stellar cast including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, and more. Each of them played different characters in six stories that took place from the 19th century to a couple of hundred years from now. They may be male in one story and female in another.

","Great film and great acting - would have given it a 10 but for the fact that Tom Hanks sounded like he was speaking in tongues when he was playing Zachary- really hate this - it is as bad as books with unpronounceable character names (anything that makes you stop to try to pronounce spoils the smooth reading) By the way saw it at cinema first then on DVD and was the same in both. My partner agrees but thinks that quality of the sound was to blame - if so filmmakers pull your socks up. Dramatically it works much better in the film than in the book as the characters weave their way through the film instead of being chopped off. Also using Tom Hanks at both beginning and end of the film was brilliant - (apparently the author agrees)"
"mike48128","10","4","6","27 September 2013"," Like 2001 and Bladerunner, It's a Confusing Classic
","First of all, this was totally ignored by ""The Oscars"" in 2012. It lost tons of money-over $75 Million and is one of the most ambitious attempts to bring an epic novel to the screen, in recent years. Not for everyone, as it shows everything from whippings to graphic and bloody tribal warfare to electrocution. Oh, there is some highly sexual content and nudity as well. If I haven't completely scared you away from watching this, then also be aware that the futuristic segments rival both the best StarTrek and Bladerunner-type movies that you have ever seen. The story is impossible to fully relate and would take several pages. It spans a timeline from 1849 to 2346. It's a revolving story with 6 distinct parts that repeat like a M*A*S*H movie, both for emphasis and clarity. It takes a while to get used to this, but eventually you see how everything ties in together, especially at the end. Five main actors play several roles each, both as men and women. (Yes, Halle Berry as a man!) Also stars Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, and Susan Sarandon and many others; who you will not always recognize due to the terrific make-up. Hugo Weaving as ""Nurse Noakes"" is the exception. He looks like a man ""in drag"" but I believe that was intentional, as that is the only humorous sequence. It's all about predestination, reincarnation, and Man's search for truth and freedom. Tom Hanks plays ""Zachry"" the storyteller that both opens and closes the movie. He is haunted by a ""green goblin"" that only he can see or that may be the author's representation of the terrible evil and prejudice in Mankind. That is the only character I don't quite understand. Parts of the movie will remind you of ""Roots"", ""Bladerunner"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Soilent Green"" and even ""The China Syndrome"", but it is done in such a way that is fresh in the re-telling. The ending is amazing as the ""Brave New World"" exists in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii that is both incredibly primitive and ultra-futuristic. Both Tom Hanks and Halle Berry deserved Ocsars for their performances. As long as ""The 10 Commandments"" at 171 minutes; best viewed in parts, to fully comprehend it. This will eventually ""make money"" thru Blu-Ray DVD release but will never be shown on ""free"" TV without several drastic cuts due to its content. Quotable lines: ""I believe that Death is only a door. When it closes, another one opens. From womb to tomb, our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we both have a future."""
"mistabobdobolina","8","4","6","1 September 2013"," An astonishingly successful adaptation
","I have to admit I was a bit skeptical. I'm a big fan of the novel this was based on, but I also would have rated it -- as a whole work -- one of the most unfilmable books I've ever read.<br/><br/>And yet they pulled it off, with surprisingly little condensation of the set of stories that form the whole. To those not familiar with the novel, Cloud Atlas tells a set of stories stretching from a 19th century Polynesian voyage to a distant post-apocalyptic future Hawaii, with stops along the way in the Thirties, the Seventies, the present day and a dystopian future ""Corpocratic"" Korea with overtones of Brave New World and Soylent Green. Each of the stories is based on a period document and is linked to the others by the appearance (somehow) of the previous document in the sequence in the current one, and also by the apparent reincarnations of at least one character.<br/><br/>The novel is structured in onion layers, moving forward in time and then backward. The movie, wisely, takes a more complicated approach, introducing each of the tales in a brief vignette and then moving forward and backward through them by thematic connections. It's quite brilliantly done and surprisingly easy to follow -- although viewers who were less familiar with the source material might perhaps have found it confusing in spots.<br/><br/>Moreover, it's nice to see that the emotional heft of the stories (the poignant tragedy of Robert Frobisher, the spunky amateur sleuthing of Luisa Rey, the broad comedy of Timothy Cavendish, the haunted future world of Zachry and Ol' Georgie with its overtones of the classic Riddley Walker) has been retained. I was worried that the overall effect might be to diffuse that kind of impact, but partly owed to fine visuals and partly to strong performances, that didn't happen.<br/><br/>And the performances are very strong: Tom Hanks shows off a quite diverse range -- making it easy to forget that his Henry Goose and Zachry, for example, are products of the same actor. Halle Berry's roles are less demanding, but she shows stronger acting chops than she's usually given credit for. Other members of the cast, woven through each story by the reincarnation theme, deliver solid to brilliant work as well, including Hugh Grant and Hugo Weaving in some expected roles and some... rather unexpected ones.<br/><br/>A special word needs to be said about the makeup, which was extensive as befits an attempt to transport an entire cast through multiple human lifetimes. It was so flawlessly done for the most part -- I didn't detect Halle Berry under the makeup for Jocasta Ayrs until I saw the credits -- that when it was distracting I have to assume the effect was intended. Sometimes the intention is clearly comic: we're meant, I think, to see Nurse Noakes precisely as Hugo Weaving in heavy drag as befits the comic tone of the Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish. Likewise, where the makeup is weird and off-putting -- as in story of Sonmi with all the fake epicanthic folds and lumpy foreheads in view -- I have to assume the effect was intentional, although I'm less sure what the intention was. In any case, it's a prominent part of the film and something viewers should be prepared for.<br/><br/>The only other minor flaw was that in the final piece in Zachry's post-apocalyptic future, the degraded pidgin-like English the characters speak sounds awfully stilted coming out of the actors' mouths. It's not a bad distraction, though, just a slight blemish on what's otherwise an excellent film."
"eyehaveewe","10","4","6","23 August 2013"," Classic Movie Experieince
","I have not read the book, but the film is utterly amazing. This is one of the few truly epic movie experiences.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is bloody and visceral to the point of excess. There are a few graphic sexual scenes. I count this as a point against the film, because it was not needed and seems like pandering to the masses.<br/><br/>Still, the theme and philosophy are incredible and motivating. I cried for about five minutes straight at one point. I've never seen a movie capture my emotions like Cloud Atlas did.<br/><br/>The Kabuki style of gender and race roles can be weird at times, but I think the directors executed it well and plays into Cloud Atlas' theme.<br/><br/>The separate plots don't come together all that well in showing what effect each timeline had on another, which is odd considering what a great job the script writers did at illustrating that this 'Cloud Atlas effect' is a real force in our lives.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie was a tremendous philosophical success. This is the type of thing that changes lives and it needed to be made. There are few movies which operate on this scale. Its mildly disturbing, but it teaches just as much as it disturbs. I feel like I should read the book, as perhaps the movie was good only because the book was excellent."

","'Cloud Atlas' - watched the DVD this weekend and was just stunned by the incredibly beautiful theme, the outstanding acting and sets, and the profound passion and scope of the story. A Truly unique and challenging and amazing film. Just gave it the first 10 I ever ranked a film on IMDb. 'The Matrix' is being used to teach philosophy in some colleges now - is this just a trick to catch young students attention? Or is using the media to posit philosophical points to large audiences a new idea? No, this is not the first time that has been done - but Cloud Atlas certainly puts the philosophy out front, and extremely well done visually and thematically. After watching 'Cloud Atlas' for the second time this week, the overwhelming core philosophy is karma and the Golden Rule, and very close to ‪Buddhist‬ ‪philosophy‬. ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."" ""Fear, belief, love; phenomena that determine the course of our lives. These forces begin long before we are born and continue after we perish."" And Tom Hanks, once again, shows the incredible range of his skills. A Magical Film."

","When I first heard of this movie, I got the impression it would be another overused drama. I was very much wrong. Though it was a drama to some extent, it was an innovative drama. The simple idea behind Cloud Atlas is a set of interwoven stories that each have a moral lesson. It is also the story of death, rebirth, and learning from past mistakes. The cinematography in this movie is spectacular. The environment and great camera work really puts you inside the characters lives. Also, the characters are very likable. They each have their own back story that connects with others lives. The story can get quite emotional at times, too. For those who don't like Cloud Atlas, or think the ideas are too confusing, this is a movie that requires a lot of thought. It should not be thought of as a drama or romance story, but rather a movie about freedom and how each one of our decisions directly and indirectly effect others. Just so you know, the only reason this movie is not liked by all is because the world wasn't ready for such a powerful film."
"brando647","9","4","6","9 August 2013"," A Refreshingly Inventive Film that Spans Generations
","Aw man, I wish I hadn't missed this film during its theatrical run. We're at a point when movie studios spend the majority of their efforts on bombastic summer blockbusters that appeal to the masses (of which, I admit, I'm a member), and it's not often we get a movie where the filmmakers really get a chance to go all out in bringing their vision to life. In my opinion, CLOUD ATLAS never really stood a chance in mainstream theaters and it's a shame to see that it grossed so low in the United States. From what I can determine, your average Joe theatergoer isn't going to invest a lot of energy into following nonlinear storytelling, especially when there are six separate stories spanning five hundred years blended together into a mosaic about reincarnation of the soul and the cyclical nature of life with themes of opposing oppression and achieving one's fate. At least, that's what I took away from this movie. I believe CLOUD ATLAS is one of those films that are open to interpretation from each member of its audience. Over the course of the film, we watch as souls move from one generation to the next and observe how the actions of one generation can drastically affect generations of the future:<br/><br/>In 1849, an American lawyer falls ill as he crosses the Pacific Ocean and befriends a stowaway slave while under the questionable care of a doctor. In 1936, an aspiring composer accepts a position as an aid to world famous musician and quietly composes his own greatest masterpiece. In 1973, a small-time journalist discovers evidence that an oil magnate might be organizing sabotage of the nuclear energy industry and endangering innocent lives. In 2012, a publisher on the run from hoodlums believes his brother has found him sanctuary in a quaint hotel in the countryside but discovers its true sinister nature. In 2144, a fabricant (clone) used for menial work in the fast food industry of Neo-Seoul escapes from her life of servitude and is shown the horrifying truth regarding the life of fabricants. And in 2321, a man of a primitive culture in the aftermath of catastrophic global events journeys to the top of a mountain where he risks facing the Devil itself to aid a friend.<br/><br/>The first aspect of CLOUD ATLAS one is bound to notice would be that every major actor in the film plays multiple roles. The filmmakers took this angle a step further and each actor portrays characters of various races and genders. This is where things can become a bit distracting at first. The makeup effects in the film are impressive and generally seamless, but Hugo Weaving in drag is still Hugo Weaving in drag. Hard as you might try, it's hard to ignore. Thankfully, this particular instance occurs in the only real comedic story in the bunch (""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"") so it doesn't hamper the story. Other cases don't necessarily fare as well. The 2144 tale is set in a futuristic Seoul, Korea so the characters are naturally Koreanexcept a good portion of the cast is not. I'll be honestit mostly works. It doesn't sit well for a little while but you become accustomed to it and future revisits to the movie become easier to settle in with. Some might also believe the language of the primitive islanders in the 2321 tale to be a problem. It sounds a little childish at first and it's weird hearing it spoken so earnestly by people like Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, but just like Jim Sturgess disguised as a Korean, you get used to it.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me, though: these are not to be construed as problems with the film. If anything, they add flavor and I love it. And once you get past some of the oddities, this is just a really, really good movie. I love how each of the stories has their own feel and each of them ties into one another in some fashion, whether directly or indirectly. Everything here is connected, and they all share the common themes found scattered throughout the movie of rising up against the powerful and oppressive. The movie is made even more effective with some amazing casting. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, and many, many more populate the film. CLOUD ATLAS is a unique experience and you have to give each cast and crew member involved for coming together to create something so different from 99% of the rest of the movies released each year. My concern is that CLOUD ATLAS did so poorly in theaters that it might discourage directors from taking chances and providing us with content more creative than your average summer explosion-fest or screwball comedies. So, in an effort to bring about more films as inventive as CLOUD ATLAS, I encourage everyone to give it a chance. It's one of those films that are perfect for a post- viewing discussion."

","I almost watched this movie twice, on DVD. And yes, it really helps to turn on the ""subtitles"" for many scenes, otherwise it is virtually impossible to make out what they are saying. I had watched the first 90 minutes then put it away for a week, started at the beginning and just watched it all the way through.<br/><br/>The great and late critic Roger Ebert saw ""Cloud Atlas"" more than once, and this paragraph from his review sums it up very well for many of us:<br/><br/>(Ebert) (quote)I was never, ever bored by ""Cloud Atlas."" On my second viewing, I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections between the segments, stories and characters. What was important was that I set my mind free to play. Clouds do not really look like camels or sailing ships or castles in the sky. They are simply a natural process at work. So too, perhaps, are our lives. Because we have minds and clouds do not, we desire freedom. That is the shape the characters in ""Cloud Atlas"" take, and how they attempt to direct our thoughts. Any concrete, factual attempt to nail the film down to cold fact, to tell you what it ""means,"" is as pointless as trying to build a clockwork orange.(unquote)<br/><br/>I had read that before I watched the movie, and that is pretty much the approach I took. It is long, but I was never bored, always anxious to see what would come next. One of the stories had an old composer and his young assistant working on the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", said to be a beautiful piece of music that some characters in other time periods seemed to be familiar with. Also the appearance in various time periods of a very distinctive birth mark. Perhaps it is all part of what one character says, ""Our lives are not our own, from womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present."" <br/><br/>As the credits roll, each actor is shown as each of the 4, 5, or 6 different characters they play in the movie. The makeup and costuming are so good that in many cases I had no idea.

I didn't read the book, so I don't know if this was the intention of the story.<br/><br/>All the major characters were beautifully played, and you feel for even the most emotionless of them.

It was incredibly hard to follow, and I was only able to hang in the 3 hours for anticipation of a turning point; of something that would connect them all to me and give me that ""AH HA!"" moment. I would have accepted even a soulful or insightful piece that would give me something to truly walk away with and think about. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It's really too bad, it was a great concept for a film and could have truly been a beautiful epic piece. Just poorly executed."
"anirudhjaura","6","15","33","28 October 2012"," Movie Review: Cloud Atlas..doesn't scale much heights
","There is an interesting TV series these days, called The Touch..which covers how we are all connected in ways we can't imagine and while its nothing out of the ordinary it beautifully creates all the links to put across a coherent story at the end of 45 minutes. Cloud Atlas..is the exact opposite to that<br/><br/>What Cloud Atlas delivers is a journey that transcends multiple lives across centuries and then keeps flitting back and forth between them enough to make your head spin. When you tell such a complex tale you need to help the audience connect the dots and follow the plot in wondrous fascination (read movies like Crash and Inception) but Cloud Atlas is merciless in that department. After spending an agonizing 164 minutes, you are still as clueless as ever and wondering what to connect with what. In fact, you would be forgiven to believe that if you took any 6 random lives and drew them up together like this you'll probably see this much connect anyways<br/><br/>The real hero of this terribly long tale is the, often ignored, make-up department. Most of the time your favourite activity while watching the movie is figuring out who amongst Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry and the others are you really watching right now. So marvelous is the make up and presentation, that it takes a while to realize that the punk writer you are watching is really Hanks or that the savage you see on screen now is really Hugh Grant under awesome make up and prosthetics. Two thumbs up for that<br/><br/>With such a stellar cast the performances are bound to be good and they are. The entire cast play their multiple complex roles to perfection, no exceptions. The music and background score which ideally should have played a more integral role given the context of the movie is beautiful but limited.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, Cloud Atlas may be a wonderful story penned by British author David Mitchell(in all fairness, I haven't read it yet). But the lack of connect and the rather ambitious attempt of telling too much of this tale all at once, makes this movie a rather tedious and unsatisfying watch. Other than the make-up, Cloud Atlas didn't scale much heights for me..whether this journey is still worth your while is up to you<br/><br/>To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com"
"doughelo","6","31","78","12 October 2012"," Nice try, but too long and too disjointed
","Not going to recap the plot, everyone else has done that. The first 2/3 was pretty absorbing, but finally it became apparent that the threads really weren't going to come together. I still don't know what the movie was trying to say beyond greeting-card platitudes such as ""I believe when one door closes, another opens"" and a vague sense of continuity between the eras reinforced by common actors and objects lasting through time.<br/><br/>I'll say this is the Wachowski's best movie since the first Matrix (not saying much) but more concrete ties between the stories would have improved coherence. For example, perhaps a Fabricant-Union rebellion triggered the cataclysm implied by the far future storyline. Other elements near the end seemed to come out of nowhere (like the signed contract for something and the box of gold) but maybe I lost track of something mentioned 2 1/2 hours before. And is Hugo Weaving getting tired of being typecast as the bad guy? <br/><br/>So overall, interesting most of the time and ambitious, but at the end like trying to pick up jello."

This is such a drivel and extremely simplistic without any depth whatsoever.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for the real movie to start. The movie confirmed my belief that if the trailer is long then you can almost be sure the movie is bad.<br/><br/>The acting was OK for Tom Hanks as his character had some reason behind it but the rest was just blank stares without any depth or feeling.<br/><br/>I have to keep writing so my review can be posted and people can be warned not to spend 11 dollars on this turkey.<br/><br/>I hope both Tom Hanks , Susan S, Halle B and Hugh G can select movies better next time as they are the reason I went to see the movie."

","Okay I didn't pay to see this and I nearly went home early. At 172 minutes it's too long and whilst well made and well acted it's tedious (which really is a terrible thing to say of any movie). The post-apocalyptic Hawaii story is actually entertaining and you get the feeling that if they'd made that one and ejected the book they'd have actually got people to see the movie. Tom Hanks is surprisingly good (again especially in the future segment) but no one else really gets going (to be fair Ben Whishaw is very good as Robert Frobisher but let's be honest that's like fish in barrel and might as well have been a BBC period drama - or an episode of Morse/Lewis). Of the others Jim Broadbent comes out the best and is excellent but again both his Vyvyan Ayrs and Young Cavendish characters seem to be from the set of a BBC drama.<br/><br/>It's not that anything is that bad and certainly the movie looks nice but it's too long and you really don't care."
"maryuss_85","1","14","31","21 November 2012"," 172 min of pain and agony!
","This movie is a complete waste of money! You get bored after the first 15 minutes and then you just want something to happen to explain why in a world all those distant stories are related, but no, you must wait (like in a queue line for IPhone 5) for another 2 hours to explain something that is completely logic and plain simple. Too bad for the special effects and display of characters. In my opinion, using the same actors gives the movie a suddenly theatrical appearance, and trying to make-up some of the actors to look like Asian or Asian to look like Caucasian it's just plain horrible (not to mention racism). Please review your choice of coming to this movie before it's too late. You can see any another movie and you will be more satisfied than this. I do not recommend this movie at all."

At least if you went to work in a kindergarten, you'd get paid.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen Sharknado, which was more plausible. Really, just such a waste of funds. So bad. I don't know how else to put it. It's just, horrible, bad, awful, the worst piece of crap ever filmed.

"dvc5159","8","7","13","26 October 2012"," To and fro, back and forth...
","""Cloud Atlas"" is an epic film that left me breathless, speechless, and wanting more. The films' virtuoso craftmanship beckons, nay, returns to an era long gone where the writers and the directors, not the studios, were given complete creative control over how their movies should look, feel and be. The fact that this film is nearly 3 hours in length shows the film's brilliant refusal to compromise itself for the sake of marketability.<br/><br/>As the films' six main story lines strongly weave together like a cane basket, we progress from a number of different genres, from period adventure, to forbidden period romance, to conspiracy thriller, to slapstick black comedy, to futuristic/post-apocalyptic science fiction. Many characters weave to and fro, some will meet again in the next timeline in the most unexpected of waves. So is life. How ponderous.<br/><br/>Such extraordinary and introspective screen writing is handled perfectly along with top-notch filmmaking skills by Lana and Andy Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer. Yes, three filmmakers. Lana and Andy, responsible for ""The Matrix"" trilogy, and Tykwer, famous for ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Perfume"" have triumphed with supremely ambitious, visionary and focused filmmaking. ""Cloud Atlas"", the trio's labour of love, is as good as any film they have made, perhaps far more better. This film is Terrence Malick mixed with Ridley Scott. Probably.<br/><br/>This is the work of great artists who have collaborated artistically and professionally to create this one-of-a-kind movie. Supreme visual effects and good cinematography interweave with great variable performances from the impressive ensemble (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Doona Bae, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant), flawless production design, interesting make-up effects and terrific music by Tykwer, Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek (Pale 3, a favourite of mine). A lot of hard work and effort went into this film and it pays off, with Tykwer and the Wachowskis transforming David Mitchell's novel into a daring, complex, intelligent and intriguing Grade-A work of cinematic modern art.<br/><br/>Good movies are ones that leave you satisfied and memorable. Great movies will leave you wondering long after the movie is over. Excellent movies are the ones which leaves you speechless and makes you want to discuss its philosophies with almost everyone you see on the street. Are we all connected by the fabric of time? Do we remember each other in previous lives? Are we all indirectly connected to each other, this life of the next? And so on.<br/><br/>I truly cannot say more for this extraordinary film. This film is a work of genius(es), and I cannot wait to see it again. 3 hours have never gone by so fast. May this film be rewarded richly in the coming years.<br/><br/>Overall: 95%"

","3+ hours I will never get back. The plot centres.....in fact no it actually doesn't centre it slap dashingly flits from one zzzz inducing storyline to another. <br/><br/>None of these stories ever develop into much and none of the characters have enough time on screen for the viewer to care what fate befalls them. The story lines seemed almost childish, with plots often being predictable and Tom Hanks & Halle Berry (who struggles with any performance in my opinion )seem to think they are performing on stage rather than on screen. Tom Hanks portrayal of an Irish Gangster had me holding my face in disbelief. No one ever finds out how these plots are remotely connected and after 3+ hours this film ends with some slight reference to karma or past lives. <br/><br/>Much to do about absolutely NOTHING! Literally felt like I just kept repeatedly flicking the TV channel over. Seriously do not waste your time on this. Cloud Atlas is about as deep as a paddling pool!!!"

There is a big chance you won't understand what's it about.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for an everyday simple Joe, this is not a movie for everyone. <br/><br/>But if you belong to the 20% that is intellectually and mentally above the general population, you will absolutely adore this piece and all it represents. If you have heard something about Jung, if you were interested in psychology, brainwashing, virtual reality, or if you were thinking about the nature of the ""true truth"", be prepared for such a mental blow to your head it will spin many minutes after the credits roll.<br/><br/>What the Matrix ultimately failed to deliver, that idea about not living a life we think we are is present and it's masterfully done. Other questions arise as well - what are deja vus? What if they aren't a malfunction of your brain? How do you explain that feeling you know someone you've just met? <br/><br/>Is it possible to cram 6 different genres into one epic movie with brilliant acting and music?

One of the other great things about this film is that it is not like some super-overdone Michael-Bay-special-effects-crap- cgi extravaganza.

No real action, nothing to say and show, no conclusion, nothing to touch your emotions unless the long time wasted in the cinema and feel to get out asap. The casting was great, wonder why the story was not.A superb space ship cannot fly to a hill which location is obvious so for an hour or so Tom and Hally have to risk their lives to get there (?) and after they find the place she was looking for, nothing really happens. I still wonder why she needed to walk there, especially since the space ship was parked at the cliff they stayed. The lovely Chinese girl become a symbol of freedom for ages but why exactly?

","Elaborate trash. Stylish arrogance. A film for people who have attention deficit disorder, at best. The nonsense of this film begins with a strangely cast Tom hanks mumbling in an incomprehensible accent about who can figure out what? While all of the many pointless events of this film are supposed to be connected, the only connection I can see in this film is how otherwise gifted actors, directors and producers can be tricked into working on this incomprehensible film. There used to be an art in complex films called ""continuity""...and that is the first sacrifice of this film. It jumps from past to future to present, between actors and accents, between scenes and dialogue with such confusion that really the effort can only be described as absurd. Are people afraid to tell the truth now? That this film has such a high rating is very suspicious. Are the ratings made by the actors and their friends? Are the ratings here honest? I do not see how they could be, as this is a confusing, disjointed and really pathetic attempt at something that in itself makes no sense. There is not one character accompanied by a history or a sense of why we should care about them, where they come from or what they are doing. I can only imagine that people have allowed themselves to rate this film so highly rather than admit they were tricked out of their money into enduring what can only be described as torture.

","If you are the type to choose all-you-can-eat buffets for the quantity of food, with little regard for quality, then you may enjoy this movie. Unlike other detractors, I found the acting and photography mostly well done. I did not mind the same actors playing different characters (à la Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove). After all, that is their profession. Objectively, I would have given Cloud Atlas 2 or even 3 stars for cinematography. However, I have given it only 1 star to help counter the outrageous over-rating it has acquired from the easily impressed. Cloud Atlas serves up several different, conflicting film genres, with bits stolen from better movies, without a single original idea of its own. It starts with a nicely realistic South Seas mutiny-type adventure reminiscent of 1984's The Bounty. Then it switches abruptly to an Amadeus type tragedy of a talented composer's life cut short. After a brief paean to the gratuitous violence of a Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it unexpectedly flips to a light-hearted version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Of course, it throws in the liberal de rigueur anti-nuclear and anti-big oil diatribe from The China Syndrome. Abruptly abandoning all realism, it adds a splash of stylistic action and wooden acting fluff from The Matrix, conflated with a '70's throwback to Soylent Green. Plop on an ending from any post-apocalyptic movie from the past 30 years. Finally top the whole mess off with meaningless new-age beatnik style drivel from Roger Corman's 1959 Bucket of Blood. Taken separately, these different episodes would make a mildly diverting all-night B-movie marathon. Unfortunately, they take this clashing cacophony of different film styles, from well-done realism to silly sci-fi, and intercut the stories in a totally random manner as if they are all related. Really? These stories are all connected by - what? Karma? Love? Fate? Bad makeup? No, silly. They all have the same birthmark. Get it? As long as coherent story-telling and originality are not important to you, then at 3 hours, you will get your money's worth of decent acting and pretty pictures tossed at you in a diverting kaleidoscope fashion. This is to keep you from thinking about what a mess the whole thing actually is."

So, I truly liked the film because I understood everything. Though I think it would be pretty hard for someone who hasn't read the book since this movie in a good sense: is a mess. What good sense? It tells like 6 different stories at the same time and manages to do it very well. The thing is that many will feel a bit frustrated by the fact that most of the first half of the film because of the ton of information dropped directly on your head. But it is supposed to be like that, at least at the beginning but then you should to be able to get the connections and meaning of every life portrayed.<br/><br/>As I said already, I didn't feel that much confused 'cause I read the book. Still, I was confused and it is normal. I guess people aren't really prepared to a movie this ambitious. So as far as I'm concerned there are two choices: you love it or you hate it. Still, it's a pretty great effort for an independent film and I think that, however you choose to feel about it, it's a film everyone should see and finish it. For me, it was a perfect 10."

","Movies like this don't come around very often. In the same vein as such movies as The Fountain and Tree of Life, Cloud Atlas explores themes of death, life, and the universe. This is pretty heavy stuff that a lot of people may feel iffy about seeing. However, if you were on the fence, or planning to see it, or planning not to see it, you should go see this movie.<br/><br/>The basic plot is this: There are six different stories the movie follows, each taking place in different points in history (two in the future). The multitude of characters are played only by a handful of actors, in order to portray how we are following the same set of souls through many different lifetimes. The film cuts back and forth between the stories as they make their way to an emotional climax. All of the segments are connected in one way or another, be it through ideas that characters have, music, or the belief in something more.<br/><br/>Some of the segments are a little dull, most notably the one that takes place in the earliest time period about a slave trader who ends up befriending a slave on the ship ride back to the States. For some reason this one just doesn't seem to have the emotional connectedness as the rest of them do. The great stories are the tale of two gay lovers in the 1930s, the story of a Chosen One in the future, and the story of a villager in a post apocalyptic distant future. The other two stories are one of a woman reporter in the 70s and a washed up publisher in the year 2012.<br/><br/>The film is directed by three people, the Wachowskis who directed the Okay Matrix Trilogy and Tom Tykwer who directed Run Lola Run. The Wachowskis directed the story about the slave trader and the two set in the future, while Tykwer directed the stories of the lovers, the reporter, and the publisher. They all come together quite nicely and each time the film cuts back and forth the parallel stories compliment and heighten the meaning of the others.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic from the main cast. Tom Hanks is best as the role of the tribesman in the far distant future, but also shines as an extremely angry writer in the 2012 storyline and as the sketchy doctor in the slave trader's story. Halle Barry's main role comes as Luisa Rey in the 70s story about a cover-up involving alternate energy. She is also great as one of the last remnants of a highly advanced society in the post apocalyptic story. Jim Broadbent plays the down and out publisher in the 2012 story, but he really shines as the old and cruel composer in the 1930s story who forces his amanuensis to either publish the Cloud Atlas suite under the old composer's name or risk being found out as a homosexual.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the music, composed by director Tykwer, John Klimek, and Reinhold Heil. Instead of trying to come up with something that is catchy and simplistic for the Cloud Atlas music that links the stories together, the piece is a grandiose classical movement, and the rest of the score is as interesting and beautiful.<br/><br/>Despite what you may have heard Cloud Atlas is quite clear cut, assuming that you pay attention. In fact sometimes it becomes a little too heavy handed, and the dialogue is sometimes extremely clunky, but that doesn't distract from the beauty and majesty of the movie too much. My only wish is that they would have spent more time on the two stories set in the future, as these proved to be the most fantastical, exciting, and important. This is a movie that needs to be seen by anyone who enjoys intelligent, heartfelt and mesmerizing art.<br/><br/>thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"

","I'm not sure what I expected from Cloud Atlas except for its lengthy running time but whatever they were they were excelled. Cloud Atlas is a truly moving and unique experience. The film follows several different story lines over a very long time period that are somehow connected and affect each other.Like many films of a similar nature some story lines work more than others depending on how they engage you and how they are executed. The most powerful and emotionally resonant for me were the Sonmi 451 storyline which just blew me away and the one concerning the closeted gay composer. All had great moments and were impressive for different reasons in their own rights. As for the performances Tom Hanks is well enough but his multiple roles and extreme differences are a lot to pull off and he does well enough with them. More impressive is Halle Berry who has less to do in the film but reminds you why she won that academy award by giving a solid variety of different performances. My favorite performance of the movie was from Doona Bae an extremely talented actress most powerful as Sonmi 451 , I also really liked the sexy and talented Jim Sturgess in that storyline as well as well as the one in which he plays an ill writer. Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant, yes Hugh Grant are rather good as well. The only performance I wasn't huge on was that of Hugo Weaving. He's been way better in other films but never very good in my opinion. But at this point he's more of a staple of The Wachowskis. And speaking of them and the films direction the Wachowskis started off really solidly with the noirish thriller Bound and followed that up with the first accomplished Matrix film but ever since than it's been a mixed bag. This is without a doubt the grandest and most ambitious film they've ever done and thats saying something and it's also their most solid feature since the first Matrix but it's far from flawless the bits directed by them are mostly good but their are a few questionable choices here and there which make you feel the films length. The same goes for Tom Twyker who had an amazing debut with Run Lola Run but hasn't followed it up with much his bits are good here as well and he does fare a bit better in some aspects but the film does need a bit of fine tuning. The spfx are amazing as expected especially considering the films smallish budget for something of this magnitude and I have to give extra credit to the films different age and character make ups they are truly incredible. All in all it's a really solid experience some moments are better than others but the films underlying message is inspired and unforgettable. it's without a doubt the bravest, most ambitious film I've seen this year and one of the best. 4/5"

As for the movie itself, before seeing it I watched trailers and read articles, none of it prepared me for the movie. It is not perfect, but i will not even talk about those points. This movie is what happens when big Hollywood money is put to good use. This movie is so much greater than the sum of its parts. Do not examine the run time, or make up, or violence, or story as things to pick a part or study. I cannot stress this enough; walk through the door and let this movie consume you, and I believe it will effect each person in a unique way if you let it.

"DICK STEEL","8","8","16","20 January 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Cloud Atlas
","The Wachowskis, with help from director Tom Tykwer, are back with a vengeance after their previous film Speed Racer underwhelmed at the box office. This time, they adapt from David Mitchell's award winning book Cloud Atlas, which tells of six inter-related tales spanning different eras from the 19th century to a post-apocalyptic future that brings humans back to the primitive times. It's almost three hours long, and a sprawling epic from start to finish, with a star-studded cast roped in to assist in the creation of the film's philosophy of how life interconnects through seemingly disparate events.<br/><br/>But perhaps the best way to enjoy this film is to treat them as separate short stories and nothing more. The original stories in the novel had the various segments lead in to one another through texts found by various characters in their individual story arcs, with a built in cliffhanger each, before delivering the respective payload in reverse chronological order they were introduced to the reader, and rounding it all off. It could work as a structure for the film as well, but that meant having to wait for some time for the later arcs to appear, and make this really look like a series of short stories being artificially stitched together.<br/><br/>So while the directors helmed different segments, the decision to sequence through all the six stories into one linear narrative was perhaps the right one, and through this fashion ring home the point of the inter-connectivity between the lives of characters in various story arcs more effectively, since scenes which were thematically similar at a point were edited to blend into one another rather seamlessly, rather than to get the audience to hold on to that thought for a later time application. Lines of dialogues also became memorable quotes across different story arcs, as do the character element of a comet-like birthmark that some of them would possess.<br/><br/>However, don't get too caught up in trying to link the stories together through gestures like the ones mentioned, or to even consider whether the characters the various actors play, are connected or have links when they appear in the different stories. Forget about how the stories serve to link up beyond what got produced on the surface, because it is stuff of required, repeated viewings. Instead, what you can choose to appreciate, is how the actors gamely took on various roles in the different stories, where in some they would anchor as the lead, and in the others they would lend support, or cameos even. Make up and special effects were top notch to disguise the actors to play different characters, and part of the fun is to do a double take when you discover just who is hiding behind heaving prosthetics, makeup, or even something as simple as a moustache. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry took on no less than six roles, while the rest chipped in with five or less multiple characters, allowing an exercise of their individual acting chops.<br/><br/>Technical brilliance made this film, with makeup as mentioned, costuming, art direction providing the canvas of the different eras, and special effects piled on as and when required, especially the futuristic segments, to make the worlds as separate and different from one another. Direction, despite being handled by different directors, was seamlessly integrated and consistent that you won't be able to tell them apart unless you sneak a peek at the production notes. The score also became a highlight, rendered by Reinhod Heil, Johnny Kilmek and Tom Tykwer, since it served as a centerpiece element for one of the story arcs.<br/><br/>It's pretty fun watching the actors in their various roles, and those who particularly stood out were Hanks as Zachry, the man who had to defer to Hugo Weaving's devilish character before suffering the pangs of karma, and Doona Bae who may seem to have walked through yet another Air Doll role as Sonmi-351. It was surprising to see Zhou Xun involved in this film too, as was Hugh Grant being the most unrecognizable of the lot. Cloud Atlas is a mammoth of a film, that will demand you rewatch it again, not only to continue in your spot-the-star moment, but to give connecting all the dots another go, after you've come to savour the stories individually at first. Recommended!"
"KZucc","5","8","16","4 November 2012"," Technical Epic.... But
","Allow me to start by saying: I've never read the book. All I know of it is that it was deemed unfilmable. <br/><br/>Lets judge this film properly, shall we?<br/><br/>The word epic has been thrown around to describe this. And considering it was said to be unable to film the source material, of which I can make no comparison, it seems that the filmmakers did their absolute best. They juggled various stories and moved between them well enough. The wachowskis certainly made it clear that their influence was all over this film, which lead to marvelous visuals. Tom Hanks carries it entirely, working his tail off in many roles as do most of the actors. In some cases this works even when you clearly know who's behind the makeup, in other cases (Doona Bae as a redhead Caucasian, that one guy playing a strange version of Ron Israel from Sweet Genius) it fails miserably and takes us out of the experience. <br/><br/>My 5/10 rating was for the visuals, the acting, and the direction. The story, the content... I cannot praise at all. And can understand why ""mess"" is thrown around to describe this as often as epic is. I can truly say, I can't remember a single character name, I can't remember a solid theme through the film (though narration at the end seems to blatantly try to tell us, as if to say ""yea in case you didn't get it here it is"") and the one point that stood out in my mind was my frustration over the strange manner of speaking between Halle berry and Tom hanks during the only segment (story? Tale?) I found any interest in. Although, the film (which is easily 40 minutes dare I say an hour too long) doesn't really go anywhere. I ultimately found myself bored, begging my girlfriend to kick me to keep me awake."
"andell","10","8","16","31 October 2012"," Quite possibly the most unique movie going experience of the last 20 years!!!
","Having never read the book that this film is an adaptation of, I entered ""Cloud Atlas"" with no preconceptions of what it should be. I'd read critical reviews that hailed it as great, and others that called it boring.<br/><br/>After having seen it, I was stunned: what an absolute gem of a motion picture!!! ""Cloud Atlas"" tells six different stories in a completely non-linear way, so if you go to see this, be prepared: you need to pay attention, otherwise you will not enjoy this film. The stories are entwined together, with connecting individuals, histories and even objects that reappear again and again. I'll attempt to summarize all the stories here, but will not be able to list every connection...for that, you have to see the film.<br/><br/>Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) is a young lawyer from San Francisco who is abroad, negotiating contracts for his Father in law (Hugo Weaving), when he witnesses a slave (David Gyasi) being whipped, and falls ill from a ""polynesian worm"" infection. On the trip back to the USA, he is becoming sicker and sicker, despite receiving treatment from Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks), a physician allegedly familiar with this particular type of malady.<br/><br/>Ewing's journals, are later published and partially read by Robert Frobisher (Ben Whislaw), a gifted young musician and grifter who was apparently disowned by his family because he is a homosexual. Hoping to achieve fame and fortune, Robert offers his gifts to renowned composer Vyvyan Arys (Jim Broadbent), while writing faithfully of his hopes and dreams to his dear love, Rufus Sixsmith (James D'Arcy). When Vyvyan asserts his claims to Robert's work by leveraging the mistakes Robert has made in his life, Robert becomes as desperate as Adam had been, and tragically ends his life after finishing his ""Cloud Atlas sextet."" <br/><br/>Some 40 years later, an elderly Rufus Sixsmith finds himself trapped in an elevator with Luisa Rey (Halle Berry), a reporter who longs to follow in the footsteps of her Father. Sixsmith attempts to provide Luisa with a report that is suggesting that industry insiders are planning a nuclear disaster, but before he can hand over the report to her, he is assassinated. Luisa realizes that this is the biggest story of her life, but one that could very well get her killed.<br/><br/>Some 35 years later, editor Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) has barely had an opportunity to read a manuscript about the adventures of Luisa Rey when he is assailed by the brothers of Dermot Hoggins (Tom Hanks), a writer he represented whose book is now much more successful because he threw a critic off the roof at a party. Turning to his brother Denny (Hugh Grant) for help, he finds himself locked away in a nursing home at the mercy of the vindictive Nurse Noakes (Hugo Weaving), plotting his escape.<br/><br/>Over 100 years later, the story of Timothy Cavendish's escape from the nursing home is, for a time, the sole image of the world that fabricant Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) carries with her. Having watched a fellow fabricant die a horrible death after attempting to escape, she finds herself freed by ""pure blood"" Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess), who shows her what awaits the fabricants after they fulfil their contracts and are supposed to be free. Hae-Joo believes that Sonmi will change the world for the better.<br/><br/>And finally, in a future time, after the fall of civilization, a group of valley people try to live their lives according to the lessons handed down by their God, Sonmi-451. Zachry (Tom Hanks) is haunted by the demon Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving), watching his brother in law and nephew murdered by the violent Kona people. When his niece nearly dies, he enlists the help of other world woman Meronym (Halle Berry) to save her, and agrees to take her to the devil's mountain so that she can fulfil her mission.<br/><br/>There is a lot more to this movie than what I've revealed, and although some critics claimed the film's components were pretty thin...I never felt that way at all.<br/><br/>Yes, some elements needed more elaboration...particularly how Sonmi-451 went from vacant fabricant to a more evolved being...but I just can't hold that against this film. <br/><br/>You're not going to see another film like this in a very long time, so my suggestion would be to get out there and see this one while you can. It's easily the best film I've seen this year, and one of the best I've seen in a very long time!"

","I'm fascinated with how brave the producers are to finance such a non traditional movie as this, it's epic in it's ambition, it's cool, funny, sad, inspiring.. Feels like it's edited with a little A.D.D. but unexpectedly you realize that it's all for the good of the story, if you think you can't follow 6 stories at the same time, no worries, the production values are enough to entertain you. Acting is top notch, and it's fun to realized which actor is who on every story, as many i'm not a big fan of the Asian looking version of the non Asian actors, they look somewhat alien, but at the same time makes sense, like an evolved version of an inter-racial mix, anyhow i loved Jim Sturgess in such character, who knew he can kick ass.

","After a long time i have seen a movie so intriguing and though there is no moral message coming out of the movie, but still it is a thought provoking movie. The best part of the movie is that it doesn't try to tie the stories together as many would have expected. In fact, even when the stories seemed related the directors tried to separate them so that they don't lose the identity. There is no story telling or spoon fed tying of different plots between the stories. The viewer needs to make those logical connections themselves which has made the movie even more beautiful as imagination is with the viewer and not with limited to what the director was thinking while making the movie. <br/><br/>I really liked a few scenes and quotes from the movie. And, yes i would love to go again and again to watch this movie. <br/><br/>Superb movie, story lines and hats off to the directors to turn a seemingly tough novel into a movie as beautiful and spectacular as Cloud Atlas. Should go all the way to the Oscars this year!!!"
"o3017597","1","16","38","2 November 2012"," Trying too hard
","The directors enlisted some of the best actors to convey a philosophical message about love and humanities interconnectedness. The result is a boring, tedious, waste of 3 hours.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that the movie is confusing until the end the directors fall back on the following themes that Hollywood so much in love with: 1) The future is always bleak and horrible. 2) Gay people are always great but misunderstood. 3) Black people are always good and moral. 4) Capitalism is evil.<br/><br/>If you believe in the above mentioned propaganda then go see the movie you'll enjoy it. The rest of you who feels that we live in a more realistic world where gay and black people are both good and bad just like the rest of us and capitalism (portrayed in the movie by big oil) with all it's faults is still the best system that humanity ever came up with, please save your money for something better."

","CG wise this film was stunning. Everything else is a hole different story. I may have forgiven certain plot holes, I could have forgiven the awkward pacing and editing, I even could have forgiven frustrating hill billy like language of the future. What I could not not forgive though (and I can tell you it ruined this film) was the horrendous make-up jobs on the actors. Every time I'm about to get caught in this intricate, twisting storyline, out comes one disaster of make-up after another. I just couldn't enjoy the film, because these actors (of whom are some the most talented in the industry) had there faces covered in uneven, putty knife applied, god awful b-movie prosthetic make-up. I can only assume 3/4 of the make-up crew must have been made from a directors niece, a producers girlfriend, and a D.O.P's brick laying brother in- law who happened to have putty knife. <br/><br/>Instead of hiring Asian actors, they covered Caucasian actors in large browed masks that made them look more akin to the Romulans of Star Trek, then the Korean facial features they attempted to portray. Seeing this example of ""yellowface"" make-up (Terribly done at that) in modern day cinema is both low-class and potentially insulting. I could have let some of it slide, if it was just that alone. But, the moment the award winning actress Xun Zhou, is revealed, on the screen, as a terribly rendered Blue eyed(cheap contacts), red headed(theater wig), Ginger Child of the 19th century version of herself. I didn't know whether to be upset, disappointed, or to LOL. I almost walk out right then and there. Because, at this point, I just felt they were doing it on purpose. It was a make-up calamity, and I cannot understand why it was aloud to get as bad as it did, on such a high budget film. Don't judge me for getting so upset about this. The make-up was just that bad. I'll probably get over it someday.<br/><br/>I found this to be a Big Budget film with fantastic CG and a Grade-A Cast. Unfortunately those are its only values. The multiple storytelling format, as seen in other films before it, was certainly interesting, but there was nothing that made the story feel interconnected (aside from the seemingly pointless ""My Little Pony"" shooting star birthmark, that keeps showing up in a failed attempt to be profound). The idea of reincarnation was never driven home, and it left me(if not the whole audience) feeling disjointed, dissatisfied and with a nagging sense disenchantment. There were no claps of applause at the credits. No hum and chatter of discussion. Just a filing of people leaving the theater, without any reason or ability to say ""it was 2 hours and 52 minutes well spent"". It's fantastic book, and it could have been a great film. It was placed into the wrong hands and, at no fault to the casts performance, was not translated well enough to screen."
"griffolyon12","9","10","22","28 October 2012"," An Almost Masterpiece
","There are many things one could call Cloud Atlas -- ambitious, emotional, thought-provoking -- and all of those things would be rightly justified. Quite simply, it's the hardest movie to sum up in words.<br/><br/>The film, directed by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer, is a collection of six stories set in different time periods, ranging from the 1800s to modern day, all the way to two stories set in the future. With Cloud Atlas, it has a seemingly simple aim, to try and show how the smallest acts a person can make can impact and shape mankind's future. This is done brilliantly as an 1800's man details his story in memoirs, which are read by an aspiring composer in the 1930s, who writes a piece (that becomes the film's unforgettable theme) that is heard by an investigative reporter in the 1970s, and so on and so forth. This could have easily been a boring slog fest, as the Wachowskis and Tykwer tried to piece everything together, but what makes the story work is how they jump back and forth between each time period.<br/><br/>Each time period represents a different genre of film: one story is a comedy, one is a drama about artistic passion, another is a period drama, and one is like a political thriller akin to All The President's Men. Add on to those, two futuristic sci-fi stories, and it creates an intrigue in the viewer to try and piece together how these stories are connected, not making it completely obvious at first how these six stories are similar. Where everything starts coming together is how the Wachowskis and Tykwer use parallel action to unfurl the story. What is happening in one time period will mirror what is happening in another time period, where they are crosscutting between multiple time periods to form one scene that has a larger impact than any one time period could offer on its own. It's this use of thematic similarities that ultimately ties everything together.<br/><br/>Each story is about a person doing something against the established order to try and create something greater than what has ever come before. It's this thematic idea that each story represents that makes the film so emotionally powerful when all of the revelations start to be revealed. As it is, this is one of the more unique films I've ever seen because of the storytelling. The way the story does not conform to traditional storytelling methods by intercutting between the different genres, constantly keeps you on your toes and keeps you engaged. I mean, here in one scene you'll be in a broad comedy, then the next you'll be in a thriller, and the next you'll be in an action flick. However, the storytelling is not the only thing makes this film truly one of the most ambitious films ever made, it's the approach to the acting.<br/><br/>The story uses the same group of actors in every time period, from Tom Hanks to Halle Berry to Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. They do this by using makeup and prosthetics to change the actor's looks. At times, some of the actors are completely unrecognizable -- I mean, who ever thought they'd see Hugh Grant as a post-apocalyptic cannibal? Take Halle Berry, for example: she plays an old Asian man, a white Jewish woman, and an African American woman, all in the same movie. Every one of these actors relish in the opportunity to play such vastly different characters, many of which are unlike any they've ever been able to play before. In this one film, you see charming Tom Hanks, mobster Tom Hanks, villain Tom Hanks, and even a Tom Hanks who is plagued by a dark force battling inside of him. I'll just say it, I have never seen this done before, and I am not sure I ever will again, and that is what makes Cloud Atlas such an important film.<br/><br/>With all this said, Cloud Atlas is not for everyone. Not everyone will like the way the story is told, and not everyone will connect with it as I have, but for individuals who like something that tries different ways to tell stories and to express emotions and ideas, this is a film for you. It's impressive, exceptionally well acted and exquisitely well made on every level, featuring one of the most beautiful endings in any movie I've seen in recent memory. Cloud Atlas is close to a flawless movie, if only it didn't drag for about the first half hour, as you're left wanting for forward momentum and not exposition. So what? It's an A+ for originality, but unfortunately I must grade the entire film.<br/><br/>I give Cloud Atlas a 9 out of 10!"

"DJRMewzique","8","7","14","30 October 2012"," You don't have to walk out completely understanding it to truly appreciate it.
","I walked into the cinema having pretty much no clue what I was about to see. All I really knew about ""Cloud Atlas"" was that it was co-directed by what used to be the Wachowski Brothers but is now the Wachowski Siblings (the team responsible for the Matrix trilogy and ""Speed Racer"" before Larry Wachowski became Lana Wachowski) along with Tom Tykwer (""Perfume: The Story of a Murder""). Oh, and that it was apparently a singular story that spanned centuries with numerous big-name actors playing a multitude of parts in a multitude of eras. And it had a running time of just under three hours.<br/><br/>Ouf.<br/><br/>Alas, with murmuring of Oscar possibilities and the talk of incredible visuals, my cinematic obligation superseded my hesitation. And I have no regrets.<br/><br/>In reality, ""Cloud Atlas"" is a myriad of interlocked stories unfolding through half a dozen eras spanning from the late 1800s to the distant future through almost seventy characters played by just a dozen actors and extraordinary visual effects that must be seen on the IMAX screen.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Halle Berry lead the charge, playing a dozen completely dissimilar characters, some with similar traits, each creating their personas with such pronounced detail, from the selfish, conniving doctor to the almost-worshipped ""alien"" visitor, accents ranging from British to Queens to ""Nell""-like mumbo-jumbo, but never leaving you batting an eye while you think about scratching your head. British heavyweights Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, James D'arcy and Hugh Grant with UK lightweight Ben Wishaw all bring such incredible life to nearly three dozen characters of all ages, sex and sexual proclivity. Susan Sarandon? Always a pleasure.<br/><br/>And then there is relative newcomer Doona Bae who also slips into a half dozen characters, yet all but steals the show as Fabricant Sonmi-451. If there was a first possibility of a Best Supporting Actress nomination, it goes to Bae for playing a non-human who finds humanity within, portrayed through exquisite physical control and expression. The visual execution of the film is one of the most extraordinary to hit the big screen in some time, jumping from London in the 1800s to California in the 70s to a distant-future Seoul and a post-apocalyptic wasteland that bridges the past to the future. And the directors and editor, Alexander Berner, manage to jump from one to the other almost seamlessly, despite the polarizing images of environment and segues of triumph, love, passion, tenderness, disaster and unforgiving violence.<br/><br/>So, all this leads to the question ""What is 'Cloud Atlas' about?""<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I have no idea where to even begin. And if I tried, it could ruin the experience for anyone who chooses to undertake the task. Even Roger Ebert wrote ""I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections between the segments, stories and characters."" Indeed, they are connected, but to try to figure out how they truly overlap is another story. This is a film that one needs to see a few times and will still probably not figure it out. But unlike last year's ""Tree of Life,"" which not only made no sense, was suicide-inducingly boring and pointless, the viewer walked away angry that they wasted two hours of their lives on crap-posing-as-art, ""Cloud Atlas"" will leave you elated, satisfied and hopeful, even if you walk on not quite being able to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. It all culminates into an extremely emotional crescendo regardless of whether you find yourself lost or not.<br/><br/>What I can say is that it is about Truth. And what one will do to cover Truth, discover Truth, run from the Truth, embrace the Truth, repent from the Truth and how heroes are willing to die to expose the Truth.<br/><br/>And love. Love between a man and a woman, love between two men, love between parent and child, love between human and non-human. That love is love and it should never, ever be considered ""forbidden."" <br/><br/>And that, my friends, is the Truth."

Instead of congratulating the lesser films for their bland and easily forgotten contributions to cinema history, they should have drawn attention to such a bold and refreshingly creative movie, rewarding it for defying the mind-numbing pixarification of American movies.<br/><br/>It's so sad to see such a beautiful film, that moved me to verge of tears twice, disappear into time without the recognition it deserves or rewarding it's contributors.<br/><br/>Disgustingly, this is the fast food, Michael Bay world we live in. It's like Iggy Azalea said, you can't tell a real meaningful story anymore: you've gotta sell empty worthless junk or wrap it all up in stupid paper so stupid people will pay for it."

","In all honesty this is the first time I have felt the obligation of writing a review about a movie, and that alone says quite a bit.<br/><br/>It is a lengthy piece, but it is by no means tedious. From the beginning of the film it shows clear intent of suggesting that one must be paying close attention at all times. If this is not accomplished, then the viewer will find him or herself lost throughout the whole movie, and therefore will miss out on one of the most ambitious and fantastic story lines I have encountered.<br/><br/>The make up, setting, music, and editing are pure genius. I loved the cast and praise the versatility of each and every one of its members. <br/><br/>I have not read the novel, but I commend David Mitchell for being able to create and intertwine so many different and amazing story lines into the masterpiece of a story that became Cloud Atlas. <br/><br/>Just as Andy Wachowski said, many critics and viewers hate what they do not understand, and hence tend to detract works and art of worth. It is not a film intended for superficial viewing.

","""Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime﻿ and every kindness, we birth our future.""<br/><br/>That sentence will wander in your brain for hours after you leave the cinema. But before I go deeper into reviewing Cloud atlas, let me congratulate the Wachowski's for the masterpiece they've filmed. Cause Cloud atlas is a masterpiece indeed. A masterpiece that provokes critics, audience and even the most blind-minded guy out there to talk about it. Be it good or bad, Cloud Atlas, provokes. And that's what all masterpieces of art do. Be it a book, a photograph, a movie or a picture.<br/><br/>The movie itself is an independandent movie, which makes Wachowski's accomplishment a whole lot bigger. Don't know if any of us can imagine what means to script/shoot and realize a movie that was labeled as ""unfilmable"" without any of the big fishes behind your back. Everithing seemed to be against Wachowski's and yet, they've done it.<br/><br/>The cast doesn't even need a comment to be honest. This is the final piece that shoots Cloud Atlas to the heights. I think that pretty much all of us here can agree that a movie with Halle Berry, Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving each playing multiply roles in a single movie, simply CANNOT be bad.<br/><br/>While the movie doesn't have the typical story-telling structure, Cloud atlas is really easy to follow, and I keep failing to understand the people that state that the movie is impossible to follow. The six stories are bound together in the best way possible. It all makes sense if you give your brain a minute or two to understand what actually is this film about.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong... Im not saying that Cloud Atlas is a movie that everyone will understand. It's a movie that everyone MUST watch and just give it a chance... I know that it's not for everyone... Most of the people will even think it's boring or cliché or whatever, but for those that love movies like 12 monkeys, the Matrix, the 13th floor and even the epic Memento it will be an epic piece of art that they will forever remember."

","Many might find Cloud Atlas a daunting movie to consume. It's probably one of the most complex narratives in movie history. But it is also the movie that keeps on giving. There is so much going on, I swear it has everything. Ev-er-y-thing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, James D'Arcy, James Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, and Doona Bae play a variety of characters, and their descendants in a sprawling mega-story spanning many centuries. The South Pacific in 1849, Edinburgh in 1936 and 2012, San Francisco 1973, London in 2012, Neo-Seoul in 2144, and an island 106 years after an unspecified cataclysm feel the ripples of love, tragedy, hope, and imagination as souls are reincarnated with the teasing latent memories of their ancestors written in their DNA.<br/><br/>Across their chain-linked lives Hugo Weaving plays a menacing figure representing injustice determined to maintain the status quo and prevent human transcendence. But, as Dr. Ian Malcolm once said, 'life finds a way'. Humans cannot be contained, not by governments, rules, or any kind of oppression. The drive to push our species forward will always trump all kinds of evil.<br/><br/>The expansive story and lengthy running time will alienate casual movie-goers, and the unusual dialect in the far future timeline will either make the rest hopelessly confused or laugh childishly. I personally had no trouble understanding it. Language, like any other entity, develops or disintegrates over the years, and will especially become twisted and guttural in a world without mass media. Perhaps the haters just couldn't grasp this and decided that laughing at it was the way to endure until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>If you like challenging movies, if you are willing to apply yourself to a rich universe and an ingenious idea I have to admit that Cloud Atlas pays you back a thousand times. Tom Twyker's score is utterly mesmerizing. Not only is it a fascinating movie to look at but it sounds heavenly. It's the music of your dreams, and the movie it threads through is filled with magical moments that will steal your heart away and stay with you forever. I just cannot recommend Cloud Atlas enough.<br/><br/>Many have called it a failure, but I say it's a huge accomplishment. Few directors could have pulled it off, but the Wachowski's and Tom Twyker have delivered a profound epic of human life. Even the haters should admit that."

On the other hand, the make-up job on the cast varies from brilliant to mediocre. I have a problem with what the movie seems to saying 'though.

","""Contains Spoilers!!"" I loved Cloud Atlas! Before I went into seeing this film, I thought this film could have been a descent film. But coming out of it, I'm happy I spent my money on this 3 hr. adaptation. The movie is about six different people in different time lines,making decisions that will affect their past, present, and future.Let me start off with the negative comments on this. The most confusing story in the film, would have to be ""An Orison of Sonmi~451"". The story and moral for that isn't fleshed out very well. The actors do try their best, but in the end doesn't fit very well. I was caught off guard when Hugo Weaving was a Korean man and a Lady in the film. Although Halle Berry was good in some sequences, her lines were very cheesy and unoriginal.<br/><br/>Now on to the Best moments! Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his Career as each character, especially in ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"". The cast did a fantastic job in the film! My favorite moment in the movie would have to be a battle sequence, in which Tom Hanks fights against the temptations of the devil, and the Kora creatures. Overall: I very much loved the film, and would like to see it again, sometime soon! Overall rating: 10/10"

I didn't read the book on this either - although I may now.

Admittedly, I didn't get every single connection and nuance between/through all six ""stories"", but, for this, I don't even care. It truly did feel like a roller-coaster ride - front row for sure... and if you just sit back and let it flow over you for it's almost 3 hours, you'll get what YOU need to pick up.

","Cloud Atlas reminded me of The Matrix....something completely different from most other films. It was quite ambitious to weave all the plot lines and characters in this movie. I don't know if having read the novel would have made it easier to follow, it likely would have. I had trouble connecting the characters and trying to understand the message. It was just too long and the pay off questionable. I did not like the tedious fight scenes much either. The futuristic clone female character was interesting but the close-up teary-eyed shots got a bit old especially after nearly 3 hours.<br/><br/>However, that being said, I hesitate to tell you not to see the film on the big screen. As with The Matrix, the extra work to make sense of what was happening in such an unusual movie may be worth the time. I think people will be talking about this film and each viewer will certainly have their own opinion. But, bottom line...I was kind of disappointed in Cloud Atlas.

","I really tried to like this movie. I mean, good actors, some interesting scenarios. The problem really is that the people who put this together failed to create an engaging storyline that one could follow comfortably. Throwing out a bunch of detached vignettes for the consumer to assemble demonstrates a lack of ability to write a good storyline. Not all of us like to treat a story like a crossword puzzle. An, the theme of interconnectedness of events that would be obvious in a film with a logical sequence is something 'new' that the consumer has to discover. Using the actors for different characters in time and space, often in surreal, out of context places, is confusing also. It is just impossible to identify with these people with such poor character development. A few minutes into the film, I didn't care what happened to the characters. Later on, it was worse. Summary: A real waste of time here. But it appears that some people can find reason for a film like this. Maybe it's politically correct for the critics, with all the right actors?"

"Blooner","10","6","12","21 January 2013"," An incredibly great movie, based on an amazing book.
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - In a rather fortuitous string of events, I finished reading the novel 'Cloud Atlas' (by David Mitchell) in the lobby of the cinema, a mere 5 minutes before seeing the movie 'Cloud Atlas' in a sneak preview, a whole week before its release date. This put me in a wonderful position to reflect upon the book and the movie simultaneously. And I can tell you right now, both are incredible pieces of storytelling.<br/><br/>The Cloud Atlas novel is very unique. At first glance it seems to be a collection of six separate short-stories. The first chapter consists of pages out of the diary of Adam Ewing, a notary from San Francisco. It is the nineteenth century, and Mr. Ewing is sailing the South Pacific on a ship called the 'Prophetess'. After reading about his adventures for about 40 pages, the narrative abruptly stops mid-sentence, and the next chapter begins. Here, we are reading letters that one Robert Frobisher sends to a friend. Frobisher is an aspiring musician who has escaped creditors by finding refuge in Belgium and is working as a musical aide in the 1930's. The next chapter follows Luisa Rey as she uncovers a conspiracy surrounding a nuclear power plant in the 1970s. Skip to 2012, London, where Timothy Cavendish, a publisher, finds himself in a ghastly ordeal. Next we jump to the year 2144, a dystopian future reminiscent of Aldous Huxley's classic 'Brave New World'. A fabricant named Somni~451 is recording her recollections for the oppressive state's archives, before being executed. Lastly we listen to the tale of Zachry, a simple goat-herder living on one of the smaller islands of what was once known as Hawaii. At this point civilisation has collapsed, to such a degree that even the year is no longer known.<br/><br/>Each of these stories, except for Zachry's, has been interrupted halfway through. Now each story collapses back into the previous, rolling back the narrative in opposite order. We learn what happens to Sonmi~451, and we learn how things end for Timothy Cavendish, Luisa, Frobisher and lastly Adam Ewing.<br/><br/>All along this journey we see call-backs and foreshadowing of stories that came before, or are yet to come. The reader experiences an ever increasing sense that things are connected in more ways than one. Similarities to the characters in each of the stories are revealed. Similarities to their faults, their plights, and their actions. An overarching theme is revealed bit by bit, and before you reach the final page you know that this are not six random short-stories, they are one amazing journey, which transcends time, transcends space, and transcends lives.<br/><br/>""Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies"" – David Mitchell<br/><br/>Try translating that to a movie<br/><br/>Enter the Wachowski siblings, together with Tom Twyker. They take on the challenge, and bring us 'Cloud Atlas', the movie. Immediately there is a major difference from the book. The stories don't start out chronological, but seem to switch around every other scene, in seemingly random order. I start out confused Why would they do this? It makes the whole experience rather confusing for someone not familiar with the book. But soon the realization hits, that not the individual stories are show here, but rather the overarching storyline, the themes that bind all these adventures together. Scenes follow each other in the most logical order, running parallel to showcase their similarities. This creates a whole new experience. The movie starts out as this cacophony of mismatched stories, characters and scenes, then slowly but surely blends into a crescendo of epic proportions. Much like the titular 'Cloud Atlas Sextet for Orchestra' (OST).<br/><br/>""Lifetime's music, arriving all at once. Boundaries between noise and sound are conventions, I see now. All boundaries are conventions, national ones too. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive of doing so."" – David Mitchell (p. 479)<br/><br/>This is my favorite quote from the book, and, to my great pleasure, is used ad verbatim in the movie.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a rare movie that is both viscerally and intellectually engaging. There are awesome action sequences here, but this is no brainless action-flick. I fear Cloud Atlas will not stay in cinemas long, as it is too complex for the average movie-goer. My gauging of the audience with which I saw Cloud Atlas was infuriating. Some of them left after a mere 15 minutes. Some walked off 1,5 hours or more into the movie. I heard after the movie was over, that so many people still did not see any correlations between the six stories, and I was saddened by their close-mindedness. It is not that it is incredibly difficult to comprehend; it is just that the average movie-goer wants to be entertained without having to think too much. That certainly does not work with Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>Please go see this movie, and prove to the entire movie-making business that there still is a market for movies such as this. Movies with more substance than ""Expendables 3"". I will certainly do my part by going to see this movie a second time. I am sure I missed so much the first time around.<br/><br/>A multitude of tiny details within the film enriched the experience of the story. I loved these little nods to the connectedness of everything. The way Luisa Rey's apartment number was 451 (as in Somni~451), or the way the violinist in the Nea So Corpos' slum played Frobisher's Cloud Atlas Sextet. And the way the waistcoat-button from Adam Ewing, is used as an ornamental feature on the necklace that Zachry wears. It is small things like this that I want to explore on a more thorough viewing of Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>I can not stress enough how incredibly great this movie truly is. Go see it now! - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"
"ShaShank_MovieFreak","10","6","12","31 October 2012"," Cloud atlas, simply a must see...
","The novel by David Mitchell was in itself, amazing. Handling all the time lines portrayed in that story would be a near-impossible task just because of the sheer complexity. But that is where we must praise the trio of Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis for making one of the richest epic movies seen recently, spanning a lot of centuries. Cloud atlas is in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year, or probably the whole decade.<br/><br/>Though the story does revolve a bit around the concept of chaos theory and the butterfly effect, each segment/time line in itself was very well- made and even their combination was a perfect fusion. I mean, the screenplay was nothing short of amazing, though it felt a bit like a Kubrick movie sometimes for the incredible care for detail the directors took. The movie might take more than one viewing to understand it better. In the three hours of its runtime, there was not even a single second that was wasted or was passive.<br/><br/>The actors had done an amazing role in the movie. All of them, Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, and others too. However, a special mention goes to Hugo Weaving, who appears in multiple roles in the film and every time he appears, he manages to make a powerful character portrayal. He was in this movie, as yet another reviewer has pointed out, a genuine show-stopper. The soundtrack was another character altogether. It was just right for the movie and was very well made.<br/><br/>Part of the movie's perfection, apart from the fact that it was made based on the novel was the fact that the adaptation was carried out indeed very efficiently. By the end of the movie, when(or if, for the first time viewers) you see the connection between the happenings across the centuries, you will understand the effectiveness of the movie and how well it portrays our world for what it was, what it is and what it could be.<br/><br/>Cloud atlas is a must-watch for everyone who loves intelligent movies that really make you think and have a long running time (near three hours). I shall even go as far as saying that the movie presents a rare opportunity of making us see how our actions are not as trivial as they seem and everything in this world is, after all, connected.<br/><br/>An incredible movie. And, oh did someone just say 'Oscar'?"

"Rickting","10","4","7","31 January 2014"," One of 2013's best and most overlooked films
","You probably didn't see this as while this underperformed at the box office, everyone else decided to go and see clichéd carbon copies which they have all seen 10 times before because no-one seems to want to be original anymore. Here however, this original and ground-breaking masterpiece emerges as the best movie of 2013 (Better than the best picture winner, 12 Years A Slave) and the 21st century's answer to 2001 A Space Odyssey. This takes 6 seemingly unconnected stories from different times and weaves them together into a tapestry of visual glory, emotional power, thrilling action and genuine humanity that will confuse and frustrate many, but it kicks the living daylights out of almost any other 2013 release. It might be one of the strangest viewing experiences you'll ever have as the film randomly cuts across the different narratives, different actors turn up in different make up and as different characters in the various story lines and all of the narratives seem almost unconnected. Yes the film is a marathon. Yes the film is baffling, indulgent, pretentious. But it is never, ever boring.<br/><br/>The film, in the end, is about humankind and how the past shapes the future. Amidst all the action, humour and bizarre stories, the film has a genuine soul and a sense of humanity which helps keep it afloat, and as it goes on it becomes more and more powerful and you start to care about all of the characters. Whether the film is focussing on a dying sailor's friendship with a slave on a ship in the 1800s, a musician's struggle to compose his masterpiece, a journalist (Halle Berry doing maybe the only thing worthy of note she's done since Monster Ball) stopping a conspiracy at a nuclear power plant, a publisher trying to escape a nursing home, a clone becoming involved in a revolution in the far future or a post apocalyptic storyline with 2 people trying to find a remote communication station, the film is characterized by great acting especially from Jim Broadbent, fantastic direction, a moving script and a never-ending sense of humanity. Even if you don't get it, it'll still be a great cinematic experience for all and truth be told, some may even shed tears.<br/><br/>10/10"
"OttoVonB","5","4","7","10 November 2013"," Caught Between Two Worlds
","Characters in 6 different eras struggle and define themselves, decisions and acts of kindness (or evil) rippling through time and influencing other lives. In the 19th century, a young slaver is helped by a stow-away; in the early 20th century, a conflicted young composer works as an apprentice for a forgotten genius; in the 70s, a reporter investigates corporate wrong-doings; in the present day, a debt-ridden publisher goes through a number of absurd ordeals; in the 22nd century in Neo-Seoul, a clone waitress discovers the hidden power she possesses; in a distant, post-Apocalyptic Hawai, two survivors from different cultures try to activate a beacon that might allow them to escape a poisoned Earth.<br/><br/>Long summary for a complex story. I will not look at this in the context of the source novel, since I never read source novel. But since against all odds this was turned into a film - and the ordeal endured to get it made is worthy of a book itself - how does this film work on its own merits?<br/><br/>Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola Run & Perfume) co-directed this huge independent venture with the Wachowsky siblings (Matrix, Speed racer, V for Vendetta), and at first it is very encouraging to have such strong cinematic voices expressed through such a project. Directing duties were split depending on story segments in a way that meant the more contemporary ones were handled by Tykwer. A much more interesting, unusual and ultimately controversial decision was made to have actors recur across segments, playing various characters who differed in their gender and race. More about this later.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas has been praised as a masterpiece and derided as a massive folly. Whatever it is, and in my opinion it is torn between the two, sometimes within the space even of an individual segment, it certainly is unique. In fact, when commenting on films you can often single out things that worked throughout and others that didn't... With Cloud Atlas you have a less clean-cut job on your hands.<br/><br/>For all the vaunted technical prowess and vision of its makers, Cloud Atlas has trouble keeping a balance, something it often just barely makes up for in pacing. For a 3-hour film containing 6 smaller stories and a framing device, it actually flies by. But then, on the flip- side, you often feel that we cut to another thread just as the one we were following was getting interesting. This ambiguity stretches to nearly all departments, even casting. <br/><br/>What largely saves the film and will keep you in your seat is the ever-dependable emotional anchor that is Tom Hanks. Whatever the era, he is hugely watchable, and provides much of the humanity of the film. The same can be said for Jim Broadbent, alternating between heart- breaking coward, indifferent officer and evil old bastard depending on the sub-story. Elsewhere things get more complicated: Ben Whishaw and James D'Arcy have trouble shouldering the weight that the script piles up on them, Doona Bae is undermined by the film's most controversial artistic choice, and Halle Berry is simply terrible across the board.<br/><br/>And for all its merits - Hanks, Broadbent, visions of different periods, the light interweaving of stories - there are two decisions that come very close to making the whole thing ridiculous: to a lesser extent, the silly future-speak from the post-apocalyptic story repeatedly makes you laugh when it shouldn't, and doesn't make sense in the broader sense of the film: why then do people use modern vernacular in the 18th, 19th and 22nd centuries but not here? The real disaster on hand, though, is the gender and racial-bending casting.<br/><br/>Effects makeup have come a long way in 130 years of cinematic history, especially when it comes to portraying the otherworldly, but we still haven't nailed many more natural things: aging makeup is still hit-and-miss (think of ""J. Edgar""...), so changing genders and races without finding yourself in the darkest corners of uncanny valley should be quite a challenge. Here it fails miserably: the pasty, waxworks-looking futuristic Asians played by Caucasian actors are unsettling enough, but undermining poor Doona Bae's performance by trying to pass her off as Caucasian on two counts really hurts. The many faces of Tom Hanks are a bit more playful, but things become downright ridiculous when 60 years are piled on D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving plays an old nurse, and manages to be less convincing as a woman than he was in drag-comedy Priscilla. It's an impossible-to-overcome distraction in what could have been a great film, and keeps you at arm's length from an often compelling story.<br/><br/>In the end, I do recommend seeing this. For all its short-comings, it is never less than interesting, and even its failed experiments deserve to be experienced once. It's unlikely you'll see its like on this kind of budget anytime soon."

"samvanharen","10","4","7","5 May 2013"," Cloud Atlas Blew My Mind In a Very Profound Way
","This is my first review and it seems appropriate that Cloud Atlas would be the subject. I've heard it is much more fun to write good reviews than bad and Cloud Atlas was the best movie of 2012 and probably one of the best in the last ten. No other movie this year or any I can think of has affected me like Cloud Atlas. Even now, almost a week after seeing it, Cloud Atlas is still with me. I don't just mean that I have thought about it every now and again; but that I have never stopped thinking about it's beauty, emotion and often sheer amounts of kick-ass spectacle. It's characters are so well thought out and well performed that they feel like real people. Cloud Atlas was adapted (from the David Mitchell novel of the same name) and directed by three of today's greatest auteurs, Tom Tykwer and Andy & Lana Wachowski. With six connected stories told in six wildly different locations and time periods, this behemoth of a film needed each one to work as well as it does. As much as I love Run Lola Run and The Matrix, which is a lot by the way, Cloud Atlas is far and away the best thing any of the three have accomplished. Cloud Atlas shows ""how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future and shows an act of kindness ripple across centuries to inspire a revolution."" It does this through six seemingly unrelated stories with the cast of actors playing roles in each. The stories range from 1849 in the South Pacific, to a Post- Apocalyptic earth 106 winters ""After the Fall"". I won't go in depth with each story as we would be here all day and I wouldn't want to spoil any of the challenge. The cast is phenomenal and they'd have to be in order to pull this off. Each actor appears in each story, often in heavy amounts of make-up and sporting accents. The make-up work is always incredible, though it doesn't always work with the particular actor (such as Korean actress Doona Bae as a 19th Century white woman). But the actors are only on screen as their more bizarre transformations for a limited amount of time. Many of the performances, however, are simply brilliant. Every actor is incredible in many of their roles. Halle Berry is wonderful as 1970's reporter Louisa Rey, Tom Hanks as the post-apocalyptic villager Zachry is excellent, and Jim Sturgess' portrayal of 22nd Century Korean freedom-fighter is a stand-out. The best performances are given by Jim Broadbent and Ben Whishaw and both men are serious Oscar contenders. Jim Broadbent is phenomenal as composer Vyvyan Ayrs in the 1930's sequence and as TImothy Cavendish in the present day sequence. Both performances are completely different and he nails every line. If he doesn't earn an Oscar nod for his work, there is no justice. Ben Whishaw as Robert Frobisher there aren't enough words to describe how amazing he is as the amanuensis (fancy word for assistant composer) to Broadbent's Ayres. Frobisher composes the Cloud Atlas Sextet the driving piece of music that connects the stories. The story of Robert Frobisher and his lover Rufus Sixmith (played by James D'Arcy) is the most emotional and affecting of the six. It is beautifully directed by Tykwer and even though Whishaw and D'Arcy aren't on screen together often, the tragic love story is wonderful. Cloud Atlas would not work nearly as well as it does if it weren't for the impeccable and often jaw-dropping editing done by Alexander Berner. In an interview The Wachowskis and Tykwer they said that while writing the script they planned the exact moments when a transition between time periods would occur. That doesn't make Berner's work any less flawless. One character could be turning a corner in one time period when the film would show another character walk through a door in another. Some critics have called Cloud Atlas overly complicated and hard to follow. I would have to call these people old, or at least slightly lazy. I honestly had no trouble following the narrative. That isn't to say I didn't have to work for it; because, I did. Assuredly, not everyone will react to this film as positively as I have. I saw it with my brother and there were probably 25-30 other people in the theater. We were the youngest people there by at least ten years. When the final credits rolled, I applauded which I do not do very often but my brother and I were the only ones. I'm not saying this was obviously a case of ""they were too old, so they didn't get it""; just that you should go in with an open mind. If this review seemed a little sappy at points or that the movie is pretentious I apologize, but that is how emotional and excellent Cloud Atlas is. I simply can not recommend this incredible film enough. This was the best film of 2012 and rests comfortably on the top of my Best of 2012 list.<br/><br/>For more of my movie reviews and news, check out my blog: samshotfirst.tumblr.com"

","'Cloud Atlas' is one of the most ambitious and life-changing movies ever made; a Cinematic Masterpiece! And it's no wonder when the creative minds of Wachowski siblings ('The Matrix', 'V for Vendetta') and Tom Tykwer ('Run Lola Run') collaborate to adapt David Mitchell's considered-to-be-unfilmable novel. Wachowskis' expertise in science fiction and human interest stories, and Tykwer's expertise in modern-day fairy tales, really work in the favour of the movie. It covers the six stories with such finesse that, at times, it becomes maddeningly epic.<br/><br/>With six stories intertwined, it might seem difficult to follow. But the flow is unique and interesting, and not at all difficult to follow. It shifts from 18th century Pacific Islands to futuristic Neo-Seoul to post-apocalyptic earth with such soulful elegance.<br/><br/>It captivatingly and artistically deals with themes of Love and Freedom. Anyone who hates society and conventions, and loves human interest stories dealing with dire situations of different times with a dab of fantasy, is bound to fall in love with the movie. For me, after a certain point, it stopped being a movie, and became something much larger than Life itself.<br/><br/><ul><li>""All boundaries are conventions waiting to be transcended. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive of doing so."" The movie's cinematography (Frank Griebe, John Toll) is enthralling. It gives each timeline its own unique setting, which adds more depth to the story. The movie has so many unforgettable scenes and quotable dialogues, it is almost impossible to side out a few.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""To be is to be perceived and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other."" - ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others – past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."" The movie's splendid cast, with the main actors (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Ben Wishaw, Jim Broadbent) having interesting and different roles in each timeline, truly does a mesmerizing job. In many of the roles, the make-up and acting make the actors almost unrecognizable.</li></ul><br/><br/>But, the movie isn't everyone's cup of tea. As all great movies, it is bound to split viewers into Avid Lovers and Strong Haters. Only people with universal knowledge and vision, maturity and understanding of the importance of Love and Freedom, can really love the movie."
"haosstoposto","9","4","7","15 January 2013"," Perfect 9
","I went to see this movie with mixed expectations. Some say this movie is deep and philosophical masterpiece while others call it boring crap. Like with many interesting movies we have here a love-it-or-hate-it scenario. As for me, I loved it. It is almost three hours long but it does not feel that way. I will not say much about the synopsis of the movie, go see it or read the book. The first premise of the movie is that everything and everyone, in past, present and future is connected in some way. In the movie we have characters with strange comet-like birthmark who move the story of the humanity forward. Perhaps we can can observe them like reincarnation of the same soul trying to redeem itself through the ages. In this concept we see that everything the humanity does, be it good or evil is a part of some great destiny and of course a single person can never grasp the whole picture. The idea is that everything is not only connected, but there is a meaning in everything and when not it leads to some hidden meaning in everything that will happen in the future. All the things in life, good or evil, life, death, pain, joy, happiness, sadness, health, sickness, birth, saving and taking lives, peace, war, love, hate, sacrifice of yourself or the others are part of the great journey of the humankind and when everything looks dire and hopeless and when evil is on the rise, there is always some overlooked grain of sand which causes the machinery of evil and it's schemes to collapse in the end. It is a comforting thought for the humankind but not for the individual and...it's a long story in the history of religions and philosophy and not meant for this movie review. In short, it is a story that will inspire many. I gave it 9 because we do not actually see where this great journey of humankind is going. Maybe toward redemption, but there is only a single individual that can redeemed him/herself in the end. As for the rest, we will see."

","I didn't expect much from Cloud Atlas. I certainly expected it to be a mess. And it was a sort of mess, but a surprisingly coherent one. It managed to be entertaining and the stories always made sense in their own style. It wasn't the ambitious failure I expected, and that's because I do think the critics were hard on it. It's certainly no Dune, and if anything, I think it's better than The Matrix. I think the whole cast did a great job, and the film is full of memorable scenes and characters. It's definitely easy to forget a lot of what happens in each story, and keep track of everything going on, but for a first time viewing it's better to just enjoy it and immerse yourself in the experience. This is a film that I can see becoming a huge cult classic."
"dalydj-918-255175","8","4","7","25 November 2012"," Cloud Atlas is six stories connecting life to other life's so well
","""Cloud Atlas is six different story lines (1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2114, 2321) done so well I found it hard to look away from what I was being presented even when the scenes did not work"" <br/><br/>Based on David Mitchell novel of the same name Cloud Atlas would be a novel called un-filmable because they are so many story lines and trying to connect them to each other would be hard. The Wachowski siblings enlisted Tom Tykwer to direct this very hard story to film. The story goes through six different eras over a time period of 427 years. The stories always have one connecting moment showing that the film is one full story. From a sick man on a voyage home to his wife to a journey of discovery many years into the future.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's and Tykwer to film this story came up with the idea to have one set of actors that played many roles throughout the film. For example actors like Tom Hanks and Halle Berry played about six characters throughout the film. Making this decision meant that makeup was very important because it is used to make an actor look different every time they are on screen and even when the makeup was very present in a bad way I still respected the decision to use these amounts of makeup during the film. Even when the story in some segments turned me off I would be brought back in once the next scene presented me with a visual that amazed me by how they filmed it. The Wachowski style is very present especially in the future scenes (which where the ones the directed) with the Neo Seoul landscape as the characters race through just astounded me.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is probably the most known actor in the film which is a disadvantage to him because when they applied the makeup hard on him I had a problem believing he was the character. His best plot line is in the far future with Halle Berry and he acts his best but in the other plot lines he becomes too cartoonish. Halle Berry also widely known does better with the makeup because he face can be more constructed to look different. She was fine but her one solo plot line of the 70's was the worst in the film because how it started and paid off was not entirely interesting. Jim Broadbent plays many characters but he is just there for comedic relief and the film felt like it did not need him there because of how the rest of the film was structured. Doona Bae was unknown to me before watching this film and playing Sonmi she was the best of the film because she was the life and soul of the film. There was so many other actors including Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and Hugo Weaving were also very good even though the did suffer from applied makeup that made me laugh at times.<br/><br/>The film was very ambitious especially the choice to use the makeup but for me it just looked so well. The story moved very well with great images but the biggest problem was some plot lines failed to make me feel something especially when mixed with plot lines the moved me to love this film more then I thought I would.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Donna Bae)"

","The Wachowski brothers are back with top actors Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in ""Cloud Atlas"" that has some of the feel, pomp, and grandeur of Chris Nolan's ""Inception"" or the brothers earlier ""Matrix"" movies. One of the problems though is the apparent weakness in the supposed overall connection with all the different stories.(Spoilers)I was hoping for a better tie-in than some shooting-star birth marks shared with many of the characters across space and time. Also several of the stories were shallow or not well developed particularly the 2012 and the 1936 time- frames. What really lost it for me though was the Fortune Cookie aphorisms and simplifications like ""conventions in lives are boundaries"" or ""love is everything"" that should NOT be narrated - do the writers think we need to be spoon-fed? There's some Kooky kumbaya detectable, and avid film-goers deserve better. Too bad too, as Cloud Atlas has a pretty nifty production design, and the futuristic sci/fi stories are fairly good despite the dialog. Perhaps sticking with just that final Sci-fi pairing and developing a deeper story between them would've been stronger. This one deserves a mixed/so-so rating."

Right away, I felt that something's not right. As a matter of fact, nothing's right, to be honest. The huge, huge problem is the following: only the way the story is told, is epic-esque, the story itself is (or all six of them, for that matter) dull, clichÃ©d, and has absolutely nothing new to offer. In fact, I was stunned by how utterly predictable the whole thing was, despite the efforts to make it complex. Dear directors: if a story is empty, boring, and quite honestly, heartless, there's no way you can make it interesting. You can chop it up, stir it, put it in a blender, whatever: it will remain empty, boring, and heartless.<br/><br/>There's a very easy way to tell, when there's something wrong with the storytelling aspect of a movie (or a director, for that matter): if there are excellent actors in the movie, who play awfully. I have never seen Tom Hanks or Halle Berry act so painfully badly. The answer is simple - they could not find the pulse of the story. Of course they couldn't It was dead on arrival."

","The film, Cloud Atlas, was a bold undertaking and it delivered. It succeeded in the areas that count the most and it did so without comprising the underlying philosophical message driving this insightful work. The film is not responsible for the task of changing our view of the power of love, nor adding value to cerebral expressions, nor the promotion of compassionate thinking , nor the importance of selfless deeds, nor personal sacrifice. In addition, your average garden-variety film critic, who specializes in defining what will meet the current criterion of popular entertainment and not what satisfies the timeless criterion of what stands to make a positive difference in the world around us, will most likely underrate this thought-provoking call-to- action to live life with a higher awareness of our individual impact on each other now and in the future. As a sidebar, the 102 million dollars invested, which is only an objective representation of employed human talents, in this film is testament to what the film promotes which is, the cost of our actions may seem incredibly high in the here and now but over time will yield immeasurable profits in the world around us in ways that cannot be measured.

There is a commonality between the themes of each story and this combined with the similar pacing of all stories and reincarnation of characters, some playing similar roles throughout others shifting from a more positive role in one to a negative one in another, integrates them all into a whole, which is a tale of oppression, predation, liberty, humor and love amongst other things.<br/><br/>However, with all this and more combined into one single film it fell somewhat short of being magnificent but perhaps that just because I am used to single stories that can afford more depth rather than a multitude of interlinked ones.

It is an absolute crime against humanity that this masterpiece was not recognized in any major awards show outside of the Score category.

When this film debuted nationally on October 26, 2012, it was the third-highest grossing film of it's weekend, behind Argo and Hotel Transylvania (in close to Its 9th week in the theater). It barely earned half of its budget back. Why? Perhaps it was the film's intimidating run time, at 2hrs, 50mins. Perhaps it was because one of the three directors was a transgender. If this is the reason, then people need to grow up and let people make their own lifestyle decisions. (Although I do miss calling them The Wachowski Brothers.)

","As much as people's eyes light up when discussing how ambitious, beautiful, or transcendental this film is, I think they are forgetting to admit that it's also quite simply long and boring. I'll admit that I had a tough time realizing it myself after three viewings. But it's true. Everyone is so focused on interconnectedness and reincarnation that they fail to see what is actually sloppy filmmaking, or sloppy storytelling, or perhaps both. I believe that many of those who watch Cloud Atlas are afraid that if six concurrent stories seems confusing or incoherent it must mean that they ""don't get it"" and therefore apply their own vague understanding of Eastern religion so that it becomes a profound tale of humanity.<br/><br/>I'll be honest. I wanted to like Cloud Atlas. Really bad. I resisted the urge to fiddle on my phone. I paused when I had to pee. I rewound when my kid yelled from the next room. But after 3 viewings, 2 one day and 1 the next, I realized that I was bored. I realized that I didn't miss anything walking out of the room for 60 seconds. Contrast with something like Mulholland Drive. That feels like an incomprehensible film at its end, but its never boring, and each minute holds import, even for someone who doesn't understand exactly what's happened. But Cloud Atlas tricks you. There's no payoff and the ride isn't even fun. But of course the less sense it makes must mean its all the profound, just waiting for little old super smart film loving you to discover its wondrous secrets. It's alright to admit that just because a film was made with 6 stories doesn't mean it's good. Ask someone to really tell you what's so fantastic about it, in detail, with specifics. It will be a bumbling affair with lots of vocal filler and big words like ""connectedness.""<br/><br/>I first went in expecting at the very least some very clever exercises in causality. I was pretty disappointed at the lame ""connections"" and a flimsy, undeveloped notion of reincarnation. Moreover the stories were just boring. For this film to even begun to have worked it needed to deal with stories that could stand on their own. But the viewer is so distracted by making connections and abrupt transitions that it takes a little while to see that these stories are incomplete. In fact, I was waiting for all but one to get to the ""good part"" and it never happened. Each is filled with a dull anti-climax culminating in insignificance. The very structure doesn't allow any time to connect with anyone. When you have a story devoid of anything to personally ""connect"" to, it gets very boring very quickly. <br/><br/>1849 is a dull plod through one man's minor morality struggle while he himself is subjugated by evil near and far. Surprise! Good guys win, yeah! 1936 wants to show off the purity of love and art by giving us a protagonist who can't find the time or courage to face his lover and would rather kill a man than give due credit to his composition. What is this? The world is cruel? Maybe, but your moral compass could sure use some calibration before we throw the pity party over your suicide. 1973 Corporations are evil and will clearly blow up planes. But daddy's little girl can't be beat down by ""the man!"" Power to the people yo! 2012 Yawn. Why should we care about this guy? He's obviously a little less honest with money than he ought to be and he slept with his brother's wife. What are you cheering for? 2144 Easily the most boring. A tired tale of revolution trimmed down to 30 minutes. And the bad guys win anyway. Revolution failed. 2312 or whatever. What could've been the most interesting segment is whittled down to incomprehensible babble, and for a story about contacting the colonies of a post- apocalyptic Earth it's made as purposefully uninteresting as possible.<br/><br/>It's just not that grand. Just because something has never been done doesn't mean it should, and just because someone did it doesn't mean they did it well. I will concede that Cloud Atlas is a fine treat for the eyes, but it doesn't contain the genius ending that justifies its tedious approach. I know the cuts between stories are quick, but don't let it fool you into thinking anything important is really happening. <br/><br/>As I said, I wanted to like this film, I still do. But it's so inflated with purpose, so intent on being profound, so dazzling in its premise, that it could never live up to whatever vision someone like me hoped for. What's there is even difficult to understand. Something is peculiar with the sound (very noticeable in The Matrix as well) that makes characters particularly hard to understand, more so considering the British and Asian accents in the first two, fourth, and fifth segments and the sixth remains all but a mystery without subtitles. The inclusion of a handful of actors for a few dozen roles is, like the film, surely ambitious, but ultimately distracting.<br/><br/>Ambitious does not equal pleasing, entertaining, or coherent. Sprawling does not imply meaningful length. Grand in scope is not synonymous with a cohesive narrative. Stop letting these words ""cloud"" your mind when you find yourself just plain uninterested in this ambitious, sprawling epic of grand scope. What one forgets amidst all this pomp is that things like pacing, restraint, and focus are consistent hallmarks of good filmmaking and good storytelling. The gimmick makes us too many promises that no one can keep. The objective ought to be to figure out what one wants to say and then form a creative way to say it. Instead, when it comes to Cloud Atlas, it seems that too many are wrapped up in how the story is told rather than the significance of what is told."

Another hindrance is the distraction of Hollywood stars plastered in unconvincing make up giving the viewer a barrier too difficult to overcome.It also takes itself terribly seriously,i think a lighter touch would have been more persuasive.Certainly there's some striking imagery (pretty much all included in the trailer) but aside from that we are left with a ponderous,dull story.<br/><br/>I applaud the films ambition but unfortunately thats about all i can recommend."

","Before I begin, I'd like to express my embarrassment of carrying the karma which has led me to be born on this planet, a planet on which unique pieces of art like this film receive negative reviews while dumb films make a future and receive so-called ""universal"" acclaim! <br/><br/>I wish I hadn't been born here! <br/><br/>This film is about reincarnation and karma and connectedness of actions/reactions despite the filmmakers not clearly putting it this way (I think if they had said it so, they would have received more negative reviews!). And that's the resistance of stupidity and unawareness that the film is intelligently trying to show; that's where the message of the film is ""shut up"" by the resistance of the unaware exactly as the story tells! Each sentence, each piece of dialog is intelligently put there to give you an insight of the philosophy and doctrine of the film. Unless you already know things, don't expect to get it all the first time.<br/><br/>""To be, is to be perceived"". And that's the truest meaning of ""being"". In the doctrine of karma-reincarnation, the ""perceiver"" is the part of the self that is ""given"" the body in different lives. It's not the feelings, memories, brain and mind. It's the deepest level of self. That part of you, as the reader of this text, has existed since the dawn of time even before the big bang and will exist after this life. That's the only thing you can say about yourself.<br/><br/>YOU are that perceiver. YOU are not this BODY that has a SOUL! YOU are that ""SOUL"" to which a body has been given. YOU are that same ""perceiver"" in your dreams! YOU are that same ""experiencing entity"" that in some of your dreams looks like has lived in another old time. Haven't you had such dreams? The one like what Tom Hank's character has before feeling something dire is about to happen? Haven't you had deja-vus like the one Cavendish gets at the train station? <br/><br/>Think about it for a second. What if that dream is real? What if you were actually there in another body. What if you're actually that ""perceiver"" not ""this body with perception""! <br/><br/>The moment you cross the boundary and transcend from a ""believer->then->viewer"" to a ""viewer->then->believer"", you're done! That moment is like the moment Neo chose the ""right"" pill in the Matrix to realize the reality of being and the truth behind reality.<br/><br/>YES! The universe is a huge Matrix in which ""souls"" or better say ""perceivers"" are in a game without realizing it. A game of facing the consequences of their actions that ""force"" them to gain ""divine"" qualities; qualities that a ""thief-doctor who kills to rob"" does not posses but a ""nuclear scientist who prefers to be killed to save others"" does! The universe is a master of turning such bad souls into such good ones! <br/><br/>Don't fool yourself! The only way out is to take the ""right pill"" which has been placed in front of you! You'll be in the game even if you kill yourself and the bad thing is that you won't even remember you did kill yourself to get rid of it, even though the universe may lead you somehow to this same piece of text here in 500 years' time! <br/><br/>And that's the purpose of the global Matrix. You are here to realize this truth. You are here to become a colleague for the creator who has put you in the game, despite the creator is actually a part of the creation or maybe the creation itself.<br/><br/>And yes, Wachowski's Cloud Atlas is Matrix UNIVERSAL! They have put the pills in front of you to take. Would you take the right pill or give a negative review to the film and take the wrong one to stay in the stupid game? <br/><br/>Some say musicians only make one song and filmmakers only make one film and that happens to be the case for these guys!"
"rennells","8","5","10","21 December 2012"," A soul's journey
","This was an extraordinary film, spanning many centuries and many past and future lives of a select few souls.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book but after seeing this film I will definitely be buying a copy. <br/><br/>My understanding of the movie is as follows:<br/><br/>1) Each of us has soul-mates, and these are souls who we have a connection with in our current life, and also in our past and future lives. A soul-mate isn't necessarily our lover but can also be an enemy or a friend or an employer or a relative. If they are not already part of your life then your paths will one day cross and when it does you will be drawn to each other and will continue to be drawn to each other in every future life, in what ever capacity.<br/><br/>2) After death, the soul is reincarnated in to a different body. The soul remains the same, but the body is different. Somehow, the soul recognises other key souls from previous lives, even though the body is different. The relationships between souls are different in each life. For example, two souls could be lovers in one life, colleagues in another life and friends in another life. Despite the relationship, the same souls are drawn to each other in each lifetime.<br/><br/>3) In the movie, the same actor is used to depict each soul's journey, so that the viewer can see the past and future lives of each soul. In each past and future life, the soul will have a different body, a different face, and even a different gender or ethnicity but the soul remains the same. This would be impossible to film, so to make it easy for viewers to understand what's happening, the same actor has been used in the various lives of each soul. <br/><br/>4) From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. From birth until death, we are bound to our soul-mates and every decision we make affects those around us and can potentially ripple through the centuries. <br/><br/>5) The soul evolves over the course of many lifetimes, so that you could be an evil murderous doctor in one lifetime, a murderous writer in another, a brave and unfortunate scientist in another, and a courageous and loyal survivor in another. It's as though the soul learns lessons in each life which can impact on the next life. <br/><br/>I'm sure there was much more to the film than that but nevertheless these are the main things that stood out to me. I can't wait to read the book now. This movie is definitely worth watching a few times!"

"radivel","9","5","10","4 November 2012"," Cloud Atlas is not a normal movie.
","Cloud Atlas is by no means a normal movie. IMDb has this blurb: ""An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution."" (Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/) which is vaguely accurate. The story itself is more both complex and less deep at first glance than this.<br/><br/>It's more like a collection of stories across history that feature strange interactions between them. Each story and time period has the same actors / actresses playing either complete different or characters that are somehow related to their other time period characters in some way. The decision as to which is which appears random, sometimes feeling unnecessary and not all appear in all eras / stories. The drastic changes of say, Hugo Weaving's appearance between two periods is amazing and nearly a reason to watch the movie on it's own.<br/><br/>So, having read this so far, you might be thinking, ""But I've already seen The Fountain, why do I need to watch this?"" Well, The Fountain is an amazing movie, but it's different than this. The themes explored in this movie are nowhere near present in The Fountain, because despite the ""intertwined characters across time"" aspect, it takes a different approach. The Fountain is much more evident in it's time-spanning interactions, but perhaps Cloud Atlas takes multiple viewings to achieve this? <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean that this isn't a great story. It very much is. There's adventure, love, humor, passion and some amazing writing, all set to spectacular scenery and a probable Academy Award for costume design. It explores multiple themes, has you caring on multiple levels, and encourages multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The Good This movie is: 4/10 The Fountain 2/10 The Hyperion Cantos (seriously!) 1/10 Blade Runner 1/10 Mad Max 1/10 British Comedy 1/10 A bunch of other things If this doesn't sound good, I have some Jason Statham movies to recommend to you.<br/><br/>The Bad It takes a long time to get going, you're very confused at the start. I mean a long time, more than half an hour. Some of the dialects used are difficult to understand.<br/><br/>Overall It's rare that someone can call a movie ""beautiful"", but this is indeed just that. I will watch this movie several times throughout my life, and I suspect that over time, it will gather appreciation it deserves. 9/10 stars here."

"ProfessorKaos64","8","9","22","27 October 2012"," One extraordinary film
","Never have I ever left the cinema more profoundly touched and moved by a movies message than with Cloud Atlas. What starts as a seemingly innocent premise at the start of the film, evolves into an opus of story telling surpassing the connected events driven story of the film Crash. The film follows several seemingly disconnected strangers, who's lives, actions, and motives shape the course of history over immense gaps in time. This masterpiece of cinema is largely driven by the message of life, through the consequences, actions, and events of many. A message so beautiful in its execution, I sincerely believe those who criticize the film miss the purpose of its storytelling entirely. Throughout each story arch, you can't help but connect the dots, and see the similar concourse each story follows. From the early days of 1800's exploration to the science fiction dystopian society of Neo Seoul, each story interweaves in such a magnificent fashion, you can see just how each character discovers their interconnected lives. No, this isn't the sequel to Looper, there is no time traveling involved here. The concept of Karma is a major player here, shaping the decisions of each of the characters throughout their stories. Realizing what you do affects others in this life or the next? Now that is one powerful message. Whether you believe in Heaven or Hell, the film conveys a very real sense that when one door closes, another opens in its place. Where one person dies, another life begins. I know some will look at this film, and not get the broader message. That is quite fine with me, and I know they will dismiss its importance and impact on cinema. The expert precision, in which the actors played several characters with such creative artistry, was amazing to be frank. At the end of the film you will never believe some of the characters were even played by the same people. I truly applaud the actors in this move for going the extra mile in this, and the makeup artist for their expert transformations they created with the actor's characters. In this day of remakes and stories ripped from books, comics, and the analogues of history, the creativity of this movie can't be ignored. Look past the special effects, the almost indecipherable native speak of the islanders, and the speed dial, furious changing of one stories scene to the others. This is one film I will cherish and hope that others do too. As Tom Hank's character looks to the sky at the end of the film, pointing out Earth to his kin, I can't help but wonder what the universe holds for me."
"ferguson-6","8","9","22","26 October 2012"," Melody or Malady. The True True
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ambitious and mesmerizing. Those are the two words that best describe my reaction to this stunning film based on the David Mitchell novel. Hopefully, you have not come here for answers to the many mysteries offered up by this most unique film experience. If you are the type that loves to think, analyze and discuss complex movies, you will be challenged and satisfied. If you prefer your stories clean, straightforward and gift-wrapped, you will be like some of those in my audience who walked out of the theatre at various stages -not to return.<br/><br/>While there are no easy explanations for what we see on screen, this is undoubtedly one of the more complex and multi-faceted and challenging movies to watch. There are six stories that span approximately 500 years (beginning in 1849 and going through 2346 or so). We see many actors playing multiple characters of various ages, crossing racial and gender lines depending on the specific story. We track the progression/regression of their souls through time. This will prove more challenging to you than it sounds on paper, as the make-up work is some of the most extreme ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>The six stories are co-written and directed by Tom Twyker (Run Lola Run) and The Wachowski's (Lana and Andy, The Matrix trilogy). These six segments are split evenly between the two director groups, yet then blend seamlessly thanks to the truly expert editing of Alexander Berner. You will recognize the influence and similarities of such films as Master and Commander, Cocoon, Silkwood and Blade Runner, as well as many others.<br/><br/>Filling the clothing, donning the make-up and spouting the dialogue in manners that you often won't recognize are such actors as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Donna Bae, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D'Arcy, Xun Zhou, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. Especially entertaining are Hugo Weaving as a sadistic female nurse and Hugh Grant as a violent tribesman. The best laughs in the film are courtesy of the great Mr. Broadbent whose facial expressions are near clown-like in elasticity.<br/><br/>As for the themes and points of the film, that is a topic for debate. A couple of lines of dialogue offer some clues. Hanks' nasty ship doctor spouts ""The weak are meat the strong do eat"", and we notice the recurring theme of the strong dominating the weak across all story lines. There is another line: ""One can transcend any convention so long as one can conceive of doing so"", that provides the glimmer of hope in each story. Love and oppression are always present, but it's clear to me that the human spirit remains strong and is capable of overcoming oppression in the past, present and future. You may disagree but our debates will be colorful ... and may change after a second viewing!"

How some of these reviews managed to put 10 stars in reference to this movie is nothing short of a conspiracy, and I am not a conspiracy theorist by any stretch of the imagination. This Movie was TERRIBLE. There is no point in trying to critique bits and pieces, because the whole darn think is just plain BAD. Instead of watching this movie one should just turn on some good music and channel surf for 3 hours.

For example, I generally don't care for short stories, so the idea of seeing a film with 6 short stories, even though interconnected, was not appealing. And, a lot of people are giving the impression that this film is difficult to understand. So, I figured I would be one of those people who really didn't understand it. You might ask why I went. Well, I rather like Tom Hanks, and even people who have criticized the film seem to be impressed with its visualization and scope.<br/><br/>First off, the actors. Tom Hanks in perhaps his finest role...or I should say roles. Halle Berry, extremely impressive. Susan Sarandan, a very entertaining role. I was impressed with one actor with whom I was not familiar -- Ben Whishaw. And, Jim Broadbent was wonderfully entertaining. There were others as well, many of whom carried multiple roles. No complaint about the acting here.<br/><br/>I found the stories reasonably easy to follow. A few connections escaped me, but don't take a very long bathroom or snack counter break -- you might miss a key connection.<br/><br/>The photography and special effects are tremendous.<br/><br/>So while I entered the theater with negative feelings, I left rather uplifted by it all. It would be difficult to sit through it all again...at least in a theater. Perhaps on DVD, where it could be broken into sections it might be more enjoyable a second time. And for those who are seeing it multiple times hoping to bring more clarity...my guess is that while multiple viewings might clear up a few points, if you don't get the gist of the story the first time around, you probably won't get the gist of it the third time around, either.<br/><br/>I rarely give 8's, but this time I will!

There's also the overarching idea that the elites of any society will use what ability and power they have to subjugate those who they deem inferior. Consider George Orwell's ""1984"". What's particularly exceptional is the editing, some of the time switches occur within seconds, bringing the viewer from one time dimension to the next flawlessly. In that regard, I must caution the viewer that paying attention is of the utmost importance, or for those not engaged in the picture, not important at all.

","How do you review a film like ""Cloud Atlas""? Well, I could start by saying that it is an example of ""hyperlink cinema"", a style of film-making which has become popular in recent decades, especially since the turn of the millennium. Such films involve multiple story lines which are intercut with each other instead of being told sequentially. With most films of this nature, however, there is some obvious connection between the various plot lines. Altman's ""Short Cuts"", for example, was based upon various short stories by Raymond Carver. All the plot lines in ""Traffic"" were related to the illegal drugs trade, those in ""Syriana"" to Middle-Eastern politics and those in ""The Hours"" to Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs Dalloway"". <br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" is different. The film with which it has most in common is ""Babel"", which also featured apparently unrelated stories, but ""Babel"" only had three plot lines, all set in the present day, whereas ""Cloud Atlas"" has six, set in six different historical periods:- <br/><br/>In 1849 Adam Ewing, an American lawyer travelling between the Pacific Islands and San Francisco, tries to help Autua, a runaway slave who has stowed away on his ship. <br/><br/>In 1936 a young English musician named Robert Frobisher becomes amanuensis to Vyvyan Ayrs, an elderly and eccentric composer, after being expelled from Cambridge for homosexuality. <br/><br/>In 1973 Luisa Rey, a San Francisco journalist, finds that her life is in danger when she investigates the suspicious death of a scientist named Rufus Sixsmith. <br/><br/>In London in 2012 a writer murders a critic who has given his book a negative review, thus setting in motion a series of events which culminate in his publisher, Timothy Cavendish, being interned in a sinister old people's home. <br/><br/>In a dystopian Korea in the year 2144 Sonmi-451, a member of a despised underclass of genetically-modified humans, joins a rebellion against the corrupt society to which she belongs. <br/><br/>In a post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the year 2321, Zachary Bailey, a member of a primitive tribe known as the ""Valleymen"", encounters a more technically advanced people known as the ""Prescients"". <br/><br/>Not only do these stories appear to have little in common, they are also made in quite different styles. The first two are costume dramas, and the 1973 story is a ""paranoid"" thriller reminiscent of ""The Pelican Brief"" or ""Chain Reaction"". (Like those films it deals with skulduggery by high-ups in the oil industry). The 2012 story is essentially a black comedy and the last two plot lines are dealt with in a science-fiction style. The Korean one shows the strong influence of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner""; even the name of the cloned underclass, ""fabricants"", recalls the similar term (""replicants"") used in Scott's film. The Hawaiian story seems to have been influenced by Kevin Costner's ""The Postman"". <br/><br/>So how are these disparate strands connected? To a limited extent, by the use of recurring characters and places; Sixsmith, for example, appears as a young man in the 1936 segment- he is Frobisher's lover- and as an older one in 1973, and Ayrs' mansion later becomes the nursing home in which Cavendish stays. Another device used is that of casting the same actors in different roles in different stories, although often so well disguised as to be unrecognisable. It was pretty obvious that Jim Broadbent was playing not only Cavendish but also Ayrs and the 1849 ship's captain, and that Halle Berry was both Luisa and the Prescient woman with whom Zachary falls in love, but I didn't spot her as Ayrs' wife, probably because she was made up to look white in this section. (Several actors play characters of a different race to their own, and in one case, of a different sex). I failed to recognise Hugh Grant, normally a distinctive actor, in any of his six roles. <br/><br/>With so many actors playing multiple roles, there would not be room here to single out every good performance, but I think that special mention should go to Broadbent as the confused, bumbling Cavendish and the irascible old Ayrs, to Tom Hanks as Zachary and to the South Korean actress Doona Bae as the initially servile Sonmi, who gradually comes to recognise her own humanity and the criminal nature of a society which fails to respect that humanity. <br/><br/>Watching the film is a bit like trying to do a jigsaw puzzle. At first we are confronted with what looks like a mass of confused fragments and then, as we start to put them together, a bigger picture starts to emerge and we realise that there are indeed links between all six segments. I won't set out what all those links are, but the most important one is the thematic link of revolt against, or liberation from, some form of slavery, imprisonment or oppression. Autua and Sonmi are enslaved in the most literal sense. Cavendish and Frobisher are both held against their will in the same building, the former by physical restraint and the latter by blackmail. Zachary and his people are oppressed by an aggressive race known as the Kona. Luisa fights against the tyranny of corrupt people in high places. As the film reaches its end we realise how people in one era have inspired those in the next when faced with similar problems and we eventually see the complete picture. The film has divided critical opinion, but from my point of view it succeeds beautifully. 8/10"

","Hello There! i would happily review this flick in 2012 when first time i see it, but i just couldn't collect thoughts and emotions because i was so excited and confused a bit. after 2012 i watched this movie many times, every time i watch it i realize,know and discover more and more about the plot so there is nothing confusing anymore, but when the movie ends the Euphoria is haunting down and i couldn't talk about thoughts and feelings about this movie! so in the August's warm night i want to say a few word until i can. Lets start about Directors Tom Tykwer and Wachowskies...<br/><br/>Wachowskies are gods of Sci-Fi the Creators of Matrix world after they wrote and directed matrix they also showed that they can also write a good Drama with thriller elements(V for Vendetta) but there was bound too before in 1996 but OK ENOUGH with Wachowskies. Tykwer is also familiar with fantasy and drama as we know so They stick together all the experience and put in this one! they adapted and directed unbelievable book! unbelievable scenes and they did it without making it ugly! Mitchell said that he didn't thought that filming his book was possible, but they did it and they did it great! the film is simply beautiful every scene,every view is beautiful and got its meaning.<br/><br/>also the cast are well chosen and they did great work most of them plays 4-6 characters and they do it really good,imagine they must play several different character and they must not be the similar and they should be, at some point... Makeup artists did the great job as well. + Director of Photography and all the cameraman + Visual Effects + Composer Tykwer + of course Writer David Mitchell who gave us amazing dialogues and whole Story. +<br/><br/>if you haven't seen yet. you're Lucky! do it now!!"

","Cloud Atlas (2012): Dir: Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski / Cast: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant: Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski brothers unite to create an epic film about connection. It is a complicated film that spans about four centuries and features six interlinking stories where various actors are done up in heavy makeup and playing multiple roles. This is all visually spectacular with its futuristic outlook and flying cars and skyscrapers. Tom Hanks is featured as a villager whose village is threatened by bandits. He also plays an evil doctor seeking a treasure owned by someone who is tasking to eliminate slavery. Halle Berry is featured as a journalist who is run off the road by those whom she is out to expose, and survives. She also plays an alien like creature whom the villager Hanks plays assists in a travel in return for her curing his daughter of a dreaded disease. Jim Broadbent has a more comical role as a publisher locked in an old age home by his brother. He owes money to some heavies and this is his unfortunate hideout. Hugo Weaving plays many of the villain roles as he did in the Wachowski brothers Matrix films. We even get an amusing role of him in drag as a nasty nurse. Hugh Grant also appears in multiple roles including one where he is unrecognizable. Viewers are advised to pay close attention but the film is never boring. Everyone of these six stories could make for a movie of their own but at least it never becomes clouded over with confusion and draws on what connects us all together. Score: 9 / 10"

"robinski34","7","3","5","8 June 2014"," The Weight of the World
","Cloud Atlas is an audacious avalanche of ideas that it took three directors to deliver. Arguably overlong and of uneven tone, perhaps the film's greatest strength is that it begs the question 'Is it not more important to have ideas than to have successful ideas.' Then again, it is too easy to dismiss novel projects in this vein as being over-complicated when they should be lauded for taking the risk to attempt something different. As ever, Tom Hanks hardly puts a foot wrong in what seem to be the most testing of roles, and Halle Berry is equally effective in convincing the viewer to swallow some huge conceits. Jims Sturgess and Broadbent appear comfortable with the tall notions that abound, and there are equally effective turns from Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving, who always looks like he is having tremendous fun. Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Keith David and David Gyasi also deserve a mention for their significant contribution, but it's hard to argue against Doona Bae being at the film's heart, her performance in the futuristic Neo Seoul capturing fragility while showing strength, and displaying both dignity and determination. Bae and Sturgess deliver as many emotional scenes as Hanks and Berry, and deserve high praise for it. Viewing Cloud Atlas, I would argue that, in cinema, the end is not necessarily to present a coherent outcome, but to generate contemplation of what the outcome might be, or of the path followed to reach it. In the end, Cloud Atlas could be seen as being failing under the weight of too many cinematic genres, with the comic strand in particular tending to jar against the drama and tension around it, but the writers and directors are to be commended for attempting such an ambitious project, that delivers much in the way of thoughtful cinema and compelling performance. Multiple viewings seem bound to reveal more dimensions."

I'm still not entirely sure if Halle Berry was actually played by Tom Hanks or vice versa, I confess I had no idea what was going on until a second watch-through. It's a shame they don't make closed-captioning for the stupid. If you are on drugs right now don't even try, trust me, you'll need a cup of coffee. There are too many elements deserving of praise to mention, but the driving force is the chemistry of the talented and charismatic cast and David Mitchell & the Wachowskis' sly storytelling (I didn't read the book but it's obviously pretty good so go and pick it up), with Tom Tykwer's pace-setting score really tying the whole thing together like the rug in The Dude's apartment.

","I had some problems with this film but mostly it was great. It's a good adaptation of a novel that's ridiculously difficult to adapt and tells six interesting stories that wildly differ from each other. The range this film successfully portrays is great, from 70's pulp mystery to dystopian science fiction and 19th century drama in the style of Amadeus.<br/><br/>The visuals look amazing, the costuming and prop departments outdid themselves. The big problem was that for absolutely unnecessary reasons they tried to turn Western people into Asian people with make-up and vice versa, with unsettlingly unsuccessful and jarring results. Seriously, it looks weird. Why didn't you just give up? You didn't need to do that! If you get past that, the film is definitely worth a watch and some discussion. It's very humanistic, dealing with things like prejudice and the things one person can do to change everything. The film discusses morality through difficult topics like homosexuality and slavery. Though the film is science fiction and fantasy, its messages are broad and applicable."
"forrestly7","9","3","5","17 November 2013"," A Fever-Dream to Treasure
","Cloud Atlas, much like a lucid dream, is a jumbled, confusing, puzzle that also makes sense in it's own mad way. One that you simply cannot take your eyes off of. Beautifully shot, directed and acted, it is an avant-Gard cinematic masterpiece that needs to be seen more than once. Special kudos to Doona Bae and Jim Sturgess, who almost steal the movie in their headliner roles. All of the actors do a wonderful job, however-Broadbent and Hanks are reliably excellent , and Weaving and Grant do a respectable job as villains throughout history. Halle Berry shines and showcases her immense talent. One flaw would be in the narration, where the point that we are all ""interconnected"" and that our actions impact what happen to us in future lives are drilled into the audience repeatedly. This karmic message throughout the film really goes without saying and the narration is a bit overkill. Cloud Atlas is a rare achievement - producing the same feeling as after one wakes from an epic, confusing, emotional, strange dream. One that makes you want to return."

"BharatSamra","9","3","5","27 February 2013"," A Mesmerizing Premise, That Lives Up to Its Promise!
","Forget all that cinema has taught you. If you can manage to not use fabricated expectations that you have gathered throughout your cinematic life when experiencing Cloud Atlas, then the altitude of enjoyment you are left with following the film, will be elevated amongst some of the other most original concepts film has to offer. Yes, Cloud Atlas does contain familiar storytelling elements, but no, they are not enhanced and adapted into conventional territory; in fact, quite the opposite. The trailer prepares you well, without giving much of the plot away, in that the tone is set and you are prepared to be mesmerised by the power of being told a similar story several times over, though they are adapted to different spatial and cultural contexts. Cloud Atlas is one of those rare visual experiences whereby you take an outsider's perspective of reality, as the film's originality in embarking on a mythology of ancestry and its message alone are enough for you to continue discussion on its brilliance for generations to come; though I am sure our descendents will have another approach to this work of art.<br/><br/>My apologies if that perplexing piece of prose above did not make the slightest bit of sense. There are just too many points of celebration to enforce onto my appreciation for this magnificent film, and trying to encompass each of them within a single piece of writing is rather difficult when even the premise is a potential topic of ongoing discussion. The acting, editing, costume design, stunning visual effects, dialogue/language use and many other superb elements in Cloud Atlas are almost taken for granted; they are left in the backdrop in order to supplement the sensationally superior foregrounded concept that makes this feature unique. We are taken on a magnificently original journey, that is aided by the seamless editing as we leap from era to era: one moment we are dealing with the issue of 19th century slavery, and the next shot will see us transported to a future post apocalyptic condition with similar oppression. The beauty lies within seeing the similarities of each generation that they pass on to the next, which saddens and intrigues at the same time. It certainly does take perhaps a few seconds to realise that the film has shifted in time, and for you to draw the necessary parallels between characters that make up the story, though once you fit these puzzle pieces into place, you see the utter genius and appreciate the film for all of its gloriousness. <br/><br/>This could quite possibly be the worst film for attempting to leave your seat for a restroom break or to purchase refreshments. I would recommend holding it in/refraining from wasting your money. Missing a second of Cloud Atlas (not that you would want to) results in becoming more lost than skipping an episode of, well...LOST. Every single second of the 172 minute feature is imperative to comprehending the narrative as a whole. The film certainly requires your absolute attention, though that is no issue as there is no other way to feel about Cloud Atlas in its entirety, than intrigued. In fact, you are so intrigued that watching the film for a second time would probably be as useful to grasping all of the aspects to the plot, as much as it would be for your reinforced enjoyment. <br/><br/>After an incredible first hour of primarily exposition, there is a brief inkling that the film will suffer from an inevitable decadence because of the inconceivable strength it has exhibited so far. Surely, it cannot endure additional weight to the narrative and take the pressure of our developed expectations? Well it does, and in spectacular fashion! Cloud Atlas actually gets better as we progress through the modified three-act structure. It climbs to a beautiful climax (plural?) and its two main overarching stories draw themselves to such a satisfactory conclusion that you want to stand and applaud before running to tell every human being that if they have the opportunity, to go and experience Cloud Atlas. Those that believe Cloud Atlas is just another drop in an ocean of insignificant and forgettable modern cinema, I say ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?"" and this is in an instance when this particular film has the stature of a rogue wave when up against the majority of other theatrical releases that drop into our cinemas."
"samuel_legassick","9","3","5","27 February 2013"," 6 Films In One!
","Full review here: http://www.thewildbore.com/2013/02/review-cloud-atlas/<br/><br/>When I heard that the Wachowski's were coming back with a huge new film under some kind of pretence of it being a big budget 'indie' film, I was dubious. Was this them trying to get back some credibility? How can such a cast and a $100 million small fortune be deemed indie? In any case, I still felt that the Wachowski brothers (now brother and sister) haven't done a good film since The Matrix; they haven't done many since then but still. Remember also, they did not direct V For Vendetta, instead it was their Matrix 1st AD James McTeigue but I didn't really like that either. Co-director Tom Tykwer has had some very strange films made since Run Lola Run but does this collaboration work? It's one of the few films that puts three directors in equal standing for a movie. But then, it's not your average movie <br/><br/>So what of the 3 hour epic Cloud Atlas?<br/><br/>I have to be forthcoming and say that this isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. Firstly, it has six simultaneous story lines and to begin with, this can be rather daunting. Flitting between characters in completely different time periods can seem confusing but the directors, and the clever editing, allow the viewer to never feel alone, they are confidently guiding you through the story and even when you think you're lost, you're safe in the knowledge that the people who have crafted this film know what they are doing. So you have to come at this with an open mind but also one that can juggle lots of information at the same time. If you want something you can sit back and zone out to, this won't be for you. This is mainly for the current generation of people who like to multi-task, listening to music with the TV on while surfing the internet and texting your mate. Watching Cloud Atlas is never boring, in fact it takes what looks like the best-of bits from each storyline and presents them in a linear fashion, it's like channel swapping with each channel being something different, but all part of the same whole.<br/><br/>The six stories are uniquely different. The earliest one takes place during the slave trade where a lawyer is travelling on a boat to get back home (period/history piece), then there is the young bisexual composer who writes the Cloud Atlas sextet (the romance story), a young journalist trying to uncover secrets of an evil nuclear company (70′s thriller), Broadbent with some other old timer mates in the present time (comedy), a future with a cyborg with a soul (sci-fi) and a post-apocalyptic tribal world where they are trying to reach the top of a mountain (action/adventure). If this sounds like an incomprehensible amazing mix of genres, then you would be correct. The fact that you're flying from one of these to the other might sound like a nightmare but instead it flows so smoothly, so naturally, that by the end of the film you feel like you have lived six different lifetimes.<br/><br/>Of course, the other reason this film flows so well is that the same actors play different parts in each storyline. This isn't some self-congratulatory showpiece of how diverse the actors are, but instead it's for the benefit of the story and a unique take on the book. There is a birthmark that continues throughout and is usually associated with ones who essentially change the story, it's attached to the real protagonist of each piece. But then each actor has an arc as the timeline continues.<br/><br/>Hanks goes from being a morally dubious fellow to a selfless shepherd, his path taking a positive step as time continues. Sturgess goes from reluctant hero to full on revolutionary, abolishing any kind of slavery (slavery and the idea of power being an overarching theme in the whole film). Ben Whishaw never really emerging from the shadows, his sextet however being his true legacy. Halle Berry rises up through the ranks to try and save humanity one step at a time, Broadbent goes from being an arrogant oaf to learning humility and becoming some kind of transient being and Doona Bae learns to fight for herself. For each positive transition there are also negative ones. Hugh Grant for instance remains evil throughout and ends as a cannibal warrior, Hugo Weaving goes from bad to worse (as Old Gregg lookalike Old Georgie) and seems to become the manifestation of pure evil. Of course there are other actors but these are the main ones and watching their journeys and thinking about them afterwards adds to the experience of Cloud Atlas. I can safely say it's the only 3 hour film that I would have been happy to watch again straight after it finished.<br/><br/>Full review here: http://www.thewildbore.com/2013/02/review-cloud-atlas/"

Don't struggle to get comfortable with it. Let it master you, and you will be immensely rewarded with the grand emotional culmination. Yet even still, it demands multiple viewings. Its sophisticated ideology and philosophy will cause one to introvert and reflect on what influences their lives and the expansively possible consequences of their choices, as well as the differences they can make. The Cloud Atlas universe is one full of mystery and wonder, and it takes viewers on a spectacular journey as the plot evolves. There is so much depth here that it appeals to a broad audience as each subplot emphasizes its own genres. The film's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the Academy Award has already been won by the makeup department for their astonishing transformations of the actors, who embody roles of differing race, sex, and ethnicity. Cloud Atlas is a true work of art, a moving, profoundly entertaining cinematic accomplishment, and a standout movie of the decade. It has the power to deeply, psychologically affect its viewers, and its ideas and notions could reverberate for years to come."

","I'm 16, I have a certain taste in the movies I watch. Any movie that doesn't interest me, I just fall asleep in. All of the Bourne movies, put me straight to sleep they were so uninteresting, but this film was so different to my expectation. My eyes were glued to the screen by the end I had wished there was more! Three hours of a film and I felt it was only five minutes. I had gotten so absorbed in the six stories, I was so attached to each character. <br/><br/>This movie is honestly so great and underrated, it was such a surprise. I would have never thought this movie was that great, but it really is A MUST SEE."

","The storyline, that of Sonmi451, was an almost verbatim replay of the story of Jesus Christ. I for one, found that refreshing. But knowing that the political inclinations of the directors are more in line with those who feel that the needs of the many are more important than the needs of the few, I wonder if they were even aware that this story is in direct contradiction to there socialist ideal. <br/><br/>I found the performance by the actress portraying Sonmi451, Doona Bae, mesmerizing, and I hope to see more of her. Jim Broadbent delivered the only Oscar winning performances in the entire film. Other than that, the other performances were only average from the likes of Berry and Hanks, nothing too memorable. There were quite a few moments that fell short of there potential, hence my 7 star review. <br/><br/>It is truly a beautiful movie and a pleasure to watch, but the message is just far too obvious. ""Everything is connected!"", is hardly a revelation to me. If it is a new realization to you, I just wonder what rock you were hiding under prior to this movie. I only hoped that the profundity of this reality might have been better captured."

","Cloud Atlas is a movie that has five stories running concurrently! The movie I believe is based on the space time continuum where past, present and future are all running concurrently in different dimensions. The movie tries to explain that we all are interconnected in the universe; where good deeds have a ripple effect! The characters face struggle and opposition in the battle between good and evil. Cloud Atlas explains the same story/themes over five different time periods to show a natural progression in the cycle of the universe. Cloud Atlas bounces back and forth through which could be hard to follow for some viewers, and the five stories makes for a long movie. I believe the way Cloud Atlas was directed and acted allowed the movie makers to pull it off as a big story which is hard to do."

","Let me get this straight, I don't believe this movie could be rated more than 1. The high ratings were probably related to the scenery instead of the storyline.<br/><br/>The story is totally schizophrenic. It has no head no tail and mixed in a messy way that makes no sense. I could write a thousand of stories like that just by mixing pages of a thousand books. That was what the author seemed to do by mixing 6 different short stories. The most hilarious is there is someone who is willing to spend $100 M to produce a movie out of that non-sense. It might be possible that these $100M include the wasted time of the unfortunate viewers.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: before you think that I am a dumb addict of brainless action movies. Nope. I am able to understand quite many tough scientific concepts. And yet I have no idea what this movie is about.

","I think you had three people who went to this movie. The people who really like it, consider it a work of art. A movie that highlights a novel excellently. <br/><br/>Then you have people who came to this movie, really enjoyed the effects, the scenery, and props. Would probably rate this movie between a 5-7. There was nothing here they thought was done absolutely horribly and based on things done in this movie, would call this a very unique movie.<br/><br/>Then you have the negative Nancy's. This is where I come in. I will say, that the actors they put in the movie have done good previous works. The special effects were good. The way they jumped between stories was a very unique technique, and one I would have really supported had I enjoyed the overall theme of the movie and plot. However, the plot was not done so well. An intelligent person who went to this movie knowing what actors were in it, would have known right away that this movie's main intent was to push a liberal message. I hate politics in movies! What the heck? I want to watch my movies and sports without actors or sport stars trying to push a liberal theme to its audience. It was a 3 hour message, involving Atheism, and depicting the Corporations and Energy Companies as mean inhuman threats to society. I am writing this review contrary to the opposite of my title. <br/><br/>Because of the Liberal Message being forced through the movie I think that many of the smaller stories were mutilated. The story about the two homosexuals for example, was completely buried by the overall themes of this movie. That story in itself could have provided a wonderful movie. The Armagedon scenario was also another interesting story.<br/><br/>The acting by the way... even though they had wonderful actors... absolutely dreadful. What the heck is up with the fake accents? Any emotional attempts in the stories were absolutely unconvincing. The only convincing love story, or story of sorrow was the story of the two gay men. <br/><br/>Why the need for the same actors? Were they trying to save money? The actors were clearly not the only indication for the reincarnation theme. As sometimes the birth mark was the indication. Some really stupid attempts at trying to pass this off between the stories was trying to make the white actors look Asian. That was completely racist and horrible. It was like the old movie planet of the apes. They didn't even look Asian? They just looked like mutated freaks with shave eye brows. Then they also attempted to make the Asian girl a white girl. <br/><br/>I would also say, that any average review of this movie should be highlighted as people trying to say there were many great things in the movie THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. But guess what.... they weren't. And they should rate the movie the correct way. Would you buy this movie for twenty bucks and put it in your DVD collection as one of your favorites? Hell no. I'll save a long movie like that for Lord of the Rings."

One hot mess of an epic adaptation of David Mitchell's novel by the Wachowskis (Lana and Andy) with Tom Tykwer - who took turns directing - involving a meta-verse of six plots interweaved in flashback/forward of how one generation inspires another and vice versea with themes of revolution, self-discovery, racism, ageism, conspiracies, class struggles, science fiction hybrid with fantasy tone poem - phew- among others with its principals doing triple (and more) duties/roles with questionable results (largely the uneven make-up - one rotting nose prosthesis is plenty if you ask me for Hanks!) and a lot of precious, preachy sociopolitical ramifications throughout. While there is a lot of visual effects of jaw-dropping beauty and CGI spotty here and there the end result is a lot of endurance (easily could've dropped 20 minutes somewhere!) and tolerance but oddly enough picks up steam 3/4 thru involving the viewer for its trippy , time-skipping, globe trotting and interlinking crazy quilt of filmmaking the likes of which haven't been seen in quite some time."

","One of my simple pleasures in life is to see highly rated, under-advertised films. So as you may expect, when I looked up 'Cloud Atlas' on IMDb, I was thrilled and planned my show time that night.<br/><br/>An 8.3 on IMDb in my mind is a guaranteed win! BUT after this experience I want to know who I pis$ed off on this database to be conned into such a mind numbing experience.<br/><br/>The film starts out slow and ends slow. The 30 second spurts of action are nothing more than teasers...no the film is not going to actually get better. A countless number of times through, calming music played while browsing through the lives of the characters tricking me into it finally being over. However, it would just continue between characters that lead barely exciting lives and are dragging mine down with them. I found myself wishing characters would die in hopes it will speed up the torture I was sitting through. This is a movie where a nuclear reactor could explode killing off every character and I would not walk away questioning it or even being upset.<br/><br/>It was almost as if the directors wanted this movie to be a bit of everything and in returned got a train wreck. Action, horror, pornography, mystical, comical, pick one and stick to it next time because this is an epic #fail.<br/><br/>Unless you are somehow enamored with the novels this is based off of, I would not see this movie. It is not magical like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. It is not mind blowing like Inception. The ancient characters can not compare to Apocolypto. It's no comedy and unless you're into soft core Asian porn I would just back away from the 'Cloud Atlas' tickets and rethink the next three hours of your life."

","What a supreme mess this film is. It has to go through time constantly and change peoples facial/racial characteristics and personalities at the same time. It tries to present some sort of cohesive plot and it never works. (Tom Hanks might think he is a modern day Alec Guinness, yet he is certainly not. Some of his characters are surely for comedy purposes only along with his attempts at accents and compatible wigs.) Moreover, the decision to go with some sort of pigeon English for part of the film was surely a mistake too, as it became laughably inane. as well as irritating.
You have to say it was far too ambitious in it's attempts to go through time and persuade us we are all having a hell of a time in other epochs. Everyone became a Muppet-Puppet of their other selves and had a miserable time of it for three hours.
It is a pity so much time and money was spent on trying to tie an number of wholly different histories together, which if taken individually were unremarkable anyway. (The Book might have succeeded in suspending our imagination in a more complete way)"

"shiningmagos","3","4","8","14 June 2013"," This movie demands your complete attention
","Three hours of my life, which I'll never get back.<br/><br/>This movie, which attempts to be a sprawling epic, demands your rapt attention at all times, if you hope to have the faintest clue as to what's going on. It casually jumps from story to story, and depends heavily on the character's narrations, whose shallow philosophical monologues apply to multiple time periods (in case you weren't confused enough). Those same monologues may at any time be other characters reading stories from the past. I wish I could say that the filmmakers managed to generate empathy at any point during the film, but I could not find myself giving any love to these flat and uninteresting characters. The pace flips between molasses slow and murder spree, with little to no buildup of tension.<br/><br/>Even people who gave this a high review admit there were times in the movie they felt completely lost. It's not you, guys. It's the movie. There's no centering narrative in this careless jumble of unbelievable accents and even less believable makeup. It drags on and on, and I found myself torn between wanting to know how the various threads ended and just wanting the movie to be over. I'm sure the book flows better, making the connections between these stories more obvious, but the movie does a terrible job of juggling six narratives. Add to that these thick, annoyingly fake accents and ""creative"" grammar, and you have a recipe for frequent cases of ""What the hell did he just say?"" That's not going to win you any points in a story that's hard enough to follow already.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews here remind me as a cluster of art critics huddling around an uninspired work of modern art, yammering on and on about how a set of colored rectangles holds such deep emotional implications. Maybe they're right, and I'm just not seeing the feeling of the rectangles, but I found this movie to be painfully dull and pretentious."

I may give it another try in a year but I have say tonight has been a painful evening and movie failure. I would have ended my review here if it wasn't for the IMDb 10 line rule. So here goes. The film has a plethora of great actors and some of the great cinematography which I have seen. However the inability to keep the audience focused on the plot is the main reason I felt compelled to write this review. Spending money on technology and actors is a far cry from actually making a great movie. Don't waste you time. Go for a walk or enjoy the sunset a much better way to spend your time."

","The last time I was this shaken and moved by a movie was in 1979 when ""Apocalypse Now"" was released. I came away from ""Apocalypse Now"" stunned at seeing something I never expected, with depth of story and character development. And now again, 34 years later, ""Cloud Atlas"" takes your breath and mind away, how the heck did they do that??<br/><br/>This movie has accomplished something that I didn't expect...it was far superior to the book (a very hard novel to read) and Hollywood has accomplished something I never expected, to make a movie that goes beyond entertainment. It makes you think, it makes you cry, it makes you laugh and it fills you with wonder, wondering how in the heck each individual storyline relates. And it ties it all up with hope for humanity and love in the most unexpected ways and events.<br/><br/>I loved the birthmark ""comet"" and how Halle Berry said she has felt this way before. This is what a person should expect from a movie, brain food, not the usual junk that comes out of Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's thrilled and made us think when The Matrix was released...a new/creative idea that made you think twice about it. And now they've done it again courtesy of David Mitchell's novel.<br/><br/>And of course the actors themselves, a tour de force and the makeup which should get an Oscar! The ending was more spectacular than that in the novel and it truly wrapped up the story lines even better than the novel did.<br/><br/>I felt I had watched a 90 minute movie, it went by so fast yet it was double that time. I can see how it could be confusing to some as in parts it switches from story to story rapidly but you just have to sit back and let it soak into your mind and try not to reason it out, just watch and listen and most importantly, feel it.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay at the end and watch the credits, they will show you who each actor's characters were...and notice even the name fonts change in a sort of way that perhaps matches the era that the character was in,very cool.<br/><br/>I hope this movies recoups its cost of production and I am sure it will be highly regarded in the long run. I can't wait for the Bluray edition to come out!<br/><br/>Watch it and be moved, Hollywood has created an event that is remarkable in so many ways."

Basically, a mess with a banal message that is rendered in an overly declarative fashion. <br/><br/>If one is to enjoy this movie, my advice would be to watch it without trying to connect the dots. Because the connections are emotional, not rational. With its length, with the challenge of following the numerous segments of the mosaic, and the mental energy it takes to constantly see the same actors in different roles, the film can be tiring enough even without attempting to decipher the relationships between the characters. Giving up such an attempt would help you in the enjoyment of this film because after all it is not a badly made film. Just too much of everything. An example of over-zealousness that unfortunately did away with any spontaneity in making and watching this movie."

","Never while watching a film, have I been so utterly perplexed. Even as the credits began to roll, my jaw was dropped, my eyes glued to the screen. What had I just witnessed? At that point, I wasn't sure, but I knew it was something glorious. And I knew I had missed a lot. After a second viewing, I was perhaps not so perplexed as I was the first time, but I was still dazzled by the effect of this colossal masterpiece. Is it the best film of the year? That, for now, I cannot answer, but it is certainly the most ambitious, the most expansive, and most breath taking. Peter Jackson, who is one of my favorite filmmakers able to make films so epic, they stop your heart for just a moment, is releasing the first installment of his Hobbit trilogy this December. Not that it won't be a good film, because it will be, but The Hobbit will float past you like the tiniest gust of wind after watching Cloud Atlas. <br/><br/>When reviewing the film, many critics said the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer were on a suicide mission even attempting to adapt such a novel as Cloud Atlas. They said the book was unaddaptable. I disagree. No piece of literature is unaddaptable, but some are harder than others. If you ask me, the filmmakers behind Cloud Atlas are brave and ambitious for doing what they did. Along the way, yes, there were a few errors and some small parts that could've been better, but do those things really even matter at this point? The fact that this movie was even made is a miracle. No filmmaker has done something this gutsy since David Lean directed Lawrence of Arabia back in 1962.<br/><br/>Most of the actors present in Cloud Atlas play nearly six parts, and are transformed through flawless make-up work, into people so different, we cannot even recognize who is who. The cast must take on different dialects, different tones, and even different personalities to make the film successful. It is particularly peculiar the way the cast fumbles through their narratives, as if they are trying to figure out what is happening just as much as you are. The film will puzzle you, it will intrigue you, and then it will floor you with its grand finale. <br/><br/>Honestly, I can't begin to think of a way this movie could've been panned by any critic. But sadly it was, one these panners being Kyle Smith, the man who enjoyed Jonah Hex. Based on its ambition alone, even if it didn't all work out in the end, and it does, I would have given this film at lest three stars. Maybe even two and a half if it totally flopped at the end, but it doesn't. The ending is glorious, pure cinematic joy. Cloud Atlas is an event that demands to be witnessed. Go and see it. It'll blow your mind."

","The concept of Cloud Atlas is a special one. When I read that this movie would be 6 stories mixed into one movie I thought about movies such as Pulp Fiction and Inception. Pulp Fiction being a movie where different stories collide and Inception being a movie where events occurring in one stage have an effect on other stages, like Cloud Atlas. I love Inception and Pulp Fiction for these concepts so I was keen to see what Cloud Atlas would bring.<br/><br/>6 story lines in one movie seemed very confusing and I was worried that the movie might be very hard to follow. These worries seemed unfit. I never got confused during this almost 3-hour running movie. Instead I was amazed at how well all the stories are displayed. There is no superior story or story that's let down by focusing too much on another which is remarkable and a admirable achievement by the directors.<br/><br/>I knew I had to see this movie when I saw the directors and the cast.I loved the Matrix Trilogy and V for Vendetta from the Wachowski siblings and Run Lola Run from Tom Tykwer so I was anxious to see this movie. My favorite actor is Tom Hanks so naturally I was happy to see a new movie with him. What I found admirable is his use of different accents in this movie. Next to strong acting his voice is very powerful and diverse in this movie. I have seen Jim Sturgess in the movie ""21"", a movie in which I found his acting quite strong. I was curious to see what he would bring this time. He didn't let me down, he put down a few very good role. I liked Ben Whishaw in Skyfall and was surprised to see him in another movie already. Although I liked him in Skyfall I wasn't sure he would be able to complete a task as big as this one, but he managed to stand his ground and put down multiple strong characters. I have always liked Hugo Weaving and I loved his roles in this movie. It was hilarious to see him as Nurse Noakes, fun to see him as Bill Smoke, which made me think about his role in The Matrix Trilogy and I thought he did a splendid job at performing Old Georgie. Jim Broadbents roles were very good too, I especially liked his portrayal of Timothy Cavendish. In the movies I have seen with Halle Berry and Keith David I thought they were okay, but not outstanding. They have proved to be worthy actors to me now with strong acting in this movie. Halle Berry for her portrayals of Luisa Rey and Meronym and Keith David for Joe Napier. I had not seen Donna Bae in any movie before but I think she did a very good job in this movie playing Sonmi-451.<br/><br/>The landscapes and sets are beautiful. When you see the voyage of Mr. Ewing the grand ship makes it very realistic and interesting and during the scenes in the Valley with Tom Hanks the forests and mountains are magnificent.<br/><br/>This movie looks very realistic. The ships from the future civilizations look very nice and the make-up work on certain characters is beautifully done, it was so good that only during the credits I realized by which actors some characters were played, which gave me a pleasant surprise. Everything used in this movie to make people look more fitting for their era sometimes makes them look very different and along with that more entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall I would say the concept is revolutionary and fascinating, the acting is fantastic (kudos to the casting team) and the quality is extremely high. Definitely a recommendation, it's something special that has never been seen before."

I have seen what I consider to be the very best and worst of all cinematic history and, having just witnessed this film, have decided to leave my very first review ever.<br/><br/>This movie is, as my title states, not merely a film, but an enthralling EXPERIENCE which transcends and encompasses all genres, beliefs and boundaries. It is truly a 'once in a generation' creation, akin to films such as Blade Runner, The Godfather and Citizen Kane in it's EPIC and definitive magnitude! The scripting, performances and storyline throughout are of such quality that it comes-across like one enormous sonnet or poem without a second of cliché or unimportance. Furthermore, though a little confusing to begin with, the juxtaposition and intertwinement of the various plot-lines, messages, cinematography and time-lines is sublime and almost revolutionary in its scope. To add to this, the 'special effects', makeup and musical score are just as exceptional and serve to only deepen and bolster my positive feelings toward it.<br/><br/>In short, I believe this to be one of the best, if not THE best, film of its kind (though no other films are really similar) ever created, and not a single person with even an inkling of enjoyment for movies should miss this! I intend to watch this film many more times and will keep the Blu-Ray on my shelves forever, once it is released.

Each plot progresses slowly at first, then goes back and forth seamlessly between each character.<br/><br/>The underlying themes of truth and freedom are played out in a plethora of bold and visceral human nature sprinkled with some humor, action, and adventure.<br/><br/>I never believed in reincarnation but this movie really puts it into perspective of how it could be. For as one dies, a door opens.<br/><br/>From a production perspective the cast put on an excellent performance between a notary, bisexual composer, journalist, publisher, clone, and tribesman as the leading roles and even a lot of the supporting ones as well. The pacing was spot on, and the make up was superior that many familiar faces were unrecognizable or done up extremely well respective to the time period.<br/><br/>In essence, Cloud Atlas is a film worth viewing a few times as it may be a lot to take in on one sitting. Be warned as it has earned its solid R rating. Even so, everything is presented in good taste and good timing from a little nudity, sexual situations, and some graphic violence at times.<br/><br/>As a fellow filmmaker and human being, Cloud Atlas gives me great inspiration and if you know nothing else about this film before viewing, you're in for a treat."

","Reviewed by Mitchell Rhodes Non-Spoiler, Spoiler Alert Cloud Atlas makes spoiler alerts redundant. There is nothing that I, or anyone else for that matter, can write to spoil the plot. Does God or karmic flow have a plot? You don't watch Cloud Atlas, as much as you witness it. So the more you assume the role of a non-judgmental god or perhaps karmic flow itself, the better this film will play. Getting quickly to a place where temporal composition holds little meaning and where and all phenomena can be view as one thing, the better.<br/><br/>It may take ten, or so, minutes to adjust to the unusual structure, genres changes and spiritual dialectic of the film. At least it did for me. There are quick edits between six different story lines, each with it's own genre that occur in different timelines. The genres and timelines line up like this: historical narrative (1849), romance (1936), mystery/action (1973), comedy (2012), sci-fi thriller (2144) and post-apocalyptic (2321-2346).<br/><br/>If that doesn't cause sufficient confusion, then having the same actors play different characters in each of the story/time lines, while representing the same reincarnated 'soul' character or karmic flow, just might.<br/><br/>Once you've settled into the role of universal witness, the film's other elements will emerge with greater efficacy. And there is a $h*t load of them to try and follow. It's as if the writer and then directors took everything that holds some meaning and controversy and jammed it into the film. Does this make the film too ambitious? As god-witnesses, no, as human beings, sitting in a theatre munching on popcorn and sipping sugary drinks, perhaps.<br/><br/>Admittedly there are at least a dozen ways to slice this film into themed categories. If forced to do so, I'd unpack the film this way: spiritual/philosophical, contemporary, reflective. And yet, no matter which way the film is broadly analyzed there is a plethora of specific elements that emerge. And with only one screening under my belt, I'm confident I've missed most of them. No doubt there are many others waiting to be discovered upon subsequent screenings.<br/><br/>Spiritual/Philosophical Elements Concepts from the ""Tibetan Book of the Living and Dying"" play strong throughout this film. The character, Somni-451, says, ""As one door closes another one opens."" This is true not only in life, but also in death. If you don't recognize certain truths as an opportunity for change and progress you are relegated to repeat the same mistakes (as certain 'soul' characters do over and over).<br/><br/>If Universalism exists at all, it exists within the context of love and justice. This axiom runs as an undercurrent throughout the film. <br/><br/>Allain Badou, the French contemporary philosopher, puts forth the idea of an Event—a breakthrough or rupture in the phenomenal realm. Events that are strong enough in both cause and effect sow the seeds for revolution. We witness such an Event in the Korean story/time line set in 2144.<br/><br/>""Your life is not your own, your life belongs to others."" This line from the film puts forward the Lacanian psychoanalytic concept of the big Other and the role that language has in creating the symbolic order. In the story/time line set far in the future—language has transformed into some hybrid. It's difficult for English speaking viewers to fully understand the dialogue in this sequence. And that's the point here—to reveal and experience the role that linguistics plays on our relationship to the symbolic order. Especially in our understanding of how it's only possible to develop meaning in relationship with others.<br/><br/>The words of American theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, might be used to sum up the entire spiritual/philosophical elements of the film: ""Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing true or beautiful makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone, therefore we are saved by love."" Amen.<br/><br/>Contemporary Elements Issues such as ethics, the stranglehold that Big Oil has on society, the consequences of greed and consumerism in the context of unfettered capitalism and the dangers associated with cloning and by extension GMO foods will be easily recognizable, in the film, by anyone who pays even the slightest bit of attention to current events.<br/><br/>In the 1973 the story/time line, we discover that a nuclear disaster was covertly perpetrated by the oil industry. Done so in order to create fear, toward nuclear power, among the citizens of the world and keep them committed and dependent on fossil fuels for meeting their energy needs. Might this be a not-so-hidden reference to Fukushima? Reflective Elements Cloud Atlas engulfs us in benefits of spirituality while explicitly presenting the dangers of our capitalistic dogma—presenting quite clearly what might unfold, in the future, by holding such values. And yet, each of us paid over $12 to see the film while the studio, producers, writer, and directors all desire for the film to make tens, if of not hundreds, of millions of dollars in profit.<br/><br/>On a Meta level, what message do we inherently take up from this? Capitalism's pervasiveness and its resiliency to bring everything into its fold—spirituality, revolution, war, peace, hate, love? After all, there are profits to be made in each one of those things."

To do this, and entertain the audience, is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Although the movie ends up biting more than it can chew (referring to the novel), I'm glad it was made to interest people in the novel, and the central idea of the story itself: a very powerful examination of the meaning of our lives.<br/><br/>I think any movie that attempts to put out a revolutionary look at life cannot be pretentious, but courageous.<br/><br/>p.s.

","Lana, David and Tom did a wonderfully masterful job collaborating on this effort,which they all must consider the most important work that they have achieved so far and may have resonance on the global zeitgeist. The karmic theme with the nuance of a Bodhisattva(remember Buddha was originally a Hindu too)is appreciated, such as in the form of Sunmi 451, but in an understated way that actually helps to further the argument with touching poignancy. This quixotic collage of stories between 19th and 24th centuries all serve to further the argument that we just might deserve to have arrived beyond our solar system with our good human stuff intact a few of my old head hunter colleagues included). We perhaps collectively forget how much we have sacrificed to arrive where we are today or in the future worlds of Sunmi 451 and beyond. For future Bodhisattvas of our collective imagination, let us not ignore the ""tru-tru"" (reminds me of Talk Pigeon in Papua New Guinea) in front of our noses, lest we be compelled to repeat the fallacies of dystopian futures hopefully less traveled. The overarching message: let us all learn to love one another as we explore and ultimately understand the universe together irrespective of person, place or time."
"trevor-mcinsley","1","6","14","20 December 2013"," A Horrifically Convoluted Film
","It is never a good sign when you get eighty minutes into a film and genuinely sigh when you realise that is just the halfway point. I forced myself to carry on but it just doesn't get better. The stories don't build up to anything and don't go anywhere. There is scarcely any underlying plot. What few 'revelations' there are were obvious all along and usually just nicked right out of better stories. I can only assume the 'Soylent Green' line in the nursing home plot was put in as a joke when they realised the entire plot of the future story was just a rip off of it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem? The cast. Even in regular films where each actor plays just one role I often have a hard time telling faces apart. If the two lead male roles look remotely alike for instance I will sometimes not be sure who is the good guy and who is the bad guy between scenes.<br/><br/>This film is nightmarish for me. Every actor plays a half dozen roles employing a large array of absolutely absurd looking make up and incomprehensible accents. I feel I'd have grasped the point of the film far better if I could have understood even half of what the future tribe people were on about. The combination of a deep south accent, dyslexic speech patterns and made up words rendered the vast majority of it entirely pointless. Firefly did good futuristic style rural slang... it painted a beautiful picture of society whilst the meaning was still generally clear. This film might as well just be in bloody German.<br/><br/>As best as I could tell in this convoluted mess... the notion is that all the characters have lived past and future lives and that these are all somehow interconnected. This however does not explain why Hugo Weaving goes from being an old man to an unconvincing woman to a green demon man to some kind of giant bipedal fish. Honestly the make up and prosthetics employed to try and make him look vaguely Asian are just plain offensive. It's not even clear why he was in that particular role... all it did was make the scene ridiculous. Likewise with the future character of the lawyer/pianist. He ends up looking more like a vampire from Buffy than an Asian man.<br/><br/>The result is that the vast majority of the characters don't even look human. Virtually every scene has someone made up to look old and it never looks convincing. I'm fairly sure one of the characters changes from a black woman to a white woman too. Any serious plot is utterly lost behind these comic book like facades. Honestly would have been more engaging if the characters were just giant bipedal fish men...<br/><br/>I'm sure at least half the roles Tom Hanks appears in throughout this film serve absolutely no function either. The plot would not have been affected by casting an extra in the role instead. As a result whatever interconnectedness the plot is trying to get towards gets lost by characters which just don't need to be in the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is just a few very short stories without enough backbone to stand up on their own so they decided to weave them all together under a web of absolute nonsense. Absolute nonsense in which Hugo Weaving has a tendency to look like a fish monster.<br/><br/>Save the two and a half hours of your time. Get one of those kid's activity books with the mazes in it instead. That's a far less tangled mess."
"pagan1-2","3","6","14","21 November 2012"," Cloud Atlas - Nothing is connected
","I decided to write this review as an advice to everybody: Don't go to this movie with too high expectations! After hearing about a Tykwer/Wachowski movie, based on a bestseller, reading some favorable reviews and seeing a IMDb score of 8.2 i was really excited to see this movie. As the directors are known for radical story twists, i interpreted far too much into the tagline ""Everything is connected"". So i sat in the theater for almost three hours, expecting a sci-fi/magic like interaction between the 6 segments, only to be finally disappointed. This totally ruined the movie for me!<br/><br/>Now to the movie itself: The concept of reincarnation/archetypes isn't explored at all and, for me, also didn't seem to matter for storytelling. I just perceived it as ""actor recycling"". I also found it very boring that the underlying messages of all 6 time levels where the same generic commonplace values: ""Slavery/oppression is bad"", ""Boundaries can be overcome"", ""Your actions dictate your future"" (Seriously!), ... I didn't expect an epiphany, but for me there was nothing even remotely thought provoking.<br/><br/>The acting (in particular Halle Berry) was compelling and generally good, while i found the direction to be too fast paced for this kind of movie. The soundtrack was nice, bur nothing special. I liked the Cloud Atlas Symphony theme and it should have been more prominently integrated into the main score.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell, i found the movie to be more bland and pseudointellectual than ambitious and it failed to involve me at all.<br/><br/>On a side note: In the German dub i watched, the ""post apocalyptic future language"" sounded a lot like Jar Jar Binks babble, which was seriously distracting and hurting the seriousness of the movie."
"jdkraus","7","6","14","26 October 2012"," A feast for the eyes that did not fulfill my appetite
","There have been many movies that pushed the envelope in storytelling. ""The Fountain"" gave us a love story that takes place over a 1,000 year period. ""Babel"" juggles four plots that happen over 3 continents. The only thing these 2 films have in common is that they revoke the typical, chronological order of storytelling. ""Cloud Atlas"" takes these concepts further by giving us six stories that occur over many years between them—an 1849 diary of an ocean voyage, letters from a young, naive composer to his friend, a thriller about a nuclear power plant's dark secrets, a farce about a publisher in a nursing home, a clone that takes part in a rebellion during futuristic Korea, and the tale of a tribe living in post-apocalyptic earth in the far away future. Every single genre you can imagine is crammed into this three-hour movie. There is humor, action, drama, mystery, suspense, fantasy, romance, and science fiction. <br/><br/>This movie is certainly unique with the wonderful production values of a big budget Hollywood picture. It does not fail with its stunning cinematography and visual effects, exquisite set pieces and costumes, close to spot on make up design, a marvelous musical score, and an all-star cast that includes: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Doona Bae, and many others. Interestingly enough, each of these actors play a character in each of the different story segments of the movie. <br/><br/>For me, it is a film that is hard not to like, for I am drawn to all its talents, yet I cannot consider it as revolutionary or even a masterpiece. The non-linear story structure was not the problem. If anything, it helps the film's pace. It's the fact that there are so many plots and there is no solid conclusion to draw all of them together. Some of these stories clearly relate to one another while others seem to be a fluke to the overall movie. The best that I can assume in my viewing is that since each actor is in each subplot, it is a human evolution or reincarnation of the same person, either succeeding or failing in their individual story. This is a novel idea, but (a) it becomes humorous to see actors play different races with incredulous accents (it's particularly bad with Hugo Weaving as a Korean and Doona Bae as a red-haired Caucasian) and (b) it makes the overall film nothing more than a pretentious, unresolved mess. <br/><br/>I am aware that this movie is based off of the book and I have not read it, so I cannot make a comparison. But from experience in reading books that have been adapted into movies, it is more enjoyable to read a 500-page book with 6 or more plot devices than viewing a three-hour film trying to do justice to such a novel. If this movie were even 4 hours long, I think it still would not be any better. It would have been more of a success if each segment were turned into a separate flick rather than trying to throw all of them together as a whole. <br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" is not for everyone. The story structure and lack of resolution may put people off, as could the gratuitous sex and violence. It was a feast for my eyes, but it did not totally satisfy my appetite."

","Cloud Atlas is like one of those ""know it all's"" we all put up with, who beats you over the head with the most intimate knowledge of the most arcane subjects. Roughly 5 or 6 story lines are running in this movie that appear in different times, different characters (but the same actors in different makeup, etc) and different unrelated plots. I got a headache trying to figure out how to tie this mess together. If they would have just did an entire movie about the Tech Seoul story plot the movie would have been a great science fiction movie. I've come to appreciate the fact that strange titles make for ugly movies. The producers, writers, directors etc seem to delight in making idiots out of the viewers of this film. In fact, what the writers, producers etc have accomplished is to put together an incoherent, pretentious two hour long piece of claptrap. I do not recommend seeing this movie. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I'm a big believer in movie makers taking thought out risks in producing films for the sake of advancing the art. This movie apparently was produced to shame the critics into calling Cloud Atlas a masterpiece because deep down the critics, like everyone else, don't have a clue what this movie is about, if indeed it was about anything."
"sandratry","4","5","11","14 April 2013"," Way to long and difficult to follow.
","This is a three hour long movie and for such a long movie it had better be good. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>It probably took me about an hour just to understand what was happening in the movie. In the movie we follow the stories of different people in different time eras. We get to see only a few minutes of each story at a time before it switches to another so it's very difficult to follow the storyline in each story. The stories also belong to very different genres, for example the story about the old man is a pure comedy and suddenly the movie switches another story where someone is being brutally killed. It makes it hard to sustain the interest for each story because you're busy trying to switch between your feelings (laughing, being excited, being shocked, etc.) and remembering what happened in the last scene of each story.<br/><br/>In the end I was able to start seeing a connection between most of the stories and once you start to understand what is going on it gets better. The idea behind the story (or stories) is good but the movie is both too long and doesn't do the idea justice. I guess I'll have to read the book to see if it's not better.<br/><br/>The only good thing I can say about Cloud Atlas is that it has beautiful colors and visual scenes, and that the story gets better towards the end."

","This ambitious film is based off of David Michelle's best-selling novel. I cannot compare the two because I have not read the book, but from what readers of the book claim, it is really awesome. Cloud Atlas has almost every genre imaginable in it with action, adventure, mystery, romance, drama, and science fiction all incorporated. Cloud Atlas also has an amazing cast, three directors, Oscar worthy special effects, and a story like no other. I would need three more pages to explain what the movie is about, so here's what it is essentially about. Taking place in five different periods, various actors play multiple characters (one from each period) and each characters life impacts that of another character in the past, present, and or future. All of these characters act of impact trigger some sort of rebellion whether it's big or small. This sounds like it would be a lot coming at you at once, but for a 2 hour and 45 minute film it is somewhat tame. The only parts of complication are the switches from one time period to the next. However, this is necessary for the film as a whole. It is a little confusing for one minute focusing on a dying lawyer writing in his diary in 1849 and the next being in the 1970's. This is what makes the movie interesting though! The music is terrific and actor Tom Hanks and actress Halle Berry are as good as ever. This is without a doubt the most ambitious movie of the year. Cloud Atlas's ending left me speechless for a good two hours and is definitely a top 10 movie of the year."

Add the extra minutes and the film becomes groan inducing (I actually heard a few groans from my cinema seat). One might think that with so much time that CLOUD ATLAS could convey its message subtly, with events and indirect dialog. No chance. We get many instances in which characters ""preach"" the message of the film as if to say, ""Hey, let's take a time out so we can explain what this film is about."" My bad.

","We're all connected. It's either as a species, as part of a communal society, or as individuals living within universal maxims of love, fear, happiness, and struggle. Over time, over place, we still maintain a link, locked in to our shared humanity, no matter the situations or circumstances. Though it has much more to say about this subject than a few introductory sentences can proffer, this is the main theme of the brilliant and bold cinematic statement from Lana and Andy Wachowski (The Matrix) and collaborator Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), Cloud Atlas. Unfairly dismissed when it was released, this artistic revelation reminds us that, though years and backdrops may divide us, a commonality of purpose and perseverance endures.<br/><br/>Interweaving six stories across eons and realities, we start with an old man (Tom Hanks) telling a story by a fireside. In 1850, a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) sails the Pacific and befriends a slave (David Gyasi) preyed upon by an unethical doctor (Hanks again). Then we move to England in 1931 and a composer (Ben Whishaw) trying to balance his love of a young physicist (James D'Arcy) and the demands of working as the assistant of an aging maestro (Jim Broadbent). In the '70s, a journalist named Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) uses the musician's story as inspiration in her attempt to uncover the truth about a possible problem at a nuclear reactor run by a shady businessman (Hugh Grant). Her friendship with a mystery-loving teen (Brody Nicolas Lee) leads to the story of a publisher (Broadbent) who, after angering a gangster client, ends up in a nursing home against his will.<br/><br/>A movie made of his comic story becomes the Bible for a genetically engineering servant girl (Doona Bae) in a future Seoul fast food conglomerate. With the help of an anti-government rebel (Sturgess), she becomes an effective propaganda tool. Her thoughtful and profound words of resistance become the basis for a religion in a far off distant future where the planet has been destroyed by radiation. Living like savages, a father (Hanks) tries to protect his family from cannibals while helping one of the last members of a technologically advanced race (Berry) contact possible help off on another world.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas was the best film of 2012. It was and remains a misunderstood masterpiece that, in time, will be turned into the cinematic classic its ambitions aimed for. Working together, the Wachowskis and Tykwer have taken the complicated novel by David Mitchell and fashioned it into a genre-crossing complication of individual movie archetypes (the period piece, the future shock, the '70s activist, the '80s British comedy of manners) that meld together to form one emotional and entertainment epiphany after the other. The result is a remarkable, complicated experience. On the one hand you marvel at the meticulous moviemaking acumen at play. On the other, you're stunned by how prescient it ends up being.<br/><br/>This is an unbridled success, a spectacular expression of the spirit of mankind synthesized into a storyline that ties seemingly divergent elements together in graceful, elegant ways. Music makes Berry's character continue her probe of Grant, while a clone's cobbled-together memories of a bawdy publisher's problems become the foundation for a far off distant faith. Elements in the past play heavily in arenas in the present, while small asides add up to big payoffs in the end. This is what film as an artform is about - the transportation of the audience to somewhere they've never been, to see things they never would normally experience. While it doesn't always work flawlessly, it does consistently amaze, turning the title into a map of everyone's interwoven experiences. It's a true gem."

I do realise that this means that those who haven't read the book will have a hard time understanding what is being presented, but I do hope to make the viewers try.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has taken 6 very different stories, very different settings and themes and yet managed to weave a fantastical tale that has a deeper and more layered agenda. Sure, it is long, but don't good things come to those that wait? <br/><br/>As the audience, I had my favourite segments and not so favourite segments. My favourite even while reading the book was Robert Frobisher. The adaptation of his part was brought to life by almost perfection by Ben Wisham. <br/><br/>One part that took me completely and pleasantly by surprise: the enacting of Old Georgie. A standing ovation to Hugo Weaving, the costume designer and the make up artist for bringing a concept like Georgie to the screen. Everything from the top hat to the nails, just well done. <br/><br/>The movie certainly takes a few liberties but never have I seen a movie so painstakingly adapted (franchises not counting). The make up?! The setting?! One of the liberties hugely taken or maybe I myself never picked up on it was having actors from each segment play a different role in another segment. It was certainly not hinted at in the book except for the main character. This one left me pondering and I think it was a mistake as how can one be evil in one life but good in another? Overlooking this one fact, loved the movie in all its entirety."
"adam111111","9","2","3","26 June 2017"," An ambitious film that reaches and mostly succeeds.
","It's hard to imagine a more difficult movie to make than one that spans centuries, races, and the very limits of human consciousness. However, Cloud Atlas is a phenomenal success. Despite its length (or maybe because of it), it manages to weave a number of very different stories into a single, spell-binding story of humanity itself. It is hilarious and terrifying, inspiring and profoundly horrifying. The music adds to the atmosphere too.<br/><br/>Some of the movie's ideas like the language spoken in the post- apocalyptic scenes, some of the makeup choices, and the quantum mumbo jumbo were perhaps not as good an idea as others though. It fits many of the not-so-nice clichés of the post-apocalyptic genre as well.<br/><br/>I have been a big fan of similar Wachowski projects like Sense8, and Cloud Atlas is similar in theme and tone. My main source of frustration about this movie is the fact that I waited five years to see it!<br/><br/>(I saw this on June 26, 2017)"

"cinswan","10","2","3","29 August 2016"," A Challenging Movie to Watch -- and I'm Going to Put it in My Library for Reference
","I gave this the highest rating for a reason. This is a film that is a reference for any actor, director, or writer (which I am) especially of speculative fiction. As someone writing in speculative fiction who has had recall of other lifetimes since 1986, this movie make so much sense to me. Is it hard to follow? Yes. Bear with it.<br/><br/>This may be one of the most difficult movies to watch you've ever encountered. If you're a writer, an actor, a director...and like me, also a person who remembers other lifetimes, this is a must see. You may not be able to watch it in one sitting. It's that complex.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, and that's a big reason to watch it -- because great actors get to portray multiple characters in a single movie. For all of them, it's a tour de force which they can hold close to their hearts (I hope they do) as a reminder of what exceptional work they can do.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis? I've got no words (and I'm a writer, of sci fi to boot, based on past life recall, so I should have words). What they did, despite the pans, I truly think will stand as a classic (the same happened to Blade Runner).<br/><br/>Who are we and how did we get here? What are we doing, what do we need to do, and why? Most of all, who do we trust? It's the people we love. The people we've always loved. For hundreds if not thousands of years. That's at the bottom of this complex film.<br/><br/>Some reviewers questioned yellow face (by the way, there's an Asian actress in white face) however if you pay attention, the Wachowskis bent over backward to create a sort of continuity of personae through the casting of the multiple characters brought together in different time streams.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks as the storyteller who begins and ends the movie is incredible with his scope of acting through many different characters. Kudos to him, the Wachowskis and all the other actors who came to this game. The film world is richer for it.<br/><br/>Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey e-book series"

","In an era where most films released in the theaters are sequels, remakes, or involve superheros and teenagers, a cosmic epic like ""Cloud Atlas"" is a massive undertaking and a wonderful folly. It's an uneven journey, but also a fascinating, challenging, intelligent, imaginative one. The filmmakers incorporate many different genres (nautical adventure, period drama, spy thriller, comedy, futuristic sci-fi, etc.) and the film is alternately funny, sad, heartwarming, violent and exciting. It's also a triumph of production design and makeup (only a few of the digital special effects look fake), and a great showcase for the versatility of several actors who play multiple characters. *** out of 4."
"muligens","10","2","3","5 July 2016"," What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?
","Rarely do you see a movie that embraces the possibilities of the medium so fully. This story could easily have been told in a much more conventional way but it would certainly have been worse off for it.<br/><br/>The editing, cinematography, set design, score, acting and make-up are all stunning. Even if you have no idea what's going on you just have to sit back, let the beautiful pictures wash over you and try to take it all in. Trusting that it will all make sense in the end. Asking questions along the way is pointless.<br/><br/>And does it all make sense in the end? In a way, yes. Trying to tie up all the loose ends is an exercise in futility. This is a movie about universal themes; love, freedom, greed, control. The details are important in the emotions they evoke but don't try to explain every little thing.<br/><br/>There are many messages you can take away from this film. Which ones will end up resonating more is largely dependent on you as a viewer. To me, the main theme was that even small individual acts can influence large events. If enough of us act in a certain way we can change the future. Even an individual acting alone can have a profound effect if the right action is taken at the right time.<br/><br/>Secondly, I loved the way art was used as a medium to communicate these acts across the different stories. Music, literature, movies and scripture were all used as media to carry one person's actions through to audiences in different times and places. Beautifully and powerfully done.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about the use of re-incarnation in this movie but I think that's almost beside the point. Yes, it's implied but ultimately I don't think it's important for the story. Human beings act out the same mistakes and kindnesses throughout history. History repeats itself. Some people act out of kindness, some out of greed. Some are easily influenced and can have a big effect if swayed one way or the other. Whether these people are re-incarnated souls or new individuals makes little difference. Human nature is what it is and changes slowly if at all.<br/><br/>So what is ultimately the message of Cloud Atlas? Keep fighting the good fight? Perhaps. Perhaps this is at its core nothing more than a retelling of your basic early 80's Spielberg movie. But what a retelling! This is worth seeing for the sheer ambition alone."
"alexecolvin","10","2","3","27 June 2016"," A Masterclass in story telling, art directing, editing, and acting.
","Cloud Atlas is an ambitious work of art unlike anything before it in terms of scope and diversity. Spanning three hundred years and locations around the globe, it weaves a perfect tapestry of interconnected stories that build upon the simple themes of choice and change. This would be impressive enough if Cloud Atlas took a straightforward approach to telling this story and told it in several chronological chunks. But the controversial editing of Cloud Atlas reveals the directors and editors understand the strengths of what film can do best. The edits are linked by one specific thing, focusing on an actor, an action, a point in the story, and the film weaves a web of interconnected moments or ideas that make for a beautiful tapestry of a film that washes over you in a way that takes effort to follow, but never is artless or obscure. The other masterstroke of Cloud Atlas that plays perfectly into filmmaking is the way the production uses its actors. In each story, the same actors are put into different roles, sometimes being heroes, sometimes villains, sometimes main roles and some are mere cameos. But the brilliance behind this is that it keeps the film canny and easy to stay invested in. As the shifts in character are mesmerizing, and the film leads to several 'Aha!' moments when you recognize an actor who has completely transformed from one role to the next. The film is also brilliantly paced. While you may think a three-hour run time is excessive, the strength of having six intertwined stories, is that they can have concurrent climaxes, battle scenes, or escape scenes, leaving you fully invested in stories that constantly thrill and will make you want to re-watch the film again and again to see if you missed anything. A film as brilliant, as complex, and as well-made as Cloud Atlas is a rarity, and it's excellence will need time and a great deal of effort to be surpassed. Is the film flawless? No. There are little nitpicks to the film that can be addressed. The mystery section is perhaps the least interesting and most formulaic, and some of the philosophy of the film around spirituality and love may be wearisome for some people. But you would be hard pressed to find a better cinematic experience than Cloud Atlas, it is quite simply, one of the best films out there."
"filipemanuelneto","8","2","3","28 April 2016"," Mentally provocative, it's one of the most underrated movies I've seen.
","This film addresses a subject rarely addressed in the cinema: how individual actions can, over the time, influence the course of future events. It mixes six different stories passed in the past, present and future. It's directed by Tom Tykwer, who also wrote the script along with Lana and Lilly Wachowski. In his several roles, it includes Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry and Doona Bae, among other artists.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most complex and difficult to follow I've seen in cinema. We need to view it carefully in order to understand it and savor it, and that complexity is a motive why some people will probably dislike it. By mixing six stories situated in six moments in space and time, but united by so subtle connection elements such as a song, a book or a birthmark, this film looks like a tangle of stories without head or tail, but it's not true. That happens because the topic addressed is also complex, so as David Mitchell's novel. The script is flawless, superb and deserves congratulations but the cast deserves even more applause. They literally had to unfold to make this film and none of the main actors made less than three different characters, which is an achievement and a challenge for any actor. And perhaps it was the pleasure of the challenge that led so many big names from Hollywood to risk entering in an openly indie film, far from the financial support of the big corporations of the industry. The technical offices are beyond reproach, thought of every detail and made an exceptional work: the costumes are exquisite and the makeup and visual and special effects are gradually surprising more and more. Reinhold Heil signs the soundtrack, which was also excellent.<br/><br/>There are certain films that, as good as can be, end up being marginalized due to issues that have nothing to do with the quality or beauty. This film is one of those. Despite the depth and complexity of the script doesn't allow it to be massively understood or appreciated, is an exceptionally good movie that the fact of not having a film company behind left almost out of the critics attention or the major industry awards. Surprising, exciting, this film is mentally provocative and it's sad that hasn't even been nominated for more categories at the Oscars and Golden Globes."

"williamkevinblack","9","2","3","30 November 2015"," An Innovative Masterpiece Weaving Together Time and Space
","Cloud Atlas: An Innovative Masterpiece Weaving Together Time and Space<br/><br/>An adaptation from David Mitchell's book, Cloud Atlas tells six asynchronous stories simultaneously, conveying a relation between different events, people, and objects over time, teaching individual worth and importance of action. It presents both stunning scenery and office space. It pulls the watcher in, engaging their minds as it grapples with core human struggles. <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas intricately weaves time frames together through juxtaposing related scenes and concepts. In the opening scene, the narrator begins by mentioning the devil. ""I'll yawn you about the first time we met, eye to eye."" Though we expect to hear his story, we cut to a lawyer strutting towards a doctor digging in the sand. We later discover that this 'doctor' poisons the lawyer slowly in his cross-sea voyage, attempting to steal his wealth. He is the original ""Old Georgie,"" as he attempts the first murder. The doctor shouts out ""Have you lost something?"" and we expect the conversation to follow through, but instead, we cut to a woman speaking into a voice recorder, wondering why someone would be willing to kill over a report (which is later revealed crucial to a city's survival). And so the movie continues throughout its entirety, linking scene to scene, theme to theme, time to time. As we expect to see a door open, the scene seamlessly moves to another time, where another door, physical or metaphorical, will open. <br/><br/>One such moment struck me in its parallelism, through using match cuts. A sailor aims his gun at Autua, a stowaway ordered to loose the top mast. The lawyer can choose to stop the shot and save Autua's life. Fluidly, we cut to a future scene, as a flying ship fires laser pulses at a thin bridge, narrowly missing our protagonist. The parallelism connects the times, increasing our worry for Autua as the ship's firing foreshadows the sailor's firing. We see the sailor look up, take aim, and we cut back to the future, looking up at the narrow bridge, paralleling the narrow topmast. Our care for these characters, heightened by this connection, helps us see how inaction is not a neutral stance, a pervading theme of the film, explicitly stated in several time lines. <br/><br/>In each time frame, the film reused most of the key actors as they played new roles each time. This core of actors portray differing genders, sexes, alignments to good or evil, and levels of historical importance, thus emphasizing the fluidity of human nature. We see the importance of individual choice in Somni-451's prophesy. Though made to motivate those in her own time to fight against social injustice, it was later used in a post-apocalyptic world to motivate and inspire Zachry to complete his quest. In the 1930's, Robert Frobisher explicitly states that ""All boundaries are waiting to be transcended,"" and Cloud Atlas does just that, merging past, present and future. The fluidity of these usually fixed attributes implicitly declares the thesis of our personal ability to change and the universal potential we have to change the world through seemingly unimportant actions. <br/><br/>The purpose of Cloud Atlas isn't to merely tell intriguing stories, linking them through parallel actions; it is to link common themes and eternal truths throughout the film. A central theme echoed throughout a call to fight and die for Truth and right, unfettered by social constructs and fears. In the earliest time and the future most time, the same actor gives the same quote. ""The weak are meat the strong do eat."" In other time periods, we see this fulfilled literally. The explicit statement, as it bookends the show chronologically speaking, seasons the entire timeline with its message. We begin to see those who buy in to this mentality in each of the distinct timelines, seeing those who take advantage of the physically weak to promote themselves. <br/><br/>We see this again near the end of the movie, when the protagonist turns on his slave-owning father, joining the abolitionists. The father admonishes, ""There is a natural order to this world and those who try to upend it do not fare well. {At this point, we see an execution squad in the future.} This movement will never survive. If you join them, you and your entire family will be shunned. At best, you exist as pariah, to be spat on and beaten. At worst, lynched or crucified. {At this point, the executioner lowers the mode of execution onto the martyr's head and pulls the trigger.} {We return to the abolitionists perspective.} And for what? For what? No matter what you do, it will never amount to a single drop in a limitless ocean."" Undeterred, the protagonist replies, ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?"" The synthesis of audio from the past and visuals from the future bind together the two times. The newborn abolitionist, who may only be a drop in an ocean insofar as his effects on slavery go, parallels Somni-451, who we know to have caused not only a revolution, but also to have become a goddess figure, having brought about a post-apocalyptic world. This parallel shows us how a drop in the ocean really does have monumental effects on the universe. <br/><br/>Overlapping scenes, motifs, allusions, and themes throughout Cloud Atlas give the piece great power to convey its themes effectively. Its divergent nature cements in the minds of listeners its themes, of Truth, Love, Right, and the power of the individual. Due to the graphic nature of several scenes, I wouldn't show it to my children unedited, but the themes contained are definitely worth engaging. 10/10 if it cut a few unbecoming scenes not necessary to the plot."
"lampic","7","2","3","31 July 2015"," Intriguing
","Slightly confusing but still enthralling movie that invites second viewing, this long semi-SF saga has feeling of too many chefs cooking one dish. Its perhaps just a little bit too ambitious for its own sake (three directors, countless movie actors playing various roles in different eras) and a idea of jumping from one chapter into another without really explaining what they have in common might be off-putting for audience used to follow linear story - be warned, there is not much of narrative continuity and one can find himself utterly confused with all these unconnected stories (or find them connected, I did not) however there is a very endearing enthusiasm and energy of everybody involved, which lifts it above criticism. Most of all, the whole fact that directors dared to play with such loose ideas and avoid usual clichés of start-middle-happy end in itself is perhaps commendable. Still, as much as I find myself enjoying it, must admit that TV serial might have been a better idea. <br/><br/>Actors galore - Halle Berry, Jim Sturges and Doona Bae got the best parts. Now I really need to read the novel."

","You either love this movie or scratch your head wondering what in the world did I just watched. I'm the latter. The only movie I like by the Wachowski brothers who were men and are now transgender women directors was The Matrix and that movie was alleged to be written by a black female author named Sophia Stewart. The Matrix was a revolutionary movie (red pill, blue pill, 360 degree camera angles, and slowing down the action, Westerners defying gravity like their Asian counterparts before them in Asian action films). The sequels had great action but was overall didn't live up to the hype of the original.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is an expertimental movie which plays around with editing, time periods, and actors playing different roles in different time periods. This movie is almost three hours long and I frowned when I paused the movie to see if it was almost over and saw I had only watched an hour and had two more to go. Yet, my brain got the better of me and I went to LaLa Land.<br/><br/>This confusing plot of a movie is like staring at a painting. One may think it's mediocre or ugly. Another may see it as revolutionary, beautiful, or a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I see it as Hollywood being full of themselves and overcomplicating a movie with a very simple plot and then thinking they're brillant and creative geniuses for doing so. This movie is a nothing burger, pretty to look at with no real substance.<br/><br/>The story could have been told in an hour in a half to two hours in an easy to follow along plot in chronological time in each time period. Instead of Tom Hanks being in the 18th century then the next scene he's playing a different character in the 21st character. The plot in Christopher Nolan's Momento, The Prestige, Inception, and Interstellar were told out of order but were done right, the audience understood the plot from the beginning and were able to follow along with the story even when some scenes were confusing with ambigous endings left to interpretation.<br/><br/>I hate movies like this because it's Hollywood self-congratulating itself and forgetting it also has to create a coherent and enjoyable movie for the audience too. Cloud Atlas is a vanity project. It's Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive. A dramatic version of Hail Caesar or Movie 43. Hate to add from one of my favorite actors, but this is Will Smith's After Earth.<br/><br/>If you're a wine snob who pretends you're a wine expert, you'll love this movie. If you're honest and can admit you don't know the difference between a bottle of wine from 1843 and 2012 and are content with the box wine or cheap store brought wine, then you may want to skip this movie unless you have two hours and fifty-two minutes of your life to waste."

I think it was like an assay for what the directors are doing in Sense 8.<br/><br/>They are talking about revolutions, as they did in The Matrix. But more in a sense of the objectives and how much you can get if you decide to go into a revolution. Also, they talk about the world being a big cycle, with the good and the bad being eternal. And how our decisions can not be ultimate, but they only form a part in a long chain of causes and consequences.<br/><br/>The philosophy they are based on is very interesting. But the quantity of resources they use is exaggerated. And it makes obvious and repetitive the message they want to tell.

Tom Hanks is surprising, getting a lot of reactions for him for a single movie (still, not my favorite). <br/><br/>The make up is very obvious.

I just let the whole stuff take me on this incredible ride, and marveled at how incredibly well these stories were weaved altogether.<br/><br/>I have to give it to the directors, the way they edited the story made possible for each of them to have a bigger impact than they would have told on their own. It felt like the climax of one story was only possible because of the build up provided by the others, and one story would find its emotional impact in the resolution of an other, and just for that, I have to salute the directors <br/><br/>I can't find any fault with the acting, that was spot on from beginning to end. Seeing Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant as bad guys was delightfully refreshing, Ben Whishaw and James d'Arcy manage to provide a touching love story despite sharing very little screen time together, Halle Berry is flawless, and Doona Bae was a true revelation. What a blast it must have been for all those actors to have the chance to be four to six different characters all in one experience! <br/><br/>All in all, this movie doesn't require you to think too much, and I do think that people who over-analyzed it (and generally ended up trashing it) were missing the point. It vehicles simple ideas, treat them on an emotional manner, and it is up to you to elaborate on the intellectual views and concepts that yielded in your brain upon watching it.<br/><br/>I think the biggest problem with Cloud Atlas is that we live in a lazy society where too often audiences expect to be fed with solutions. How many times I have read ""I didn't understand Cloud Atlas""? There is nothing to ""understand"" since all stories and their connexions are pretty simple, no big philosophical answer to be provided to you in here: it is only entertainement, and if, in the process, it makes you start to think about the world you live in, then it is enough. <br/><br/>It isn't about looking for a life changing message, this movie is all about being a pure expression of art. all it wants from you is to let yourself be immersed in the story and go with the flow. I also love the fact that you can rewatch it many times and pick up new details here and there and get something new out of it every time"
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","1","6 April 2013"," An interesting way of looking at the nature of freedom.
","Initially I wasn't going to see this film because a reviewer completely trashed it, and also when I read a synopsis it suggested that the only this that was connecting the six separate stories was simply that the guy at the end was telling all of the stories to his children, but after watching it on a plane from Hong Kong to Europe (and pretty much sleeping through most of it because I was just so incredibly tired) I decided that I would give it another go, and fortunately that opportunity arose on the way back to Australia.<br/><br/>I would not necessarily call this movie a great movie and in a way I would probably prefer to read the book (and it is on a list of books that must be read so I guess I will keep my eyes out for it). Anyhow, as we probably all know, this movie is actually six different stories that are somehow all connected. There is the physical connection, in that the first story (at least in the book) is the journal of a man who is coming to understand the evils of slavery as he sits on a boat in the South Pacific. This journal is then picked up by a young man in the 1930s who is a struggling composer being blackmailed because of his homosexuality. He tells his story through a series of letters that is read by a investigative journalist in the 1980s who is investigating a murder relating to the commissioning of a nuclear powerplant. However there is a second link with this composer as he writes a masterpiece called Cloud Atlas, however because of his situation, it literally sits gathering dust for years until uncovered at a later stage.<br/><br/>All of the stories are connected in this way, though a flaw that I found in the movie was that the forth segment, about an old man attempting to escape from an old folks home, does not seem to have a connection with the previous segment, though it is connected to the fifth segment (a near future action story) through a film that they watch, and the fifth segment is connected to the sixth segment (a post apocalyptic adventure) by a recording that is located in a communications station, once again called Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>However, there is another theme that seems to run through these segments and that is the idea of slavery. The first and the fifth are the most obvious links, with the fifth dealing with a race of clones who are created to simply serve humanity and have no rights whatsoever, and a failed rebellion that arises because of it. It is interesting when that is looked back on there is a suggestion that her impact upon the future was minute indeed, and in fact when we look back from this period the impact of many of those in the past are very few. Yet, the homosexual composer who ends up killing himself in a bathtub (a noble way to go he suggests) has the biggest impact of all, as not only does his composition become very popular (as the record store owner says, I found this and started playing it, and I simply cannot stop listening to it) he also indirectly brings down a conspiracy that is set up by the coal industry to discredit the nuclear industry, as well as causing mass destruction along the way.<br/><br/>The other thing that I liked about this film was how they would jump between the segments, and the way that they did it was quite impressive, and in some cases very seamless. Sometimes the segments would be long, other times they would be short. Sometimes it would simply be like moving to other scene, but at other times the jumps would be related, such as periods of intense passion. However, as said, this movie is good, but it is not fantastic, but it does actually make me want to read the book to see how things are done there (I do have an idea though)."
"droekaerts","1","7","18","28 December 2012"," Senseless and oh so ... boring
","After reading a lot of encouraging reviews on IMDb I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It was quoted 'epic' quite a few times. Well let me get straight to the point: epic it was most certainly not. I would like to warn people from jumping in and expecting a wonderfully complex, yet flawlessly executed journey across time ... So what went wrong? The idea is sound, the actors are good? Well there are a few things that are wrong. Let's start with the script ... it is either overly complex (as some reviews point out correctly) or plain silly (as others point out correctly as well). The same set of actors are portraying different characters in different eras. This becomes so dull and silly that at times you genuinely believe you are back in the 90s watching an Eddie Murphy movie where he plays multiple characters. At least the intention of Eddie Murphy was to be funny. To see this set of actors putting on different accents and dragged into different ethnicities is laughable to the point of painful. I would have definitely fired the make up artists on the spot. Seeing Tom Hanks with another prosthetic nose and false teeth, or Hally Berry as a white woman is over the top. If you do want a great laugh though, fast forward to the part in the future, where suddenly everyone is supposed to look Asian. Asian? They all look like they have had a bad reaction to a bee sting ... sigh ...<br/><br/>I have to be honest. I did not pay to see this movie, which was godsend. Out of respect of the theatre owner I did have to sit through it. If I had paid for this I would have walked out after the second 'costume change' of the actors.<br/><br/>Whoever believes this is an epic tale needs to look up epic in the dictionary (or Google it these days). I am sure you will find the following titles under your definition of epic: Waterworld - Hudson Hawk - Dick Tracy - to name a few. All very expensive movies who just ... didn't deliver! Or maybe IMDb is now truly taken over by the studios with thousands of people in a sweatshop somewhere saying this is 'oh so amazing'.<br/><br/>Comparing this to Stanley Kubrick is an insult ... a real insult. At least the critics got it right!<br/><br/>It's a turd ... avoid at all cost ... unless you are so bored the only alternative is to slit your wrists (which might actually be more fun)."

","What does a lawyer who saves the life of slave in the 1850's, a gay conductor who is recruited to help another composer revive his career, a reporter who is discovering the cover-up of what could be a dangerous nuclear power plant disaster, a man who gets stuck in a retirement home and now must escape from there, a clone who discovers she is the key to humanity's future, and a futuristic hunter and an alien teaming up to discover how to save humanity, all have in common?<br/><br/>To the narrow minded, or to the uninitiated, probably not much, or nothing at all. But for those of us who have seen Cloud Atlas, it is everything!<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas, based on the book(which I have not read, but will soon)by David Mitchell, is a film about humanity and all that unites us to one another. Through six stories, that are stand alone stories, but all feature links to each other, themes of love, greed, courage, destiny, free will,faith, and reincarnation(!!!) are explored to amazing lengths, that, although the film is three hours long, never bores! In fact, this reviewer was reinvigorated when the credits rolled!<br/><br/>This film has it all:great acting(particularly from Tom Hanks, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, and newcomer Doona Bae), great drama, great action, a terrific score, great costumes, great visuals, and a larger -than-life feel that rivals anything I have ever seen on screen before!<br/><br/>The segments are very strong, in particular the ones about the composer(called Letters from Zedelghem), the one about the man stuck in a retirement home(called The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish) and An Orison of Somni-451, which is the about the clone. The remaining three are The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing(which is the one about the man and the slave), Half-Lives: The First Mystery of Luisa Ray(the mystery about the nuclear reactor), and Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rything After(the last one about the hunter and alien). They are all strong stories, and I was amazed by how they all came together and how they all worked on screen. <br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the editing. The film cuts back between the stories, sometimes before you expect it to. It is takes a little bit to get used to(for me, it only took about five minutes), but you get quickly caught up and become entranced by what is on screen.<br/><br/>It is funny, it is emotional, it is action-packed,it is spiritual:it is all of these. If someone asked me what this film was about, I would just tell them this:it is about life, and what it means to truly live.<br/><br/>Whether this ends up becoming huge to word of mouth, or whether it remain a modern day cult classic, I don't know. But what I do know, for me at least, is that Cloud Atlas is one of my favorite films, and I can't wait to see it again and again!"

","Contrary to what some pretentious director may believe, one may understand a movie and still not like it. That is the case with Cloud Atlas, which mixes 6 average stories to prove that: the soul survives; soulmates do exist and white people are evil.<br/><br/>The 6 scrambled but linked plots are book-ended by the story taking place in a low-tech post-apocalyptic future. Cowardly Zachry, played by Tom Hanks, lives with a tribe that worships a deity called Sonmi-451 and is constantly menaced by savage Kona barbarians. Despite his fear, Hanks helps a member of a more advanced group, played by Halle Berry, to launch a signal for the evacuation of what is left of mankind to another planet.<br/><br/>This story contains the only unsolved mystery: how did Zachry's village even come to exist, considering the brutal, random Kona assaults. Also, as an added annoying bonus, Zachry has ""visions"" of the devil (played by poor Hugo Weaving, who is the villain in all the stories).<br/><br/>In a movie this long and complicated, ""visions"" are the last thing one needs.<br/><br/>The other story in chronological order are: in 1849 a lawyer sailing back home saves a stow away Afro-American, who strangely happens to live in a South Pacific island inhabited by Maoris. All the villains on board are white, so once back at home the lawyer decided to join the abolitionists. Also, the lawyer is married to a read-headed, freckled oriental woman (this is linked to the soulmate concept).<br/><br/>In 1936 the love story of a gay couple is destroyed by suicide. The link with the previous story is the diary written by the lawyer and read by one of the lovers.<br/><br/>In 1973, Berry plays a journalist who meets the remaining half of the gay couple and gets involved in a story that looks like blacksploitation with nothing to do with the rest of the movie, apart from proving that white people are bad.<br/><br/>In 2012, an elderly publisher gets locked up in a retirement home, but manages to escape. The evil nurse of the home is played by Weaver, who looks nothing like a woman - albeit a very masculine one. The link to the previous story is a house. This story tries to offer some comic relief, but it is not very funny.<br/><br/>In a dystopian future, in South Korea, a female clone named Sonmi-451 goes through the same plot line of The Matrix, albeit in a more condensed time-frame. Chosen by a revolutionary group for reasons impossible to understand, Sonmi-451 discovers that the world is not what it seems and that humans deserve to know the truth, only to get the group attacked by the authorities and herself in danger. She also falls for her saviour, played by Jim Sturgess (who's the lawyer married to the oriental redhead).<br/><br/>All characters in each segment are played by the same bunch of actors, which means Berry gets to play a Caucasian blonde, Jim Sturgess is badly disguised as ""oriental"" and Korean Doona Bae plays both Sonmi-451 and a weird- looking redhead.<br/><br/>In fact, the make-up is excessive to the point of distraction More than the idea of souls surviving and meeting again, one gets politically correct characters shoved down the throat - with the constant of Hugo Weaving, white male and incarnation of evil."

"Likes_Ninjas90","4","5","12","1 March 2013"," When the narratives are formally compared as an expression of karma and reincarnation, the juxtaposition is vacuous
","Filmmakers find it attractive to be ambitious. It is a luxury of cinema, often producing an epic scale or a multilayered story, reflecting numerous threads and character. However, the separation between art and mere grandiosity is the clarity of the director's intentions through the formal control of their work. How one uses the cinematic language to express and solve a problem is the heart of great filmmaking. <br/><br/>Andy and Lana Wachowski are rarely short of ambition but their recent films have been bloated and undisciplined. They ended their Matrix trilogy dismally and their last film Speed Racer, made over four years ago, was a financial and critical dud. As filmmakers they lack restraint. They over-stylise their work, relying heavily on technique estranged from meaning. Their love of geek culture traps them into imitating anime, manga and kung fu films, but without thematic, tonal or stylistic cohesion. <br/><br/>As people they are difficult to gauge too as they have been notorious recluses and deliberately media shy. Only recently did they lift the veil from their personal lives because they were making Cloud Atlas with a third director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run). They also opted to address a deep personal issue. Once known as Larry, Lana Wachowski transitioned from a man into a woman, following a sex change. <br/><br/>Transgender is fascinating in the context of the Wachowski's entire filmography. The five films they've directed have used avatars to hide the identities and motives of their central characters, or to subvert the conventional gender roles of archetypal characters. As a semi- autobiographical element in their work, it is one of the more intriguing aspects of their films. <br/><br/>Adapting British author David Mitchell's, Cloud Atlas takes avatars and hidden identities to extremes and reaches a new height of tedium. It is a film that is as ambitious as the Wachowski's have ever done, told over multiple timelines, with the same actors playing different characters in makeup. <br/><br/>But the thematic spine that adjoins all of these stories is lost in an opaque, perpetually interrupted narrative. At nearly three hours long, the film is intriguing and conceptually unique but it coasts too regularly on its own deliberate ambiguity and pretenses of telling a story, without ever elucidating the cryptic details of each universe. <br/><br/>The plot is a jumble of six threads that are thinly stretched and often terribly imbalanced. In 1849 a young man (Jim Sturgess) is helping a slave onboard a ship and defending him from the other crew members. On an island, a man (Tom Hanks) sees a spaceship land near his village and then a mysterious woman (Halle Berry) helps him to defend his people from barbarian warriors. <br/><br/>In Britain during the 1930s, Robert is a gay musician (Ben Wishaw) determined to write music with Vyvyan (Jim Broadbent), a grumpy but famous composer. He constructs a piece called The Cloud Atlas Sextet. In the 1970s a reporter (Halle Berry again) is investigating a secret report about a nuclear reactor. 2012: Jim Broadbent also plays Timothy, a publisher intimidated by a criminal who has written a book and is now threatening him. He asks his brother for help and is sent to a nursing home, overseen by an evil nurse (Hugo Weaving). In the year 2144, a cloned restaurant waitress (Doona Bae) makes a discovery about humanity in an oppressive futuristic society. <br/><br/>Dividing the stories between the directors has resulted in a lack of equal weight and value. Jim's story feels thinly stretched and uneventful compared to more memorable and extensive threads like the nursing home. There are striking images, like a satellite dish unfolding itself, but the smaller scope of the vintage periods reduces the visual flair. The only moderately exciting sequence is Timothy's escape plan. It outshines an emotionless future setting, derivative of Blade Runner and The Matrix, which would have been earmarked as the visual centerpiece. <br/><br/>Also like The Matrix, the same florid and sometimes pretentious philosophical dialogue haunts the film too. Ideas about the afterlife and people being reborn under different regimes are suffocated by overwritten lines like: ""one can transcend any convention if one can conceive doing so."" The dialogue touches on everything from consumerism to slavery but are these issues ever adjoined or resolved? <br/><br/>The intercutting, non-linear structure fails to answer this question due to the impatience of the editing, culling the rhythm and fluidity. Threads are interrupted by pointless jump cuts to other universes, never long enough to complement each other in meaning. There is also a heavy reliance on gimmicks that distracts from personal investment in the stories. What is the significance of Hugo Weaving playing not only a hit-man, but a green monster in a top hat and a female nurse? Who are these characters? <br/><br/>Critically, when the narratives are formally compared as an expression of karma and reincarnation, the juxtaposition is vacuous. The technique serves only to enhance the velocity of the chase scenes, instead of a synonymous theme. No matter how lofty the ambition, this is fatal in a film addressing interconnections."

"ipekkara","9","5","12","1 November 2012"," ""What is any ocean but a multitude of drops?""
","I haven't seen a movie that inspired me to write a comment on it for a very long time. Finally Cloud Atlas has arrived which succeeded in balancing commercial goals, technology, make-up artistry and a good/complex story with the urge to have something done with a great deal of endeavor. It's an adoption by Wachowskis based on an idea about how mistakes repeat over time and the battle between good and evil emphasizing on basic kindnesses or cruelties across lifetimes.<br/><br/>People may criticize that there were too many messages poking the blind eye like- we are human, we are not alone, everything we do has an impact on others and on future, death is a door, we are all the same and at same value, how we live in circles, the fight between people in power and slaves etc. And yet they can find them all very simple and trivial but in fact, in the chaos that we call life makes us forget these things. In the end what movies are for if they don't move us and pinch us to remember something that is already with us. It is so funny that we think that in our time, in our ordinary lives, slavery is not a subject anymore. But every one of us is the ring of the chain as we live in a capitalist/colonialist system. So they may find this message simple but it is the naked truth.<br/><br/>Technically, It was hard to keep track of the sequence of the story since it tells six stories in six different time periods, using a handful of actors who often play a different role, sometimes across race, age, or gender lines—in each segment. But even separate stories in it was enough to move me. Maybe a second round could help to grasp it thoroughly. Though I left the theater with light-heartedly, ruminating the movie in my head. Maybe overwhelmed of the thought what to take away from it. And the music. I wish we could hear it more. <br/><br/>It's not an instant classic or you may not count it in top movies but it definitely has a character that does not allow you to see and forget right away.A good break amid all rom-coms and action movies. I recommend not to set the bar too high and do not wait for it makes sense and reconciles every story in it. Just watch carefully and I'm sure you will find something to take away with you."

","I watched CLOUD ATLAS more out of mild interest than anything else. I'm aware that it's based on a lengthy novel by the British author David Mitchell, but I tend to avoid most modern 'literary' stuff because I find it dry, self-indulgent, and pretentious claptrap...<br/><br/>So along comes CLOUD ATLAS, and pretty much ticks all of those boxes. This is a film made by the Wachowskis, a pair of sibling directors who peaked early on in their careers with THE MATRIX and have gone downhill ever since. I'm not sure whether CLOUD ATLAS is as bad as SPEED RACER - on the face of it, probably not - but it smacks of desperation and 'look at me' attention seeking.<br/><br/>This is a long-running, slow moving storyline which tells various mini-narratives over the course of its running time. One is set in a futuristic Korean society, one is about life in a nursing home in contemporary times, one is a historical account from the 19th century. None of these stories adds up to much on its own, but the idea is that each of the characters in the stories are connected, sharing souls with characters in otherwise unconnected tales. A look at reincarnation, if you like.<br/><br/>What this amounts to is having the core cast taking on wildly diverse roles. Western actors will play characters who look like themselves in one story and then don 'yellow face' for the Korean tale. Koren actress Doona Bae is turned into a westerner for one of her roles. The problem is that this make-up looks RIDICULOUS with plasticine foreheads that made me think I was watching Klingons on STAR TREK. In addition, the acting stinks, particularly from the trying-too-hard likes of Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant. I was embarrassed, and cringing through most of this.

I agree with the late Roger Ebert that even with two or three viewings, I am still trying to put this all together. It doesn't matter.

It was really drawn out and way too long, not a total waste of time but defiantly not a movie I would watch a second time around nor do I believe or agree this is the movie of the year..<br/><br/>A very average score for a movie that had a very average and confusing story line. I am sure it will be nominated for an award due the very weird story line and plot which most movie critics give high scores to and general the public are left standing going.... what the ....?"

","Without doubt one of the best movies I have seen for a very long time. Really would go so far as to say a masterpiece. Never called a movie un-missable, but this is.<br/><br/>There is no point describing the story as it will spoil it. Most of the acting is out-standing. Ben Wishaw, Bae Doo-na, Jim Sturgess and Jim Broadbent in particular were magnificent. The casting was also excellent. It is isn't over-pretentious or over-acted. <br/><br/>The version I saw was around two and a half hours but this flew by and I ended up not wanting it to end. Apparently there is a four hour version. If so, I would certainly watch it again."

","Skip it if you can, watch it if you must.<br/><br/>The acting is great and the writing is fine... And the good news ends there. The movie is like chop suey that is almost destined to give you seizures with how much it jumps around between the six story lines. This movie could have usee another two dozen rounds of editing with better cohesion of the stories and plot (possibly even dropping a story line or two as they weren't aññ necessary).

Most people tell me they don't understand it and that it wasn't good. I respect that opinion, but I feel like they are missing the whole point of the movie. How lives are connected.

"Jovan_Dojcinovic","10","3","6","9 March 2015"," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","As they've done before, the Wachowski's, this time alongside Ton Tykwer, set the bar in Narrative storytelling. Like they did with The Matrix, Cloud Atlas is a confusing but satisfying story. Things don't go the way you would've liked them to, but what matters is what you find in the end of it all, what it means. This film connected with me in a deeply spiritual way. It was almost religious, how we're all connected throughout different generations just means that some souls cannot go without each other and it's just an awesome concept to put to film. To this day, Cloud Atlas remains as my 2nd favourite film of all time. I cannot think of anything else that has nailed a book adaptation like this.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's hit beyond a home run with this cinematic marvel."
"Lifesforliving","10","3","6","27 February 2015"," A life changing film
","To begin with, let me just say this... I'm not one to label any old film life changing. Yet this film (to me at least), is just that.<br/><br/>How can I describe the workings of love? How can anyone? It's a near impossibility to do so. You may as well ask me to describe the essence of music, or the colour of starlight... Simply put, love, is beyond words, as this magnificent film shows us... Now that my little intro is over, allow me to elaborate on just how tremendous and life changing this movie is.<br/><br/>When this film was initially released back in 2012, I made the horrendous mistake of not going to see it at my local cinema. Looking back, I regret this immensely. My reasoning for dodging this film is mostly down to the lukewarm reviews it received. The critics who wrote these reviews deserved firing on the spot, as they obviously did not understand the story nor the message of the film. Thanks to this error, I have now learnt never to trust a critic (a lesson long overdue).<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas shows us that love is the only way to true inner-peace. It shows us that the choices we make not only influence us, but those around us. A negative action will spread to others, causing nothing but misery and sorrow, whereas a positive action will spread love, joy and enlightenment... The six stories presented to us take on different themes and genres. In order, they are...<br/><br/>1. The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing – Drama 2. Letters from Zedelgham – Romance 3. Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery – Thriller 4. The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish - Comedy 5. An Orison of Sonmi 451 – Sci-fi 6. Sloosha's Crossin' an Ev'rythin' After – Dystopian/Fantasy<br/><br/>Each of these tales are joined to one another, showing us how 'Everything Is Connected.' I admit that one must be fairly observant in order to notice these connections. But, if you pay close enough attention you'll realise that everything is woven together in the tapestry of life. This is highlighted throughout the film, as it cuts back and forth between the stories, each sequence mirroring the one standing next to it.<br/><br/>In fear of rambling, I'll bring this review to an end... I can't explain this film in any finer detail, as to do so may in fact spoil the experience for you. Just trust me when I say, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS FILM.<br/><br/>I know that this movie splits people down the middle, so most likely you'll either end up loving it, or hating it, but it's worth the risk. Give this film a try... If you enjoyed it, but still found it confusing, then I suggest you re-watch it, as I've found that it only gets better with each subsequent viewing (and I already loved it enough the first time).<br/><br/>I'll leave you now with this quote from the film (and the book). Always think of this in moments of despair. When you think that everything you do will amount to nothing, and that you'll never leave a mark on this world... A quote to remind us all of the goodness we can do, and of the difference we can make.. You may think that your life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet, ""What is an ocean, but a multitude of drops?"""

","So, <br/><br/>Just finished watching Cloud Atlas. Honestly its the best movie I've ever seen. I've seen better acted movies, better written movies, movies with more character development, movies that have more enticing visuals and have better prop and set design; But I have never seen a movie that better represented my thoughts on the world and humanity and has hit me so close to the core. I honestly don't know if this movie is for everyone or if anyone would actually enjoy it. <br/><br/>However with all that being said I can not recommend this movie more, It's almost 3 hours long and it has a very slow pacing but It does not seem to waste a second of the given time.

The scale of the film is sweeping - it spans centuries, continents and lifetimes. The editing is fast, clever, fascinating... I mean that literally. One of the reasons I will watch it again is that the story lines happen simultaneously in a cleverly intertwined way. <br/><br/>Frankly, I think the critics who didn't like the film didn't understand it.

","One of the most impressive movies ever looks at the ripple effects of different actions throughout history and into the future. The main cast members play multiple roles of people trying to right the wrongs and bring about positive change. I liked how they edited the movie to have the numerous plot lines coincide with each other, ensuring a better understanding of the characters' motivations. Like ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Cloud Atlas"" poses the question of humanity's origins and where we're headed. While the visuals are overwhelming in some scenes, the movie is all about the characters: Jim Sturgess's lawyer, Ben Whishaw's composer, Halle Berry's journalist, Jim Broadbent's publisher, Doona Bae's slave, Tom Hanks's tribesman, and the other characters played by each of these people plus Susan Sarandon's and Hugh Grant's characters add up to a most amazing movie. I really recommend it."
"senor-ektr","2","3","6","13 July 2013"," McIntellectualism
","The overall basis of the movie is grandiose. It follows a few souls through time and reincarnation. Trying to sew their lives and events into meaning and continuity. And more importantly, trying to answer the big questions of life. At best, the movie shakes through a space/time non-continuity. Never allowing any of the characters to properly settle to gain depth or be truly personified. The directors failed at reincarnating a book unto the big screen. Mozart was able to create monumental feats with nothing more than a few ideas, ink and paper. The Watchowskis nor Tykwer are no Mozart. They sat and composed a tone def production of experimental sounds.<br/><br/>Many people boast about the intellectual feats this movie achieves. But I say this movie would be the equivalent of Starbucks and McDonalds collaborating to produce a film. The end result equal to their product, it's fast, tastes OK superficially but it's neither gourmet nor will it ever properly nourish your mind. They did not super-size any intellectuals feats here. A cliché term would be pseudo-intellectualism but I struggle with that. I think such a phrase is too good for this drab they they tried to feed on a silver platter.<br/><br/>Save yourself the time. Sit at your couch and surf all the channels for three hours, you'll gain just as much and feel equally jumbled as if sat through this. I really can't see the difference between the two."
"anthonypape","4","3","6","4 July 2013"," An over-hyped and simply not enjoyable ride
","Like many I guess I'd seen the trailers and the actors involved with this movie and concluded it was worth a look despite some mixed reviews. These days its a given that a big budget film is going to look good and this is no exception - the sets are authentic and any cgi blends in very well. That isn't the problem with Cloud Atlas.. neither is the acting which considering the multiple characters being played by any one actor and heavy make up involved is perfectly fine. What ultimately detracts from what is a great 'looking' film then, is the crucial thing that makes a film - the story. Without giving any plot details away, the story is actually a series of stories in different times throughout the ages which are somehow linked to each other.. The trouble is some of these stories are, to be blunt, a bit dull or simply average and the big message the film is trying to get across is typically vague spiritual nonsense. <br/><br/>To be honest, as visually impressive and unique in style that it is, the film is simply not very satisfying to watch. As some others have summed up well, its a case of 'the emperor's new clothes' Lot of people seeing something that isn't there."

","If you're going to tell a story about how actions and intent ripples through centuries and across the universe, you need a deft and subtle hand, which I don't think is something the Wachowski's can list in their strong suits.<br/><br/>In ""The Fountain"", Darren Aronofsky achieved this with astonishing success - creating a masterpiece that stands strong on first time viewing and only gets richer and more complex with each viewing. I'd recommend you watch that instead of Cloud Atlas. It's cleaner, smarter, and far more touching.<br/><br/>By comparison, if I had to describe Cloud Atlas in just two words, all I could really think of would be ""Clumsy"" and ""Bloated"". It's certainly spectacular, in both vfx and makeup, and it has enough high points (usually involving Jim Broadbent) to not make it a complete waste of time at all. But considering its grand ambitions and theme it just didn't have the toolbox to pull off the job."

","i mean, im looking at them and wondering what film these people were watching, or if they were even paying attention in the first place... in fact, the negative reviews are so astounding in the wake of this mind blowingly epic film that all i can think that makes sense is it must be some kind of conspiracy against the film to cover up the powerful nature of it or to buffer its inevitable effect on the populace. This film is that good imo. I've seen it 5 times since its release and will probably see it another 5 times just out of sheer enjoyment. even the preview gets me all teary-eyed. i mean, how can you NOT love this film... and even if you think this is just some fawning sycophantic review, watch the damn thing and decide for yourself.... all the negative reviews keep saying, ""don't watch this film!"". that seems suspicious to me. what would anyone have to lose by you watching a film. how does it affect them? that as well lends to my distrust of the negative reviews of this movie. the fact that it was entirely snubbed by so many award organizations makes me think something is up with the industry and the world as a whole in response to cloud atlas. My honest deduction as to why; its about reincarnation. and too many industries and powerful people and entities would lose a lot of power if humanity as a whole believed we lived more than one life on this planet. or if they believed they were divine beings that death could not touch. this film allays fears of life. it makes a person feel one with everything to a degree. and it makes you think, ""if i leave the planet in such disarray, then im going to have to come back to my mess and deal with it again, so i might as well clean it up and protect my home."" i think a lot of powerful people get along on the fact that many people think they get one life then they get to go somewhere else. a person is less likely to take care of a hotel or motel room because he doesn't have to live there... and there is that old saying, ""don't sh%t where you sleep"". and i think it is the exact culprit for why there is such a hush about this film. we cant have the sheeple waking up to the beauty and the immensity of existence and their eternal spirits. i say this; give the film a shot... if you don't like it, then its just 3 hours of your life. and if you love it, your life could be changed forever... literally. its a lottery. and you might win big. i did."

","It has been a while for The Wachowskis, but this film marks their return to magnificence. But I have enjoyed all of their films, and this film brings us back to the level of incredibility which we first saw in The Matrix.<br/><br/>I believe that everything is connected. In fact, the way I view the universe is the way it is shown here, my thoughts on Heaven, Hell, Afterlife, even Time all mirrored in this film based on a book which I must read.<br/><br/>I believe that we as souls are put on this earth to learn, to evolve and to become enlightened, and if we keep getting it wrong, we keep getting put back.<br/><br/>That is what this film seems to be saying: a soul, played in several various lifetimes by Tom Hanks, must learn how to change from a scoundrel into a hero. And because he is the narrator of the central story in this time spanning adventure, so must his character be the focus, even when his involvements in the other tales are peripheral.<br/><br/>""There is a Natural Order to this world"" - ""The Weak are Meat and the Strong must eat"" - Even the phrase ""Soylent Green is People"" - All become repeated phrases or ideas, in sometimes grisly and literal ways.<br/><br/>What makes it difficult to review this movie is the complexity of it, and it was a wise choice not to follow the format of the book. Instead, the stories are told all at once - Because even through the veil of time, they are all happening at once. But I found it not difficult to follow the story as it played out. The first time I watched this I was in a dream-like state, it was as if the film were speaking to me personally. As if the film were telling MY beliefs, even though I was not really aware of it at the time.<br/><br/>And while five of the tales are about ""Something Diresome is about to happen"" I loved the tale of ""Cavendish"" - With all of the Dark being played out, the Humour of that chapter was not wasted, and well placed in the film.<br/><br/>Stories like this cannot be told in any format but the format presented here. For anyone who believes that Deja-Vu is a glimpse across time or even alternate universes, this film will be easy to follow. But for people who lack empathy, who either believe in nothing or their religions prevent them from accepting the ""true-true"" or other ideas and religions, then the meaning of this film will fail to reach them.<br/><br/>I would have been included in that latter group of people, even 20 years ago, but as we live, we learn and our world-view changes. This is how it is supposed to happen. If we live a long time and keep our one and only world view and it does not change, then our lives have failed and we must live it again until we DO understand.<br/><br/>And the other main point of this film, is that Truth is not and never can be objective, we do not perceive the Truth, Truth is Truth whether we believe it or not, see it or not, or ever had it told to us or not. This is where we commonly fail as people, especially when our religions try to replace ideas that have solid evidence to support them, such as the Big Bang and Evolution. I have found that Faith does not require you to believe in Creation stories as Gospel Truth: Faith is also another thing that is not objective, Faith is Faith, you do not have Faith IN something, you simply have Faith- And Faith is not directed toward any person or God, and if connected to religion, the claim is that Faith is FROM God. So too is the True-True.<br/><br/>This was why the Zachry character had trouble with the Meronym Character at first, until a real trust and Truth was established, when Meronym also trusted Zachry enough to tell him why she was there. This is where we always get tripped up, Truth, when we tell it, repels fear.<br/><br/>The magnificence of this film is revealed in the way each actor plays different people through time, sometimes of different races, and sexes. Without the great ensemble of character actors, this film may have failed. It required Faith to have been a part of the making of this film, as each actor was charged with making we the viewers believe in each of the people they had been, are, and will be.<br/><br/>There are so many dimensions to this film, 1000 words are not enough for me to convey how deeply it affected me. The Golden Age SciFi Writer Lester Del Rey (Del Rey Books) is brought to life in the character of Luisa Del Rey."
"norero","10","3","6","18 March 2013"," Marvellous and extraordinary piece of Gold
","Cloud Atlas is like nothing I've ever seen before. It's a bold cinematic treasure from a brave collaborative filmmaking collective. Mad geniuses Tom Tykwer (Perfume) and the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix) boldly take on David Mitchell's layered epic novel, which connects six generations through the power of storytelling. While not everyone will embrace the overarching theme of spirituality and reincarnation that links the threads of Cloud Atlas together, there is still so much rich material within the tapestry to offer something to just about everyone - regardless of who they are, where they're from, or what their personal beliefs and values are. As stated at the start: this is a unique blockbuster experience and is the type of bold choice in filmmaking that (in my opinion) deserves to be applauded – if for no other reason than the ambitious intent to say something greater about life and experience. Best of all, the journey to that destination touches upon just about every emotion possible – while at the same time challenging both the mind and the eye with big ideas and small (but important) brush strokes of detail. If there was ever a movie that truly engaged the viewer, this is it. At nearly three hours, it does begin to wear on you as it comes down the final stretch, but the payoff at the end is worthwhile – and, dare I say, even beautiful."
"TheMaster01","10","3","6","15 March 2013"," An Incredible Achievement
","What makes this film so incredible is the fact that it is an adaptation of what was labelled as an unfilmable novel. David Mitchell's 'Cloud Atlas' ""erases the boundaries of time, style and genre"" and the film perfectly brings this combination of six interrelated stories to life. Although the novel follows a 'Pyramid' form (initially only telling the first half of each story), starting in 1849 (the Chatham Islands), moving up through the times until we reach 2321, the post apocalyptic island known as 'big island'. After this, it progresses backwards leading to a climax and resolution to every enduring tale and ending with the final line ""But was an ocean, but a multitude of drops?"". The film follows a different format, a format which is perfect for a film layout, and the screenplay which is absolutely perfect. The creators of the Matrix have devised an ingenious Screenplay that reflects both a desire to dive into the realms of their own imagination, and to also improve on an already incredible novel. Whether any other viewer, other than myself can enjoy the style and mixture of six different genres, this to me, is a very underrated masterpiece.<br/><br/>To put the films outline in its simplest form: Jim Sturgess plays a naive lawyer during the time of the California gold rush in 1849, Ben Wishaw plays a musician with a persistence to compose with his idol in 1937 and Halle Berry plays a journalist thrown into deep water in 1973. Jim Broadbent's 'Timothy Cavendish' is forced into a retirement village from which he cannot escape in 2012, Somni-451 (Doona Bae) discusses her story with an Archivist in 2144 and Tom Hanks plays Zachry, who embarks on an unexpected adventure on 'Big Island' in 2321. All of these stories are interrelated and connected through various links, and combine to make an incredible story.<br/><br/>Having actors play multiple roles may annoy many viewers, but it efficiently limits the amount of faces that need to be remembered and keeps you thinking non-stop. The characters that each individual actor plays have certain links between them. It ties together relationships between actors such as Halle Berry and Tom Hanks as well as Doona Bae and Jim Sturgess. There are also some fun games you can mentally play whilst watching this film, like ""Where's Halle Berry?"" (Here's a Hint: In one story she plays a tattooed/painted tribe women who is seen for all of 3 seconds, and in 2144, she plays a man. Yes that's right! A man!). The costume and make-up in this film is top-notch. As is the amazing cinematography and mind-blowing visual effects. The Original Score is also a triumphant achievement (thanks to Tom Twyker) and to believe that it only received a Golden Glove nomination and not an Oscar Nomination, is very disappointing.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis seem to have a liking for casting Hugo Weaving in their film roles, and Weaving's character in 2321 (a figment of Tom Hanks's imagination) resembles Agent Smith in many ways. Cunning, mysterious and frightening. Weaving has played some great roles for the Wachowskis such as Agent Smith and V in comic-adapted 'V for Vendetta', but now they can add Haskel Moore, a difficult named composer, a dangerous assassin (Bill Smoke), a female nurse!, the Boardman of 2144 and the already discussed, Old Georgie, a figment of Tom Hanks imagination.<br/><br/>The real heart and soul of this film, lies in Tom Hanks' characters. And not only that, but also Tom Hanks himself, who contains such effortless grace and a fantastic screen presence. Although there are six different main characters (all played by different actors), Hanks seems to just stand out with his great diversity from an Irish thug, to an evil doctor, to a cowardly-unlikely hero named Zachary doing what he feels is right. Zachary proves to be the character that 'Cloud Atlas' ends up being based around. Whilst Doona Bae and Jim Sturgess do hold the emotional soul of this film (particularly in 'An Orison of Somni 451' and 'The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing'), Hanks delivers an Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant makes some pretty unlikely (as well as disgusting) appearances, and does a pretty good job moving out of his comfort zone of British Romantic Comedies. I take my hat off to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Ben Withshaw, James D'Arcy, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Keith David, Doona Bae and Susan Sarandon; for all playing multiple roles and doing awesome jobs. It is like watching 6 different movies in one. It demands multiple viewings! <10 out of 10> Beautiful in every sense of the word!"

Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell is one of my favourite books, a sprawling beast of a thing, with many disparate characters telling generally unrelated stories across the centuries. Six tales, structured in a way that can infuriate, then reward. Tricky thing to film, Cloud Atlas. The only possible solution would be to get three great directors on board, mix all the stories up, make everything even more dramatic, especially the chase sequences, and get some of the best actors working today. Thankfully, the producers went for the only possible solution.<br/><br/>Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski divvied up the six stories and some of the actors. The theme of reincarnation/karma wasn't pushed strongly in the novel but, by using the same actors in the different stories, the film really goes for this idea. We are united across time; by ideas, by actions and by cosmic chance, possibly including rebirth. All the actors are superb, with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry excelling in so many key roles, especially a joint-smoking Berry looking about 25 years old as Luisa Rey in the beautifully filmed 1970s sequence. But my favorite were Doona Bae (The Host) as Sonmi-451 and Ben Whishaw (Q in Skyfall). Whishaw is superb as rakish young composer Robert Frobisher (my favourite character in the book) and you really, really want his outcome to be a positive one. Sob.<br/><br/>The Sonmi-451 story happens in a nightmarish future, the teeming metropolis of Neo Seoul, where soulless corporations control free thought and clones serve junk food to the masses. Nothing much new there then. But this element of the film has been injected with extra imagination, adrenalin, epic sets and edge-of-seat action sequences. Doona Bae is simply perfect as the clone that rocks the boat, with Jim Sturgess equally good as Hae-Joo Chang, her rescuer and lover. Again, I wanted a good outcome for who had become my favourite character in the film. Sadly, the outcomes have to be shared out across all the characters. In my opinion, the Sonmi-451 storyline would make a great film all on its own.<br/><br/>While the book was all about the characters, Cloud Atlas the film tries to do more, with superb cinematography, sound and effects. It's all about love, karma and the need for constant revolution. Its message is very timely, for Earth in 2013 is a dull and nasty place for most. Can this film transcend its pure, epic entertainment value and flick some switches inside its viewers' heads? The Matrix worked in the same territory but life has become unarguably less bearable since that release. Will Cloud Atlas cause a Sonmi or two to wake from their soap- induced stupor and lead us towards to a society where love, truth and fairness actually matter a damn?<br/><br/>Is everything connected or are we selfish, egotistical beasts? Big questions from a big film."

","I really did get a special gut feeling hours before seeing this movie, which is running in theaters here now. I barely knew anything about it, hadn't seen a trailer, didn't know who was directing. <br/><br/>Basically what I knew was that a handful of actors were playing multiple characters of different race, which I had heard from a friend (quote: ""it looked kind of weird"").<br/><br/>Little did I know that I was in for quite the ride. A magnificent work of story telling with directing and music wanting you to swim into the screen, sometimes to lend one of the many convincing protagonists a helping hand, at other times just to enjoy the marvelous scenery.<br/><br/>The depictions of every characters' journey is very well presented, and when you're already sucked in to one of the scenarios, another one just as capturing is thrown in your face. And they're all beautifully intertwined. I understand that it's based on a book, which I haven't read, but I definitely will after seeing this.<br/><br/>For me, this movie is an instant classic, and I most certainly will see it over and over again for years to come."

","I was a bit worried about the film dividing opinions.Some people said it was boring or that it was a mess.Maybe having read the book gave me a head start on people who had gone into cold.All i can say for a film that length it held my attention pretty much all the way through.Only about two scenes i didn't like that probably lasted 5 mins.The breakout at the end of the nursing home story and the daft punch up in the pub.Also the few minutes chase scene in the Lousa Rey Mystery up to when the guy shoots the dog.Apart from that i thought it was fantastic.Well done for the directors making the movie and i hope their backers make their money back and more for taking a risk.The funny thing about everything being connected is if Natalie portman had not given the book to the Wachowskis when making V for Vendetta this film would probably would never been made. Then again if the Matrix had not made as much money it might have been a great stand alone picture,and we wouldn't have got the pointless money grabbing trilogy it became."

","Cloud Atlas is unlike any film I have seen before, it tells a number of different stories spanning across centuries, with many big name actors playing multiple roles across those time lines sounds confusingbut something about it just works. It has the big names (Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant, and Halle Berry to name a few) and a big budget. Making this film was certainly an ambitious task, and yet somehow it flows effortlessly through multiple stories while never really feeling disconnected. You get a real sense that EVERYTHING in this film was meant to be there. Each time line connects to another, and if you don't pay attention (for a pretty hefty 2hrs 50mins) you will miss important plot points. It kept me engaged for the whole film.<br/><br/>In the course of the movie six very different stories are told, and there is something for all types of movie audiences: A 19th century tale of unlikely friendship between a stowaway slave and a young plantation owner. A love story via letters between a gay composer to his partner in the 1930's, A 70's corporate espionage thriller, A comedic account of an wrongfully committed pensioner in an old folks home, a beautiful futuristic clone's battle for freedom, and finally the story of a post-apocalyptic tribesman and his family facing the dangers of the far-future. Although all these stories are so different, we never lose the feeling that they are somehow connected, and as the story plays out, we begin to see these connections come to light.<br/><br/>Without wanting to give away too much about the stories, I will say my favourite was: The modern day set trials of an ageing writer played wonderfully by Jim Broadbent whom is placed in a home by his bitter brother and must escape. Hilarious and quite heart-warming. I also loved the Blade Runner-esque future story involving the question of Artificial Intelligence and consumerism gone mad. It looked beautiful and the relatively unknown Doona Bae was great as the clone/android Sonmi-451.<br/><br/>The master class of acting across these stories is what steals the show. Some were so unrecognisable that I didn't even realise who it was until I saw the credits. <br/><br/>For all its plot twists and connections, Cloud Atlas, for me is about the idea that our actions affect others greatly throughout time, every action we make has a reaction to someone, somewhere. Chaos Theory suggests the smallest act can have great consequences.<br/><br/>Like many movies with such a deep message, Cloud Atlas didn't do as well as perhaps it deserved to in the box office, and it has been met with some criticism from mainstream critics who consider it too showy and self-indulgent. This movie is a great achievement, and one that I hope is looked back on and thought more of in hindsight in the years to come.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the better films I saw in 2012."

","Cloud Atlas (2012) wow what an amazing story.<br/><br/>the easiest way for me to explain this film is comparing it to time. now it is believed that time is linear, therefore meaning that there's a past, present and future. but what if this was not true? another theory is that time is not linear but it's 3 dimensional, meaning that it is past,present and future all at once.<br/><br/>if you are looking for a film that's more than your usual Oscar glitz and glamour films that are filled with mindless violence which receive accolades from critics. Then maybe Cloud Atlas might not be suitable for you.<br/><br/>But if you appreciate new thinking, creativity and great visionary then you will enjoy watching Cloud Atlas just as I have enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>but don't take my word for it, you should watch it yourself and make your own decision of what you think of it."

","Great effects and acting but the weaving was too complex. I could not follow the story and watch a lot of movies. It was lush and visual, but changed so much in the plot that it frustrated my need for a story. I think it was an arrogant mess. I do not believe this is good weaving of story an reflects on desperate efforts to be new and daring, at a cost to entertaining. I do not believe this is a good film and call it a collage or montage, but in this case, a schizoid mess, one for the cooks. Its a movie where the make up is entertaining, and incredible. Where the make up is so good it stands out more than anything else. Maybe Hollywood has more money then mind."
"dchegarty","9","3","6","10 January 2013"," Exceptionally well pulled off but not as good as the novel
","As I read the tirade of reviews, it struck me how few people actually read the book, which really does help alleviate any confusion. Watching a film that has been carefully pieced together from the original ideas of David Mitchell has been an amazing experience. The book itself is enormously complex and non linear which is why I was fascinated to see how the directors could have possibly made a linear film from it. <br/><br/>Personally, I believe they have done an excellent job intertwining the 6 stories in a manner that many thinking people will understand. This is not a mindless shoot'em up film and requires a great deal of thought and willingness to understand the plot. If you are not engaged then you had better avoid it at all costs.<br/><br/>There are no films out there that have tried to integrate 6 stories in such a way as has been done in this film. It is a first and as such should be appreciated for it. It is a work of art and should leave you feeling that you want more. The main problem is that with the novel, you could easily flip back to the earlier half of a particular story if you got lost. In the film, you will just have to wait until it appears on DVD and go back a chapter or so to understand.<br/><br/>As with most film adaptations there are always compromises and story changes but for the most part the film is a good representation of the book. In my opinion, the Seoul story was changed the most but the general messages remained the same for all story lines. If you want to be amazed and blown away AND fully understand the plot from your first viewing, I recommend reading the novel. You will not be disappointed."

","First of all try no to walk out of the theater after the first half an hour after the movies starts. If you'll give it a chance you will walk out of the cinema after 3 hours with a big ""WOW"" on your face. It's an amazing movies if you try to understand it. It's the type of film you can watch it over and over again (or at least twice - it's kinda time consuming).<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a series of interconnected stories from past, present and future revealing the nature of human kind, the mistakes and good choices, the cowardliness and heroism, the freight and courage, the bad and the good - in one word - the duality that lies in all of us. The characters in every story are also connected - a character playing in one story has another part in the next, but it's contoured and shaped in a way that reveals the human duality on one side, and the true and singular nature of the human soul on the other. You need to wide-open your mind for this movies as it unconventionally elaborates motifs like reincarnation or the collapse of humanity (by returning to cannibalism for example).<br/><br/>The picture begins and ends on the same set, in the same period of time - a very far feature where the last humans tries to get by on the single part of the earth left un-demolished. This set up is the main point where everything ends, where the grandfather tells the story of world to his grandchildren.<br/><br/>The title of the movies represents ""The Cloud Atlas Sextet"" written by Robert Frobisher, a becoming music composser. The Sextet will remain the main motif of the movie and will show up in the present as the best music ever written uniting generations of hundred of years and representing the everlasting immortality of the human spirit.<br/><br/>We can see how the future and the past are united and no matter the year we are in we can discover the same social perturbation like slavery and revolutions, fighting for you freedom or fighting for love. The evil, as love, in the human soul are eternal and a-temporary.<br/><br/>We can see a few individuals in this movie but so many characters (stay for the credits at the end). Every reincarnation has it's meaning if you watch really closely. Let's take the characters of Tom Hanks for example (the most prolific personage in the movie). We can see how he turns from a evil medicine man using his medical eduction not to heal people but to kill them, to a man of science who will risk his life to make a difference in the world for greater good, to a hero that fights the Devil and succeeded in defeating It even with some many victims on the long side.<br/><br/>In conclusion the movies tries to make us realize that even if it's hard to change the past and make a better future, it's not impossible. As Adam Ewing would answer to his father-in-law's remark: - You are just a drop in the ocean! - What is an ocean but a multitude a drops?"

","First of all let me say that I loved the book and read it several times over the years, so when I heard that there would be a movie adaptation I was excited. I was a bit skeptical however as the book is quite post-modern in its narrative, jumping between story lines and changing its style, so I wondered how it would translate. After finishing watching the movie I am impressed. Everything about the movie screams high production value. They've managed perfectly to capture the different lives and how they tie together. The impression is that of a quilt composed of many different fabrics all tied together into a unified piece. Parts of the movie gave me goosebumps for being so beautiful, both in visual style and overall message. The movie is close to 3 hours long, but on the contrary from some movies of similar length(*cough* Hobbit *cough*) where you look at your watch about two thirds in and wonder if it will end soon, this movie almost felt too short. I got so completely immersed in the story and the visuals and the almost universally great acting of the cast that when the credits rolled around I couldn't believe I had been sitting transfixed in front of the screen for such a long time. A tour de force that captures and enhances the mood of an already great story, and perhaps even makes it more accessible to a wider audience. Bravo!"
"mkham6","10","3","6","6 January 2013"," Magnificent brilliant sweeping sci-fi love revolutionary masterpiece from Watch twins
","This is a MASTERPIECE from the Wachowsky twins- a magnificent sweeping sci-fi love revolutionary story splayed across 3 centuries, 6 societies, with the often fast cuts between story lines as finely crafted as the best symphony. It all holds together and comes clear in the end (actually must watch it again)- incredible acting tour de force by every one of 10 or so major actors, who each play 4-7 roles- you won't believe or realize 1/3 of them till the picture credits- Hanks + Berry are amazing. The photography is beautiful, the acting spectacular, the multiple story lines so exquisitely done that the Watch Twins have invented a new form of film making that approaches a 3 hour classical music video in its audacity and emotional wallop. Although complex, the stories are laid out and intercut so perfectly that they aren't hard to follow, and build to simultaneous climaxes that scream with tension.<br/><br/>At its root it is about throwing off the shackles of slavery and fear that bind us all, with a few recycled ideas from the Matrix- but with the gov bankrolled banksters cackling as they bleed us suckers, and the Republicans (+ Dems) turning the US over to the rich as they make the planet uninhabitable... who can doubt some revolution is necessary. (Note- one Watch twin has become a woman with sex-change: Lana, which adds some poignancy to the sad gay story line. Well, they are from another planet, aren't they?) <br/><br/>All audio is English, except the Hawaiian 22nd century pigeon, which maybe I can write a subtitle track for, since I lived on the Big Island (real locations used?- Honoka'a, Waipio Valley, Kohala Mtn.?, Mauna Kea?, where I worked on biggest telescope complex on Earth) for 2 years, Maui for 1. Whites are oppressed, beaten, and killed there now; so undoubtedly will be in a century or 2 (which this courageously portrays)- it is the most violent racist place I've ever seen... as well as the most magnificent geological meteorological biological oceanographic place on Earth. Also blew into San Francisco in '73 in first contact with Pacific in first Great Trip, and am a journo with big interest in nuclear power/war and AGW, so film is paralleling some of my life.<br/><br/>FIND IT, WATCH IT NOW.

","What is life? And is there an afterlife? What shall happen when we die? There shall be bereavement, shrill pitched voices explaining how good we were, interestingly same voice could never bestow the same degree of accolade whilst we're alive. So by all probability, deathis that it? Is that the boring finale of our dull lives? Born, brood, burn, breathe last... Only thing to differ, this isn't it. There is a certain afterlife, a life whose genesis is implied the very moment our karmic cosmic particles are in motions. I have been hearing that karma thing for years like you only go back in high heavens of lowly hell, after getting even with your karmas and yourself. However, few fellows seem to trespass that threshold and that strengthens the notion that they've been exempted the karma cycle swiftly. Though only thing, that isn't it as well, karma carries on following you and decides what you're going to be in your next life. Revenge is best served cold – Kill Bill v.2. Quite well put, though revenge carried out across time frames that could range from colonial centuries to post-apocalyptic world is what makes it gruesomely awesome. There are few flicks that re-instate you belief in something mystical, something far more complex and typical then our ignoble brainy cells could ever comprehend. The condescending nature of human superiority overtly eludes few deceptive facts that are as certain as eye to a face, yet we choose to be misled every time shallowly for our own goodbad, don't know. This very flick describes on such hell of an amazing ride and it takes you across centuries within blinks and yet you can make out the connection in between those two eclectic, seemingly incongruent events. Ever played connect the dots? Just that this time you're seeing your brain do the homework while you sit tight trying to help the poor fella out. Unbelievably deep layers of stories that in one way or another, relate to what gets served, is marvelous representation of thought provoking cinema. For example, a person too bad, full of greed and lust in colonial times turns out to be a nice fella in early 18th century and then keeps on improving until he meets his fate, in an excruciating way. You can ponder, hell bloke was nice for two centuries and then suddenly? Yeah, karma cosmic, remember? There are several such mind numbing examples set out in movie that make you actually wonder that you're a changed man after watching it. Tom Hanks – this man carries enough space up his belly to carry all the awards conceivable and yet walk like a camel. In his till date most phenomenal performance from a contemporary failed writer to an primeval lust-bitten doc, he justifies his grandeur once again and takes the cake for this year's best supporting role, if I were to be believed. And squeezing out such a grimly overlaid script in 172 minutes is an achievement in itself. From euphonious and amazingly mellow background music to grandiose of one of the finest cinematography I've ever seen, I am afraid this movie is not for everyone who loves to see fantasy movies with the fantasy, eyes wide jaw dropped, brain hibernate style. Most brain-tickling movie I've ever seen in recent times is easily this special movie which even makes inception a bit duller, albeit only at different plateau. Watch it for the sheer imposing cinematic experience that will render you flabbergasted for a more somber and subtle view next time. These aren't my ruminations, you may call it fiction, some may call it fantasy, others may call it karma delectation, though I prefer to call it in its originality – CLOUD ATLAS! 11/10"

","The Wachowskis are no strangers to the commercial side of Hollywood. Their movies are either half-brilliant half-commercial blockbuster or just a dumb version of the second half.<br/><br/>Tom Tykwer on the other hand had the ""luxury"" as a European director to make movies his way. <br/><br/>On this note, thank the stars that WB didn't fund it... it almost didn't get made because of it, but probably due to Tykwer's connections in Germany the movie got funded and made the way the authors wanted. <br/><br/>I'm not going to comment much on the brilliant storytelling techniques, or on the beautiful score/cinematography. Those alone never make a great movie. A great movie does one of the following things (not necessarily mutually exclusive): entertain, move you emotionally, make you think, sends a message etc...<br/><br/>When a movie is really successful at doing more than one of the above then I call it a masterpiece! <br/><br/>The most interesting part of the movie and the one that probably most people will sadly miss, is the message. This is a constant for the Wachowskis (Matrix, V for Vendetta...). Each of the 6 stories makes a point, the same point. I can try to phrase it but it sounds cliché either way I try. <br/><br/>--- Minor spoilers below --- <br/><br/>There is a common theme that runs through all of them. The theme of ""evil"" as a product of greed and selfishness that becomes more and more monstrous as the ages progress and a theme of ""resistance"" and ""bond"" of the ones opposing it. In each story there is a bond of 2 characters who help each other defeat the ""evil"" of the age. The message goes beyond this... it's just an artistic instrument for transmitting it. <br/><br/>I also liked various other things: the ""reincarnation"" theme is suggested but never pushed down your throat and sufficient alternative interpretations are left to the viewer. There are also a lot of moral choices the characters face, situations where their actions can be viewed from both angles. This moral ambiguity is also something that I liked very much... <br/><br/>I only saw the movie once and I'm sure I've missed a lot of subtleties the first run... and am very much looking forward to seeing it a second and third time. I missed for example the connections between some of the stories... some are obvious but others aren't. <br/><br/>I rate this 10/10 not because it's the best movie ever made but because it's one of the few that does most of everything right. It is entertaining, moving, makes you think, has a very strong (although a bit too subtle) message, can use great CGI without becoming CGI porn... It's a movie you will want to see at least twice because of how dense the information presented is and also because the presentation style can be a little confusing during the first viewing."

Another opinion, from a friend who had been a big Matrix fan, was that he was expecting more out of it, however it was not that bad. <br/><br/>The fact that my friends regarded the movie as a brain twister and that it was made by Wachowskis, instantly got me very curious about it and right then I already got the feeling that this would be a real goody for me. It just wasn't the first case when some of my friends perceived a movie as some artistic nightmare, but I really loved it. So, my expectations was high already from the beginning and maybe they even worked in some way as a self suggestion that contributed to my sense that this movie was a true gold. Long story short, as I expected, I absolutely loved the movie.<br/><br/>For the last month I have been steadily going through a learning program designed by Eben Pagan and called Mind Control.

","This is my first review so far, so bear with me.<br/><br/>When i went to watch Cloud Atlas i must say my expectations were high. They had been raised through reviews, trailers and word of mouth, so i was expecting to have that special feeling at the end of the movie. And oh boy did it relieve my expectations!<br/><br/>I must say it has been the first film this year to hold my attention and deliver in a way that Cloud Atlas does (and yes I've watched Batman: DKR). The story (stories) is compelling and the acting is superb. The movie reaches so wide an audience that you never thought possible, there are histories from the past, present and future. Sci-fi, action, comedy, drama and romance. So no matter the taste, the audience will be pleased.<br/><br/>But what really makes this film special is the acting. The actors do a superb job, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry delivers as usual. But what really surprised me was the (for me) unknown actors; Jim Sturgess and Ben Whishaw who did an astonishing job, holding a grip of me for every minute of screen time. Especially the story about the young, Robert Frobisher and his struggle to write his masterpiece and echo in eternity, said without revealing too much.<br/><br/>I would recommend you go and see this film, since it is some of the best if not the best, movie I've watched this year. BUT! If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared to stay focused for all 172 minutes, because if you do not stay concentrated, you will miss out, due to the jumps in times and stories. But in the end, you will exit the theater with that special feeling in your stomach that lets you know, you just witnessed a great piece of art.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Movies can tell stories and show unique characters and some show an idea or a philosophy. Cloud atlas is the ladder. I was not laughing or thrilled by this movie. However I did watch at midnight and by a weaker movie I would have fallen asleep halfway. I wanted to see more and if an extended cut comes out I will buy it. I can't promise you will enjoy it, but a movie like Cloud Atlas should be viewed if you see film as an art form or want something unique. <br/><br/>The movie has great cinematography and an awesome score.

","The makeup in this movie blew my mind. Without the assistance of IMDb, it would be hard to spot who was who in the 6 roles some of the cast played.<br/><br/>I thought 3 hours was too long for a movie, but it played out well and enjoyed every minute of it. This is reminiscent of ""lost"" style with connecting the past with the present and future but on a more well played out level with the 6 timelines.<br/><br/>Its not easy to get lost and see the connections between past, present and future and everything fits well together at the end of the movie. Lots of philosophies in the movie at times that are eternally recurring in human nature. The human instinct for freedom, to just name one. Traditionalists opposing change in each timeline, to name another.<br/><br/>Watch it, you wont regret it."

","This movie is one of those movies that grabs onto you after you leave the cinema. Like Koyaanisqatsi it holds a message that people can relate to so I would say this movie is about an empowered Karma. Where your actions have repercussions throughout Eternity.<br/><br/>Most of us has seen a world where people want money, power, objects and alike; but all that is to reach happiness, our true and actual goal is always to be happy, nothing more. We mistook this desire for happiness as a need to get a hold on as many Things and Wealth as possible, but actually happiness is a mental state that can be achieved by anyone when they focus on it. If you stop desiring to buy things and get lost in daydreaming about the future, make long-term plans and worry about things you have no control of, and if you also stop thinking about the events that have happen to you in the past then you will be left to enjoy the present. Like it was said by Alice Morse Earle in her book ""Yesterday is History, Tomorrow a Mystery, Today is a Gift, Thats why it's called the Present""<br/><br/>Because it is in this ever lasting moment, the now, where life happens, where you feel happiness and joy, where you meet new people and where you exist as well as everybody else."

","Don't do like me and work too hard on guessing which souls are which in each time period, because it's almost always different ""soulmate"" couples that are featured and a major character in one life might be extremely minor or even dead in another life. Tom Hank's characters are easy to point out, but it's not so easy for the other lesser-known actors. So, that being said, the stories take place in 6 time periods in different locations ranging from 1849 to 2321, 2 of which might be considered science-fiction. The characters in each story, that are alternating and not linear one after the other, are souls that reincarnate and are somehow linked together. Those 6 intertwined stories are simple easy-to-follow affairs provided you don't think too much about identities on the first viewing. By themselves, they are of different genres (comedy, drama, action, sci-fi, romance, historical) sometimes combining (example: sci-fi romance). They are interesting, but not great. Few of those would have the potential for a feature-length film.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a bold, ambitious project with decent directing by the 3 directors, but it's moderately successful in its impact. I didn't find it too confusing and sometimes even clever in how it transitioned. I think what doesn't help the emotional impact is that it's not the same couple of souls being featured in each time frame. Some might find it a strength, I felt as if it unfocused and hindered character build-up and evolution. I would have preferred more emphasis on 3 or 4 characters instead of the dozen there was, but I have to keep in mind it's a book adaptation and it probably worked better in book format. The acting was OK, nothing great, with the highlights being Ed Broadbent (the old guy) and the main Asian actress. It was a difficult undertaking, but sometimes the makeup really failed and actually detracted from story immersion (Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving, as that woman was horrible). The film is obviously a commercial failure and I find it silly to lambaste a film for that. It might become a cult film and I wouldn't mind seeing it again although I didn't adore it. I think it's worth watching at least twice.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10 (Very good)"
"Laakbaar","9","3","6","9 December 2012"," Epic
","There is some cool science fiction, action and adventure in this movie. The stories told are interesting and beautiful. Even if you don't care about the movie's message, I think you could also just go and enjoy it for the entertainment value.<br/><br/>But this is actually an epic movie, a movie with a message, an intelligent movie with profound themes. The main point is that everything is an interconnected rich tapestry, a truth that has profound implications relating to human dignity, liberty, art, spirituality, and so on.<br/><br/>The movie gives us this message not just in the content, but in its form, technique and even its acting. The movie is composed of six individual stories set in different times and different places. They are completely different stories and different genres.<br/><br/>Each story itself is a complex mini-movie about 30 minutes long. Most of them are set in beautiful locations. Each story can stand independently, having its own characters, plot and finale and depending heavily on its particular genre, but still dealing with the primary themes. The various stories are not subtle: each has clear heroes and villains. This is a world of good guys and bad guys.<br/><br/>The movie weaves these stories together, showing us occasionally the ways that they are interrelated. Sometimes the interrelationship is obvious and forced: the director cuts from one scene to the next to make that point. Sometimes the interrelationship is not obvious or glaring, but subtle and mysterious. The movie goer is invited to figure it out.<br/><br/>The characters and actors are also interconnected, in the sense that each actor plays a handful of roles. This was so well done that I was shocked when I checked out the cast on IMDb after I got home. I could tell that some actors were playing double roles, but I missed three quarters of it.<br/><br/>The actors play different sides (from hero to villain, and vice versa), different genders and even different races. Some of it was obvious and I can see why some might think it inept. On the other hand, I accepted the movie's message that the distinction between races and genders is unimportant.<br/><br/>Philosophical statements on the theme of interconnection and other similar themes are made throughout the movie. These statements often seemed rather profound, but were delivered in a context that made it difficult to absorb in just a few seconds. I need to see this movie again to focus on that. (Or of course I could read the book.) It was a little frustrating not being able to follow it all closely. The movie I saw was (thankfully) subtitled in Dutch, so I was able to follow most of the dialogue.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is confusing. It takes a few minutes to understand the structure and the fact that the director wants you to pay attention. It soon fell into place though. There were also a few times when I felt I was being lurched from one story to the next. <br/><br/>The didacticism and philosophising of this movie had a downside. Yes, the stories are entertaining, but it's quite clear that grand truths are being preached to the movie goer. <br/><br/>But that's what epics do. I'd go see this one."

Wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.<br/><br/>The worst thing was it had a couple of parallel stories with the same set of actors. Couldn't get what is the connection between these movies.

","I expected seeing this movie to be a life changing experience; being a person whose religious beliefs tend toward Buddism and the notion of past and future lives on Earth.<br/><br/>This film purports to deal with this issue philosophically, but really doesn't. It is merely a half dozen little novelettes performed by a small corps of actors; made up to look different but still suggest continuity of souls through the ages.<br/><br/>The novelettes are not very interesting. The high-jinks with all the makeup is distracting. And really undermines the credibility of the story when a particular soul coexists with himself in the same time frame. Just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>There is some very good action involving that bad guy from the Matrix. And some gorgeous erotica (briefly).<br/><br/>Not worthy of the hype."
"fraser-simons","9","6","16","29 October 2012"," Go See This Movie! -No Spoilers-
","There's been a lot of gripes about the film so far and it's only the opening weekend. I for one enjoyed it even more than I thought I would. Going in having a vague idea of what to expect wasn't idea as I think if I had no idea what to expect I would have enjoyed it even more. <br/><br/>The idea that a feature length movie would have six interlocking stories all with multiple themes that come together into a resounding theme is awesome. I can't think of any movies other than this one that's done it at all and if there are others I doubt they would accomplish it in such a cool way. Each character begins in the movie and then their story is taken into the next character and the next until the end story. In this way it manages to climax all of the stories and close them one by one until we are back at the beginning of the end. It was admittedly slower at first because they are building all story lines but by the end of the movie I was just so pleased with the outcome I didn't mind the very minor short comings. Of which I can only find two. The makeup on the main characters can be decidedly reaaallly odd sometimes but when you think about it there's not really a way they could have interlocked these characters together in a simplistic way. Something that needs to be done for North American audiences, as reading other reviews they are clearly missing the overall scope and theme as well as the minor ones that pop up that resound into the other stories. The second short coming was what I had said before, just that it is slower to build but does a nice job of tugging you along as you're trying to figure out how all these people are woven together exactly. <br/><br/>The main point is just that it's really nothing I've seen in film as yet and it does a great job doing what it set out to do. All the stories would be enjoyable in their own right. But I really like how they have tied them all together and explored a lot more then just the main theme. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
"zardoz-13","6","7","20","2 November 2012"," ""Cloud Atlas"" is no ""Matrix!""
","""Cloud Atlas"" qualifies as a pretentious philosophical potboiler. The premise of this lavish $100 million epic is that mankind is connected across the millennium in our pursuit of happiness. ""The Matrix"" co-helmers Lana and Andy Wachowski along with ""Run Lola Run"" director Tom Tykwer have bitten off more than they can contend with in their convoluted adaptation of bestselling British author David Mitchell's award-winning novel. The filmmakers argue that nobody resides in a vacuum, and everybody exerts an integral influence in the evolution of mankind. Everything amounts to an eternal loop. A defiant replicant, Sonmit-451, summarizes their collective ideology: ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."" Touting a laudable liberal agenda and boasting an incomparable cast, this schizophrenic science fiction saga serves up six insipid B-movie plots which intertwine as they unfold in a disorienting daze. Each episode concerns three chief characters and depicts them battling an oppressive system that engages in some form of prejudice. Two visual threads tie these stories together. First, some characters share a comet-shaped birthmark. Second, all appear in multiple roles. The Wachowskis told ""The New Yorker"" magazine that the actors represented migratory souls that evolve over time into a higher state of consciousness.<br/><br/>The first story takes place in 19th century Hawaii. An American attorney, Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess of ""One Day""), purchases Maori slaves for his racist father-in-law. During his sojourn on the island, Ewing suspects he is being poisoned by Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks) who is treating him for parasitic worm. According to Dr. Goose, the worm is devouring Ewing's brain. Actually, Dr. Goose covets the key around Ewing's neck that will unlock a treasure chest. Meantime, Ewing has smuggled a slave, Autua (David Gyasi), aboard the sailing ship. The bond of friendship between them convinces the lawyer to become an abolitionist. During the 1930s, in Belgium, a destitute, young, gay musician, Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), works as an amanuensis for a cantankerous composer, Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent of ""Inkheart""), who is losing his memory. One of the books Frobisher reads at Ayrs' mansion is Adam Ewing's seafaring chronicle. Tempers flare up between Frobisher and Ayrs when the youth writes a symphony, the Cloud Atlas Sextet, which Ayrs claims as his own. Frobisher pulls a pistol on Ayrs, packs up his symphony, and goes into hiding. The action shifts to San Francisco in 1973. A crusading journalist, Luisa Rey (Hallie Berry), obtains a confidential report about a possible meltdown at a nuclear power plant. An assassin stalks not only Luisa but also Dr. Isaac Sachs (Tom Hanks) who acted as the whistle-blower. The next story occurs in contemporary London. An ill-fated book publisher, Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent), goes into hiding after some thugs threaten him about royalty payments. Timothy's brother Denholme (Hugh Grant) arranges sanctuary for him. Timothy discovers too late that Denholme has committed him to a retirement home that he cannot leave. In the next story, set in Neo Seoul in 2144, a genetically-engineered female fabricant, Sonmi~451 (Donna Bae of ""The Host""), who toils in a fast-food restaurant, participates in a revolution against an Orwellian corporatocracy. The final story takes place after a planetary apocalypse in 2346. Meronym (Hallie Berry), a survivor of a technologically-advanced society, persuades a superstitious goat herder Zachry (Tom Hanks) to guide her up a treacherous mountain to an outpost named Cloud Atlas, so she can transmit a message to humans who have abandoned Earth and reside on distant planets. Zachry and Meronym speak in a Pidgin English dialect that audiences may find difficult to decipher.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis directed the Ewing chronicle and the two sci-fi sagas, while Tykwer helmed the episodes about the composer, the journalist and the publisher. They cross-cut erratically between these yarns so all six end up being one single story. One minute you're up to your neck in comedy, while the next minute you're plunged into a tragedy. The gimmick of casting actors in various roles doesn't always succeed. Indeed, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, and Hugh Grant aren't convincing as Asian characters. Ultimately, some plots emerge as more entertaining. The slapstick Timothy Cavendish plot surpasses the serious, straightforward ""Blade Runner"" plot about an insurrection in futuristic Korea. Part of the problem with ""Cloud Atlas"" is that none of the characters is remotely charismatic, and the plots are pretty lackluster, particularly Adam Ewing's adventures. Neither the Wachoswkis nor Tykwer develop a palatable sense of either tension or suspense in these stories. Sadly, despite its lofty ambitions, this derivative 163-minute melodramatic marathon suffers because nothing about it constitutes a revelation."

","This is a film I'd been looking forward to for months, all the more of a great disappointment. There wasn't a problem in following the various threads, it's not a new concept, think new age. But the director's aim went into every direction except letting me accept this film. Too often it felt manipulative, sometimes obviously so.<br/><br/>The best facets were the British scenario and the future story in Seoul. They seemed to enjoy the luxury of having the best direction and acting. Tom Hanks had some excellent scenes, but others fell flat, it was Tom Hanks playing ... said character, Halle Berry just didn't resonate for me. I kept seeing both actors for who they are, not who they were trying to convince me they were. Most of the makeup looked awkward, CGI would have benefited the story. One scene's character channeled Heath Ledger's ""Joker"", literally. <br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film, but yes, I'm sorry it did feel pretentious and self important more often than not."

I wanted to know more about some characters and less about others. Was Tom Hanks' character supposed to be going through Karma reincarnation as he played evil and good and bit parts. Matrix evil played his typical stereotype - intense, mean-spirited, and cruel. Thought the sex scenes in New Korea were unworthy and unnecessary - would could have figured that out in our heads, didn't need a porno show. Even my review is chaotic and split personality HAH.

","Cloud Atlas. It takes a lot for me to get inspired about a film and to write a review. You've accomplished that much and I thank you. Forget everything you've heard about this film from critics or whoever. <br/><br/>All their lives are connected as ours. After the movie let out, we went to a restaurant in our home town 20 miles from the theater and met a middle aged couple who were at that same restaurant, who had just gotten out of the movie. Crazy Stuff and proves this movies relates to all of our lives.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a modern day epic, that ties in the lives individuals reincarnated in different time periods. We follow the lives of an sick American who boards a ship to get cured of a disease and befriends a stowaway slave as they journey back to the US, A gay composer who works writing music for an old composer unable to write anymore. We follow a news reporter on a breakthrough discovery about corruption in energy, and a writer who must go into hiding in an retirement home to escape debtors after him. Finally this film takes us to a Korean future, where we follow a waitress who falls in love and could change life forever, in a Blade Runner esque utopia. Finally after the fall of civilization, something out of the dark ages, we follow the lives of a goat herder as he encounters other beings that change his world. And yes I am still talking about the same movie lol, The cinematography was beautiful on this film. The world the Wachowski brothers have made is a rich deep world, that you feel entrenched in and fall in love with it. The story was well written though if the film was a little longer and connected the stories better this would be a 10/10 for me. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry's acting was good in this film. With so many roles its hard to pick apart their acting. Ben Wishaw's and Jim Brodbent's highlighted the film with the best performances. The music was top notch, some of it composed by Tom Tyker and special effects were some of the best I've see ever. The themes of reincarnation, karma and so many other themes beautiful tie this film to our lives. <br/><br/>This movie is not something you can see once. To fully take in the symbolism, plot and characters you'll need a second viewing experience. And I'm OK with that. Because I believe years from now people will look at this film and remember it like a blade runner, or whatever movie it is. <br/><br/>Slightly flawed but overall amazing movie.

","Before I write this review, I want to apologize for being doubtful about this movie after watching the trailer thinking ""Oh this is another one of those movies where well-known cast boast their presence with stunning visual effects and abysmal plot."" when it is based on the novel that got numerous receptions and awards. The Cloud Atlas is about various people from different centuries experience incidents that simultaneously and magically get connected through a series of cut scenes. <br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this movie is the way they edited to help us catch up the multidimensional scenes. Chronologically, it contains 6 different stories that take us from the remote South Pacific in 19th century to a further post-apocalyptic future, the importance of editing and various roles from multicultural characters is blatantly crucial. This movie can be considered as gambling because of a giant blockbuster cast, the complicated theme that often perplexes audiences. Fortunately, the directors and crews manage to nail it.<br/><br/>The number of characters appear in the movie make me deeply think how challenging it must be for everyone to execute different roles to fit their assigned characters. The most memorable character for me is Sonmi-451 played by Doona Bae, the Korean actress whose native language is neither Spanish nor English which are used in this film. Sonmi-451 is basically a genetically engineered clone that is designed to forcefully serve at restaurant owned by the notorious organization called ""Papa song""(Gotta love the name!)in 2144 Seoul, South Korea.<br/><br/>As much as I love imagining the future, being able to experience the futuristic environment that consists of majestic skyscrapers that are connected by the transparent bridges where spiffy hybrid cars zipping around is really impressive. One drawback is the lack of originality because it reminds me of ""Tron legacy"" and the street of Midgar in Final Fantasy 7 in terms of looks and the fact that there are destitute citizens that include drug addicts, prostitutes, and bohemians who are under control of an autocrat. <br/><br/>No movies motivate me to write this much. There are still many things I would like to add but I better end it here before this review puts you into sleep. And last but not least, please let me share a few tips to those who are planning to watch this. <br/><br/>1. Try to pay close attention to the very beginning of the movie. The more you concentrate in the beginning, the easier for you to understand the entire plot.<br/><br/>2. Since each actor/actress in this movie is in charge of various roles, it will be difficult to figure it out everyone's identity. If you want to feel how much efforts they put in makeup, I suggest you to know the roles for each character ahead before watching it. The funny thing is even if you do, it will still be extremely hard to tell who they are. <br/><br/>3. This method might not work on others as there are different stories that often propel each other from time to time, try to grasp the flow of the movie by feeling instead of trying to scrutinizing each story by connecting them piece by piece. <br/><br/>Enjoy the movie."

Some talented director would have made 6 movies with this money, but the Watchowsky Brothers decided to make one movie with 6 stories, just to demonstrate that even if we die, love is a link between all our life. Brilliant but 3 hours to explain that, having sliced the stories in 30 seconds to 2 minutes slices jumping in time and going all over the place even in space?!?! Impossible to relate to any characters, hard to follow any stories, no suspense. <br/><br/>Worse, the music is awful, no epic theme, just a slow boring piano and string loop for 3 hours. I can remember 2 different themes no more in such a long movie. Where are the good composers who were doing music on screen? It is sounding like a long trailer and Audiomachine would have made a better job for the score. <br/><br/>There are maybe 2 action scenes hahaha... so awful, it is slow like ""Out of Africa"" without the picture, the light, the power and the music. I can love complex movies, but here, with modern computers, slicing movies all over the place is not something that deserves an Oscar, it can be done with an After Fx script! So if you want to loose 3 hours of your life go and see it. You have been warned, even in DVD: avoid."
"achyutaghosh","9","6","17","27 October 2012"," Cloud Atlas movie review- Ambitious, brilliant, epic!
","No movie in 2012 will split audience opinion as diametrically as Cloud Atlas. Some will find it ambitious, exhilarating, brilliant cinema, other will find it a ponderous mismatch of form and substance. Either case, it is a movie that is guaranteed to remain unforgettable, and if you, like me, belong to the former club, it will warrant multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Great source material is an essential ingredient to great movies- Cloud Atlas is based upon @David Mitchell's heady 2005 novel that chronicles six stories in different time-lines spanning over 600 years blending genres and tones to show the human soul moving from century to century, and explore how our actions in one life affect the next. While the stories in the book are linear, with one story ending leading to the next, the movie adaption takes liberties in narrative continuity, weaving the different story lines together adroitly to illustrate the interconnectivity of life in a way that may be confusing to start with, but rises to dizzying heights of creativity pretty quickly. <br/><br/>Chronologically, the tales start from mid 19th century where a would be slave trader has a life changing experience, to a distant post apocalyptic future where a cowardly tribesman guides a researcher, and segments in between times that include a gay musician trying to make a name for himself, a crooked publisher who gets served, a journalist investigates a nuclear power plant, a clone who seeks self actualization and in effect sparking a revolution in a dystopian Seoul in 2144 (my personal favorite). Not all the stories are outstanding, but all ARE involving in their own way. And what makes the movie more demanding than the book is that the same set of actors plays different characters in different stories as a result of which we see the faces we know so well going through the universal themes of greed, oppression, hatred, and redemption, and personifying that regardless of the time, the core human values of love, courage and freedom remain the same. <br/><br/>Much of the movie's genius is due to the actors, and with an A-list ensemble star cast comprising of Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon among others, you really cannot go wrong. Sometimes almost unrecognizable due to their excellent make-up, these titans do an excellent job in making the audience feel the range of emotions they go through, and believing in their predicament and the choices they face. My personal favorite here again was Hanks as the evil Dr. Henry Goose and cockney author Dermot Hoggins.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers, oops, can't say that any more as one of them has had a sex change, - Lana and Andy Wachowski are no strangers to futuristic cinema, but this movie is not just that genre- this is an epic adventure drama played across a canvas spanning many centuries and the sheer orchestration of this scale and characters is a wonder. The Wachowskis paired on this one with Tom Tykwer who gave us the classic Run Lola Run, and this time traveling, globe hopping extravaganza is not only a feast for the eyes, but also has moments of tenderness, humor, and suspense. Bottom-line- Cloud Atlas is surely easier to watch than to explain, so do not feel bad if you walk out of the nearly 3 hour long Cloud Atlas with more questions than answers- this is the kind of cinema that makes you think and ask questions now, and also 10 years down the line. Go on, enjoy some extraordinary quality cinema- 9/10"

","The motion picture of the year! It should be up for and win the Academy Award for Best Picture! If it doesn't, there's something wrong with the Academy. Cloud Atlas is a stunning combination of 4 or 5 different movies combined to make a statement about our humanity and connection with each other. I especially liked the convincing portrayal of people through time and space by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry (I now forgive her for her Catwoman role), Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving and other fine actors for stretching themselves (through use of makeup) in an actors dream roles. For all you New Age and Metaphysical believers, forget about all the other so-called ""New Age"" theme movies (The Secret,etc.) you have seen, this is the ""Metaphysical"" movie of all time (until a better movie of this type comes along). I especially like the ending where mankind connects up with their ""Outer Space"" brothers and sisters. So the movie is three hours long! Big Deal! For me, the movie went by real quick and I wanted more."

","They said that it couldn't be filmed. They said that David Mitchell's  Cloud Atlas  considered by many a literary masterpiece  with its  globe spanning, time-tripping plot could not be adapted for the big  screen due to the complexity that fell between the pages.  But that didn't seem to scare of a trio of directors  Tom Tykwer (Run  Lola Run), Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski (The Matrix)  from  signing on in an attempt to bring the literary adventure to the big  screen.  Accepting roles in the visionary adaptation were A-Listers Tom Hanks,  Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess and  Keith David. And with a screenplay adapted by Tykwer and the two  Wachowski's, Cloud Atlas rolled in front of the cameras late last year  and now has it's World Premiere at the Toronto International Film  Festival.  Multiple characters, eras and story lines have notary Adam Ewing (Jim  Sturgess  Above the Universe) keeping a journal on his voyage across  the Pacific Ocean in the 19th Century; A musician in 1931 Belgium who  writes of his experiences in a letter to his love; A journalist (Halle  Berry) who investigates a murder that has taken place at a nuclear  plant circa 1975; A publisher in modern day England and his pursuit by  gangsters; A clone is interviewed on the eve of her execution in  futuristic Korea; and a tribesman (Hanks) in post-apocalyptic Hawaii is  visited by a member of a dead civilization. The stories are intertwined  and jump rapidly between each arch sometimes in as little as just a few  seconds between swaps.  All of the above story lines are weaved together in a 163-minute  adventure drama that desperately tries to become the most audacious and  epic film of the 2012 theatrical release year.  And although we can agree that the term 'epic' is aptly applied, Cloud  Atlas is also a labyrinth mess of a film that will alienate and confuse  audiences more than having them engrossed in story development.  Tom Hanks is clearly the actor of focus embodying over 11 different  characters through the different time zones and stories. With the  exception of one storyline that has Hanks as a British thug who commits  a violent act towards a critic, Hanks' ability and presence keeps the  film afloat while the ship takes water. All other actors play multiple  roles all competently, even Hugo Weaving who in one story plays a Nurse  Ratchet type female caregiver.  All other stories with the exception of one where Jim Broadbent plays  an aging composer are interesting enough even if they don't grab  audiences in a way that would have one root for one specific  character's journey.  The story arc that is rooted in the future where a clone falls in love  with a human adds some punch and high tech effects which help pass the  far too stretched 160+ minute running time.  There are also some scenes of incredible violence in Cloud Atlas.  Throats get cut, people get thrown off buildings and Korean clone women  get strung up like meat cattle. The violence is graphic but it is also  awkward in a movie that doesn't seem to be able to find its true voice.  Cloud Atlas is therefore like a glass of cold, flat Coca-Cola. It does  satisfy an immediate desire for taste and sugar, but it's ultimately  unsatisfying and leaves you wishing you had ordered something else.  We will also predict that Cloud Atlas will not only be shut out of any  Oscar or awards conversations, but the estimated $100 million will be  very tough to recoup even with all that star power headlining the  poster."

","Mmmmm... purchased this movie last week on BD (fortunately second hand) and looking at the list of actors had very high expectations, but what an unfortunate mess it turned out to be. After a very long sit I still don't have a clue what the actual message of the movie is supposed to be. Sure, some of the special effects were interesting, but then again, a movie should be so much more than a collection of special effects. What bothered me most were the results of the make-up department, as to me, they delivered crappy and unbelievable older versions of some of the key characters. For the actors, I didn't get the feeling that they themselves had any clue what the movie was actually about, but I guess they couldn't say no to a nice paycheck. The idea of using alternating timelines in movies has been experimented with quite a bit, and this is a failed experiment that deserves no other place than Hollywood's garbage bin."

Quickly this is what I thought<br/><br/><ul><li>Too much mumbling. It washard enough to follow without trying to decipher the slurred mumbling. The mumbling was from Hanks on different islands and all sorts of different characters from all over the world at different random epochs with no attempt to connect them with a cogent plot -The plot was allover the place and all over the epochs. Ridiculous in the extreme. -Instead of everything being connected as is claimed by the promos, everything seemed badly disconnected. -It looked like they had a lot more fun making it than I had watching it -The futuristic Korean bits looked anything but slick. The torch the girls had would look prosaic for present day Korea let alone in the proffered future</li></ul><br/><br/>-Pretentious without any real substance -No plot tension. I was not hooked in in the first place so how could they hold my interest after that?

I usually don't write this badly; their fault for serving up this mess.<br/><br/>-Because there is a lot of overlapping obfuscation it does not make it profound. I thought it was a lazy movie with a big budget -Again and importantly- no suspense at all. You have to have some kind of suspense in a movie to give it credibility.<br/><br/>-When the plot, location and time of a movie is so unclear at least make sure the actors are not mumbling<br/><br/>-Polynesian style tattoos on people talking in slurred trailer trash style accents from a completely disconnected era does not make it deep or profound. It just makes it look like a self- indulgent sprawling pretentious mess. One character in a rare moment when I could make out what was said, remarks with great serendipity something about ""an exercise in futility"".

","45 minutes into this movie I decided to read some reviews. I can only come to the conclusion that those that liked it were only saying it because they got burned spending money on this completely boring movie and didn't want to be the only suckers to do so. Nothing about the first 45 minutes piqued my curiosity one bit. I looked at how long the movie was, then I looked at how much the budget was and how much revenue it generated and I came to a second conclusion, ""Could it be that the cast and crew were writing reviews here at IMDb to try and get the ratings up to deceive unsuspecting others to view this sporadically put together movie that completely lacks fluidity? It is not my cup of tea to have to play Rubik's cube in my mind while watching a movie.

The whole movie reeks of wanna-be intellectualism...and it's so sad that it has to be like that. All of the story lines are really boring...(annoying)like...nothing happens. The idea they're trying to sell is so simple...how could anyone thought that this poor idea could bring a fine and entertaining movie?

From the reviewers that I read, it seemed they all had read the book, this gave them a basic understanding of what the movie was about and where it was headed. We almost walked out but kept giving it another chance. I did not know going in that it was almost three hours long, so that was three hours of being basically lost. My wife and I kept looking at each other and neither of us could explain to the other what the heck was going on.

","This is the worst movie of the 21st Century by directors who know better. Or should know better.<br/><br/>We all know that great directors will have failures -- they all do, from Scorsese to Coppola to Nolan. (No doubt some of you will disagree, but Nolan's ""Inception"" was fatally flawed.) And here we have the Wachowskis, who have literally made one of the greatest movies of all time (""The Matrix""), wrote an absolutely brilliant film directed by another (""V for Vendetta""), and many other accomplishments. But with ""Cloud Atlas,"" they have made one of the worst movies ever made.<br/><br/>Now, non-linear storytelling is fine, if it works. Nicholas Roeg infamously used this technique successfully in a number of his films back in the '70s & '80s. If you're too young to have ever seen any of his films, then you think Quentin Tarantino is the ""father"" of non-linear storytelling. He's not. But Tarantino uses it quite astutely with his films, and probably no one today uses it better than him. But the Wachowskis? What DRUGS were they on when they wrote this script and/or edited this film? This is the worst use of non-linear storytelling I have EVER seen in my life. Abject failure.<br/><br/>The whole film is a failure, for way too many reasons to list here. I can only assume that those rating it highly, or calling it a ""masterpiece"" are either on the same drugs as the Wachowskis, or, they were won over by the cinematography, the special effects and the music. But these elements do not by themselves make a good or great film.<br/><br/>The overall problems:<br/><br/>SCRIPT/STORY: A mess. Not coherent, full of unmotivated actions by the characters, with plot points that don't make ANY sense, etc.<br/><br/>CAST: The entire cast of this film is bad. Mediocre acting from pretty much everyone, even Hanks. (Although to be fair, I think it's more the bad writing/dialogue's fault than Hanks. And the fault of the directors.)<br/><br/>DIRECTING: Horrible. F'ing horrible.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY (and Production Design): Very nice. But I don't want to spend 3 hours watching something ""nice."" That's not what movies are about. If I want to look at nice images, I'll go to the f**king art museum.<br/><br/>So you've been warned. Watch at your own risk. As to the ""point"" of this story, about past/present/future lives, and how we may re-incarnate and reconnect with people we've known in other lives... I just couldn't imagine a worse execution of this premise than this film. There probably never will be a worse film done around this premise."

","""Cloud Atlas"" the novel struck me when I read it as the kind of book that would be pretty much unfilmable, and seeing this hot mess of an adaptation has not changed my mind.<br/><br/>How to explain ""Cloud Atlas?"" Several stories set over different time periods -- the oldest set in the mid-19th century, the latest set in an apocalyptic future -- are connected through works of art, mostly of the written word, created in each that are then consumed by characters in the other stories. For those of you who remember freshman English, the plot is much more important than the story. This is a book about big themes, not individual characters. It's a grand thing to read, and one of the best books I've read in recent memory.<br/><br/>The movie boldly tries to be faithful to the book, which is an admirable ambition but also is its failing. There's simply too much to get through, and the film spends more time on telling the stories than developing the themes. It makes a valiant effort to include all the connections the book does, and I actually quite liked the end, which does bring everything together rather nicely, but I'd given up on the movie by then, which comes at you like a never-ending assortment of random scenes.<br/><br/>A conceit the movie explores which wasn't available as an option for the book is having the same actors play various characters throughout the film. It's a good way to literally link the stories to one another. However, it just doesn't work. It's like a variation on ""Around the World in 80 Days,"" where you're so distracted by trying to identify the actors that you forget to pay attention to the movie. It doesn't help that the makeup is rather awful, and actors like Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant and Halle Berry look noticeably uncomfortable under the heaps of prosthetics they're asked to wear. Some of Hanks' makeup looks as outrageous as that to be found in the ""Austin Powers"" movies, with the major difference being that the makeup in those films was played for gags, whereas we're supposed to take the ""Cloud Atlas"" makeup straight.<br/><br/>I'm fairly curmudgeonly when it comes to giving movies kudos for ambition alone. If you're going to take on something as exceptional as ""Cloud Atlas,"" do it right or all you've succeeded in doing is ruining it.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

It is just different stories being spliced together and held under the same banner with a narrative that preaches that things are connected. The past, present, future, so on so forth, even when we die, every kindness, every crime is interrelated to the other.<br/><br/>What a load of garbage.<br/><br/>Best analogy is that, we can have a movie with the tagline ""Every movie is connected"". We just have to take Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, and Avatar and edit them along their similar setups in between one another, and add a narrative that forces them to relate, and we will just as well have a complete story.<br/><br/>This is just a time waster if you have three hours to waste.

","It seems normal nowadays to watch a sensational movie trailer and assume the movie will be great, based on what you had seen -- until you go see it in theatres and suddenly the trailer contained 85% of what little goodness such a movie managed to muster up. This is becoming all too common.<br/><br/>But this is not the case with Cloud Atlas. <br/><br/>The trailer alone screamed 'Perpetual, epic, and sensational'... and the film absolutely blew the preview away.<br/><br/>The movie takes us on a journey between six story lines from mid 1800s to our post apocalyptic earth, jumping in an intuitive flow-of-consciousness manner from story to story in a completely unlinear way. It takes about 40 minutes of this nearly 3 hour movie for the entire stage to be firmly set in the viewer's mind -- but once it is, you fall in love with each character and embark with them on their journeys through space and time. The story lines, the screenplay, the ensemble cast, the visuals, and the heart of the story that seems so intuitively inspired work together so flawlessly that you may forget you've been shifting nervously in a butt-numbing theatre chair for three hours. Prepare to laugh, cry, twist your face in ways you never expected to (the movie has a very... visual nature to it), and to fidget dramatically with your thumbs. <br/><br/>Though there are a few minor gripes. <br/><br/>Watching the cast jump gender gaps, races etc can be hilarious... simply because the makeup doesn't always work out. The makeup use is very extreme, and it is usually implemented well, but sometimes shouts through the story ""Hey, I'm definitely Hugo Weaving, though I clearly shouldn't be.""<br/><br/>But the movie is guaranteed to polarize audiences into groups of 'that was awesome!' And 'that was a waste of time'. Simply put: if the extended trailer speaks to you in some profound way, or elicits a desire to watch it, this movie is for you. Some people just don't appreciate the way the story is told... its a right brained thing. And right brained people will get the most out of this movie because of our ability to transcend sequential narratives. Left brained people will be left trying to deeply analyze a single, monural instrument and instead miss the intricate orchestral work in the stereo field. <br/><br/>In short: if you like the preview, this movie will deliver way beyond expectations. For what it's worth, I guarantee it will leave you knowing you've witnessed the cinematic experience of the century."

","""Just trying to understand why we keep making the same mistakes."" Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) <br/><br/>What did I expect from filmmakers responsible for Matrix and Run Lola Run? A complicated, philosophical treatise on humanity—of course! But Cloud Atlas is more than that: It's a convoluted thriller with intersecting segments that eventually spell out humanity's penchant for good and evil, its ability to reinvent itself, and its undying connection down through the ages and into the future: We make the same mistakes, we get better at them, and we sacrifice to make the world a better place.<br/><br/>As director/writers Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, and Lana Wachowski spin the filmed version of David Mitchell's murderous, new-age, sci-fi novel, they create individual stories of oppression and redemption, tied together by the common bond of humanity and some very smooth cross cutting. The six stories, covering the five centuries through 2024, treat slavery of several kinds, care of the elderly, corporate crime, and a robotic working class up to the aftermath of the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Although the first hour of the almost three hours is confusing and slow, eventually the characters become recognizable and comprehensible (helped subtly by the same actors playing different parts) to the extent that we care what happens to them and ultimately the human race. Stay for the credits to identify the multiple roles each actor plays (some may surprise you).<br/><br/>Going into the film, I had a suspicion that I was going to see a version of Terrence Malick's abstract Tree of Life. Au contraire, Cloud Atlas is an action film about good guys from the past and the future running from bad guys; the key, however, is that everything that happens has ramifications for the past or the future. The weakness of this grand action is that there are too many characters and actions, weakening each with the overlay of the other.<br/><br/>Notice I haven't even tried to explain the plot although all strands intersect in humanity's enduring struggle for freedom be it the 24th century post-apocalyptic survivor Zachary (Tom Hanks) joining with a visiting space lady (Halle Berry) or an 1849 runaway slave (David Gyasi) aided by a young sailor (Jim Sturgess). In each segment, slavery of some sort is the catalyst for rebellion. It's hard not to see contemporary parallels in warring states of Africa or even in the great divide between the wealthy and the other percent in the US.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is not on Cloud Nine: Its adventures may be too many, but its themes are consistent, universal, and real and its actors some of the best of the day. It beats Kevin James's Zookeeper."

","While I have come to value IMDb.com for the wealth of information it offers on the world of film, the many high rankings for Cloud Atlas were another reminder that the site too often elicits views from those easily impressed with the ephemera of epic attempts at film entertainment without looking for the real artistic depth that makes a great film. Like the hugely inflated rankings for Inception (a film that I also ranked at four stars), Cloud Atlas is a picture that tries hard (harder even) to be too many things, ultimately relying on too many cool visuals, popular faces, and dumbed-down feel-good philosophizing to make its point.<br/><br/>Now that I have thoroughly alienated myself from many readers for what could be seen as the inherently condescending/pretentious view of a middle-aged professional reviewer, I may as well heighten your outrage by noting that longer experience with the tools of film, and storytelling tends to leave you with a more discerning critical apparatus.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this movie. I love a well-made epic, I was fascinated with David Mitchell's take on the pomo-novel, and I believe that the film's directing team came to the material with good intentions (I even liked the first Matrix movie). The art direction and use of CGI technology is excellent, and their choice to juxtapose the competing plots of the different stories in a more basic parallel fashion than the novel was probably the only way to attempt an adaptation. A couple of the separate stories actually work well enough in a stand-alone way. But the best intentions can still go awry. Perhaps this novel simply shouldn't't have been adapted to film at all.<br/><br/>Fact is, there are so many things wrong with this movie that you would have to sit down with your finger on the play/pause button of a DVD player in order to list them all. I'm not going to take the time to do that but...<br/><br/>Mitchell's novel is a challenging work that does not dumb down the central insights in the way that the directorial team has with their incessant platitudes and those oh-so knowing looks on actor's faces that figure repeatedly in attempts at profundity. I hope the author got a hefty fee for the film rights to Cloud Atlas, which would help him from cringing too much at the final product.<br/><br/>Then there's the issue of casting famous and not-so-famous faces. At times the quick edits from one story to another left me rolling my eyes, especially at Tom Hanks' one-dimensional earnestness, Halle Berry's affected concern, and Hugo Weaving's oh-so-predictable expressions of evil. Kudos to Jim Broadbent for being the only prominent name who is convincing - (maybe because he got to handle the funnier stuff?), along with rising stars Jim Sturgess, James D'Arcy and Ben Whishaw. Doona Bae impressed me too except that some of her lines in some of the most important moments were virtually unintelligible.<br/><br/>As for Hugh Grant, take satisfaction in the fact that he is usually so covered in latex as to be unrecognizable. Yes folks, there's enough latex here to keep a condom factory rolling for months, but all that latex and exotic henna designs on faces still can't disguise when it's old ""awe-shucks"" Forrest Gump underneath the rubber, especially when Hanks mangles one accent after another, scene after painful scene. It's such a shame that big films like this have to feature a few Hollywood names to get the production money. Like Jack Nicholson, Hanks is one of those names who just comes off as himself, trying however valiantly to inhabit a character he's not suited to.<br/><br/>Halle Berry is more of a hollow presence, though for a few moments in her scenes with Keith David things hint temptingly at the aura of '70s Blacksploitation movies. Susan Sarandon is just simply a waste of Susan Sarandon. She could be strolling some red carpet event for all the weight she gets to show in this picture, with almost no lines to speak.<br/><br/>Sarandon's bit-part also highlights the poor integration of minor characters in the sprawling mish-mash of periods and places that are thrown together. I pity anyone who hasn't read the book just for the basic understanding it would bring to explaining certain scenes (such as Adam Ewing's return from Asia near the end). Without that, some scenes would be completely meaningless.<br/><br/>At nearly three hours the film is at once too long and too short: long in the rudimentary way it tries to drill home the central thread that ""everything is connected"" (did the directors do too much acid?), and short because it would take a mini-series to really penetrate the deeper nuances of character that you get in the novel. Of course one expects the film to be a different thing than the book. It's a completely different medium, but the real fault here is in the tone.<br/><br/>A truly great film would have led each individual viewer to make their own connections to the various themes and parallel story lines, but this movie has to nail them home for us.<br/><br/>Call me a curmudgeon, but if you haven't seen Cloud Atlas, don't trust all those younger, more easily impressed viewers who ranked it at 8, 9 or 10. Sorry kids, but it doesn't come close. Learn something about film history before you try to argue how it deserves such accolades.<br/><br/>At best, the film looks good and offers a couple of well-told tales interwoven in the rest of the mess. At worst, the landscape is defined too simplistically. The atmosphere in this atlas is too thin, and not cloudy enough for my imagination."
"Agent10","9","6","18","27 October 2012"," A great achievement in filmmaking
","In all the years I've loved and enjoyed movies, one thing that has become consistent with the current trend of filmmaking is the lack of passion. We see tons of movies all the time that simply wish to make money and bore us with their product tie-ins in tow. But Cloud Atlas, thankfully, bucks that trend.<br/><br/>It is only fitting that a wonderful group of talented individuals congregated to make this film, beginning with the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. Despite their two different viewpoints of filmmaking, combined to make a consistently beautiful piece of film that flows as perfectly as time itself. Never once did this film feel like a three-hour epic, much in the same way one can watch Magnolia and never feel like your time has been intruded upon. While the whole idea of connectivity beckons like any edict from a far eastern religion, it is done so in a way that allows us to see the obvious connections without noticing the lesser ones (staying for the credits certainly helped with that, though I wished they hadn't revealed those connections). Some might think the $100 million price tag is a bit much for a rather dangerous ""art"" film, I think the crew managed it quite well considering so many big movies need $150+ just to pay for the sound and visual effects. It comes as no surprise to me that X Filme was the primary production company, for the European filmmaking mindset (which isn't totally concerned with money) was far more suited for this production. I'm sure many will call it a failure due to the many years it will take to recoup the money, but sometimes, art needs to appreciate in order to make its money.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas wasn't perfect, but the problems were purely nominal. I'm talking about the make-up, which was a no win situation from the beginning. You just can't make someone Caucasian look like a real Asian, and vice versa. I don't know, perhaps it would have been better to not change their appearance at all, possibly adding another layer of connectivity that is only obvious to the audience, a bit of dramatic irony so to speak. Either way, I was more than happy with the end product."

","The Short: Critics be darned, Cloud Atlas is incredible. Ambitious, insanely well told, brilliantly crafted and incredibly complex, Cloud Atlas is truly a sight to behold. It's a rough diamond a film, but for those who invest in it will find the payoff extremely rewarding like no other movie before it.<br/><br/>Review - When is the last time a movie gave you a headache? Not because of the shaky cam, terrible acting, etc. etc. When was the last time a movie gave you a headache because you actually had to think?<br/><br/>As I sit down to write this review, I simply can't express it any other way but this: Cloud Atlas is incredible. It reminds me of the first time I saw The Matrix. It's intriguing world and complex conundrums wowed me and thrilled me long after seeing it. It's the same with Cloud Atlas. I didn't think that the Wachowski's could pull off yet again another sprawling spider web of complexity, but they have.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas features an incredible plot, all of which I believe is well told. It's not until the final few minutes that everything comes together in incredibly clever ways. It all makes sense in the end, but you can't go on autopilot and simply ""enjoy"" Cloud Atlas (which is it's major downfall). Cloud Atlas is best described as a puzzle, and it's presented that way too. You'll be piecing everything together until those last moments, making Cloud Atlas's finale a huge payoff.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas also shines due to its incredible casting. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, and more play multiple characters in multiple time periods. The acting is (save for a few roles) surprisingly serviceable. Since these actors play multiple roles, it's interesting how they synthesize and bring together elements from the plot and character archetypes so well. And it's great to see Hugo Weaving as an oppressive and gigantic German female nurse.<br/><br/>Everything else is icing on the cake. The cinematography is indeed epic, the presentation is phenomenal, the special effects are amazing, and the sheer scope of some of the scenery is truly incredible. Segways into new scenes are very well thought out, which are one of the best things of the film.<br/><br/>Now while Cloud Atlas's story, characters, and sheer ambition shine brightly, it's not without its hiccups. Cloud Atlas comes together in the end very well, but the whole movie is freaking complex they barely give you any breathing room to process connections and ideas. Cloud Atlas is an exhausting film, but I mean that positively. The comedy sections do give you a chance to breathe, but only until the next scene. They also could've done without some of the stronger innuendo, and the beginning of Adam's story is, lets just say, there for a political agenda of which I don't approve of. Oh, and Hugo Weaving looks very creepy as an Asian person.<br/><br/>Rounding it all out is the star of the show: The Cloud Atlas Sextet. The soundtrack is beautiful, but this original symphonic piece is unlike anything in a soundtrack I've ever heard that was part of a movie soundtrack. It's sweeping, beautiful, and each movement tells a story: that very same story you are watching on screen. <br/><br/>In the end, what is Cloud Atlas? An ambitious, incredibly thorough and complex epic piece of filmmaking that will have you glued to your seat the whole 2 hour and 43 minute run time. Granted, some may be overly bored in Cloud Atlas, which is a shame. Cloud Atlas respects the movie goer, making them think and giving just enough payoff to keep you begging for more. <br/><br/>4.5/5 stars - high recommendation"

And to understand the heart of the story, it needed to be done this way. I'm a rare cryier, but at the end of the film I was sobbing. Not because of sorrow, because of a restored faith in humanity, in today, in myself.<br/><br/>It's not a The Fountain, Tree of Life, Inception ( Which I love) where you watch, and re-watch to gain meaning. It's simple in it's complexity . The only thing is that there are very graphic love scenes, gory violence and language that doesn't move the story forward, it was pure shock factor.

","This movie was, for me, doomed by one thing and on thing only: the editing. I HATED HOW THIS MOVIE WAS EDITED. At first, you'd get introductions for each story. Those intros are merely glimpses of each stories. After the glimpses, we'd jump back and forth from the 1800s to the 1930s, 70s, present day, the ""high-tech"" future and the apocalyptic future. This choice of editing bothered me throughout the entire film. I was unable to identify and connect with the characters. Also, because of the editing, I didn't spot the connections between the stories. I only noticed them after reading the film's plot on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>NOTE: After reading ""Cloud Atlas'"" Wikipedia article, I actually thought the movie had a strong plot (hence, I gave it half a star). If I reviewed this film and not read the Wikipedia article, I'd give the movie 0 stars if I could. <br/><br/>P.S. I'm not really sure if the 3 ""past sequences"" take place in the 1800s, 1930s or 1970s. I can't remember. ALSO, I'm new here. I don't know if I could actually give 0 stars."

","This film is based on the book game where you have to find a small character (Wally) hidden among a complex picture of similar people and objects. Each page of the book is set in a different scene –the seaside, a park, etc. In this film you have to find famous, and not so famous, actors (male and female), who play different parts in six different time-lines. It does sound a bit easy, but the actors are helped by a large make-up and special effects team.<br/><br/>The majority of the actors in this film are of Anglo Saxon origins, so the directors Tom Tykwer, and Andy & Lana Wachowski make it easy for you to find Halle Berry, Keith David, and Xun Zhou, for obvious cultural reasons, despite their acting skills. Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon, and Jim Sturgess are more difficult to find in some scenes, as they do some quite decent acting. Tom Hanks on the other hand, is very easy to find in each story, as in all his films, he plays himself with the addition of the props department. <br/><br/>Now the most difficult things to find are the plot and the point of the film. The story line jumps around from the 19th to the 23rd century, through 1930's Cambridge, and 1970' New York. And the idea of the film seems to be about whether or not we should open or close connected doors through time, on the 'journey of life'. The music is the standard 'four violins and a piano'; extra violin for intense scenes.<br/><br/>So, if you want to play this game - have fun, but for almost 3 hours, you may need to swap the XL cola for an XXL Red Bull. And don't worry, if you don't manage to find all the actors, all their characters are revealed at the end of the movie. You'll be aghast!"

","I'm not here for a sound bite, I've now seen this twice and although the scenery and in some cases makeup and costumes are beautiful the movie itself is a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>I had no problem following the individual threads, but some of them were vastly better than others. Anytime Jim Broadbent was on the screen it started to feel a little like a poor Carry On film (UK members will remember these) although he does a decent enough job and to his credit his character was on of the few I really clicked with.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is, as always giving it his all, sometimes a bit too much in fact, but his acting, even in drag is more convincing than that of Hanks or Berry.<br/><br/>The film though isn't let down by acting it's let down by the mish-mash editing, I genuinely felt like they could have made several short films instead as I really couldn't have cared what happened to any of the characters, especially as we reached the end, at which point I wanted them all to die for boring me silly for the past 2 hours 45 mins.<br/><br/>It only got worse on the second viewing a few weeks later, as I was sure I'd missed something. This is a Marmite film, you'll either love it or hate it and you'll probably know within the first 30 minutes whether it's worth continuing, if you find you haven't clicked with any characters by that point I suggest doing the ironing, picking your nose or sucking on ice cubes instead, it'll be far more enjoyable."
"worldbarrow","1","3","7","10 June 2013"," Makes 'The Fountain' seem like 'Casablanca'
","The multiple lives of individuals are traced across identities and eras. At least, they should have been. In most of the roles in Cloud Atlas, the casting of single actor in multiple roles was presumed to illustrate their connection, but the effect ranges from completely unnoticeable to completely ludicrous. I have not read the novel on which this was based, but the film plays as a collage or DJ mix of assorted bad movies. The editing feat is actually impressive because we don't have to commit to watching any of the bad movies in their entirety. The only story that holds together is in the roles of Jim Broadbent as a famous composer who wishes to steal the films eponymous piano concerto written by an amanuensis. In his subsequent life, Broadbent's character is a struggling publisher harried over payment for a document. There is no other clear analogy between the character's serial lives, and the filmmakers seem satisfied by the discontinuity, hiding actors in ridiculous makeup, representing awkward racial changes, and generally failing to tell the story they are following. It was not necessary to makeup inhabitants of the futuristic Seoul to 'look Asian'. It wasn't necessary for everyone in the post-apocalyptic future to speak like voodoo witch-doctors. I was sad to see these actors used up, choked for stupid accents, and prodded through roles that weren't so badly written as they were played under such incompetent theatrical direction. As an epic failure, this reminds me of Dune, but that wasn't David Lynch's fault. I don't blame Lana Wachowski for becoming a woman, but I might blame her for thinking that her actors identities were as mutable as her own. Honestly, I enjoyed the potential of this film enough to call its failure unforgivable, and it's a bad ad for an author who is worth consideration."
"Ben_Horror","10","3","7","5 March 2013"," Clever... Ambitious... Entertaining... Epic...
","So here is a movie that has everything: gore, sci-fi, violence, drama, action and huge visual effects Yet it's very telling that when it came out in the US it flopped. Big-time. There were lots of walkouts because it was 'too hard to follow' for some and 'too boring' for others. For a generation weaned on endless Michael Bay helmed Transformers toys advertisements – sorry: movies - or regurgitated Spider-Man remakes/reboots/prequels/sequels/who-the-hell-cares, Cloud Atlas committed the ultimate sin: it was a movie that strayed from accepted convention, playing out multiple story lines that seemed unconnected over a huge ass-numbing running time. Punters voted the only way they knew how: with their pockets. Simply put, they stayed away in droves. <br/><br/>And who could blame them? After all, it wasn't a reboot; it had no fighting robots and featured no vampires. However, this is exactly what makes the reception to the film all the more telling because - get this - Cloud Atlas is an exceptionally brilliant movie. Even more tellingly, it's (A) Easy to follow – the stories are surprisingly simplistic - and (B) not boring at all – the movie, in fact, moves at a very fast pace. It's very telling that even after you take those aspects into account, it still managed to go over US audiences' heads. So what was the problem, if any? It seems Cloud Atlas's biggest sin was it attempted to be bold, ambitious and original - probably not the kind of thing that would go down too well with an audience waiting for the latest Marvel rehash.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas tells the somewhat fanciful stories of people and events that while happening far apart from each other – mostly in other times - are intricately linked beyond time/space. It may sound unwieldy at first but it works: a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) on an ocean voyage is being slowly poisoned by his greedy doctor (a brilliant Tom Hanks); a sassy journalist (Halle Berry in top form) is investigating some nefarious matters concerning a nuclear plant; a revolt by robots (fabricants) in a futuristic Korea is being suppressed by authorities; some senior shenanigans goings-on at an old folks' home where a literary agent is sequestered; there's post- apocalyptic bloodletting in an age many centuries from now and finally, two composers war over a piece of music which they're claiming equal ownership of – the 'Cloud Atlas' sextet of the title. <br/><br/>While this may sound like a storyline that is has too much going on for its own good with its 'everything but the kitchen sink thrown in' approach, it still works and there is a reason for it. If there is one thing that has been overlooked with Cloud Atlas it has to be the remarkable feat of editing. Surely, this has to be one of the best edited movies in years? Editor Alexander Berner has no fewer than six stories to juggle, which in lesser hands, could have been a huge 'throw it at the wall and see what sticks' mess, but in Berner's hands, the stories are inter-weaved and played out to perfection. There's a lot of ground to cover here. When juggling that amount of stories, the editor has to have the precision of a surgeon. It's a balancing act for sure: when do you cut away? When do you return to a story? When do you introduce a new story? When do you cut away from that and go to the next strand? And so on. It was a massive - nay, typical - oversight on behalf of the Academy that it wasn't even nominated.<br/><br/>The cast are great too and play multiple roles across the vast layers of stories: Tom Hanks doing the best Irish?/British?/Scottish? accent this side of Dick Van Dyke and Halle Berry playing a white woman that resembles Madonna back in her 'Vogue' days; Jim Sturgess playing an Asian (with a distinct Neo-vibe from The Matrix) and Hugo Weaving playing a chilling demonic entity - there is no-one dragging their weight here; everyone is giving it one-hundred per cent. While some have sniffed at the notion of white people playing other races, it's important to point out that blacks and Asians also play whites in this movie. In fact, there's a strange fascination in trying to spot who's playing who in what era/role – kind of a generational 'Where's Wally?' if you will. <br/><br/>This approach may have been budget-driven; after all, if you're going outside the so-called 'Hollywood system' to independently fund a movie, doesn't it make financial sense to have you're A-Listers playing more than one role? Why hire others to play them? Furthermore, it also indirectly benefits the whole mystical conceit that we are all linked through time – would the movie be as effective if different people were playing these roles? Who knows.<br/><br/>Like the 'Tree of Life' before it, it's been favorably compared to another not exactly mainstream movie: '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Both mix story and theme strands, but while Tree of Life maybe be the more Kubrickian, it has to be said that on the whole, Cloud Atlas is the more successful of the two, expertly weaving and interweaving to perfection the multiple scenarios that are cross-cutting across the huge running time. <br/><br/>This movie could easily be put in the 'don't make 'em like they used to' category: just when you thought that large, epic filmmaking was a relic of the past, here comes Cloud Atlas to shift your views: it's huge and dazzling entertainment, for sure, but the really telling thing is although it's juggling six story lines for almost three hours, it remains riveting the whole way. Brilliantly directed by Tom Tyker and the Wachowskis with a great musical score, Cloud Atlas is nothing short of a criminally underrated classic. Watch it and you will be transported, spellbound, touched and more importantly, entertained."
"nrbarton","9","3","7","28 February 2013"," Cloud Atlas is wildly ambitious and deeply philosophical
","Each time I consider where to begin reviewing 'Cloud Atlas' my head feels like it's about to explode 'Scanners' style. My mind flicks back through the movie and its various stories and times. Where do I even begin with such a film? It's based on a book by David Mitchell, which I haven't read but I hear it was considered unfilmable by many. This adaptation is written for the screen and Directed by Tom Tykwer ('Perfume', 'Run Lola Run') and the duo formerly known as The Wachowski brothers ('The Matrix' Trilogy, 'Bound' and writers of' V For Vendetta'). I say formerly because Larry Wachowski is now Lana Wachowski. I'll quote the trivia section on her IMDb page to clear this up:<br/><br/>""Understood to have had gender reassignment surgery after ""Speed Racer"" in 2008. For 10 years beforehand, it is believed that Lana was having hormone therapy. Her first public interview after revealing herself as Lana came at a press conference to discuss 'Cloud Atlas', where she fielded questions about her private life with resigned good humor. Her brother Andy, to whom she is very close, is fiercely protective of his sister and supportive of her struggle to live in her authentic gender role.""<br/><br/>Not really relevant to the movie but it was an interesting fact I thought I'd share as confused me for a while. I thought Andy Wachowski was now working with a new sister, which I suppose in a way he is. Anyway, I'm very happy for her and she looks great in interviews promoting 'Cloud Atlas', especially sporting some funky pink dreads.<br/><br/>'Cloud Atlas' is about five, six, I don't know how many movies in one, and is one of the most ambitious films ever made, if not the most. It's intelligent, profound, thought-provoking and mind-boggling in scope and philosophy. It's also wild, crazy, unhinged and downright odd.<br/><br/>Not only does it frequently switch story, but also time, and the tone is all over the place. One minute you'll be watching a serious period piece about a classical composer and the next minute a futuristic dystopian Science-Fiction film, then a seventies conspiracy thriller, then a comedy about the elderly set in present time, then some jungle tribes fighting and a man being harassed by some sort of green goblin demon. It's both completely nuts and deeply intelligent, and this combination delighted me and my thirst for groundbreaking cinema.<br/><br/>The film has a wealth of top actors including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and Doona Bae. The characters in the different times are played by the same actors and have to deal with similar crises and decisions at times. The obvious interpretation is the movie is about reincarnation, but I don't think it's that rigid or that you have to believe in reincarnation to appreciate it. One clear message from the movie is the question it poses, ""Why do humans continue to make the same mistakes over and over?"" and this is a very good question, as is the idea that this cycle can be broken.<br/><br/>One character makes positive decisions in his past which shapes his similar decisions in the future life. Another character makes very bad decisions in some lives, shown to wrestle with his conscience in other lives but ultimately makes positive, vital decisions for the future of humanity. The idea that our future selves' decisions can be shaped by our decisions is an interesting and important one. Even discarding reincarnation, could the future of the human race become better, or inferior, through decisions we make now? Of course it can and the idea that one person can make a difference, despite just being a drop in the ocean is also true, but, as the movie states, an ocean is made up of drops. Can the future human race be genetically better, or inferior, due to the decisions we make now? Well, this is more debatable and evolution is a very mysterious thing, but I'd say yes also. Are certain people destined to meet? Probably not but it's a beautiful thought. These are just some of the deeply profound questions and ideas the movie covers.<br/><br/>At almost three hours running time, and feeling more like six due to all the various plot/times, this is one of the best value-for-money cinema experiences you'll ever have. It's also certain to be one of the finest movies of 2013, even if I expect it's too deep, challenging and demanding for your average cinema-goer. It is a rather hard going and odd film that's bound to attract its fair share of haters but I think it will be loved and appreciated by more.<br/><br/>The only criticisms I have are that some stories worked better than others, and also there were some seriously dodgy make-up jobs at times. I sympathise with the special effects artists as not easy to make young people look old, Oriental people look Caucasian and a man look like a woman, and at times they did as good a job as could possibly be expected. However, there were other times it looked so fake it was funny, but in a way this just added to the zaniness of the whole project. It was quite an odd contrast to sometimes being one of the most visually impressive Science-Fiction movies ever.<br/><br/>Even just for the bravery and wild ambition I loved 'Cloud Atlas', but it was also profound, philosophical, thought-provoking and, at times, deeply moving. I consider it a flawed masterpiece where even its flaws have a certain charm. Nobody can deny this is a very special and unique project, and films this special don't come along often.

","Having just finished Lost, which I loved (although too many episodes for my liking), whilst sitting through this mess of a film I couldn't help but compare the two. Both were originally created in 2004, with the major difference being one is great, one is shite. Both were about past life's, the future and good vs evil.<br/><br/>The last episode of Lost is up there with the last ep of Six Feet Under, over whelmingly emotional, and one which really makes you think about your life. You cared for the characters, you were on their side. Where as you couldn't give a hoot about any of the 1 <br/><br/>The trailer looked great but the film was a joke, with some of the worst acting I've seen in years. As for some of the accents, simply woeful. I didn't give a toss for one character in the film, apart from the writer, mainly because it was like watching Benny Hill.<br/><br/>It's long, boring, messy, overly complicated and poorly acted with a very poor script.<br/><br/>People seemed to be to easily pleased or maybe I'm hard to please.

","What is this movie about exactly? It is a meshing of several stories. Six and a seventh. You will ask yourself, how do I keep track? The trouble is, you can't. I suggest going to Wicki on the Internet and read the synopsis. Only then will you glimpse the meaning of this movie. A science fiction piece? Perhaps. It is about lives intertwining through time by karma or something else. It's just shy of three hours. Think you can sit your way through something that long before you begin to ask yourself, what am I doing? Granted, the acting is great. The cinematography is great. They spent oodles of money on this project. About 140 million. It shows. You can't complain about the production being of quality. But if you are no nonsense and demand clarity of a storyline, this won't easily yield anything. You are going to have to come up with significance for yourself. This isn't going to tell you what to think. The most interesting story of the six is the one of the futuristic Fabricants. Now, that is science fiction and that ""part"" was edgy and captivating. It could stand alone as a small movie by itself. Of the six this is the one worth mentioning. I suggest you ask yourself if you can afford three hours of your time without really having any satisfaction. If the answer is yes, go ahead and watch this. I had nothing better to do so I don't feel that bad, but I wonder how is something this schizophrenic can be made? Apparently Tom Hanks is the answer.

Instead, we're left with a number of wide shots and great looking environments for brief amounts of time before we're whisked away to the next story line.<br/><br/>Let me make it clear early on: I WAS NOT CONFUSED, NOR LOST AT ANY POINT DURING THIS FILM. I UNDERSTOOD IT FROM START TO FINISH AND SAW ALL THE THEMES IT WAS GOING FOR. The criticism I hear being thrown from the defenders of the film to its detractors is that ""you didn't understand it"". Well, I did. It's still not very good.<br/><br/>This film is not even that complicated. The themes are quite straight forward, and it's clear what they are from the very beginning. The problem was, they were never all that compelling. Sure, there was the potential for a great ending, but it all turned out pretty cliché and disappointing.<br/><br/>I won't go as far as to say, like many critics, that the film is borderline pretentious, because I don't think it is. Normally, I like these kinds of films and I was really hoping to like Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>Other problems with the film is the tiring Wachowski directing, especially during the action sequences. I was reminded not too fondly of the dreadful Matrix sequels and their flashy and unbelievably unrealistic fight scenes.<br/><br/>The dialogue turned out to be pretty flat at times as well, opting for clichés and simplicity more than anything.<br/><br/>One thing I did really enjoy, however, was Tom Hanks and his many portrayals. He managed to melt into his roles and brought me back to the great Hanks films of the last two decades."

If you carefully watch each ""story within the story"", you will see how it pieces together and the interconnectedness amongst the characters or stories.<br/><br/>In a nutshell though, I have not watched a movie that I have loved as much as Cloud Atlas. I have many favorites that are, of course, favorites amongst many others. Cloud Atlas was not heavily advertised in my city. Perhaps it was and I just never saw it but I remember looking online shortly after the film was released in theaters; I was trying to come to a decision as to what movie I wanted to see. There were several that had been advertised quite heavily and though I would see one of them. I came across Cloud Atlas, briefly read the synopsis and though that this film could be good.

","I went to watch this movie with high expectations, and I didn't get what I wanted completely. So I'll explain you what not to expect in this movie, so you enjoy watching it thoroughly. After watching the trailer, I always asked my self how can such a movie suffer from not-so-good box office results? Well, after watching the movie itself, I got my answer. It now seems reasonable to me why this movie didn't sell that good: It tries to be a complicated masterpiece, but it fails to do so. I will first explain the good part then I'll get into what the movie fails at.<br/><br/>The movie switches between 6 different story-lines in different times and even different genres of film-making! with characters having connections to characters in other story-lines. With same actors changing makeup and play different roles in different timelines. This is to give you an Inception-like feeling of connection between characters of different stories, possibly through reincarnation. This kind of movie making certainly pushed the directors and makeup artist and virtually everyone in the crew to their limits, to put all of their talent on the table. And frankly, with a few exceptions, they do a magnificent job.<br/><br/>The movie tries to bring a complicated plot; One that you could view over and over again and with each viewing, you get new things out of it. But it fails to do so. The connections between the characters are few and simple, with almost none of them having any influence in the game. Basically the movie is 6 stories apart from each other, glued to each other to make one movie to make you feel they're related. They also mention exciting concepts like 'dejavu', 'time-space continuum', 'quantum physics' and 'Heisenberg uncertainty' here and there, but the concepts are only mentioned briefly often in a wrong way and actually have nothing to do with the movie! It's like they were not smart enough to put them in plot so just mentioned them on the pass so the audience feels there is something complicated going on there, while there is not! The actors playing multiple roles is a nice idea but unlike Inception, there is usually no reason behind it! But it's nice to see actors playing different roles in so diverse universes in one movie, and they do their job well, except a few casts are ridiculous (The Asian actor playing a blonde blue-eyed French girl and Hugo Weaving (agent Smith in the Matrix) playing the hollow in the post-apocalyptic timeline).<br/><br/>All in all this is one of those movies that tries to look smart by putting a lot of open questions and unexplained connections to make the viewer wonder, and make a bold undertaking by mixing 6 timelines, but it ends up not doing its homework well."

","When I went to see this film, I had just finished the book, and I decided to be mindful of the fact that the book is so uniquely structured and long, and as most people stated before the movie came out, ""virtually unfilmable."" <br/><br/>So let me start with the good: I have to applaud the filmmakers for their ambitious attempts and I don't consider the film and utter failure, however: they made some fundamentally bad decisions, starting with the cast. It's not that I hate the actors they chose (I have neutral-to- generally-positive feelings towards most of them), it's how they chose to cast them for multiple roles: they were trying to instill the idea of reincarnation, which I think they conveyed just fine in their many many overdone narrative monologues. I also found the choice to cast actors for multiple parts of such different races distasteful: I hear people talking about the film deserving best make-up awards, but I did not, for a moment, believe that any of the characters looked like the race they were supposed to be portraying. The attempts were unsuccessful and frankly, to me (a European-Asian-American), genuinely offensive. Additionally, the actors themselves, were neither terrible nor great. <br/><br/>The inter-cutting of the different scenes was, for the most part, clever, and probably the best way they could have translated the structure of the novel into filmic language. There are also immense plot changes that I won't even bother to get into, because they alone are not my biggest gripe with the film. Its biggest flaw is that it robs the book of its ideology and turns what is a very complex narrative into what is in comparison, a banal film about interwoven love stories. David Mitchell expressed his full support for the film, but if I were him, I would be appalled at the over-romanticized diluted three-hour mess the filmmakers turned a great novel into. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed the movie as is, without the book, I can understand. However, consider reading the book. To me, it felt that when I watched the movie, I really only glimpsed the tip of the iceberg: there is so much more to the book and it's worth a read to get a better understanding and much more fleshed-out version of each nested story, not to mention some VITAL themes that were left out of the movie altogether."

Tom Hanks could learn a thing or two about multiple character tour de forces from the Alec Guinness of "" Kind Hearts and Coronets"" ( e.g: Hanks' Cockney is awful and cringe-worthy), and Hally Berry is very pretty. Doona Bae is most effective, as are Ben Whishaw, David Gyasi, James D' Arcy and Hugh Grant. Unfortunately, they get swept up in the movie's clunkiness and hackneyed storytelling.

","Cloud Atlas. The name itself brings to mind soft images of fluffy clouds, bright pure skies, and light and jovial spirits. This film, on the other hand, paints a rather different picture, as the entirety is a mixture of torture, death, and gore almost reminiscent of a Terantino bloodbath, but without the benefit of Terantino's touch.<br/><br/>I was rather hopeful for this movie, as both the name and blurb seemed to advertise the movie in a particularly favourable light. Unfortunately, I was rather expecting disappointment when I arrived to find a cinema entirely empty other than myself and a friend of mine who'd agreed to join. I was also validated in my disapproval of the film by 11 other people, (aged from 14 to 54) and am thus severely underwhelmed.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that one is completely unprepared for almost 3 whole hours of non-stop death and destruction that is not entirely unlike a botched version of a Shakespearean story, (in the sense that just when you thought the situation could not get worse... It does. Aside from this fact, the film itself is an attempt at a genre of movie that leaves one pondering and postulating, wondering about the nature of our society and future... But it misses the mark, and for several reasons: Firstly, the audience is somewhat steam-roller-ed by the blaring lights and disjointed scene changes in which the movie decides to flit back and forth across supposed centuries without so much as a by-your-leave, rendering viewers confused and dismayed. Secondly, the appearance of either the shooting star or reappearance of various characters led to partial confusion as to who fought for what and how each characters connects with 'him/herself' in the past, present, or future. Finally, the plots never really intertwined as much as you would expect them to, given that the blurb suggests they influence their own lives through reincarnation. <br/><br/>As a secondary critique, the plot of the present era - 2012 - was never truly resolved. While they managed to kill the hired assassin who had been sent after them, they had still not stopped the corporations that were apparently about to cause nuclear fallout. If this is to link to the future era, then the fallout must have been almost worldwide, rather than simply in New York. Which leads to my final point: Each era took place in different places - on the Atlantic, in New York, Asia, Hawaii - and the link that they did hold between each-other was so tenuous that it was almost not worth mentioning. <br/><br/>In summation, while there was good motive behind creating the film, the mixture of gore, bad direction and shoddy editing cheapened the originally flawed plot-line, making this movie ""bizarre and not-worth watching"" if I were to quote only one of the plethora of people who advised me to steer clear of this catastrophe of film."
"chaos-rampant","Null","4","11","1 January 2013"," The quantum narrative
","The Wachowskis are nothing if not ambitious. <br/><br/>The film is in the form of a cloud of narratives, fragments of mini- films. These are threaded together in several simple ways; objects carry over, characters or their offspring, on a more fundamental level, the same struggle through the ages. You might think of this as in the vein of DW Griffith's 1916 film Intolerance (similarly: a layered film with a humanistic message, shuffling between eras, vast in scope), substituting the struggle for love with one for freedom.<br/><br/>The recurring notion in each segment is that of a narrator who is trapped in someone else's (a gnostic demigod's)storyworld, and looking to apprehend liberating truths behind the prisonmatrix of illusion. Here's how it plays out:<br/><br/>1) in the High Seas story (Herman Melville is referenced in a later segment) the narrator is at the mercy of ship captain and doctor, 2) the young gay composer is trapped by his old and famous mentor, 3) the Vietnam-era journalist stumbles across a conspiracy in the energy world, 4) the aging editor is locked up by his brother in a nursing home (a cuckoo's nest), 5) a replicant in the future of the Bladerunner world experiences a Matrix-like awakening and joins the revolution against the totalitarian machine, 6) in the Waterworld segment, a superstitious villager breaks the spell of fear and prophecy (and so, indoctrinated tradition), and this reunites him with lost humanity.<br/><br/>It helps to know that the core philosophy that connects these is what the Buddhist have been saying for millenia: we are trapped in self-perpetuating illusion that alters or distorts reality, have fashioned artificial realities to that effect which we inhabit daily (social structures, hierarchies, self), and every step we take within those, for good or bad, has far-reaching imports that karmically propagate through the world (karma meaning 'action'. In Buddha's time, Die Hard would be a 'karma' film, rightfully so).<br/><br/>That's all fine.<br/><br/>The decision to use the same actors in different roles is in line with this proposed malleability of self and causal interconnectedness of energy. They are not all of them great, but Hanks stands out. Hugh Grant as warpainted cannibal? Count me in. <br/><br/>Each of the stories culminates in a spiritual breakthrough of sorts, in that inspirational way I personally find trite. That's not the main issue with the film. It sporadically entertains, but that's not the reason to watch it either. <br/><br/>Like Inception, it is an essay on structures of consciousness done with Hollywood money and sensibility. The author of the book wrote it with explicit reincarnation in mind, which only clouds his premise—lo, confused viewers are trying to figure out who is reincarnated as who. Doesn't matter one bit.<br/><br/>Here's the core idea of the essay: Hanks as a nuclear scientist explains about the quantum unpredictability of arising phenomena, the science of it probably needs more fleshing out at this point, but the idea that the same should apply to matters of mind is exciting and one I've been investigating myself in the context of meditation.<br/><br/>Thought (dreams, memory) really work that way, in a stream of quantum phenomena that arise and disappear, and these phenomena are in the form of fragmented mini-films like we have here. The paradoxical trick? It's not the self that forms these internal films, but the other way round— the images over time acquire a narrator who begins to shape a story. (Zen Buddhists meditate to kill that narrating self)<br/><br/>From the perspective of the filmmakers, the point is suggesting that each subsequent event is in mysterious ways only possible because of unpredictable actions that precede it—my favorite bit is an actual mini-film (a public broadcast) whose message 'awakens' humanity in the stars.<br/><br/>But simply, I don't think you can sufficiently illustrate any of that in the context of 'hero's journey' mythadventure. Because in that mode you have to have the rousing battles, lessons of wisdom and archetypal grapple with destiny, all of which cloud clear focus away from life as we know it.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that Jungians and a score of literary scholars have further ruined that with metaphor. It's why the Dune movie failed. Why Lynch—who has been meditating since the 1970's—abandoned this external, costume-y mode for internal shuffling of phenomena.<br/><br/>That is because it is not metaphor to graft from the outside. It has actual mechanism, a pretty puzzling one at that—what is turbulence to classic physicists. I am talking of the illusory matrix-space where consciousness comes into being, where films are first sparked into life.<br/><br/>This space of waking consciousness is an imperfection of mind, is a prison, hence our-selves as the narrator who is trapped in it, spending our entire lives looking for transcendence, in sex, in movies, in some shared experience with something other than self.<br/><br/>I propose a quantum cinematic narrative that is possible to be conceived on and mirror that level. This is not it. Moreover, this is why it fails to work on the scope it aspires to. It is all from the outside, more Frank Herbert than Dogen. <br/><br/>Each story-particle that forms the film is about a grand leap against oppression, and in so much noise the film misses the small steps. On top of that they have jumbled the chronology, but each story has ordinary progression and logic. And whereas Buddhism thrives in the illogicality of spontaneously arising life, that life has been bulldozed here in favor of clean reincarnation.<br/><br/>I am only raising these issues, because the film strikes me as more ambitious than anything we have seen in some time. Someone (I think Time) has already proclaimed this the worst of the year, which is just a small view. <br/><br/>If you want to see a film that successfully does this quantum narrative, watch Tarkovsky's Zerkalo."

I also thought it was neat that Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant always played ""The villain"" in every story line.<br/><br/>However, the ""Slooshas Crossin"" storyline was the weakest for me. Not only was it hard to understand them half the time, but it was boring for 90% of that storyline. I didn't see much chemistry between Halle Berry and Tom Hanks. The other thing that kept me from giving this film a higher grade, would be the dialogue. Sometimes they just said completely cheesy things.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy it. And I think it currently sits in my top 10 of 2012 list....but we'll see just how long that lasts."

If you're expecting an action-based thing like the Matrix, which I'm sure some of the critics were expecting.

","To make a film that did not succeed at the box office, but will succeed in pleasing fans later, congratulations....you're film did not fail in my eyes. This is true talent, and only a handful of filmmakers have succeeded in such milestones. Cloud Atlas was a little ahead of its time, but I have no doubt it will find its true audience one day. Myself, I could not get into it, believe me, I have tried. However, I have no doubt that this is a solid piece of work, and from what I've seen, a lot of time and efforts were put forth here. The film itself is incredible, posing elements such as dark humor, violence, and seamless time shifts with multiple characters taking on multiple roles. From what I've seen, this is a wonderful film, however, it is not a film for everyone. I've seen enough to boast its colorfulness, its creativity, and its sense of passion for what it does as a whole. This movie works, quite well, and it has many amazing surprises. It was just made a little ahead of its time. Ten, maybe twenty years from now, people will be talking about Cloud Atlas. And you can thank them now for it, too."

","I am an intelligent man. I enjoy movies that make me think, movies that I can enjoy repeatedly, movies that I recommend heartily, and movies that make me a better person.<br/><br/>This was none of those. It was just too long and too confusing, with several different plotlines at different times and different places, not to mention different genres, all trying to weave together. I watched half of it one night and went to bed wondering, ""What on earth is this? Where is it going? What does the director expect of me? Why is there no clear direction in the movie? How do all these different threads link up?""<br/><br/>When I watched the second half the next day, it became slightly more understandable, but my enjoyment was seriously diminished by the director's insistence on using the same actors to play different characters over different time periods in different places. WHY? WHY? WHY? This just confused me and made me wonder whether these characters were linked in some strange way that I should be able to see but couldn't. As a result, I only watched the movie with half my attention in parts.<br/><br/>To its credit, I must say that the movie is beautifully filmed, costumed, set and acted. I just wish I knew what it means.<br/><br/>In the end, I can only say that the movie is a grossly over-long, over-complex testament to the very simple idea of cause and effect. This action causes that action. There are elements of the struggle for freedom in there as well but they are overshadowed by this very simple idea. Three hours of screen time to basically say, ""This action caused that action.""<br/><br/>You have been warned. Watch it and get your brain scrambled. Three hours of beautiful confusion."

"virag-padalkar","9","2","4","12 July 2014"," Cloud Atlas – A Synopsis
","http://goo.gl/M8EGMh<br/><br/>""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future""<br/><br/>This is what Sonmi-451 says during her broadcast to humanity; revealing to the world the injustice being meted out to ""Fabricants"" in Neo-Seoul. Thus begins the saga that is Cloud Atlas. The only words to describe this movie are ""Grand Vision"". The complexity of the movie ensure that you MUST watch the movie at-least twice to start following this grand vision. I saw this movie in a multiplex called ""E-Square"" along University Road in Pune. I dropped off my girlfriend home and on the drive back to my own home, the story started dawning on me. Small scenes flashed before my eyes as if giving me glimpses of what the directors wanted to achieve. Half-way home, I stopped. I had to. I turned around, went back to the multiplex and booked myself another show the same day. I saw the movie two more times after that and then I decided to pen this tribute to a movie that had a deep impact on me. <br/><br/>The movie comprises of 6 stories spanning from 1849 to 2349. Each story is interconnected through a series of events. Each story comprises of – A protagonist who carries a birthmark which is the same for all protagonists across all 6 stories. A guiding hand who helps the protagonist in his/her goals for that particular story. An antagonist who is trying to stop the protagonist from achieving aforementioned goals.<br/><br/>Each story follows a similar theme. In some small way, the protagonist has helped (directly or indirectly) the guiding hand. In return for this act of kindness, the guiding hand helps the protagonist achieve his/her goals. Through each story, one document is carried forward to the next story which is a remnant and a symbol of this act of kindness. Across 500 years each act of kindness has a rippling effect ultimately leading to Zachry's salvation from Earth to another planet with his partner – Meronym. Check http://goo.gl/M8EGMh for an excel sheet that tabulates how the plots are woven together. <br/><br/>The sheer audacity of the vision that the directors had tried to encapsulate in approximately 2 hours 50 minutes had me spell-bound; not just the first time or the second time that I saw the movie, but even after seeing it for the third time. The direction is immaculate. Even a slight loophole would have thrown the entire story to the dogs. Even a slight scene not in keeping with the seriousness of the movie would have rendered it laughable and irrelevant. The acting is another gem. Tom Hanks has outdone himself in 6 roles, each as varied as the sun and the moon. From a Brit author to a post-apocalyptic villager the depth and range that he brings to all roles is fascinating. In fact, I realized that the innkeeper in the second story is Tom Hanks when I saw the movie for the third time. Hugo Weaving too has shown similar skill and range. Right from the role of Nurse Noakes to ol' Georgie; he has displayed histrionic skills which had hitherto gone unnoticed; especially given the wooden nature of his character in the Matrix. Halle Berry too does a good job in all her roles. Especially well done is her portrayal of Loiusa Ray in which she brings believability to the role of a young journalist trying to justify the chip on her shoulder, left there by her famous father; Lester Ray. But what takes the cake in the movie for me is the music. The haunting background score during Sonmi-451's speech gave me a vision of a better humanity. A humanity that justifies the concept of evolution; that validates the fact that humans are at the top of the evolutionary tree with a superior intellect.<br/><br/>I am a misanthrope by nature. But for a small amount of time the movie showed me a sliver of a silver lining for humanity. As long as art like this is created, there is still hope. Hope that entertainment is not just for the mindless and the moronic but for the intelligent and the discerning. Hope that it is not old-fashioned to be entertained by thought-provoking works of art. Hope that we can still turn the current trend of degeneration and laziness around and uphold values like excellence and effort in all fields (art being the one I am speaking of in this article). But even more than the quality of the movie, what gave me hope was the plot and the story. Hope that though in today's society evil far outnumbers the good, each small act of kindness MIGHT have that rippling effect. Each small act of kindness MIGHT just be reciprocated in some small way. Towards the end of the movie, Ewing's father in law berates Ewing for his decision to work for slavery abolishment and asks him, "" . . . . For what? No matter what you do, you will never amount to anything more than a single drop in a limitless ocean"". Ewing's response underlines very nicely this feeling of hope, ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops"". Let us hope that such works of art are cherished and propagated through generations. Though the movie did not get even a single Oscar nomination, I know that it shall have much more of an impact than most other Oscar winning movies I have seen or shall see. Let us hope that humanity does indeed justify its place at the top of the evolutionary tree."

It honestly took my breath away. This movie will always have a place in my heart, and it should have won an Oscar. For sure. It changed the what I think and the way I see things.

Now it can not match with MD, therefor there are too many little things in this movie. E.g. I never liked the pompous acting of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry is a very overrated actress and the special effect are somewhat overdone sometimes. Also the storyline, though very great, isn't that amazingly great. Too much love involved in an attempt to please to normal public. But it is a movie that needs to be watched several times in order to get all the little links, references, tricks etc that connect the six story lines (cloud atlas is written for a sextet) that are in this movie.<br/><br/>So I love it"
"antony-1","9","2","4","18 August 2013"," An unparalleled triumph
","There are few films that leave me with a feeling that will remain with me for a long time, but this has done it.<br/><br/>It is rare to meet a story that speaks so well for the human condition... that asks who we are, what motivates us, and what links us together.<br/><br/>This film will speak to people who like me often sit there and think of different times, the Roman era to name just one example, and think what were the people like? What motivated them? How in all their fears and inadequacies was there someone just like me sat in this same region hundreds of years ago thinking the same thing.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas takes that, wonderfully, with interleaved stories that stand on their own merits but have common threads.<br/><br/>There are connections between the stories - much like someone could write a book 2000 years ago and now people follow it as if it were unquestionably true - about how things can influence the future. But aside from these small connections they are separate stories. They are not meant to be A + B = C. They are meant to portray commonalities.<br/><br/>The actors being reused works but also fails a little too. It perhaps at times tries to draw the narrative together a little too much. And some of the makeup and character choices are questionable (men as women, women as men and Asians that look like Vulcans). And this is the only reason I drop it a point - because it's hard for any film to be 10/10. Occasionally it snaps you out of the movie, but thankfully rarely.<br/><br/>I see some people have rated this 1/10 which to me is offensive. I appreciate that it may not be to everyone's taste; but the effects. The acting. The scope. Something warrants it to be the worst possible rating. But perhaps I'm not surprised. Some people in this world will contribute nothing. This masterpiece of direction, music, acting, special effects and locations by wonderfully talented people is worth the bottom rating of 1/10, but their 5 minute review is their 'contribution' to us. But it's nothing. They will die, and their words will be forgotten.<br/><br/>But some people stand for something. Make a mark, either on some one, or some thing... through standing against inequality, or creating beauty. And they will echo on. This is a story for all those people that have made the life we live today, and all those that will make a mark for years to come. And that is Cloud Atlas."

"glenn_mcwhirter","10","2","4","21 July 2013"," Shawshank won no Oscars either.
","I had been waiting since I read the book last year for this movie to be released here in February. The 6 minute trailer looked great. I saw it at the cinema and it took me a while to know how I felt about the adaption. It is not the Russian doll of the novel. I believe that structure would not have worked. It is the interspersing of 6 story lines one after the other with sometimes what seems a confusing switch from one to the other. (But each is linear).The first 40 minutes can be a bit hard to follow, and the language in the post modernistic story on Hawaii really is hard to follow (better on the Blue Ray with subtitles for old ears!) . But the final effect is a movie I will watch over and over again. I would call it a masterpiece. I am not going to detail anything about the individual stories, just summarize. It is, I think, about karma, reincarnation, love, slavery, oppression, bias, hope, friendship, loyalty and overturning the ""Natural order"". Sometimes funny, often dramatic, sad, beautiful and poignant. I can't make you watch it, but strongly think anyone with humanity will enjoy this. The Cloud Atlas Sextet is sublime. BTW: it should have, but never won any academy awards. As some of the best most treasured films, like Shawshank never did either. Don't use the awards system, or negative reviews to put you off. Put aside the 3 hours required and watch, think, and be amazed. Also watch the end credits. The actors put their all into this. And a big thank you to Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer and Andy Wachowski for directing a fantastic film. Let us hope the DVD and Blue Ray sales make up for the loss at the box office."
"souvikmeetszeus","10","2","4","30 May 2013"," Cloud Atlas: A Modern MAsterpiece
","I mean to say that Cloud Atlas is the most complete cinema made in recent history.<br/><br/>My claims may seem far-fetched to some, and I know some of you believe them passionately; but it is undeniable that the movie shook all of us. Cloud Atlas needs a lot from its viewers, most importantly an open mind, to the point where you can just let the movie suffuse your senses, and not try to escape from the confusion that is created by the (amazing) screenplay. It creates some sort of a magic that I can attempt to describe as 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Angel's Egg, or ambition meets spirituality.<br/><br/>The movie is about six stories spread across 1849 to 2321. The first striking feature is how the same actors are used in different stories, sometimes they are unrecognizable (yes, some make-up jobs are bad too, but most of them are excellent, 'Oscar-worthy-by-miles'). The next, would be the divine editing, I have not seen anything of this magnitude ever being pulled off so magnificently. The six stories are served in one complete story, the transitions are breathtaking. The screenplay is immaculate, I doubt David Mitchell would have any complaints against the crew. The dialogues are beyond genius, weaving the stories into one seamless idea, and helping the audience to grasp the significance of what's going on. The background score is one of the most soothing and mellow tune I have come across, the Cloud Atlas Sextet is an achievement in itself. Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Ben Whishaw, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry, Doona Bae, James D'Arcy and, above all Tom Hanks put up their best performances ever for this movie. I mean just sit back and think about what it would cost any actor to mentally prepare himself/herself to play a journalist one afternoon and an advanced being on post- apocalyptic Earth the next day. The directors, well let's talk about that.<br/><br/>The whole movie is like a puzzle that won't solve easily. It's natural to miss a few details, hence it has to be watched a few times to fully grasp it. For its entire duration, Cloud Atlas is less a movie and more a live, breathing, persistent idea that seeks to invade your mind. It is so much like story-telling should be, moving at its own pace, in a rhythm that seems to be pre-determined and not manually manufactured. While most directors struggle with a single story, the Wachowskis and Tom Twyker handle six cross-genre tales with aplomb and finesse, both. A period drama, a romance, a crime thriller, a comedy, a sci-fi and a post-apocalyptic tale is blended with a smoothness you simply cannot expect. Yes, for the first 30 minutes, things will go through the roof, but once you reach that state I talked about earlier, you are in for something epic. It is sort of disarming how none of the physical happenings are given more than a passing glance, like you may feel that the Sextet or Cavendish's story or Ol' Georgie could have done with some more attention/explanation but that is exactly the way the directors wanted it, to emphasize that it is not the individual instances but the collective impact that matters. Now let's move on to the most complex part, the idea.<br/><br/>The themes that this masterpiece explores are many, re-incarnation and the evolution of souls being the most evident. It tries to establish how one act of kindness can ripple through time and affect events of the distant future. It tries to talk about the universal cycle, of creation and destruction, and also of the cosmic connections that exist between souls. A very surprising and not easily observable theme that is also explored is how facts turn into virtual history with time, and creates chain reaction, changing minds and altering futures. Frobisher gets inspired by Ewing's journal to complete the sextet, Luisa reads Frobisher's letters to know his story, Cavendish is actually going through a manuscript of Luisa's adventures, Sonmi-451 knows about Cavendish's ordeal through a movie and the Valleysmen worship Sonmi, whose scriptures originate from a video of Sonmi-451's last speech. Any movie that has handled such complex themes is stupendous, and to do it with only very minor glitches is more so.<br/><br/>There are a lot of magic moments in the three hours that you get to enjoy Cloud Atlas, my most favorite being when Luisa (while reading Frobisher's letters to Sixsmith) meets the clerk (played by Whishaw, who enacted Frobisher) who's listening to Frobisher's sextet.Another one is when D'Arcy's dialogue in 2144, ""The world has a natural order"", is shown to have been repeated by Weaving in 1849 with a very similar context. The people are hopelessly connected via their souls as Hanks gets intrigued by Halle Berry in most stories, and Doona Bae and Jim Sturgess are couples/lovers in some, and Keith David by and large has some warmth for Berry across time. It is really a very very expansive movie.<br/><br/>In short, I feel that Cloud Atlas deserves much more than what it has got so far, but that is the usual treatment most landmark movies get. As time goes by, and people develop the necessary faculties to fully appreciate the idea, this will be exalted to a 'cult' status. It will be a celebrated piece of movie in the near future, and I sure as hell hope this movie gives a boost to the acceptance of such movies. It is one of those rare movies that can alter the way you think, it makes you want to sit with yourself and question the amorous doctrines we so cling to. In this age of imminent darkness, Cloud Atlas is a movie that gives lessons in systemic thinking, or how to forego personal biases for the greater good, and how that one single choice of yours has the ability to positively affect many more lives in the distant future."
"Lucy_Rose84","6","2","4","9 March 2013"," Like a 3 hour trailer for what would be 6 incredible movies
","Like lots of people who have been to see this film, I am a big fan of David Mitchell's book, and as I such I was nervous about seeing the film. I think that had I not read the book, I would not have had a clue what was going on for the majority of the movie.<br/><br/>My main gripe is with the choice to alter the narrative structure. The way the book is laid out, with the first half of each story coming one after another chronologically, and then the concluding each tale in reverse order, the links between them are subtly drawn out and layered to add new meaning. For the film, the writers have chosen to intercut each story so that they all run parallel, which means that links between the stories are really laboured, rather than coming as subtle references. It also means that you are never able to get absorbed in any one character's journey - as soon as you get back into the swing of this particular era, the film cuts to another.<br/><br/>At nearly 3 hours long, the film is lengthy, but paradoxically each of the six stories is only given around 30 minutes of screen time which just isn't enough for such complex narratives. As a result you only get the very bare bones of the plot - which is why I refer to it feeling more like a trailer than a full film. From the book, there is definitely scope to make each narrative into a full length feature, and I would have preferred a series of 6 films as part of a Cloud Atlas franchise.<br/><br/>Having said this, I thought the performances were fantastic, and although the multi role- playing was a little distracting, I did enjoy watching the same actors in each story. The production design was also superb and managed to capture the strange worlds depicted in the book perfectly."
"Vondaz","5","2","4","5 March 2013"," It's just 3 hours of playing ""Who's that in disguise?"".
","Right from the start you play the game of trying to identify who the famous actor is underneath all the prosthetics - ""Ooh that's Tom Hank"" or ""Is that really Hugh Grant?"" or ""Can that possibly be Halle Berry?"" etc etc. All this disguising of nationality, race and gender is all very clever, but unfortunately it's just self indulgence on the actors' parts and gets in the way of listening to what they are saying.<br/><br/>That is assuming you could even understand what they're saying in the first place. The language on the Big Island is a prime example, which appears at the very beginning and sets the tone of unintelligible mishmash for the rest of the film. And if your movie is going to be so complicated in its telling, then you really should do us all a favour and make it easy to understand what's being said. Yet another example of directors assuming that because they know what they're actors are saying then we all will - you only know because you told them what to say in the first place! <br/><br/>Having mentioned the prosthetics, I also have to call into question the quality of the make up - especially in Neo Seoul, where the attempts to make Western actors look Far Eastern was laughable - almost as laughable as the attempt to make Doona Bae looked Western by giving her red hair and freckles.<br/><br/>So, on top of distracting disguises, poor make-up and indecipherable dialogue, then you have the problem of telling 6 stories in parallel. This means we never get the time to invest any emotion into the plight of the characters (possibly with the exception of Sonmi~451) so really I didn't care what happened to them. Ewing? Didn't care. Frobisher? Didn't care. Rey? Didn't care. Cavendish? Didn't care - and anyway what was the point of this element of the story?<br/><br/>I have just read the plot overview on Wikipedia and can tell that either the directors cut bits out of the movie or the problems with spoken language made it impossible to pick up on certain aspects that MAY have made this a more enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, nearly 3 hours of butt numbing, sleep inducing, self indulgent multiple role playing with no regard for the audience.<br/><br/>Oh and finally, Susan Sarandon's teeth in the Big Island! They're all living in straw huts with no technology or medicine and yet Susan Sarandon's got the most amazingly white teeth! Do directors actually look at what they directing?"

But I would say that that gives other readers some clear message how intuitive and clueless thoes viewers are and that they didn't grasp real point of this Masterpiece! This movie is about life, hope, redemption, love and other valuable things in life and who didn't get that at the end, need to ask them self What is life for them and how do they percept it?<br/><br/>Yes, I know, it's pretty hard to watch and follow 6 stories that storming down to the end, on till they melt down to one clear inter-connected life story. There is to much going on in this movie and it's very hard to catch up all stuff that is said and done in one watching, but that is not reason to say that this is one of the worst movies of all time! Ofc, that don't mean that this movie is for everybody's taste and if somebody don't enjoy in long dramas with element of thriller, they wouldn't even try to watch it, for everybody else, if you don't get it, keep it to yourself.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I must say that this movie is at first little bit confusing and not ordinary to what we are use to it and you really need to concentrate it hard to catch, at least, glance of what's going on and where everything is heading.Yes, someone would say that all this could be interpreted in some simple fashion, one story at time, but even like that, movie send one universal message, that life is not that clear and simple, as well. That 'simplicity' includes all complexity's of life like humor, freedom, friendship, good and bad deeds, choices(bad, good, hard), dilemmas, trust, honesty, terror, love, determination and many other threads that makes life so strange, mysterious and beautiful! Maybe, that complexity is something that everybody want to avoid in cinema, where everybody expect some relaxing one dimensional flicker, but if you don't push your limits, you will never understand essence of life.<br/><br/>All credits for this fantastic creation first must go to writer of this wonderful book, David Mitchell and then to determination, fantastic and hard work of Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski. I won't even mention how good acting is and all those transformations, simple outstanding. I can't single out someone that stud out in whole movie, but if I need, then that would be, for sure, Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving, and even then that would be unfair to others that really give they magnificent contribution!<br/><br/>All in all, this movie I would recommend to everybody and don't expect to figure everything out from first viewing, but that is one of the biggest beauty of this movie. Don't even try to figure out what's going on in it, just let it go, everything will be much clearer at the end and second time you will see big picture of whole story, just like is in life, but to bad we don't have that privilege to see our life for second time!<br/><br/>Similar looking movies: 21 Grams(2003) and Traffic(2000) >> Act factor:5/5 Fun factor:5/5 Plot factor:5/5 Art factor:5/5"

","If you're going to do something daring, do it big. That could be the Wachowskis' motto for the Matrix trilogy, for their criminally under-appreciated Speed Racer and for their new adventure â€” an adaptation of David Mitchell's 2004 novel â€” that tells six stories set in the past, present and future, with a core troupe of actors, including Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, playing different roles in each tale.<br/><br/>What sustained the filmmakers through the six dogged years of planning, financing, shooting and editing? The belief that if the impossible can be attempted, then it must be â€” and never mind whether it should be. The feeling persists that Tykwer and the Wachowskis made the picture to prove they could. Most viewers are likely to be impressed more by the magnitude of the effort than the magnificence of the effect. Cloud Atlas is a Terry Gilliam movie without the kinks, a Wong Kar-wai film without the smoky dreamscape, a time-and-Space Oddity that remains frustratingly earthbound. Put it another way: this is no Speed Racer. And it never achieves the weird wonder of Lana Wachowski's enthusiasm for the movie in the moments before we saw it.<br/><br/>I have seen Memento, The matrix, Inception, 2046 and possibly the number of movies anyone can ever watch in a lifetime but trust me, nothing like this before. This is a masterpiece, a classic."

","It was way back in 1999 'The Matrix' hit the screen, directed by the Wachowskis when they were still 'brothers'. The Matrix blew me away when I saw it and it still does. The movie just questions your whole existence, it really made you ask yourself: ""Are we really living in a Matrix?"". Even last week I read an article on IGN that scientists were still researching on the topic. The Matrix sets a milestone for CG in movies too, especially the revolutionary Bullet-time which had been used and over-used ever since. It was something you'd never seen in movies before and I still find The Matrix a technical marvel. The Wachowskis went off the grid for a while and gave us the splendid 'V for Vendetta' (written, not directed) and the less noteworthy 'Speed Racer'. Tom Tykwer is another director who bestowed upon us another classic 'Perfume The Story of a Murderer'. If you've seen it, and I suggest that you do if you haven't, you'll know that he's a true blue story-teller. Who'd have thought their next project would be 'Cloud Atlas', an adaptation of David Mitchell's book of the same name. Cloud Atlas is an anthology of six interwoven stories spanning through ages and aeons and was considered to be un-filmable until now and you'll know exactly why, when are you done watching the movie. This is not a good choice for casual movie goers although for those who have read the book it's a real treat. It's sci-fi-adventure-drama-comedy all squeezed into one remarkable, brain-stimulating movie.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas stars Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Ben Winshaw, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, Doona Be, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon and I really hope I haven't missed out on any. With an all-star cast of who's- who of Hollywood rather crammed in all six stories, it both delivers an array of awesome performances and confuses the viewer. Confuses as in, Cloud Atlas is more nested than interwoven; the stories take place inside stories and it does not move progressively rather it keeps pushing you into one narrative then taking you back to another and then back to another only to be diverted back to the very first. The cast here is directed to play different characters in each segment and the characters need not be connected at all. So when you see Tom Hanks play Zachry in one segment as a protagonist, he plays the malicious antagonist Dr. Henry Goose in another which actually keeps you thinking: ""Is there really a connection between the two?"" After-all the viewers can't be blamed because the tagline of the movie itself suggests that ""Everything is Connected"". There are some gratuitous use of make-up and I found it rather distracting than appealing. Nonetheless the actors themselves got a good chance at displaying how dynamic they could be in each segment. While Tom Hanks' characters not-surprisingly stole the show, Ben Winshaw's composer character was really intriguing, Doona Be's Sonmi-451 with her tiny eyes did more acting than any in the futuristic segment, while Jim Sturgess' Adam Ewing all by himself ran his own segment. You see it's just difficult to quote who's performance was better not spoiling the narrative but I found Jim Broadbent's 'Timothy Cavendish' to be the most entertaining, incorporating comedy and drama to his section breaks the tense narratives that it was enclosed in.<br/><br/>The editing is splendid in terms of what they have achieved here and it's also to be blamed for the cobwebby sequences intertwining and strangling you into the narratives. As a result you rarely invest your emotions in one character and maybe that's what the directors wanted too. The film initially crafts each characters outlook which takes its own sweet time and takes pace towards the 2nd act and from there its smooth sailing leading to a much enjoyable pay-off. I loved how they've sewn together tense sequences as well as emotional sequences. Add to that a range of absolutely spellbinding scores that compliments each string of sequences that wraps the package pulling the right strings and keys to touch your emotions. I loved 'All Boundaries are Conventions' is a more pleasant track. Clocking close to 3 hours it definitely tests your bladder but I was not bored even once. Sometimes I thought certain narratives would never get anywhere but a sequence in the narrative changes everything in an unexpected turn of events that leads to the aforementioned sweet payoff.<br/><br/>In all its grandeur, Cloud Atlas is a commendable adaptation of something considered to be un-adaptable to the celluloid. It's a flawed but ambitious movie. It's thought-provoking and will work up emotions. I consider it to the likes of Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain'. Where 'The Fountain' spanned centuries with 3 intertwining story lines with 2 titular characters, Cloud Atlas went up a notch incorporating a slew of actors and spanning 6 story lines in different time-periods rendering it a challenge for the 3 directors. It's, at times, a mangled mess and another, an ingeniously crafted masterpiece.<br/><br/>""Some movies are like wine, it gets better with age and Cloud Atlas deserves some time to be digested and etched in people's minds."""
"memefactory","8","2","4","9 December 2012"," An Excellent Effort
","I don't really see what is so controversial here. Yes, the film plays around with structure - but audiences are used to seeing things like ""Lost"" and ""Treme"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"" where several stories are interlaced into a narrative that eventually all comes together. Is the big hoopla that this is a film and not a TV show? So what? <br/><br/>This is a really interesting film that forces you to engage with it in order to understand and enjoy it. Maybe that's the problem - some people are busy texting or talking instead of watching and thinking. In much the same way, Kubrick's films are boring as anything unless you actively participate in the film. Same with Tarkovsky.<br/><br/>And this is easily the Wachowskis best work to date. They have gone far beyond ""The Matrix"" and need to start being taken seriously as filmmakers. And Tykwer is great - anyone who could manage to pull of a film adaptation of PERFUME is okay in my book, and this is a worthy effort on his part.<br/><br/>Are there some issues? Sure. The message kinds of beats you over the head (but it does in the book as well), there could be more subtlety, maybe it would have been better suited to a TV mini-series so we could have got deeper into the cultures being explored. But just look at what they've managed to squeeze into 172 minutes. There is a LOT going on and it really isn't that difficult to follow.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the film is intriguing and quite beautiful, telling several stories at once and making numerous connections throughout (I caught some but I am sure there are many more through-line images and items that will reveal themselves in further viewings). Is it as complete as the book? No. Of course not. But it does a pretty good job of translating the book to the language of cinema. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is that it manages to be emotionally engaging despite the chopped up structure of the storytelling. That's quite a feat.<br/><br/>Interestingly, seeing what they did with the screen adaptation made me appreciate the book more. There really is a LOT in David Mitchell's novel and yes, I thought it a bit of a shame that we couldn't get more of that detail in the film.<br/><br/>Credit also has to go to the actors, especially Tom Hanks. Hanks really did a fantastic job with all his different characters. It looks like the cast had a lot of fun while doing this.<br/><br/>If you go to the movies often, and love the cinema, then this is a film you really ought to see, and think about and talk about. If you only go to the movies twice a year, and think of cinema as just another in a string of distractions and entertainment, maybe not. I'm not saying this is a ""serious"" film for ""serious"" film people - but if Adam Sandler or ""Fast and Furious"" is more your speed, you probably won't like this."

","I read several reviews and I must say I'm surprised that none of them mentioned the great difficulty in making out the dialog in this 3 hour movie. At first I thought it was just me, but my son and his wife admitted to having had an equally frustrating time of it. I think I caught maybe one half of the words spoken throughout the film; the rest might as well have been Latin or Vulcanese. Although I'm glad that we were able to see this extraordinary epic film on the big screen, we are going to have to watch this again - on video - with the subtitle feature on! Only then will we know what the characters were saying to one another.<br/><br/>Regarding other aspects of the movie, I was very pleased. The cinematography was outstanding, the cast was brilliant, and the story was rich in meaning. I love that they presented the characters as having had lifetimes as persons of differing races and gender, with varying sexual preferences, and even mixing up the yin-yang with a soul playing the good guy in one lifetime and the baddie in another... just like in real life!<br/><br/>I think this is one of those films that you need to watch over and over again in order to glean the full value from its many layers."
"timattewell","9","2","4","18 November 2012"," A movie for those in search of answers.
","Cloud Atlas is a wonderful gift that the Wachowskis have given us, albeit a bit preachy; but let's be honest, it's a movie about karma, what else did you expect?<br/><br/>The film features a sprawl of characters, each spanning numerous lifetimes from the 1800s to the incalculable future. With these characters we feel the longing for love, the search for truth, and the fight for freedom. All very generic quests, yes, but engaging nonetheless. <br/><br/>In the blink of an eye: The last bastion of free men goes out in a blaze of futuristic laser fire, an old fart escapes the captivity of a nursing home, and an African slave gains his freedom on the open sea. Tom Hanks' character spends his early lifetimes as a greedy, murderous pig, then occupies the rest of his eternity fighting tooth and nail to climb out from under the terrible karma he's brought down upon himself. It's a moving journey to say the least.<br/><br/>The real connective tissue across the many stories in this film is its score. The main theme carries a beautifully simple melody that softly plays then echoes itself, just as the actions of each character reverberate throughout the film. It's good music, well applied.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is not without fault. For all the boundaries the film breaks, it makes the battle between good and evil all too clear cut. No good deed goes unrewarded, no villain is left standing. Cloud Atlas is a universe in which you can count on the heroes prevailing at every step of infinity.<br/><br/>Ambitious is the word most use to describe this piece of cinema. If you can get past the countless dollar signs being projected on the screen, a few heavy-handed lessons in morality, and some extremely rough cross- racial make-up jobs; you will be hard pressed to find a film that compares.

"shinjini-c","7","2","4","4 November 2012"," A panorama of narratives
","Warning! This review contains spoilersÂ… <br/><br/>What one would most certainly expect to find in a Tom Tykwer and Wachowski brothers collaboration is style. Tykwer, known notably for the stylized and stylish Run Lola Run,and the Wachowskis for the iconic Matrix trilogy, do not disappoint in that department. Cloud Atlas is nothing if not stylish. Amazing cinematography and art direction realize that style on screen. The directors use the space of the big screen to create a panoramic canvas of events and characters bound together inexorably in a larger order of things and in a way viewers of the Matrix films will identify well.<br/><br/>Like the Matrix films, where the postmodern, Baudrilardian notion of reality combines (increasingly confusingly) with ancient Eastern notions of destiny and karma as an underlying theme, strong elements of both Western and Eastern philosophy underlie and bind together the stories in Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>The film is a collage of stories separated by space and time. It features delightful performances by the A-list of Hollywood and beyond: Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess (remember Across the Universe?), Ben Whishaw (going places by also bagging the role of Q in the new Bond movie) and many others, and is an actors' delight. When, for example, was the last time Hugh Grant came out of his blinking and stammering very British persona to play a cannibalistic warlord and a Japanese businessman? The film traces many lives and their stories from the 19th century to the 21st and beyond. The underlying theme is both Western and Gandhian: that every human being has the power to affect generations through their choices and actions; that every human action, no matter how seemingly trivial or small, has repercussions beyond their own surroundings and lives. Therefore, every individual has the capacity to do good or evil through their actions, which affect a host of others for the better or worse. This is evident in the way actions in each story affect those in others. There seems to be a second connection between the stories in the sense that the same actor appears as a different person in a different space and time. This is most clear in Tom Hanks' stories, where he is seen wearing a talisman made from a stone that one of his characters had stolen from someone many centuries ago. Does this imply the directors' belief in rebirth and karma? That one person, having harmed another at one time, is given a chance to redeem themselves? Or, once a bad apple, always a bad apple (a curse afflicting Hugo Weaving's characters)? Adapted from David Mitchell's novel of the same name (Can anybody who's read it tell me how the movie compares?), the film is ambitious, well acted and conceptualized in great detail. That's what keeps viewers from losing interest across a maze of stories whose connections appear puzzling for the better part of the three-hour running time. And just when the connections begin to be clear, the directors decide to nail the philosophy into viewers' heads and become didactic. Therefore, the film becomes interesting rather than sublime in the end unlike Kubrick's 2001, made on a similarly panoramic canvas and highly philosophical, but which leaves a lot to interpretation.<br/><br/>Perhaps the directors wanted to explicitly bring together the many stories being told simultaneously because they felt viewers might be confused. Indeed, one gets a sense of too much happening, yet too little. There is not enough time to do full justice to all the stories at play: each one is a mini-movie in itself and deserves that attention. So viewers have little time to engage with the characters and the stories and have to keep flitting from one story to another, wondering all the time how they are supposed to be connected. One reviewer of this film suggested, and I agree, that this should be reworked as a miniseries to give that reel (or digital!) space to every story and character. I hope the directors are paying heed."

","As a person who is sometimes characterized as egocentric, pretentious, and overblown, I can commiserate with the producer and actors of this film. Cloud Atlas is all these things and more. It is a courageous attempt at something different, but in the end, it all about people and their difficulties in life. Six disparate stories that have some similar parallels , but not the mystic parallels desired by the writers. In reality these are six stories that could not hold up for the necessary 90 minutes individually for a screenplay, so the concept of putting them in an ensemble with talented actors was actually a brilliant stroke of creativity. Of the six stories, the Korean woman in the future is, by far, the most interesting of the lot. The Halle Berry reporter story just doesn't seem to connect (although I love her, personally). Seeing Tom Hanks in red hair was amusing, however. He reminded me of a virile Red Skelton. The slave story was mildly interesting, but not as interesting as 12 Years a Slave. The old man trying to escape the old folk's home was amusing as well, but only strong enough for a 30 minute sitcom episode. The gay musician episode was quite well done in the early going, but unfortunately gradually went downhill after the first ten minutes. And the sixth component was so unmemorable, that I cannot remember it at all. All in all, a good college try by the cast and the director and advice to the writers to stick to 30 minute formats for their screenplays. Doona Bae steals this film."

David Mitchell's novel is written in a profoundly unwieldy style, making a daring attempt at balancing six interrelated storylines, that many described as ""unfilmable"". For the Wachowskis and co-writer Tom Tykwer (who also serves as co-director), unfilmable is not in their books. Their rendition of the seemingly undoable novel is a blooming science-fiction tale with relentless complexity, challenging philosophy, and an outlandish narrative structure that will lead people into coming out with high praise or extreme loathing, with a significantly small minority straying between the middle. To me, this star-studded film roars as a splendid cinematic achievement with glaring flaws that are not too hard to notice but are nonetheless overshadowed by the filmmakers' enchanting style, even if their ambition towers over the film's grasp. Telling as story spanning across six different periods within human history, this film opens up in 1849 in the Pacific Islands where American Lawyer Adam Ewing (played by Jim Sturgess) becomes a stow away on ship carrying a poor African-American man to slavery before challenging to crew in a battle of wills. Jump to 1936 Cambridge, England, we meet Robert Frobisher (played by Ben Whishaw), an English composer who collaborates with an elderly composer (played by Jim Broadbent) who has a dubious agenda hidden under his sleeve. Next, we are taken to 1973 San Francisco, where journalist Luisa Rey (played by Halle Berry) is trapped in an elevator, only to nuclear scientist (played by James D'Arcy) who informs him a diabolical plot to take down a nuclear reactor. This places her on the path of a violent assassin Bill Smoke (played by Hugo Weaving) who tries to outwit her plans. Next up, we come to 2012 London, England where elderly man Timothy Cavendish (also played by Jim Broadbent) who finds himself in the ruts of a retirement home he is wrongly enrolled in. Now jumping ahead to the future, we meet Sonmi-451 (played by Doona Bae) in 2144 Seoul, South Korea where she is subject to slavery at a futuristic fast-food restaurant run by her clones before crossing paths with Yoona-939 (played by Zhao Xun) to rebel against the corrupt system. Finally, we make to 2321 where tribesman Zachary (played by Tom Hanks) and his family are living in a post-apocalyptic society where technology no longer exist. Zachary cross paths with a mysterious woman (also played by Halle Berry) who has connections to the technologically advanced past.<br/><br/>Yes, describing the plot is nothing short of a mouthful. And many will asking what to do these six storylines have in common. The answers are slowly, but subtly unveiled throughout the film, which clocks just merely under three hours. While many will doubt that the runtime isn't inflated, many would be surprised to believe that this runtime might even be enough to fully flesh out of the storylines that take place, especially when viewers are giving the absurdly difficult task of trying to decipher the connection between each storyline. It is a powerfully complex narrative scope that strictly demands your attention in order to keep track of where the film is going on, something that most people may not be able to accomplish upon first viewing. Each storyline is sketched with a unique sense of humanity and melancholy that sheds the light on both the beauty and the darkness of humankind, while paying an absorbing message to how a single choice from the past and change a major course of society in the future. Some storylines are more compelling than others in terms of emotional twists and soundness. The story set in 1936 Cambridge with Ben Whishaw working as a composer for an aging musician is quite subtle as it touches on the forbidden love between two men who share a homosexual relationship, which is gravely prohibited in their society. The emotional payoff at the end of it leaves a brutal impact. The storyline taking place in the dystopian future of South Korea is equally compelling, especially with the Wachowskis' striking visual style, which pays sweet homages to science-fiction classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'The Matrix'. This one has the Wachowskis' handprints all over it. The 2012 London storyline has it moments with idiosyncratic humor and silliness, but perhaps not the most memorable or particularly interesting. The other three also have moments that grab at the heart with both emotional resonance and pulse-pounding tension, but it is hard not to feel that they could have been more fleshed out, especially when they task the actor with foreign accents that make their dialogue painful to understand.
 
As if balancing half a dozen storylines isn't a heavy enough weight to carry, the Wachowskis wield an interesting concept of casting each actor and actress in multiple roles spanning across each storyline, while associated them with more screentime to their main roles. Tom Hanks, easily the most recognizable, puts on a fine performance as the grungy tribesman in the sixth storyline, but journeys way outside his typecast with a series of goofy roles of characters cooked with occasionally laughable foreign accents and heavy prosthetics and make-up that often get a little distracting. It is awfully hard to buy Hanks as an 19th century English man with slightly seeding red hairline. Halle Berry does best in her role as both Luisa Rey in the 1973 storyline and the 2321 story, though she is slightly more memorable in the former. Hugo Weaving on the other hand, competes in his villainous typecast in each storyline, playing in roles that owe significant reminiscence to his role as Agent Smith in the 'Matrix' franchise. And here's a hilarious case-in-point, one of those roles is an elderly transgender woman. Jim Broadbent does his best in most of his roles, though perhaps his most memorable outing would be his shtick in the 2012 London storyline. Ben Whishaw and Jim Sturgress have their moments in their respective roles, but there is no doubt that they have done more remarkable works in the past. <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is destined to leave people divided in terms of structure, scope, and innovation. But that does not take away from the cerebral beauty that makes the film such a pleasant, if not masterful cinematic experience. The prolonged runtime will alienate some, but for everyone else, is an cinematic achievement that deserves to be embraced."

","Cloud Atlas takes the first place in my own ""10 Movies of All Time"" List. When I first watched ""Cloud Atlas,"" directed by Wachowski sisters and Tom Tykwer, I knew I would need to see it again. After the second time, I figured it is still not enough. All in all, I had to watch it more then 10 times and I still feel like I missed something. Repeated viewing don't solve the problem. Each time you notice things that you haven't noticed before. It is tricky and symbolic. Try to catch it if you can.<br/><br/>David Mitchell, the writer of the novel, wrote each segment of the story as a different genre short film. The first one is written in diary narrative format. Robert Frobisher's line is more of a romance story. Journalist's segment sounds as an action-thriller movie. Cavendish's part is full of comedy and drama at the same time. And we also see a perfectly developed sci-fi world in a contrast with primitive village world. Throughout all these different genres and time periods, Mitchell creates a link, which is actually a character. A soul that transforms in various time zones and locations. A soul that must overcome different challenges to become a better self. <br/><br/>The film itself makes a huge statement about reincarnation. However, it would be useless without indicating the human's ability to become better or worse, as they appear in various cycles of their infinite lives. The comet shaped birthmark has s symbolic meaning. It shows a mystery in such a complicated process. A process of a soul passing through another body and shows that we are all connected. Our own past lives make a difference in our present. <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is one the most ambitious films ever made. It creates questions, not answers. Answers that the viewer has to find by him or herself. It doesn't explain, it just shows. The film involves so many society's and personal issues, that it is hard to count; redemption, social hierarchy, adultery, beliefs and faith, trust, racism. Again, it doesn't show how to solve the issues, but makes viewers think for themselves what's wrong and right. <br/><br/>I was never, ever bored by ""Cloud Atlas."" Each viewing helps me to define logical connections between the segments, stories and characters."

You ll know if you like it after the first 10 mins.
I liked that many of the different characters were played by the same actors, but in some cases they pushed the envelope a little too much, many of the make ups looked really weird in a bad way."

"Bored_Dragon","8","0","0","10 October 2017"," I have to read this book
","I'm not sure to what extent I understood this movie, or if it is at all possible to catch everything from just one watching, and I really want to understand it fully. I think it would be best if I read the book. Complete mindfak, but not in usual way of inexplicability or unpredictability, but because story, although pretty much explained, is extremely complex and told in very unusual and original way. Movie follows six stories at the same time, switching from one to another every few moments, so in the beginning you have a feeling like someone is terrorizing your TV remote. Situation is further complicated by fact that all stories are placed in completely different epochs, six unrelated locations, and they even differ by genres, but the same cast is acting six different group of characters in all stories. Makeup and costumes are so believable that in some cases I did not recognize some actors in all their roles until end credits, while in other cases it's obvious but still beautifully done. Some transformations are bit raped but I didn't mind. Some actors even have roles in both sexes. There are four Oscar winners: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Susan Sarandon. At the beginning stories are seemingly unrelated, except for the cast of course, but as film progress, connections and coherence are more and more obvious, until at the end you realize that all stories make one rounded entirety, when even tragic moments gain meaning and make you smile. Whole construction is even more fascinating considering that stories are placed on 1849. boat, 1936. England, 1973. San Francisco, 2012. London, 2144. Seoul and 2311. post-apocalyptic Hawaii. Till today I never heard of this movie. I run into it by accident and I'm glad I did. This is one of rare examples of a movie that lasts 3 hours but holds attention strongly from beginning to the end. I warmly recommend it to everyone, regardless of your movie taste, because in this movie you can find overseas ship adventure, freeing of slaves, classical music, gay drama, intrigue, blackmail, 70's thriller, sex, violence, comedy, gore scenes, futuristic SF, post-apocalyptic tribal civilization, reincarnation, new worlds, romance and, well, everything you could possibly put in a movie.<br/><br/>8,5/10"
"MihaiSorinToma","7","0","0","5 September 2017"," A mix of stories
","Six stories in different eras are told, presenting different lives of reincarnated people who tried to do something different or relived the same mistakes over and over again. They tend to follow a similar path, like two people falling in love after struggling and fighting together, but they are told in such way that I found it simply too hard to remember each one from each story and what the respective was trying to do. They are interesting by themselves but the way they were presented in the long length of the movie is a drawback from my point of view.<br/><br/>A two part movie would have been more understandable and more entertaining, rather than mixing them up in an almost randomly fashion, hoping for audience to understand what they were trying to transmit. Their respective worlds, each of them with its own crisis, some of them post-apocalyptic, caught my attention, together with their spectacular visual effects, but the action, sometimes thrilling, was too hard to follow and link to its previous part. The connections between the stories are not there for everyone to see. You really have to focus and try to find them (if they exist), again, something not everyone is willing to do, especially on a three hour film.<br/><br/>I say it one more time, it would have been almost a spectacular movie if they had found some other way of presenting each event, exposing their connections and message for everyone to see."
"Jerominator","7","0","0","6 April 2013"," Mesmerising and beautiful though not sure I totally got it.
","I really enjoyed this film but hard to pin down exactly why. I certainly didn't follow all the subtle connections in play, just the more obvious ones.<br/><br/>I think I just enjoyed the central theme and some of the sub-themes; the settings, high production values, style and execution. That said I thought the old folks home sequence seemed to jar against the rest of it somehow - maybe harsh of me and I am aware it was in the book.<br/><br/>I love what stories like this dare to aim for though I think they seldom hit it. ""Tree of Life"" and ""The Fountain"" are other examples - stunning films I love, but not sure they grasp what they're reaching for entirely - you'd really have to sit with the author/director indefinitely to find out. Likewise here. Perhaps a Q&A with the authors would answer that.<br/><br/>Ultimately of course it all comes down to what you believe in - if you disagree with the central idea they're playing with here, then you're going to think the story's a load of rubbish. I am currently very interested in that idea though so perhaps that's why I liked it all the more.<br/><br/>I guess the idea of getting set actors to play the various incarnations of people was necessary to give some continuity(though the birthmark thing suddenly makes me realise they switch bodies when reincarnated which suddenly seems to defeat the object!?!). Sometimes it works really well and sometimes terribly badly - cue weird looking record shop guy, lawyer's wife, nurse Naokes, and a few more. Oh and that's not even getting into the whole can o'worms of western actors playing Koreans. Risky play but perhaps they felt there was no other way of holding the story together. I have to say all of that just detracts from the story for me so I think they should've found another way of doing it. Colours/names maybe - I don't know.<br/><br/>Anyway, clearly I can't shed any light on the deeper meaning behind the film, but I can tell you that there are some moments of true visual and aural beauty in this which is what cinema is all about for me - you can keep the rest. Only other thing I'd add is I'd guess it'd be rather heavy going for anyone under the age of ~14."
"EmmaDinkins","9","6","20","27 October 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Reincarnation hyper experience.
","The trailer for Cloud Atlas gave me the impression that this film was an eternal love story played out through reincarnation. Since my favorite reincarnation love story is Dead Again, I was curious to see if this story would be similar and if it would measure up to my expectations. With Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in the lead roles my expectations were high since they typically play in movies that I consider to be remarkable. I was not disappointed. This was not simply a recurring tragic or fulfilled love story, this film was nothing less than remarkable. I mentally segmented the film into three parts. The first part of the film was almost dizzying with the meandering from different points in the past, then to the future and then back to the past. During this first segment we see a menagerie of characters most of which are played by Mr. Hanks and Ms. Berry. A number of times I had to do a double take to be sure of who was playing a specific role, it was much more difficult to recognize Ms. Berry especially in her role as a medical practitioner, Mr. Hanks was always recognizable, but the makeup in all instances was transformative. I have seen characters in films that have been made up as older than they actually are but to see actors made up and actually look authentic as a different race is again remarkable. I would be remiss not to mention the special effects so I will say that the appearance of Neo Seoul was impressive, saying it makes me think of music, I digress. The action and the realization of who everyone truly is in the grand scale of good versus evil is revealed in the second hour, this segment is where most of the aforementioned special effects are delivered. The final hour of the film is where all things culminate and then understanding takes hold. I could talk about all the fine actors who have recurring roles of importance throughout time in this film, but I would spend all my time identifying who they are as portrayed by the actors, which does nothing to underscore how powerful this story is. I believe that any experience that allows for anyone to think in a different way presents growth. That is what Cloud Atlas represents, the very possibility that some causes are so monumental and so significant that they require more than one lifetime to resolve is just remarkable. I give a green light."

There is a hint of a storyline which NEVER comes to make any sense. The acting can be described as sentimental staring into the sky at best. Some of the make up and some of the life incarnations are plain embarrassing. After about 2 hours it starts to become clear that nothing can save this monstrosity. I can actually imagine that the book is probably not too bad but as a film its an utter failure. Its worse than that.. Its the only film to make me really angry that I have wasted my life watching it. Can I also note I am a fan of Sci-fi and but didn't have any special expectations of this film in any way.

"baberchik","2","4","12","17 March 2013"," A mess!
","I have not read the book it's based on, and thank God for that, because I can stomach fiction in the 99% of all cases trough cinema only.<br/><br/>This ""movie""... oh where to begin. The storytelling as countless other people here said - is absolutely wrong. It may perhaps have helped if this was a series rather than a single full feature length movie, but what's done is done. This interweaving nonsense... just confusion and nothing else. Some movies like Mememento and series like Lost get the concept just right - show something provocative - answer one question and ask two more - but answer at least one of those rather SOON because either impatience will repulse the viewer or the basic fact that a human brain in not a multi-core processor, and can most often times think only of one subject. Unless you are a multitasking-expert female secretary type... which by the way makes me imagine the plot/script was either written by an overly creative woman or a male artist who just does not understand how to tame his creativity to a level it is barely digestible - yet spicy enough to provoke interest.<br/><br/>The next big flaw is that due to these million stories that have to be told 1 minute at a time, to tell them all takes too long. And no - I have nothing against long movies as long as they are long not by NECESSITY but by design! I would have more fun watching a marathon of Billy Mays commercials than watching this flick. Oh and yes - the damned narrator. I wonder if that was the plan all along to have his boring old voice babble on throughout the movie in a faint hope that at least that way there would be SOMETHING that would tie the plot together! Ha ha ha!<br/><br/>The plot itself is indeed a bit stock, and yes of course all modern Hollywood trends and ""popular"" culture does feed very much into this movie, which is another reason to thumb it down. Many characters are of course waaay over the top, which is of course one of the pillars of modern popularist filmmaking.<br/><br/>What else? Oh yes, learn how to tell a story, before you release a horrible miss-mash. This is like throwing a three-course dinner into a mixer and being a self-indulging ""intellectual"" type, drinking this horrible mix while having a fake ear-to-ear Ponnochio smile. The people who give it 10/10 are just like that - full of themselves, full of their flawed admiration of an overrated piece of trash that will be forgotten as fast as the next summer action flick."
"JamesMcIrish","2","3","8","15 April 2019"," Tries hard to be deep, but is actually paper-thin.
","I get what they were trying to do. The basic premise and message of the film can be summarised roughly as, ""If individuals don't stand up for what is right, even if the cause seems hopeless, then evil will prevail"".
There were a few other similar messages mixed in. The attempt to tap in to the ongoing save-the-planet trend was never more obvious than in the ""what is an ocean but a multitude of drops"" line. A cute sentiment, but the sort of ""wisdom"" one might find in the ""365 thoughts for your day"" philosophy books you see on sale for £2 next to the till in bookshops. Hardly enough to transform 3 hours of mish-mashed short-stories (more like fables really, given their moralistic nature) into a masterpiece of intellectual art.<br/><br/>That these messages are, ultimately, truisms is probably why there are so many people falling over themselves to claim this as a masterpiece. Some people prefer to believe that it was, because the messages are positive ones that most can agree with. The jumble of the film itself then becomes beneficial, as people who are emotionally swayed by the message will attack critics of the film (who they misconstrue as critics of the message perhaps?) and leap to its defence with overenthusiastic praise, and outlandish claims of deep meaning where there is none. A 10/10 movie this is NOT.<br/><br/>The film-making itself was bad on so many levels. Trite dialogue, no story arc, no sense of resolution, no character development. Add to that the lack of overall coherence and the downright weird accent choices, and it rendered even Tom Hanks unable to deliver a performance worth watching. I engaged with none of his characters, particularly the more badly-made-up and voiced ones.<br/><br/>The individual stories were basically totally disparate sketches of people variously displaying heroism in the face of adversity, with the historic, present and future settings intending to show that we, here now, are the potential heroes of tomorrow. But not one single story managed to engage me, and I found myself irritated by the pretence that 3 hours was needed to adequately get that rather basic message across. It ended up feeling like a lecture, rather than entertainment.<br/><br/>I am never particularly keen on ""spiritualism dressed as science"", and this film does hit that nerve in places. The line ""My uncle was a scientist, but he believed that love was real...that it lasts forever"" is a particularly egregious example of it. It's usually used by screenwriters to lend whatever pseudo-philosophy plot-device they are selling a veneer of intellectual respectability. In better films I am always willing to suspend my disbelieving irritation. Here I was not.<br/><br/>There are plenty of people out there who love all that sort of thing though, and it is no doubt they who are awarding the high marks for the film!<br/><br/>The equally problematic notion of multiple lives was also totally unnecessary and irrelevant to the message, but seems to me to have been done here purely to maximise the use of their big-name cast-members.
To say they don't dwell on this element of the story would be incorrect. They don't dwell on anything. ""Shallow"" is all that is on offer here on any topic they raise.<br/><br/>Apparently this film was from a book. Perhaps it should have stayed that way. I'm not sure I'd even be bothered reading the book now, based on this re-telling."

Basically the good and bad we do affect the future. It's a movie where actors play multiple roles in multiple timelines where they face challenges.<br/><br/>Not every story is equal. Some stories are more compelling. Quite frankly, parts of some stories are more compelling than others. The slave whipping scene is certainly the most compelling. The most interesting story is the future Seoul. However it is a hit and miss kind of viewing experience. Jim Broadbent in the retirement home has problems. If he can call his brother, why couldn't he call the cops? In fact, where are the cops in that whole story? <br/><br/>I have to be honest that I couldn't remember and keep up with some of these stories. Some become just a mishmash of different stories. It doesn't help that the same actors are in different stories. To me, that concept is more of a hindrance. All the fake makeup create an aura of artificiality to everything. The idea of connected souls is admirable, but they may as well not use the makeup. That would be something interesting. This feels like Eddie Murphy."

So much for the intertwined story, which wouldn't be so bad except trying to figure that out keeps you busy most of the movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the various stories throughout time are entertaining and sometimes even intriguing, but I can't help feel some of them could've been any other story for all the same. Cloud Atlas wants to be an epos but is a collection of average quality short stories with high quality actors and CGI. It's not enough to grab the audience.<br/><br/>What I did really like is how every era not only has its own story, but also its own style.

They'd eliminated the flash-forwards (or whatever they were) from the opening, and jumped straight into some coherent narrative.

","I'm pretty sure that I have no clue what Cloud Atlas was about, and oddly enough I feel very comfortable living the rest of my life accepting that. Perhaps there's some type of existential point to the film, but I didn't get it nor want to. My best guess is that it was about the limitations of death or how we all have multiples lives, but both of those points were already accomplished to perfection with Albert Brook's Defending your Life, and at least that had Rip Torn. I truly believe that the idea behind Cloud Atlas was to have a really cool title and only five actors playing fourteen different parts. And of course Tom Hanks, because God's knows he can't pick horrible movies, i.e. The Terminal, The Ladykillers, You've got Mail, The Bonfire of the Vanities, etc. Also his son that wasn't in Band of Brother's is a rapper, which is hilarious in itself. But in his defense, Hanks was Ray Peterson in The Burbs, so I have forgiven him for the insults above. However Cloud Atlas went too far.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure what the movie was about, I think a book or a song or something that travels through time, and to be honest that could be a spoiler but I honestly have no idea. Maybe there's something that really makes this film rewarding, but I don't get it and I am a huge fan of cerebral flicks like Pi and Memento, though I did think Being John Malkovich made as much sense as cooking Paula Deen's fried chicken and collard green recipe. That should anger like seven different groups off. <br/><br/>I'd love to understand the point of Cloud Atlas, though it clearly shows that LSD is still able to be purchased within our continental United States. Furthermore there were actually some really solid actors in it, which makes me question whether they were reading the script. Personally the whole thing stinks of the church of Scientology of which I have no idea if the Wachowski Brothers/Sisters are a member. Remember they directed a little movie called The Matrix that redefined cinema, and then completely destroyed the franchise with the sequels that followed. <br/><br/>I could understand if Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Ben Wishaw and the beautiful Bae Donna saw a film directed by proved directors (there are three of them by the way, including the excellent Run Lola Run's Tom Tykwer) with an actor of Hank's caliber on board, but the exact same thing happened to Jeanne Tripplehorn in Water World because she believed in Kevin Costner's 1990's ego, and she never made a movie again (ed. note- citation needed). If Hanks has succumbed to the nonsense of L. Ron Hubbard, then he should call Travolta and see how well people respect his accent in Killing Season.<br/><br/>If you understand anything about Cloud Atlas, please post a comment, and I'm down to re-watch it. But it was confusing and seemed like beginning of some new science fiction religion that will just ruin Barry Pepper's career again. And I will never forgive you for that Hubbard, go audit your clay tables and leave Forrest Whitaker alone!!"
"EvolBob","2","3","8","24 July 2013"," 6 Stories about?
","I gave this flick 2, mainly because the makeup and acting is good. There are a couple of interesting scenes where a spaceship? - lands/glides over the water. And of course the visions of a future world, but that is the full extent of any flicker of SF content, as it certainly isn't in the storyline. I watched this mainly for the Science Fiction story it claimed to be - I want my money back! I know SF when I see it, and this is not it. Cloud Atlas seems to be promoting re-incarnation, and how one should be okay to sacrifice your life for an idea... wait for it... because you'll be reincarnated, AND be with your one true love. Why that is true, I don't know - it might, but it is not found anywhere in this movie. Oh yeah, right at the end our heroine say it is so it must be true. Give me a break. Where's the effin story? Why did she believe this crap. Half-way through I was thinking this movie looks like a promotion for radical Islam; if you don't like it blow it up or die trying. (apologies to the radicals, thats normal Islam) Don't expect you'll figure that out by watching it, it just isn't there. <br/><br/>Lastly, the cutting back and forth was poorly done, not brilliantly done as in 'Crash', the movie this one was trying emulate edit-wise. It had all the finesse of a blender. I expect movies to entertain, and even violent SF ones like 'Blade Runner' are re-watchable because it has an incredible story. CA was not entertaining as a whole, it had some enjoyable parts, but they are not worth a 3 hour painful effort to see again."
"bioniclebubba","1","3","8","20 July 2013"," Worst Movie in Cinematic History
","There was absolutely nothing to like about this movie. The acting was terrible, the story was pointless and plot less, the cinematics were like melded futuristic desktop wall paper shots, and the characters we devoid of any meaning or discernible qualities. What a cop out for a movie and how adolescent for some people to think that ""we just don't get it"" I got it quite well...it sucked. This movie sucked in every conceivable way that a movie can and only a boneheaded moron lacking gray matter between the ears could possibly like such irrelevant garbage as this. It's like a couple of overly stoned wannabe writers sat around a bong circle and said ""Wow, what if we were like all connected in some way through lifetimes and relationships and stuff or something"" and then started filming throwing in some ebonics and costumes and futuresque landscapes...sort if. Absolute rubbish. Tom Hanks and Halley Berry have hopefully rethought their script decision making process and now have new agents. What an embarrassment for everyone whose name was attached to this piece of garbage. Wow, what a waste of time. Save yourself by never seeing this horrible wannabe film. No redeeming qualities whatsoever."
"cherold","8","3","8","6 June 2013"," Very entertaining, Surprisingly Comprehensible
","I'm sure Cloud Atlas has some Deep Meaning, but I never picked up on what it was. However, as a piece of entertainment it was excellent. The movie is composed of six stories, intercut very tightly, and some of the stories are very involving, although others didn't do much for me.<br/><br/>Of the six, I liked the comedic publisher's story and the Matrix-like futuristic dystopia best, but also quite enjoyed the '70s investigative thriller and the sci-fi-tribal piece. I found it harder to connect with the two set earliest in the chronology, which had less narrative momentum, but I still admired the way each story had a very distinct style.<br/><br/>I am rather amazed at how easily I followed what was going on, as at times the movie would cut from one story to another to another in a matter of seconds. However, the film starts with relatively long sequences that familiarize you with each story, and because they are all so different you always instantly know where you are. (At least I did; I'm not sure what the response would be of a friend who said she couldn't for the life of her figure out what was going on in Memento.)<br/><br/>The acting is all quite effective, with the same actors playing different characters in different stories. I was most surprised by Tom Hanks, because I generally don't like him (his noble, ""regular guy"" shtick just doesn't work for me), but here I liked him in all of his six roles.<br/><br/>Because the movie was stylishly filmed, and the individual episodes had compelling stories, I really enjoyed the movie. But I am completely unclear as to what point it's trying to make. It appear to be saying we are all connected throughout the centuries, but how we are connected and how these connections are significant eludes me. I think I'm going to have to read the book to see if I can figure that out. <br/><br/>But forget the Greater Meaning; just enjoy the ride."

I fail to see the connecting strands through these 6 mini-movies but perhaps I'm not looking deep enough for the inter-connectivity?? The only 1 of the 6 mini-movies that caught my attention and imagination was the Korean futuristic vision of ""corpocrats"" and ""fabricants"". With further imagination, the right director could make a full length movie with this concept I would have thought? Indeed, maybe the reason for this movie is merely an exercise in fielding 6 movie 'trailers' and seeing which one the viewing public likes the most? The sixth and final 'vision' of the far future I thought was set on another planet as they looked up at the sky and wondered exactly where Earth was in the night sky?? The clipped pigeon English used by the 'natives' and the 'visitors' didn't help the storyline in any way.<br/><br/>I hadn't even connected this movie with the real-life traffic inconvenience that it caused to Glasgow's streets while a chase sequence was enacted in our city-centre.<br/><br/>This movie gets 2 stars and that's only because the Korean component of this movie was so well done.

"acspowell","9","3","8","12 November 2012"," A Phenomenal Film that never ceases to enthrall its viewers
","I came into ""Cloud Atlas"" with a very open mind, trying not to listen to what movie reviewers had been saying about the film. I'm glad I did, because every review I read was way too harsh on this film. As many of you know, ""Cloud Atlas"" switches between six stories in different times and places. The best way to come into this film is to accept that the filmmakers will cut between the stories quite a bit and will show you on many occasions how they are connected. Once you do this, you can enjoy the transitions and understand WHY they cut between the stories at the different points (there is either a direct object connecting them or two stories are at similar points in their story arches). While I have not read the novel, the film's screenplay (among many other things) should be nominated for an Oscar for how well it weaves together such vastly different stories into the same space. Every story is unique and enthralling in its own right but still maintains similar themes and arches that connect them together so well. This film is not for everybody as it does require you to pay attention closely for a few hours. When you follow along, you'll get it, and be glad you stuck with it. ""Cloud Atlas"" is satisfying from a visual, performance, and story standpoint."
"aharmas","10","3","8","12 November 2012"," Probably The Most Dazzling Film of the Year
","Six stories and many lives have common links in ""Cloud Atlas"": the quest for love, freedom, or freedom to love. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and a very good supporting cast make this an epic ride that is bound to impress and move you over and over.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe the experience because it is something to be enjoyed and admire as the directors take you from one era to another, slowly unfolding stories of love and friendship. References are made by different characters about what has happened before. Sometimes these references are inspirational or heartbreaking. While this is happening, we get to witness some wonderful period recreations that enhance the idea that history is an essential part of us, but it is the human relationships that make us special, and somehow life is a matter of one door closing and another opening to allow us to continue this cosmic trip.<br/><br/>We see people breaking through the chains of slavery and violence, homophobia, ignorance, social classes, and more. Politics and some dark references about the future of humanity are put forth, and it is up to the audience to discuss them. Much of the brilliance here is the acting jobs by the various actors who must create different personas, and yet keep the common link alive. There is the issue of reincarnation, but get ready to be thrown a few curve balls, and a lot of the fun is how we might be fooled by the excellent make up jobs.<br/><br/>More impressive is the fact that the film was directed by three people, and it has a strong unity reinforcing the various messages. ""Cloud Atlas"" will definitely remind you of the power of cinema, the strength of human emotions, and having faith in the power of love"
"artifusva","10","3","8","9 November 2012"," Incredible, but most viewers will be lost...
","Just like the Matrix films, I fear that only about 1% of the audience will really understand the deeper meaning of this film. Yes, some people thought the Matrix followed the Bible somewhat, but couldn't really put their finger on it - that trilogy went way beyond the exoteric and this film does the same. This is an absolute masterpiece! Hopefully when the DVD comes out, they will do something with the bonus features similar to what they did with the Matrix special editions and have modern-day philosophers comment scene-by-scene. At least that caused some viewers to understand that there was more to the Matrix trilogy than meets the eye, but that still only scratched the surface. I had high expectations for a Wachowski film, and this did not disappoint!"
"StevePulaski","9","5","17","28 October 2012"," We know they're great actors, now they're going to really show it
","For years, it was said that David Mitchell's famous novel Cloud Atlas was ""unfilmable."" A story of such profound, epic-proportions that encapsulating all the beauty, charm, angst, heroism, and complexity of it would be an extraordinarily impossible feat. The Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana, and Tom Tykwer have done it; they've successfully created a visionary tale of impeccable beauty. A polarizing epic filled with untold ambition and high-flying possibilities, for the most part, all of which extenuated with stunning beauty, Cloud Atlas manages to soar past any expectations to be one of the most puzzling and enjoyable pictures of the last decade.<br/><br/>The film takes six drastically different story and manages to use mostly the same actors in each one of them, making them up to look like completely different people, playing different character-types, different races, and sometimes, different sexes. We all knew going into this that headliners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon are immensely talented people, always capable of providing their audience with a memorable show, but I can imagine how challenged and pressured they felt to embody themselves in characters light years away from anything they've ever played before.<br/><br/>I will explain the six stories ambiguously and quickly, so your experience may not be compromised. The first story, titled ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,"" takes place on an enormous ship sailing the Pacific, circa 1849, exploring relations between an optimistic crewmember and an African-American slave. The second story, ""Letters from Zedelghem,"" is set in 1931 Belgium and dives into the complex relationship between a young music transcriber and the aging composer he must work for. The third, ""Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery,"" set in the 1970's, shows how a young journalist uncovers a huge nuclear conspiracy run by an oil company mogul. The fourth, ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,"" one of my favorites, centers on a British publisher who is trapped in an eccentric nursing home, shunned from his children and confined to the quirky treatment of the people working there. The fifth, ""An Orison of Sonmi~451,"" shows a grim, plastic future, set in the 22nd century, where corporations have thrived at the expense of the population and clones have been made to run society, unless one of them can see the corruption and fight back (this is how that futuristic mess Branded should've been). Finally, the sixth story, ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After,"" (by this time, we're around the year 2346) focuses on a tribesman and his close friendship with a woman with more technological aptitude than him and how their togetherness may be star-crossed or simply meant to be.<br/><br/>Have I left you in the fog? After writing that, I feel I've greatly distanced myself from reality. Cloud Atlas is a film where one can go in with the mindset to completely absorb themselves in the movie, where they will never stop thinking, question everything, and extract multiple meanings from every little piece of it. Another could go in with the mindset to be entertained, but also treated with respect as a viewer, rewarded with their 164 minutes of patience by being given some deeper moral or life-realization. And finally, the most casual viewer can just walk in and expect a fine experience for which they will be marveled and left to cherish. No one is wrong here, but I do believe walking in with the mindset that you will question every little piece leaves little to no enjoyment on your behalf. I walked in with a willingness to pay attention, listen closely, and to be taken with the world the Wachowski's and Tykwer have brought to me, and not forget that I want to be entertained in the process. I wasn't let down in the slightest.<br/><br/>My experience is greatly reminiscent of Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (ironically, the ""Sloosha's Crossin'"" story's cinematography looks very similar to the kind utilized in Malick's New World - about John Smith and Pocahontas). The first act was hard to get into, mainly because you're adapting to this world brought to you out of the blue. The second act is when you're beginning to like what you've been through and you're patiently awaiting more. The third act is when you've become so in touch with this world, that walking out of the multiplex is like leaving a place you feel you haven't spent enough time at. Let me just say, it was hard to go back in the car.<br/><br/>That's as complicated as I'll go in trying to fathom the moral and the underlying theme(s) of Cloud Atlas. I feel continuing, painstaking research will cause nothing but frustration and exhaustion to the point of me never even wanting to look at the film again. And that is definitely not how a film like this should be treated. The film is one of the most lavish theater experiences I've come to have in my short years as a functioning internet critic, and between the incredible cinematography, subversive tonality, elegant performances, non-linear narrative, and the impact left on the viewer worth two or three epics, it'll be difficult to judge another dystopian film again. Now if only there was that emotional impact would Cloud Atlas have truly come full circle.<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Bae Doona, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Zhou Xun, Keith David, David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant. Directed by: Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer."
"socrates99","9","5","17","27 October 2012"," The main thing is this movie IS entertaining
","I believe art is an emotional argument about what is important. This time the Wachowskis set out to make my point with a wonderfully inventive mix of stories that basically have little but the emotions they elicit in common, that and the actors in them. You won't be bored, but there isn't much enlightenment here either though I can't disagree with their main two points as I saw them, that there is more to life than living and we are all interconnected such that we make our own future with every misstep or triumph.<br/><br/>It's as if the Wachowskis were attempting to make those points with story. I'm not sure that they did but then I pretty much believed something very similar before seeing the movie. So I was left a bit disappointed. Also I'm not sure I was as comfortable with their choice of lead actors as they were, or with their choice of characters, in particular the devil-like character didn't work very well, I thought. But this is such a sprawling vehicle, nothing was all that much of a put off and I can't remember the last time I sat this long without squirming.<br/><br/>The art work in the futuristic scenes was effective, I thought, though often somewhat derivative of sci-fi classics like Tron, Blade Runner and Soylent Green. On the other hand the scenes of tribal life seemed oddly unconvincing. But I can't really complain. In general all of the parallel stories seemed interesting and were fun to watch. But this is not a normal movie so be open-minded."

By turns it's fun, deadly serious, tender, brutal, inane, heavy, obvious, incomprehensible, fast and ponderous: it's quite a journey. The production values are generally tremendous even when aided by cgi cartoonery, the acting, sets and make-up to these old eyes are wonderful to behold. So much happens it's impossible to convey except it's such a roller-coaster of fairly swift intercutting that (if the plot intrigues) you need to see it for yourself. Favourite bits out of many: The out of Delius amanuensis' suicide and his lovers' distraught discovery; the cops chasing the deviant revolutionaries in the future and all the flying cars almost out of Metropolis - if you pardon the pun teleportation is just around the corner, the benefits to global capitalism will ensure its development sooner rather than later; Hanks' top-hatted gravelly-voiced alter-ego in the other world almost out of Beetlejuice, a very effective startling character; Tom Gramps at the beginning and end  I wish I'd listened more to the words of the Kings Of Leon now; Berry as a hip chick in 1973 – was she and Professor Hanks supposed to be smoking a perfectly manufactured spliff? Least satisfying bit was the thumping of the Sassanachs in the pub for the modern farce section.<br/><br/>Very entertaining nonsense, even has nice music for the 10 minute fade out, and I'll hopefully watch it again.

","'Cloud Atlas' is one of those films that challenges critics and movie lovers by refusing categorizations. Historical fresco? Philosophical film? Science fiction? Art movie? Mega-production with mega-stars in distribution? 'Cloud Atlas', made in 2012 by The Wachowskis and the formidable German director Tom Tykwer, can be considered as having elements of all these genres, and at the same time belonging to a separate category. It is a spectacular and sophisticated film, which leaves many elements of the story and interpretation in the hands and minds of the spectators, and a captivating movie because of the way it is made, realized and interpreted. At the end of the viewing I was left with the feeling that many details and meanings remained open or unexplored, but at the same time I did not go through any boredom moments, on the contrary, I was permanently captivated, despite the duration of almost three hours. It's one of the few movies I'd like to see again. It happens very rarely to me, even with the films that I really loved.
'Cloud Atlas' is the screen adaptation of a novel by the same name written by David Mitchell, built as a succession of six stories, which take place over different periods of time, and which are linked by a similar theme and by the fact that in each of them there are references to the previous story. The structure of the novel is pyramidal, the stories unfold in the first part of the book chronologically, the final one in the middle, and then the narratives come back in time in reverse sequence. The filmmakers chose to present the six plots in parallel and interleaved. The film permanently alternates scenes in which the narrative threads intersect: from the story of a ship sailing the ocean in the 19th century during the slave trade period, passing through the 1930s story of the young genius composer of the symphonic piece 'Cloud Atlas', the one of the brave reporter involved in a political investigation in the 1970s, of the publisher pursued by literate gangsters in the contemporaneity, until the two episodes in the future, involving a revolt of humanoid robots and a story of contact between civilizations. There are some shared ideas - especially the uniqueness of truth and its supreme moral value, but the style of each episode is distinct, from the historical film, via political thrillers, to sci-fi. Three of the episodes are directed by The Wachowskis, the other three by Tykwer. Their combining is superb, creating a sense of continuity and sublimating the idea of temporal relativity and fluidity. One door closes in one time period and opens in another. The paces of the stories accelerate or stop simultaneously, the moments of maximum tension are reached in simultaneity. As in a wonderful mosaic where you step back a few steps and you see the whole, same in 'Cloud Atlas' the sensations of continuity and consistency are perfect.
The unity of ideas and style of the film is strengthened by the casting in different episodes of a remarkable team of actors, many of whom play multiple role roles that transcend not only time, but also ages, sex, skin color. The exceptional makeup also contributes to the melting of actors with such well-known faces as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, or Susan Sarandon in their characters. Also appearing in the film is Doona Bae, a famous South Korean actress (I had seen her in 'A Girl at My Door') but little known outside her country. Another special component of connection and expression is the film's soundtrack. I believe that for those who are not afraid of cinematic experiences other than the routine ones, and who do not necessarily look for a particular genre in its purest state, 'Cloud Atlas' is a film that offers many reasons for satisfaction. It is also a film that I think by its very structure is destined to withstand time, and to be increasingly appreciated in the future."

"estebangonzalez10","8","2","5","14 March 2013"," A potential future cult sci-fi film
","¨I'm just trying to understand why we keep making the same mistakes over and over again.¨<br/><br/>Many critics have called Lana and Andy Wachowski's new film, Cloud Atlas, ambitious and pretentious, but in my opinion it is a well made sci-fi film that is ahead of its time. Probably on a much lesser scale than 2001 or Blade Runner, but this film seems to have all the elements needed to become a cult film over time. Cloud Atlas is one of those movies you have to pay close attention to in order to understand where the plot is heading; it is definitely not for the casual viewer. It requires your time and patience, but if you stick with this film you will be rewarded by the end. This is by no means as good as Wachowski's The Matrix (although it tries to remain philosophical), but it is much better than their recent work. Tom Tykwer (The Perfume) co-directed the film with the Wachowski siblings and it is without a doubt his best work yet. The film is unlike any other movie you've seen before as it connects six different stories over several centuries and connects them in some way or another. You could say it is kind of like Magnolia, but those stories take place during a similar time period, here the connections take place during the past, present, and future. Two parallel filming units were required for this monstrous production as the siblings directed three stories and Tykwer the other three. Cloud Atlas is based on David Mitchell's award winning novel, and it was no easy task adapting it for the big screen. I think that their effort will be rewarded over time as it has the potential to become a sci-fi cult film. <br/><br/>The plot is a little difficult to explain as there are six separate stories happening over different time periods and in a way every story connects and overlaps with each other. The movie switches between one scene that can be taking place in 1849 to another in the post apocalyptic future. The first story takes place in the Pacific Ocean in 1849 as Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) is keeping a journal of his voyage while battling some sort of illness and being attended by Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks), and at the same time helping a former slave, Autua (David Gyasi), escape from his oppressors. The next story takes place in 1936 as the composer Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) is corresponding with his former lover, Rufus Sixsmith (James D'Arcy) about his experience working for the world famous composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent). In 1973 the story centers around a journalist named Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) who is investigating a murder that took place in a nuclear power plant. In 2012 a publisher named Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) gets hoaxed by his brother and is forced to live in a nursing home while he makes plans to escape. In 2144 a clone known as Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) participates in a revolutionary underground movement in New Seoul under the guidance of Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess). And finally in 2321 Zachry (Tom Hanks) is living somewhere in post apocalyptic Hawaii in a tribe that is being threatened by the blood thirsty Kona Chief (Hugh Grant). Every story is interconnected with each other as the actions of each individual impact one another in different time periods kind of like in a ripple effect.<br/><br/>The complexity of each story is the reason why the film is almost three hours long, but if you pay close attention and don't get lost with all the flashbacks and flash forwards you might just enjoy this film. Cloud Atlas is pretentious for many because it is a little philosophical as it explains how we seem to cross our paths over and over again. Every actor in this film plays several different roles (as many as six) and we can see how each one shapes his or her future depending on the actions they take. The way the film was shot allows for the audience to experience a little sci-fi action (2144 segment), some comedy (2012 nursery home escape), some retro mystery (1973), and even romantic tragedy (1936). That is why this film is one of its kind. The sci-fi scenes were spectacular and the designs quite visionary in style. The film, although very exhausting, is exiting; and I had a great time. I understand why this is such a divisive film considering it is so complex and epic at the same time. The film does feel a bit disjointed and disconnected at times, but when it seemed to lose me it got right back in track again. I think this film was quite original and is worth your time if you are willing to put your mind to it. The performances weren't as strong as I would have liked, but it is a difficult task to play six different characters at once. By all means check Cloud Atlas out; you will either love it or hate it.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"njw-humphrey","10","2","5","10 March 2013"," Fantastic. A cult classic in the make.
","There's no denying Cloud Atlas is a bit of a marathon when it comes to length, and a bit of an obstacle course when it comes to structure; but this gem definitely takes the gold medal in the end.<br/><br/>Six refined story lines are entwined throughout the motion picture, and with them presents strong themes such as trust, sacrifice and most powerfully teamwork and co-operation. The film follows the stories of many individuals, either reincarnates of each other or genetic ancestors depending on the viewers own perception, and it does not fail to impress. Three hours is a long time, but the crispy editing, fast-paced storyline and vastly expansive array of characters is sure to keep you hooked right from the get go. The make up artists have really gone all out on this one, and half the fun of this movie is just picking out which actor is playing which character, to which they all play multiple. And the acting is phenomenal. Tom Hanks, in particular, portrays such highly various characters that you will have a hard time believing they're all the same person. He's not the only one to do this, but most notable. Halle Berry and Hugh Grant are also outstanding in this regard. The story is strong and captivating and cannot be summarised without doing injustice to the masterpiece. This is a movie that you must go out and watch and form your own opinion. It may sleek in the shadows for a few years, but I'm sure this will be a cult classic in years to come."
"henry-oldmixon","8","2","5","3 March 2013"," Coud Atlas is billed as a film about the interconnectedness of human lives.
","This is a great film, no doubt about it. It is a visual treat, as you would expect from the Wachowskis, and there is a superlative standard of acting across the range of characters and timelines that keeps us fully involved. The film comprises several different story lines from different time periods, which are regularly cross-cut across the whole movie. confusing as this may seem, in fact it is easy enough to follow the different stories and, indeed, become fully engaged with them.<br/><br/>There are links made, but these are less than the sum of the parts of this film. I don't really buy into the idea that we are treated to some great interconnected opus, even while there is an overarching idea about how humanity never stands merely as the actions of an individual in time but reaches across the great span of human existence. This is an ambitious idea, which is only ephemerally realised, but if you go the film to enjoy the different stories - and the great joy of spotting the actors in different roles across the varying timelines - then you will be in for a treat.

"anasnajmie","9","2","5","2 March 2013"," A powerful movie...re-defining the word EPIC!
","Summary: 6 different stories in different times intertwined beautifully with each other. Part history, part sci-fi, part love story, part comedy all transiting seamlessly in a 3-hours exhilarating journey through time. EPIC.<br/><br/>Plot: This movie has 6 different, loosely interconnected stories in it. Not only they are different, they are in different time frame as well! Well, here goes, in chronological order:<br/><br/>1. A tale of a lawyer's journey (Adam Ewing) of an ocean voyage across the Pacific in 1850s, which is recorded in his journal. He experienced the betrayal of his trusted doctor, and befriended a black slave who in turn save his life. His view of slavery was changed,and he vowed to stop slavery, even though he knew his effort would do little change to the mindset of his imperialist, colonial society. His journal was later published into a book.<br/><br/>2. Follows the tragically short life of a talented young composer (Robert Frobisher) who was in a forbidden homosexual relationship with his lover, Rufus Sixmith, student of Cambridge in the 1930s. He was heavily influenced by Ewing's journal while composing his masterpiece Cloud Atlas Sextet. However, his aging employee, a composer himself, forced Frobisher into surrendering Cloud Atlas to him, threatening to expose his sexual orientation to the public. Hi accidentally injured the man, and ran away. Realizing his life is ruined, he committed suicide after completing Cloud Atlas composition. <br/><br/>3. Set in 1970's, Rufus Sixmith, a renowned physicist now, met Luisa Rey, a journalist. He attempted to reveal a conspiracy about a nuclear plant to her before he was murdered. Luisa investigated the case and found herself in danger of being murdered too the closer she gets to the truth. In her investigation, she found letters written by Frobisher to Sixmith in the 1930s and a report of the nuclear plant. She finally uncovered the truth and wrote the article about the conspiracy.<br/><br/>4. This is set in modern days (2012). Timothy Cavendish was blackmailed for money by a group of thugs after he received a handsome royalty from his published book. He sought his brother help, who put him (without him knowing) to an old folk's home, with no way to get out. Residents were treated as prisoners, and each attempt to get out was stopped by the staff. He managed to ""jailbreak"" with the help of his elderly friends. He found his time there as an adventure worth to be told. Later he wrote about his experience, which was made into a movie (""The Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"") much later in time.<br/><br/>5. Follows the story of Sonmi-451, a clone-bred ""server"" who works at a restaurant in Neo Seoul, Korea in a distant future. Her life was routine; everyday she serves food to the ""consumers"". However,inspired by ""The Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" she began to question her existence as a clone to the world, and the injustice and cruelty her kind suffered. She finally led the revolution to the oppressing government, broadcasting her preach and philosophy about life to the world.<br/><br/>6. The final story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, 100 years after The Fall (Neo Seoul was drowned by the rising sea level). It follows Zachry, who lived with his tribes in The Valley, worshipping Sonmi-451, believing her to be god and holy. Meronym from a more advanced society called the Prescients sought help from Zachry to guide her to a broadcast station believed to be on top of a mountain. Once there, she showed the truth about Sonmi, making Zachry questioning his faith. She also explained that she intended to use the broadcast station to find another place to live in, as there's no place on Earth to live anymore.<br/><br/>The movie was heavy. It is ""densed"" with a lot of message. The themes in the movie are many. The most notable ones are freedom, oppression, injustice and love. More importantly, it wants to show you how each actions and decisions in the past can affect the future. It is not easy to fit 6 different stories in a 3-hour movie (yes it's that long!) However, the transitions between each era are seamless. You can see 6 different times changing back and forth with each other as the story progress, yet different they may come, it is easily recognized, and the transitions are cleverly done. The comical modern day story of Timothy Cavendish really lift up the mood, and help""lightening"" the movie a bit. The graphic is stunning. That is to be expected from the Wachowskis. Kudos to the directors.<br/><br/>The castings are all Oscar materials. Seriously, the casts play different roles in different timeframes. You will see Tom Hanks as the evil doctor in one scene, as a corrupt hotel owner in another, as a righteous physicist in another timeframe, and as a confused tribesman in the far future. That acting alone deserves an Oscar! Halle Berry did great with her multiple roles as well, and so does Hugo Weaving (impressive in his Old Georgie evil god role) and many others I'm not able to list here. What's more impressive is their make up for each character. Believe me, you won't recognize Halle Berry playing as wife of the old composer, or Hugo Weaving as Nurse Noakes. Watch the credit. You'll be surprised.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8.8/10. Impressive. This movie re-define the word EPIC. Definitely Oscar nominee for this year. Be warned, this movie is not everyone cup of tea. If you can't stand watching a 3 hours movie which will get you confused during and after the show, do not watch this movie. If you are easily bored , do not watch this movie. If you do watch it, don't try to understand the movie. Figure it out afterwards.<br/><br/>You have been warned."

","Cloud Atlas... bizarre and beautiful, artistic and intriguing, bloody long and I found it so so hard to watch... the first half of the film it annoyed me with all the jumping between timelines and, to be honest, if I was watching it on the small screen I would have happily turned it off but on the big screen it was epic and damn glorious... After the first half though u really gt into it, the languages and acting is amaze balls. It really isn't ur typical film, there are so so many undercurrents and themes that even now after sleeping on it I am still thinking about it... This film, if u get it, really stays with u, there are so many quotes in it that I am off to look up. At three hours it is very long and demanding but now I kind of want more, a four hour directors cut would actually be welcome! It really is more than just a film, for me it was a piece of art, like all good art it provokes an emotional response and hell I was responding all over the place, i was happy, sad, confused, irritated, elevated, intrigued and exhausted! It really is a journey of a film and I am so glad I saw it first on the big screen... On the small screen I would have skipped it and I really would have missed something very very special! Can't wait for the blu ray/DVD and seriously considering reading the book.<br/><br/>If u do watch it make sure u don't leave until u see the cast of characters, without giving anything away u do know that the main actors play different roles in the different time zones, it was great because, for example, u like some of Tom Hanks roles in the film and others u want to smack him... But at the end u will be amazed how complete the actors were... i was amazed to see all the actors swapping identities so completely, not only characters but genders, sexualities and even race! It really is hard to classify and even now i honestly don't know if i would recommend it still but if u do decide to take a chance see it on the big screen and stick with it, I was going thru reasons to just leave in the first hour but I am really happy I stuck with it... U can see the money spent on it and I am shocked that Hollywood took a chance on a film that really really isn't a typical blockbuster! Not for everyone but, in the end, it certainly was for me..."
"kelv-2","7","2","5","22 February 2013"," more of an experience than a film
","I enjoyed this film. Is it really a film though? Yes the same characters appear all the way through the different time lines. But there are 2 sets of directors which each have done a half of the film. <br/><br/>The constant plastering of make up on the actors to make them age and only look slightly different wore thin very quickly. Also it's hard to hear what people are saying at times because of accents or background noises.<br/><br/>However the scenes were beautifully shot. Halle Berry was amazing. I'm glad she made it out of the Hollywood wilderness and into this film. The acting overall was very good with a great cast. <br/><br/>As an artistic piece this film has it all great special effects, great cast, it's well paced and has a huge expansive storyline.<br/><br/>But is the storyline too much? Is it right to have a film made by two different directors who have completely different styles? Does it work having characters re-emerging in different time lines with completely different persona's?<br/><br/>Words to the wise. The film is 152 mins long. So if you don't like long films don't go. If you want an easy watch, don't go. If you didn't get a lot of sleep the night before and you can't concentrate you wont like this film. <br/><br/>I liked the film because it got me and my friend talking about it in a good way. We discussed the plots and the meanings of the films. We agreed that the film wasn't perfect but it was great to see it at the big screen.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 out of 10 because this is not your run of the mill film. It makes you think. It is an experience. This film is by no means average. It's a work of art, And like all art it invites discussion and criticism. And like art not everyone will like it. It is definitely marmite you'll love it or hate it."
"caseymoviemania","5","2","5","17 February 2013"," Casey's Movie Mania: CLOUD ATLAS (2012)
","David Mitchell's massive, 509-page award-winning novel Cloud Atlas was widely considered as ""unfilmable"". But three directors -- Lana Wachowski, Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer -- are daring enough to step up the game and delivers one of the most ambitious projects ever made in recent memory. Whether you have read the book or even come to know the premise, it's impossible to ignore the existence of CLOUD ATLAS. The result is undeniably beautiful, but bloated mess of epic filmmaking that doesn't really bring the best out of acclaimed visionary directors of the Wachowski siblings and Tom Tykwer.<br/><br/>Spanning over six separate eras (1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144 and 2321) with six different stories overlapping one after another, CLOUD ATLAS begins in the South Pacific Ocean in 1849 where a young American lawyer named Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) arrive at the Chatham Islands to seal a business deal with Reverend Giles Horrox (Hugh Grant) for his father-in-law, Haskell Moore (Hugo Weaving). When Ewing is welcomed aboard a ship alongside with the cunning Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks), he stumbles upon a mistreated escaped slave named Autua (David Gyasi) who tries to convince him to let him join the ship crew as a freeman. In the meantime, Goose has a wicked agenda of his own in an attempt to slowly poison Ewing and claims it is a cure for parasitic worm because he's aiming to steal Ewing's valuables.<br/><br/>In 1936 Cambridge, England, a 23-year-old bisexual English musician named Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) bids farewell to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith (James D'Arcy), to work as an apprentice to a famous composer, Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent). Frobisher subsequently finds time and inspiration to compose his own masterpiece, ""The Cloud Atlas Sextet"". Ayrs likes Frobisher's newly-composed classical music so much until he wishes to take all the credit. When Frobisher refuses to cooperate, Ayrs threatens to expose Frobisher's disgraceful background. However, their subsequent disagreement leads to an unexpected act of violence.<br/><br/>In 1973 San Francisco, ambitious journalist Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) has a chance encounter with an older Sixsmith (also James D'Arcy), who is now a nuclear physicist. They first come across to each other when they stuck in the elevator due to a power outrage. Shortly after their meeting, Sixsmith is found dead. Rey starts to do some investigation and subsequently discovers that Sixsmith's death has something to do with a huge conspiracy theory connecting Big Oil with nuclear power chief Lloyd Hooks (Hugh Grant).<br/><br/>In 2012 London, an eccentric 65-year-old publisher Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) finds himself unexpectedly shipped off by his brother Denholme (Hugh Grant) to a nursing home ruled by the tyrannical Nurse Noakes (Hugo Weaving).<br/><br/>In 2144 futuristic Neo Seoul, Korea, a genetically-engineered fabricant Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) works as a server at a fast-food restaurant. At the beginning of this segment, she is seen being interviewed prior to her execution. During the subsequent flashbacks, she recalls how she is released from her caged life and falls in love with star-crossed rebel Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess).<br/><br/>Lastly in 2321 post-apocalyptic Hawaii, a Polynesian tribesman Zachry (Tom Hanks) is visited by Meronym (Halle Berry), one of the last members of the technology-based civilization. Both of them embark on a treacherous journey in search of Cloud Atlas, a communications station where she is able to send a message to people who have left Earth and now live on other planets.<br/><br/>No doubt the premise alone is intriguing enough to check out what's the big fuss surrounding this movie. CLOUD ATLAS is a movie filled with big ideas, but the Wachoswki siblings and Tom Tykwer's adapted screenplay is too heavy-handed, yet strangely hollow. That's not all, their non-linear storytelling approach is sometimes difficult to follow if one doesn't pay close attention. Meanwhile, the pacing is uneven, making this nearly three-hour movie almost like a chore to sit through.<br/><br/>While their screenplays are half-realized, their directions are equally lackluster. Sure, there are flashes of brilliance somewhere in the movie but not nearly enough to justify this as a satisfying cinematic experience. The 2144 segment, which obviously directed by the Wachowski siblings, is easily the most entertaining sequence here, even though the action are not up to the high standards of THE MATRIX trilogy. In the 2012 segment, directed by Tom Tykwer, the entire scene involving Timothy attempts to escape from the nursing home is suitably lighthearted, yet funny enough it's almost like revisiting ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, all the actors are gamely playful in their multiple roles. But it's really baffling why the filmmakers have to be so stereotypical for choosing white actor to play Asian role (e.g. Jim Sturgess in an unconvincing makeup as Hae-Joo Chang). Jim Broadbent is particularly a joy to watch for as the eccentric Timothy Cavendish, while it's fun to see Hugo Weaving in drag playing Nurse Noakes. Doona Bae gives a heartfelt performance as Sonmi-451, while Tom Hanks delivers a highly enthusiastic performance in a fake but entertaining Irish accent as the gangster author, Dermot Hoggins.<br/><br/>Blessed with a $100 million-budget tag (in which CLOUD ATLAS is among the most expensive independently-financed movies ever made), all the technical credits, ranging from its elaborate production designs to its special effects are visually stunning."
"jdneukom","6","2","5","10 February 2013"," The True True is a Knuckle Sandwich?
","This film really attempted something noble in it's artistic scope and especially with it's formatting--which was worth 3 stars on its own (amazingly all 6 stories were worthy of their own feature). Throw in another 2 stars for attractive sets, cinematography, competent acting, and the enchanting Cloud Atlas Sextet symphony. And finally toss in that final star for a couple of legitimate ""lol"" moments, namely Tom Hanks' present-day character tossing a book critic over a ledge, and for most of Jim Broadbent's caper in the 2012 strand. However, I can't go any higher than 6 stars for this...<br/><br/>...mainly because it was a very long film, that was perhaps overly ambitious to the point of being muddled. We're left with a story that's a near 3 h run time of editing contortionism to try and make a point about what exactly? Well, there's love and redemption certainly. There's also attainment of consciousness and struggle against oppression (slavery, stratification, ""big oil,"" unfair criticism/imprisonment, fascism/tyranny, savagery/tribalism). Not to mention, that the karmic theory of reincarnation is touched on heavily. What about that we're all connected in some small and large ways (we are not our own...etc)? Yep, that too. How about the strong trying to crush the weak? Sure, that was also mentioned. Conspiracy theories? Check, present in each timeline. Quantum physics and uncertainty? Yeah, that too...<br/><br/>While none of these theories are boring in and of themselves, it's just really too much to cram into a single movie with any degree of philosophical depth, even in a 3 h picture. The filmmakers would have been better served to cull out ONE of these philosophies (whichever they felt most strongly about) and use the plot device of multiple stories/repeating characters to drive that home and explore it in some depth. As it is, we have just a cursory examination of a number of philosophies, but it's just a jumble and much ado about nothing.<br/><br/>As for the plot itself, the movie is actually very good in that regard, with solid dialogue (except for the future story arc in which Jar Jar Binks could've easily held a conversation with Hanks and Berry's characters) and very good acting. Hugo Weaving and Jim Broadbent stood out. As did Doona Bae in the neo-Seoul story arc. Tom Hanks actually gave one of the weaker performances, and Halle Berry was just passable.<br/><br/>Basically, there are 6 ""vignettes"" that are separate but they are in the ""same universe.""<br/><br/>1. There is an 1849 story arc largely about an abolitionist achieving consciousness through befriending a stowaway slave. The protagonist writes a journal of his sea-faring adventure.<br/><br/>2. There is a 1930s story about a young, gay composer composing a brilliant symphony before committing suicide. This composer was heavily influenced, haunted really, by reading a partial account of the journal written in Story 1.<br/><br/>3. There is a 1970s story about an investigative reporter finding herself in a cloak-and-dagger world of corporate espionage. The protagonist is enchanted by a rare recording of the Cloud Atlas Sextet symphony from Story 2. Uniquely, this protagonist also meets the lover of the gay composer from Story 2.<br/><br/>4. A present-day story about a publisher who gets into hot water and hijinx ensue. This protagonist reads a mystery novel written by the protagonist from Story 3, which inspires him to write a screenplay.<br/><br/>5. A futuristic Seoul, Korea setting in which corporate/military fascism creates a kind of android who is liberated and discovers her humanity. This protagonist is influenced by the screenplay (made into a movie) written by the protagonist in Story 4 to start something of a revolution and become a martyr.<br/><br/>6. A story set further into the post-apocalyptic future, where the protagonist thinks of the character from Story 5 as a sort of deity.<br/><br/>So the physical connectivity of each story arc is obvious, though perhaps minimal. Also, one must mention the comet-shaped birthmark that the main character from each story sports, which happens to match the cosmos that Tom Hanks' elderly character gazes up at the beginning and end. However, the spiritual connectivity is really left to the viewer to decide and wade through a soup of philosophical/metaphysical underpinnings of who is reincarnated as who (if anyone) and to what purpose.<br/><br/>TL;DR: An almost spellbinding film that gets stuck in the undertow of it's own philosophical wake. Very crisp, clean, and attractively executed for the most part. Best aspects come in the form of very strong acting especially from Hugo Weaving always showing up to reprise his Matrix role (don't fight the natural order of things...) to the other characters' Neo roles. Jim Broadbent deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. For such a handsome production, though, some of the make-up is stunningly bad, especially the faux Koreans with laughable prosthetics on their foreheads."

","I watched this film twice.<br/><br/>The first time, I began watching the film without the sub-titles. When I reached the halfway mark, I finally gave up. I am not a native English speaker, which is probably why I could only manage to understand a word or two now and then between what sounded like people mumbling and whispering in a language that distantly resembled English. Especially the part where they show Tom Hanks and Halle Barry in some post-apocalyptic time. I could not understand almost 95 percent of what they spoke. Literally.<br/><br/>But lucky for me the movie came with English sub-titles. So I started watching the film again, right from the start, but this time with the English sub-titles on. But that didn't help much at all. True I could now fully understand what they were saying, but I guess I still needed a Master in Philosophy to put all that talk in a context. What was the context? Probably in an attempt to merge past, present and future into one single continuum, the film makers made every character looked like as if they were lost in deep contemplation, thinking about their 'pasts' and 'futures' in the 'present'. It looked as if only their bodies were in the present, but their minds were wandering somewhere in some distant past or some distant future. Their feelings and emotions, whenever they managed to show any, did not match what they spoke, most of the time. They looked like people whose minds were not focused on the tasks at hand. Like someone who is having sex, but was thinking about eating ice cream, and as a result, giving mixed and confusing messages. Maybe this is called art? <br/><br/>I believe the film makers probably intended this film to be a master artwork of some sort. The topic it discusses is complex, no doubt, but the film makers have, somehow, manged to turn it into something super-super complex. If the film makers wanted this film to be some sort of artwork, can't good artworks be produced in simple ways? Must good artworks be always super-super complex? Why use words and language which 99 percent of the world's population do not understand? Why use extremely vague clues, or no clues at all? Why make your characters sound like as if they were mumbling and whispering? <br/><br/>Turning a complex topic into something far more complex is probably not the best use of one's intelligence. If anything, it actually shows that the topic under discussion is not well understood by those who are trying to make others understand it. True intelligence, I believe, is shown when a super-complex topic is made into something that can be understood even by lay people.<br/><br/>Basically, I am frustrated that such a good topic, a film which could have been so good, has been ruined by unnecessary complexity. Still, I am of the opinion that every movie fan should watch this film at least once, because there is something in it that appeals one's soul and heart. <br/><br/>But don't feel bad if you do not understand the film, and don't say you do when you don't, because it is not really your fault if you don't manage to decipher and decode the film. This movie is designed not to be understood. Rather, this movie is probably designed, unintentionally most likely, to be felt only. Feel it and appreciate the mystery in it, because the message it conveys is probably true, but it is still far too complex a topic for our minds to understand. Even Einstein did not fully understand it. <br/><br/>That's all I have to say."

","An Art-House Lovers Delight <br/><br/>Please note – I am using a lot of other movie's name in order to make us understand the level of quality/class, and not comparing with those movies.<br/><br/>To be honest, after watching the wonderful Life of Pi, I had no interest in watching any other Art movie this year 2012. And Cloud Atlas!! It had 6 stories, 3hr run time, the failure of Speed Racer all made me stay away from CA (Cloud Atlas). <br/><br/>But after reading the reviews, I was amazed nobody has given a poor review. Hence, I watched it and WOW !! What a powerful come back by the Wachowski Brothers. It needs a strong heart, will, courage, support, belief and balls of steel to make this epic movie. It is as epic as the LOTR woven in just yes just 3hrs. Even the review cannot be summarized in a short paragraph. But, I will try to keep it simple.<br/><br/>High points – <br/><br/>1. Superb acting by Jim Broadbent followed by Hugh Grant, Tom Hanks, Ben Whishaw. <br/><br/>2. Cinematography was grand .. like Life of Pi <br/><br/>3. Story – Story telling initially u will feel like lost, but slowly everything comes to place; good pace & was gripping like the Inception. <br/><br/>4.

"fatema-zohra89","10","2","5","2 January 2013"," Its A 10/10
","Where do I begin from with Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>Thematically, The whole point of the movie was summed up in one basic dialog, ""Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime; and every kindness. We birth our future."" It was dramatic and emotional. This is one movie where I cannot highlight who the protagonist was because the characterization was done in a way that it doesn't highlight one single character but every character is interwoven living by the lines of the theme.<br/><br/>There were many important parts in the movie but what according to me stood out the most is the moment when zachary looks up at the stone in front and somewhere he was fearless because he felt he did wrong to his brother in law and now what stands ahead of him is what he deserved but meronym stands up to fight for him. The whole point according to me was that people deserve to be trusted or given a chance, but somewhere the truth stands that we don't want to give someone a chance unless we love them dearly and sometimes not even then.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was complex and timeless. This is another movie that I can watch over and over again and never get bored. Because it isn't one of the traditional movies where the simple plot is well received and easily understood. I believe the charm of this movie is its complexity created with parallel running story lines. It has intrigued me as an audience because every dialog delivered in this movie has depth in it. Profound depth that I'd like to remember so somewhere down the line I can quote them.<br/><br/>Through the period and its styling from clothing, make-up, accent; all of it should be credited to such fine actors and crew. Tom hanks, according to me, played diverse role like the others in the movie but in each of it he aced.<br/><br/>The one symbolism in the movie that I'll forever keep in mind is about transcending boundaries. That was inspiring, somewhere when bound, that's how I believe every individual would like to imagine it as in their heads.<br/><br/>If I begin to talk about dialogs; Then every philosophical dialog in that movie was beyond remarkable. It touched my heart, made me unmovable while I watched it, almost made me cry when Isaac died at the point of realization of his love for Luisa ray And the feelings sonmi held for hae joo chang, when she clarifies it to the interviewer that what she means is, she will always love him and the opening dialog about truth. How sonmi goes from an ordinary waitress to a woman to lead a revolution through knowledge and understanding... finally, how a soft, almost delicate girl accepts her death knowing that love is timeless. This movie reached a level of philosophy I can continue to discuss.<br/><br/>For me, I'll watch this movie again it's a 10/10 for me because complex topics like, love, destiny, fate and freedom cannot be painted or depicted in its entirety and what Cloud Atlas did was the best of what its director, writers and crew could have done."

","It can be against regime, beliefs, established values, but lets see what this masterpiece stands for. This movie completely explains why world peace, unity and prosperity are some things we wish for, but only few actually follow that path. Just a small number of us tend to act and inspire others to fight against greed, egos and all those demons who shadow us from the day one of our existence and will be there to escort humanity out of existence. Apparently, only when the last moment comes, when the final countdown is there, is when we became aware of what is important, essential but always overlooked and neglected. That love, good deeds, forgiveness, compassion are what humanity must adopt as main goals and outline as its purpose. Happy New Year World, I hope You will became a better place for all of us in 2013!"

","Cloud Atlas is a brave project and kudos to all those involved. The acting is top rated, as are the effects and the whole film is engaging but I fear its doomed to fail. Mainly because of the attention span of the average cinema customer. In these days of fast editing and smash cuts, it seems that if something does not happen every 3 minutes that people will lose interest.<br/><br/>Its a sad fact that a large percentage of people who this film is targeted at will either ,not be able to sit through the long running time, without texting to all the people they know that they're bored or be able to understand it. I myself found the first 30 minutes hard to concentrate on, mainly because of the dis-jointed nature but stuck with it and found it an enjoyable and touching film.

","It's quite difficult to review this movie fairly. It has a great story. The book itself was a bestseller. All of the 3 directors gave it their own touch. The whole point is also well put - no man/woman is to ""small"" to make the difference. It sounds like a cliché, but the story is told in an unique way. The makeup is something that also makes this movie great. Most of the actors play several different characters, and the transformation is unbelievable. All actors (especially Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent) did their best in this one. One of the problems with this movie would be low pace. Story goes from one era to another in every couple of minutes, but still it is not so confusing. Yet it is quite slow when you put it all together. For a movie that is 3 hour long and has such a complex story it is exhausting to keep full concentration. I watched it in a full theatre, and after second hour you could hear some people snoring. At the end everyone left their seats and nobody said a single word. I never saw such an reaction (or lack of it) from audience. Some were probably thinking about the point, but most of them were glad it was finally over. All together the movie is worth watching, but I recommend - during afternoon projections."

I enjoyed it but, based on the amount of groans in the theater, many of my fellow movie-goers found it tedious (maybe New Yorkers are just hard to please). The costumes are grand, and it's a gimmick that keeps the viewer interested in seeing what new characters will appear. The ending isn't all that great, but it's a welcome conclusion because the movie is extremely long. <br/><br/>I'm glad I saw it but definitely don't feel compelled to ever watch it again."

","We look unique, we live poles apart, our thoughts incompatible and our perceptions varied – are human beings that disconnected? The film ""Cloud Atlas"" does not think so, for actions of either crime or kindness in one life impacts another across time and space – from a voyage in 1849 to 1936 England, San Francisco of the 70s, present-day UK, a highly futuristic Korea and Hawaii 106 winters post-apocalypse. Six different settings, six different stories and six different genres – now this is a movie I have not seen before.<br/><br/>Based on the widely acclaimed - and considered to be unfilmable - novel by David Mitchell, 'ambitious', or an even stronger word, can be definitely applied here in realizing that the project attempts to turn six separate stories into one smooth narrative, has a budget of independently funded $100m, is directed by three people, is three hours long and includes an international all star cast i.e. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Doona Bae, Zhou Xun, Susan Surandon, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, the amazing Ben Whishaw etc. At first glance, there's amazement to be had and, along with it, worry since the outstanding nature of ""Cloud Atlas"" can either transcend it or bury it.<br/><br/>For me, the film sits safely on the former because the film has great visuals. However, this is to be expected considering the film is directed by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer, the ones who made slow-motion in the Matrix series a cinematic gimmick and successfully infused sinister into beauty in Perfume: Story of a Murderer, respectively. Along with that is an intriguing spiritually-driven story and six segments spanning six different movie genres that are all jaw-dropping. Also, there are powerful performances from everybody involved, particularly from a measured, intense and vulnerable Doona Bae as fabricant Sonmi~451. Furthermore, the editing is remarkable, with transitions seamlessly intertwining the six stories together (sometimes connecting them even), greatly aiding the film's pace and holding your interest throughout. Music (composed by Tykwer and his band) and cinematography (by both John Toll and Frank Griebe) are fabulous, with melancholy melodies and special shots that are undoubtedly memorable. The make-up is commendable as well, successfully giving six different looks to one actor, sometimes changing their race and even gender. Stay for the credits to see who's who – surprises are in store!<br/><br/>However, the make-up for the Korea segment is awful. It seems like they did not even try making Caucasians look like Asian, thus pulling you out of the experience quite constantly. While the editing is effective, you can only marvel its greatness later in the game because at the beginning, jumping from one story to another is jarring, border-lining madness even. However, the main complaint is reserved to the final segment in Hawaii, where, to remain faithful with the source material, characters mainly speak with a dialect that will burn your ears and brain i.e. 'smart' means technology and 'true-true' means truth. A word of warning: read this part in the novel first, double pretty please.<br/><br/>Despite these low points, ""Cloud Atlas"" is worth a ride to the cinema. This was the best 3 hours I have spent and like many, I am looking for another person to discuss the film (and perhaps see it again) with me. You may like it, you may hate it, but trust me go see it at least once because there will never be a film like this again. A solid 9 out of 10."

","It was very boring and very long. There was way too much going on while really going no where at the same time. As a viewer with each scene I felt like I had just walked into the middle of a conversation. What I really, really hated about this movie was the unnecessary use of gratuitous violence. If I wanted to see gory details I would go see a slasher film. Not really what I was expecting from the Wachowski team, or Tom Hanks to be associated with. I know many on here liked this film, and perhaps I am just too sensitive to violent images and long drawn out forever to get to the point story lines, but this movie was definitely not for me."

","Grossly over-acted, impossible-to-follow plot lines, absurd accents and the most jumbled editing ever. Boo! We had high expectations for Cloud Atlas. Unfortunately, our group of four smart and frequent movie-goers, walked out on Cloud Atlas after the first two confusing hours of painful cinematic failure. The storyline is complex, the accents are absurd and flawed. The six bizarre and pretentious plot lines jump around so poorly that you are dazed and confused. It's visually compelling, but nearly impossible to follow. Halle Berry, Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant ""chew the scenery"" with horribly bad accents. The Wachowski's reached to make a complex book into an epic drama and they got terribly lost along the way. I read a lot of great reviews calling this an ""epic,"" but it's a failure. There are aspects of the six stories that are interesting and the actors work hard, but this film is a mess. It's pretentious, long, arrogant and confusing for no good reason. It has been many years since we walked out on a film. About 20 others in the theater left too. We asked a manager as we left what he had heard from people... he said the film was very ""divisive"" among attendees, some liked it--some hated it, and both groups felt strongly. He indicated the film had a very large number of walkouts by unhappy film goers. I wish I had better things to say about this film... The effort was ambitious and expensive (over $100 Million to make.) It grossed $9 million opening weekend and was described widely as a ""bomb.""

","Pulp Fiction was made up , as I recall, of 3 unrelated mini-movies that ran sequentially. Cloud Atlas has 6 unrelated mini-movies that are interleaved, each being shown in roughly 10 minute vignettes. Don't waste your time trying to find a common thread between any of them. Well, in fact, there is ONE subtle inter-relationship between the ""Neo-Seoul 2144"" flick and the ""2321 After the Fall"" flick having to do with a character in the former now being worshiped as a goddess in the latter. But you'll have to listen closely to the pigeon-English spoken by the post-apocalyptic tribes-people in hopes of ever detecting this. And how the 'shooting-star' tattoo, occurring in 3 of the flick, relates is never resolved.I can't say that Cloud Atlas wasn't entertaining, but it certainly was not thought provoking. And I can't even remember a single melody, or segment of, from the sound track..was there even a sound track ?

","I saw the trailer and a review for this film before its release, it sounded like a really interesting concept about history, time and human morality, and from the makers of The Matrix, the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (formerly Larry(!)), I was looking forward to seeing if it really was worth it. Basically six interrelated and interwoven stories take the audience from the 19th century to the distant, post-apocalyptic future, going backwards and forwards in time, showing stories play out long enough to switch to another, and all have the same familiar faces in different historical guises. In 1849 in the South Pacific Ocean young American lawyer Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) from San Francisco during the California Gold Rush, is concluding business for his father-in-law Haskell Moore (Hugo Weaving) with Rev. Giles Horrox (Hugh Grant) in the Chatham Island. Ewing witnesses Moriori slave Autua (David Gyasi) who was a stowaway being whipped and he becomes a freeman from advocating, meanwhile Ewing is slowly being poisoned by Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks) to steal valuables, but he is saved by Autua, and returning to America Ewing and his wife Tilda (Doona Bae) join the Slavery Abolishment Movement. In 1936 in Cambridge, England and Edinburgh, Scotland, bisexual twenty three year old English musician Robert Frobisher (Skyfall's Ben Whishaw) starts working for famous composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent) to help write his music, and doing inspires him to write his own masterpiece composition, we see in Ayr's house is the journal of Ewing. Frobisher starts writing his piece, ""The Cloud Atlas Sextet"", but Ayrs wants credit for creating the music, threatening to expose his scandalous background if he doesn't get it, but the young shoots him, he finishes the masterpiece and shoots himself before Rufus Sixsmith (James D'Arcy) his lover arrives. In 1973 in San Francisco, California, journalist Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) meets an older Sixsmith by chance, he is now a nuclear physicist, he tips her off about the new nuclear reactor run by Lloyd Hooks (Grant) and a conspiracy about the safety, but before he can prove this report he is killed by Bill Smoke (Hugo Weaving), a hit-man who works for Hooks. She finds letters to Sixsmith from Forbisher, and she is passed a copy of the report by other power plant scientist Isaac Sachs (Hanks), but Smoke kills Sachs and tries to run her off a bridge to drown, but she survives and with the help of Joe Napier (Keith David), the head of security at the plant, and she exposes the plot for the benefit oil companies by creating an accident. In 2012 in the United Kingdom, sixty five year old publisher Timothy Cavendish (Broadbent) has to potential to make it big with the publication of a book by gangster Dermot Hoggins (Hanks), who was sent to jail for murdering a critic, but the gangster's associates threaten to kill him if they do not get a share of profits from the publication. Cavendish gets help from his brother Denholme (Grant), but he is tricked by him into going to a nursing home to hide, there he is treated poorly by unjustly cruel Nurse Noakes (Weaving), and held against his will, but he and other ""inmate"" patients plan to escape and succeed, and returning the publisher gets the life of Rey in a manuscript and also writes a screenplay based on his nursing home experience. In 2144 in Neo Seoul, Korea, genetically engineered clones are servants in a restaurant, one of them is fabricant Sonmi-451 (Bae) who faces execution and is interviewed before, and she recalls being released from the servitude by ""Union"" rebel movement member Commander Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess), she sees a movie based on Cavendish's adventure while in hiding. The Union rebels reveal that food for future fabricants is made up of killed fabricants that have been ""recycled"", and Sonmi-451 is taken to Hawaii to make a public broadcast and manifesto to take on society to end slavery and fabricant exploitation, and when a firefight breaks out Hae-Joo and the other Union members are killed, so she gets her time to end her broadcast before being captured, she is killed after telling her story. In the date called ""106 winters after The Fall"" (apparently the year 2321), in The Big Island, where a primitive society called ""The Valley"" still exist, following ""The Fall"" when most of humanity where killed, Zachry (Hanks) lives with his sister and young niece Catkin (Raevan Lee Hanan), and there Sonmi is worshipped by the tribes people as a goddess. Zachary lives with hallucinations of goblin-like figure Old Georgie (Weaving) who constantly manipulates him about his decisions, especially causing him to have unnecessary fear, and it leads to the murder by the cannibalistic Kona tribe killing his friend and friend's son, and the village gets visited by ""Prescients"" member Meronym (Halle Berry), they are a race who that keep remnants of technology from before the Fall. Zachary agrees, following Catkin's life from a stonefish sting, to guide Meronym to search for Cloud Atlas, a communications station, in the mountains, they will use it to send a message to the colonies of Earth, and there the Valley tribes discover the truth about Sonmi being a mortal, unlike the goddess they believe she was. Zachary is almost convinced by Old Georgie to kill Meronym for blasphemy, but he sees the video of Sonmi and changes his mind, and returning he finds that the Kona tribe have slaughtered his people, so he kills their Chief (Grant) and rescues Catkin, and before being attacked again Meronym rescues them, and they all travel together for a boat leaving the Big Island. In at least six roles between them the cast of established stars are in all time periods played out, I can't really comment on particular stars, they were all good, the special effects were fantastic, it was very long and very complicated, but good thrilling entertainment, a different kind of science-fiction fantasy. Worth watching!"

Two days later, after long and deep discussions we are still trying to find something positive from this experience. In vain... It is more than obvious that the movie wants to pass deep, inner messages and meanings. After one hour of screening we were looking to each other whispering ""they want to tell us something, watch carefully"". Ending titles... The result? 3 LOST hours ladies & gentlemen. We watched the film in a fully booked screening. The verdict was unanimous, believe me... What I keep is the beautiful actors and their interesting character changing.

Like ""The Matrix"", it's a thinking picture -- you'll likely leave it with friends talking about what it says and what it means -- but unlike The Matrix, it's a lot less of an action picture. There's one segment which does have a fair amount of action, but most of the story isn't filled with very much of things like that. It's a lot more ""characterization"" based.<br/><br/>The trailers are slightly deceptive, too. They make it look as though it goes from the distant past into the far future, but in reality, it spans about 500 years starting in around 1830 or so.<br/><br/>The theme is the connectedness of all humanity, and of how what goes around comes around... Karma, in the classic sense. Even if you don't believe in Karma, it's still the kind of picture that engenders discussion about why you, or those around you, believe or disbelieve.<br/><br/>I'd suggest its cinematography does make good use of the large screen, and will suffer on the small one... so it should be seen in a theater and not just in the home cinema."

","I am going to start off by saying that I was very excited to see this film. The trailer made it look so interesting and engaging. I think that there is a certain fascination with reincarnation that will draw folks in to see this film, whether you believe in it or not. I expected the film to flow seamlessly from one life to another; that was not the case. I recommend that you drink a red bull and wear something comfortable before you purchase that ticket. There are two main points that I want to make.. One is that the film is a hodgepodge of mini stories that keeps hopping around (hence the red bull). The second point is that this film is long; really long (hence the comfortable clothes). By the time this film was over I was more than ready to get out of there. With all that being said, the film did have some beautiful scenery, but I spent most of the time trying to relate the cast of characters from one life to the next life. Normally in these reviews I would write about the actors and their characters, but that will be difficult to do in this case since all the main actors play so many different roles, so I will just write about what I felt like were the main ones. Plus, I don't want to ruin the fun for the rest of you. The film begins and ends with Zackry (Tom Hanks). When first introduced you are not quite sure if he is from the past or from the future, but all is revealed in the end. Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) is an investigative reporter (among other roles) who is trying to follow in her father's footsteps by uncovering a major injustice in the oil industry. Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) is the most endearing character. I was rooting for her all the way throughout the film, although when she showed up again in the 1700s, I was a little bit surprised. There are a whole lot of actors that I can mention, but it would be too exhausting. I will say this. This film is an excellent test of acting skills and stretches the actors in all kinds of directions. The question is whether or not this film is worth getting butt blister to see. I am teetering between amber and green, but I am going to go with a green light just because the subject matter is so engaging."

","Suppose you consider going to the cinema and want to see if a particular movie is worth watching. What do you do? Well, checking the film description and the trailer would sound like a logical thing to do. Having done both, you feel you have enough information to ground your decision upon, right? Well, wrong. Not in this case. The description and the trailer make you expect a nice mixture of Sci-Fi, mysticism, and philosophy combined with decent CGI and action sequences - but what you actually get is a wagonload of leftist propaganda whose presentation is about as subtle as forced stuffing of the stomach through an esophageal feeding tube. It's all there. Homosexuals? Check. Radical feminists? Check. Race mixing? Check. Noble black slaves abused by malicious whites? Check. Brave illegal immigrants? Check. Characters speaking in political statements and slogans? Check. Naturally, all the ""non-whites"" are exclusively ""good guys"" – I'll leave you to guess about the skin color of the ""bad guys"". Talk about racism. :) I have also noticed that propaganda and logic rarely come hand in hand – the latter may easily be (and usually is) sacrificed for the benefit of the former. For instance, the existence of a slaughterhouse for female Asian clones (want to guess what race the butchers are? :)) has no valid logical explanation – but who needs one? The idea is to shock – not to be logical. The same goes for a female journalist successfully ""handling"" a security chief and an ex-marine. Realistic? No. Logical? No. But if the point is to make a drastic emphasis on feminist ""independence"" - well, then There are, however, certain good sides to the film too – the acting was good (considering the cast, this is not really surprising), the whole ""retirement home"" plot line was OK too (though partially ruined by the – again – politically-laden speech about ""rights""), the CGI was not bad either However, this does not save the film from being what it is - a compendium of leftist ideological statements transformed into exaggerated imagery. I have witnessed Soviet propaganda and brainwashing efforts, and thus I find attempts at ideological indoctrination through what is presented as ""art"" repulsive. Well, at least I learned the lesson and will from now on disregard official ads and reports. Note: if you want to watch this ""Left-Wing Manifesto"", yet for some reason feel that male homosexuals with a bent for gerontophilia are not really ""your thing"", you might want to have some antiemetics at hand. :)"

It is a movie that is very telling about humanity, and sometimes humans just don't want to face the truth about humanity. There were touches of comedy with the tale of the old publisher. And there were also hints of other famous films. The story of the server girl slave had hints of the film Soylent Green.

","You remember that feeling you got the first time you saw 'The Empire Strikes Back?' That feeling that you were watching something bold, important and epic? That feeling will return with 'Cloud Atlas.'<br/><br/>Often times films can have trailers that supersede them. 'Cloud Atlas' seems to have such a trailer, but it turns out to be a film that is everything its trailer suggests it's only pretending to be. It's a film that is ostensibly imperfect in almost every way, but, at the same time, believes in itself to such an extent that it triumphs over the bullies. It's the weird, ugly one that everybody is secretly friends with and confides in. It's comfortable with who and what it is, and that shows. It speaks its mind without preaching its messages. To this end the film chooses, rather, to open up its heart to the audience and invite them along for the ride. It's out of shape, a bit awkward, and always audacious just for audacity's sake, and it embraces all of this. Probably the most secure movie to come out in years. I was thrilled, scared, tickled, touched, and, most of all, satisfied. Entertaining to its very core.<br/><br/>The various makeup/wardrobe gimmicks may distract some and, to that degree, bother others. Did they distract me? Not necessarily. Maybe at first. But I kinda went into this expecting it, thanks to all of the other reviews of the film circulating around the web that go to unnecessary lengths when complaining about 'who's playing who?' and 'what's that?' and 'that's HER?' Overall, you will notice the fake- Asians and the big, prosthetic noses, but you should not let that get in the way of one of the year's best theater experiences."

The connections that there are aren't even worth telling. That's why the film leaves one in front of the TV thinking ""When exactly do they get to the point?""

"Marc_Action","6","2","6","21 May 2014"," Forget an Atlas, you're going to need a GPS
","For a film with multiple directors and 6 different story-lines (and even several different genres within a single movie), it wasn't quite the train wreck that I expected. The excellent cinematography and the ensemble cast were its saving points, and I must admit that the premise of such a film in itself is unique. And while I did enjoy seeing the actors play varying roles in different time-lines, I'm on the fence as to the effectiveness of the make-up and costumes. Some were very good (Hugo Weaving as the demonic Old Georgie) and on the other hand, very cheap and cartoonish (Donna Bae, an Asian actress, as the 19th century Caucasian female, Tilda Ewing). Not that I have an issue with an actor of one race playing the role of a character from another race. It's acting, so I applaud it. However, if the director is going to take this approach, then it should be taken seriously and the make-up should be done right. Just take a look at Robert Downey, Jr. playing a Caucasian method actor, Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. In the film Lazarus appears stuck in his role as a black soldier, Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Most importantly, his make-up is very convincing, even though the audience knows Downey's character is only playing the role of another race. <br/><br/>Moving on - the good points aside, I'm not sure why the film has received such high ratings from viewers. Nearly three hours of zipping back and forth at random between 6 different plots is a daunting task for the audience to keep pace with, and I agree with others that it would have fared much better as a mini-series on HBO or something. However, even this isn't the film's biggest sin. The biggest flaw of the film is that the writers try to force connections between the various plots and time-lines where, for the most part, none exists.<br/><br/>""I've read letters written by this so-and-so musician from 36 years ago"" and bam! There's a connection Or ""I've seen a film about the life of this so-and-so author from 132 years ago"" and bam! There's a connection Give me a break! That's no more a connection than me one day listening to a little known composer like Hungary's Zoltan Kodaly (with no previous exposure or recollection of him), then developing an instant connection to the guy. It's shallow and a cheap way to move the plot along. With the way the movie zips back and forth between story lines, most people had trouble just figuring out what the heck was going on, let alone trying to recognize the connections between the different plots. Which brings me to my last disappointment: the movie makers ask the audience to investment nearly three hours of their time to this project, which requires the viewer to use vast amounts of mind power unlike any other film. The suspense builds, builds, and then builds some more but in the end Cloud Atlas didn't really deliver the ""bang""; makes one feel cheap and dirty after giving this film so much time and cerebral commitment. That's not a good thing <br/><br/>There's also a preachy theme that runs throughout all of the 6 story lines (some more than others), so it wasn't a big surprise that the filmmakers would try to end things on a high moral point. But it misses the mark, and only furthers my opinion that they rushed each story in order to cram them all into one movie. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind preachiness in a film, so long as it's warranted. Here, the stories just don't resonate the deep meaning that the movie makers are trying to get you to buy into. Sorry."

","I went into to this movie really wanting to like it. I generally like movies that deal with philosophy and spirituality. Ultimately, though, when I was through watching it, I felt very disappointed. This movie seemed to promise a lot. It seemed to promise some profundity. As far as I can see, though, this movie's entire premise can be summed up in one word: karma. The movie is telling us that what goes around comes around. That's all well and good, but the theme of karma does not require such a pretentious presentation. It's not as if it is some profound revelation. Many people are familiar with this concept. Perhaps there is more to this movie than just that. But if there is, it went over my head. The other main problem that I had with this movie is the way the stories unfolded. The movie told six independent stories of different genres. That sounds pretty cool, but they weren't told sequentially, they were all inter-spliced with each other. In other words, only ten minutes of one story would be told before moving on to ten minutes of the next story and on and on until it eventually cycled back to another ten minutes of the original story. That sounds like an interesting and unconventional form of filmmaking. The problem with that is I spent so little time with each story that I didn't have a chance to get invested in any of them. The movie never builds any momentum. I never got a chance to care about any of the characters. It's like flipping through six different movies on TV and trying to follow all of them. It doesn't help that none of these stories are very interesting to begin with. I guess editing the movie this way is supposed to imply that all of these stories are intertwined. It doesn't. The film is a success in terms of cinematography and acting, but it is a failure in terms of storytelling. I have to give credit to the directors for trying an experimental form of filmmaking. Sadly this is an experiment that failed."

","I watched the TV version (have not seen the movie version) so do not know what the difference is. However much the photography and scenery were fantastic, I do admit. But what I was dismayed with was the jerky-jerky panning back and forth between different time eras. Each vignette was hacked into pieces and jumbled up like playing 52 card pickup. My mind kept reeling back and forth as my mind was jerked out of one era into another and then back again with no seeming reasoning. But what I disliked the most was the mumbling of Tom Hanks in the part where he and this woman are living a kind of primitive life and must climb a mountain. I do not know what to call the scene, but I found the rambling mumbling and consequent horrible bastardized English to be atrocious. I am sure that the script made Hanks turn his speech into nonsense because I have always admired Hanks for his elocution - but this part was horrendous. It irritated me to sit there watching this character who sounded like a backward primitive from the swamps of Louisiana who had never heard the English Language pronounced correctly. I give an ""F"" to the script writers and the director for this - forcing viewers to bite off of a dead stick. There is no room for poor elocution as far as I am concerned. If he was going to speak incoherent English, let him say it CLEARLY! That way, we all know he is speaking nonsense and gibberish rather then mumbling it under his breath.<br/><br/>Between the jumbled scenes and jerky-jerky plots and sub-plots, with action ripping my brain out left to right in no common order and being rendered senseless with gibberish and mumbled parts, I found this film product to be sorely lacking and probably one of Hank's worst ever films."

The movie delivers a series of separate events across centuries, in which previous events would provide deliverance for people in the future. Not a very novel idea.

However; real events throughout history are far more compelling and interesting than this fictional hodgepodge. <br/><br/>The most laughable part of this bloated time waster, was when the Asian Cyborg (anticipated to become humankind's deliverer) was standing projected hugely larger than life, voicing her philosophical directives above a battle in which her collective fought the evil enforcers.

","What happened to Tom Tykwer? Remember, this is the guy who 15 years ago directed 'Lola Rennt' ('Run Lola Run'), which became a sort of cult classic because it was a fresh, original and imaginative piece of film making. <br/><br/>Now, Tykwer is one of three directors who made 'Cloud Atlas', which is the complete opposite of everything 'Lola Rennt' stands for. 'Cloud Atlas' is ambitious, pretentious, bloated, and so heavy it almost gets crushed under its own weight. On second thoughts: scrap the word 'almost'. <br/><br/>'Cloud Atlas' consists of six different stories, set in different places and time periods, each played by the same set of actors. They vary form historical drama (a slave trader turning into an abolitionist), political thriller (an investigative reporter uncovering a scandal involving a nuclear power plant), slapstick comedy (an elderly publisher getting locked up in an old people's home), love story (a gay couple in pre-war England), to science fiction (a clone-like creature being freed in 22nd century Seoul). <br/><br/>The stories are shown in short scenes, jumping from one to the other. They are connected, but in a very minimal way. In some cases, so minimal that I didn't discover the connection watching the film, but only afterward, reading the comments on the internet. During the scenes, there are pieces of narration about universal themes like space, time, God, love, etcetera. Even Darwin turns up at one moment. <br/><br/>It is clear that you have to watch this movie several times to really understand it. I don't know if this is a quality. It can also be an indication that the movie makers have tried to do too much, that they have put too many elements into one single film, that they have given the audience so many messages that it is inevitable that, after seeing it for the first time, you are left confused, dazed and frustrated. I think the movie would have been better with only three or four stories instead of six, and with more clear elements of how they are connected. <br/><br/>Much can be said about the meaning of the movie. The central theme of the six stories seems to be the quest for freedom and the fight against oppression. The implied message is that the world doesn't change, and that throughout time we keep on repeating the same behaviour. The movie is open for interpretation; those who like can find plenty of political, religious and even environmental themes in it. <br/><br/>Apart from the gimmick of getting rid of the boundaries of time and space, I didn't find 'Cloud Atlas' particularly remarkable. The six stories in themselves are rather conventional and thin. The acting is adequate - the idea of each actor playing six different roles is challenging but doesn't necessarily lead to superb acting. The cinematography is what you'd expect for a big budget film. In my opinion, this film is special for its audacious scope, but not because it's such a good watching experience."

In the end, after nearly two hours of watching I didn't want the film to end, superbly crafted and intricate finish. Beautifully enigmatic, with twists and turns at times you don't know if it is coming or going. If you like puzzles and brainteasers, you should watch this film. Overall excellent experience, and really it is an 'experience' watching this film, 10 out of 10, enjoy!"
"dr-ong","10","2","6","13 February 2013"," A groundbreaking epic that is both entertaining and cerebral..!
","A potent combination of top-notched directors (Matrix, Run Lola Run), star-studded cast (Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Zhou Xun, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant) and USD100 million results in an illuminating epic; with dazzling and sweeping visuals spanning space-time. SUPERB...<br/><br/>The main storyboard (adapted from award-winning novel by British author David Mitchell) is about Kamma / Karma (action and reaction aka cause and effect) and the process of rebirth, illustrated by the lives of six individuals. The Old Georgie character well played by Hugo Weaving becomes increasingly degenerate through his own actions in different births, causing his woeful (mara-like) state by the end of the movie. In stark contrast, the character played by the ever-lovable Tom Hanks, gradually transforms from a murderous doctor, to become a noble man, during the process of becoming (rebirths) through making the right choices at each pivotal juncture in his lives.<br/><br/>The movie also makes a point that no one is permanent in his / her identity or 'self', as the character played by co-star Halle Berry switches from a highly talented and sentimental homosexual man to rebirths as different female persons during the cycles of life and death i.e. the Dhamma / Dharma principle of Anatta (non-self / insubstantiality). Apart from gender identity, racial identity is also an illusory aspect of the 'self', showcased by Jim Sturgess (alternating between Caucasian and Asian rebirths e.g. Adam Ewing, Megan's dad and Hae-Joo Chang) and Zhou Xun (hotel manager Talbot, Yoona-939 and Rose).<br/><br/>To truly appreciate the extent of care and effort the directors have dedicated themselves to accurately portray the natural laws of rebirth, action and reaction and insubstantiality in a cinematic setting, it is useful for the movie viewer to be familiar with the published works of Professor Ian Stevenson (University of Virginia, School of Medicine, USA), Newton's Third Law (physics) and quantum research into subatomic particles (muon, tau, energy as heat, light, electro-magnetism, electricity and so on).<br/><br/>In case all these sound too cerebral, I must add that Cloud Atlas delivers the same high octane level of entertainment and excitement as the box office hits - Matrix Trilogy and Run Lola Run, which are also iconic films by the directors of Cloud Atlas."

","Off the bat, after seeing the preview for Cloud Atlas, I was very intrigued to find out more about this film. It is a film like no other, and from the directors, Andy Wachowski one of the great minds behind the Matrix trilogy. Cloud Atlas without question had his touch and creativity. The different stories that the filmmakers somehow combine so perfectly is amazing, yet at times its hard not to get lost in one story and all of a sudden switch to the next which was tough to get used to at first. Overall the stories were very interesting and how they all seem to intertwine, the acting is superb with a nice buffet of great actors makes this film absolutely amazing. It is however a shame that Cloud Atlas was very questionably overlooked by awards, but it is a true winner in my book."
"defmecha-23","Null","2","6","27 November 2012"," A perspective in understanding the message of the movie
","For all those who are a bit confused with the story or the message of the movie, I offer a perspective that may be helpful. <br/><br/>I think it is important to first and foremost understand that the movie is an allegory. The characters and plot are used to show us how interconnectedness works in all of our lives. The characters are only analogies in trying to explain the director's view. That is the underlying foundation that holds everything together. Don't get lost in plot, because plot alone cannot explain what the director's are trying to share.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie is that we are influenced by and influence everything. <br/><br/>The resolution of conflict takes place between those who are consumed by ego, ""They want more"", (i.e. greedy corporations, slave drivers, crazy face painted tribesman) versus a letting go of ego (understanding another's point of view, not fearing standing up for others, feeling connected).<br/><br/>An example of the forces of extreme ego fighting with truth is when the slave and the lawyer trusted and believed in each other only because they saw the truth in each other. Throughout the remainder of the movie we see how this initial trust in each other, help them throughout their journey. Can anyone argue that they are not kindred spirits? Their positions in life would never allow them to connect. And their positions in life are a direct result of how our collective ego's (greed) allow for one man to enslave another. However, in their case, they connected on a deeper level and their relationship was beautiful because of it.<br/><br/>Then there was the scene when the slave showed everyone that he is the Michael Jordan of sailing. The Captain was ruled by his ego's ideas of the world (slaves are only good for one thing). He had to see the TRUTH in order for him to accept the slave as a sailor. He had to suspend his ego (I know what is best) in order to allow the truth to come in (I was wrong, don't shoot that man). That is a powerful message.<br/><br/>And there was one more somewhat subtle example of how something from the ""past"" can change our lives. When the Korean girl's friend is killed, she is killed because she stands up for herself. Her only reference of doing so is watching a clip from a movie based on a period of time when freedom was a given (the old man stating that he would not stand for the injustice). Her death had an affect on the main girl (the director made sure to make this clear for us), and it was the beginning of her emancipation. Events like these happen all the time in our lives, we aren't necessarily aware of them all the time. And her standing up for her rights was extremely serious but the origin of that was actually very comical.<br/><br/>The whole movie is jam packed with these things and more. And seeing between the lines is where this movie is at. <br/><br/>From a general Western perspective, this movie does not work. I think that's what killed it for a lot of people,. That and not knowing the philosophy behind the movie. Most of the West isn't aware of the concept of we are all one. And so, I think that this requires some open mindedness in not seeing the movie through a hard line Western perspective. It may also require getting acquainted with other world views.<br/><br/>I hope this gave some clarity for some."
"boulderlauren","9","2","6","22 November 2012"," Epic!
","I laughed and cried. All actors did a wonderful job. All notable. It was fantastic to see Hugh Grant as a bad guy and he pulled it off. The makeup and costumes were excellent. The tech was excellent as well. This film is unique in the way it spanned so many time periods and historic issues, but carried a theme of good verses evil, the sacrifices that sometimes must be made to stand up against evil and the value of freedom.<br/><br/>We all walked away saying wow. We all want to see it a few more times because there are so many details we know we missed. I say this in a good way. The story had so much heft that it warrants another viewing or two. We had spirited debates about the meaning of the birth mark. I think when a film inspires spirited debate it's a good thing."
"vagosfilms","7","2","6","21 November 2012"," Great technical achievement, great fun, but little essence
","I won't bother to mention the positive sides of this movie, since they are well presented in most reviews. I agree that it takes the art of cinematography to its best. Technically, it is almost a perfect film. But that is not the reason I go to the cinema -to see only technical achievements- and that is why I will insist on some negative sides.<br/><br/>The film had great possibilities to touch some important issues, like what is important in life and what is not, what are the consequences of one's actions, and the chance of the existence of some evolution through the circle of lives and deaths. I was a bit disappointed to see that this great idea of reincarnation was only addressed superficially, as a series of make up and costumes on the same actors, who seemed to live their lives without experiencing the results of their own actions, but only those of others. The notion of reincarnation is connected to the notion of 'karma', which means that one should experience the result of one's own actions sooner or later. This movie missed a great chance (in my opinion) to deal with this important issue.<br/><br/>I guess the directors avoided to put much philosophy in the film, because they had their eyes on addressing a bigger audience, and I can understand that, given the huge budget of the film. It's just a bit sad that there is so much junk on cinemas, just to please the lazy 'average viewer' and there is not bigger effort in trying to educate him/her. That's why i appreciate the 'Tree of Life' a bit more than this one.<br/><br/>(of course, its always easy to judge somebody else's work, but I haven't made a better film myself, just saying...)"

Perhaps marketing has something to do with that-is it a sci-fi, drama, or whatever..its difficult to nail down to one or more. <br/><br/>When I first saw the first trailer I couldn't wait to see the movie. I did re-watch the trailer a number of times but that only made me want to see it more. My son and I watched it the first week and immediately feel in love with the movie. In fact we wanted to see it again right away!<br/><br/>There are plenty of other reviews that you can read more into the stories of the movie but at the end of the movie my heart was crying: for joy and sadness at the same time."
"npogar","7","2","6","5 November 2012"," Visually Stunning, but Falls Short of Its Grand Expectations
","Despite the massive undertaking of trying to encapsulate the immensity of the novel, no one could have done it better than the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer - the film, in it's very simplest representation, is beautiful. The Costume Design & Makeup team deserve an Oscar for their work as the actors are, at times, so heavily disguised that even the most astute audience member will be surprised to learn who played who.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film and its several plot lines lack the cohesion that only the novel could cultivate. With nearly three hours (172 minutes) run time, it still seems not enough time is given to develop the characters and their relationship, and thus, limiting the viewers' emotional investment. The performances are amazing, settings and CGI handled very well, but when it's all over, you're simply left with fragments of each story.<br/><br/>My rating of 7/10 is due, in part, to my belief that no one could have produced a better adaptation. Visually stunning, Cloud Atlas is worth seeing, but does not live up to the gargantuan expectations held before it."

"stevesutton-74951","8","1","2","26 April 2020"," Nietzsche in the Clouds
","The story is based on the premise of eternal recurrence (popularised by Nietzsche), whereby time is infinite but the events within it are finite, and as such these events repeat themselves, mutadis mutandis. Individuals find themselves within in these repeating events, albeit undertaking different roles and offer different dynamics.<br/><br/>Within Cloud Atlas we find a series of small stories where each different protagonist has to overcome obstacles that enables history to move forward. Whilst each event may have the same characters involved, each story has them playing different roles within the story. Their different reflections enable a 'collective consciousness' to evolve in order for history to move forward.<br/><br/>Each story is fragmented and interwoven with each other, leading to a progression and humanisation of time. We have episodes that involve slave ownership, industrial corruption, revolution in a techno-tolitarian state, and a hilarious escape from a nursing home. And we have an interconnectedness, either directly or indirectly, through each characters on their influence on history.<br/><br/>That said, was it a good movie? It's a good movie, although in my opinion not a great movie. The motif is story driven rather than character driven, so you can't expect outstanding displays of acting. Although having said that, they were good solid performances, particularly from Hanks (However, his attempt at a english accent was Dick van Dyke-ish) The major problem is that the film is a victim of it's own premise, in that if events repeat themselves then there can be no climax, no telos. To this extent the film felt flat. I never got that 'Oomph' feeling at the end of the film. I felt I was being spoon fed a philosophical idea, and the story line(s) and acting were somehow subordinate to this.
And isn't this latter reason why we want to watch movies?<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable movie, and I would certainly recommend it."

"CinematicInceptions","7","1","2","8 June 2018"," Good premise, but with much lacking.
","This is a movie that I hope gets re-made someday. It's a really cool premise, and it wasn't exactly executed badly here, but I definitely felt like there was something lacking in it. I turned Mr. Nobody off in the first 20 minutes because I got the sense that it, like Cloud Atlas was going to get a little too caught up in the novelty of its premise and not actually do something interesting with it. This movie is trying to make a pretty interesting, deep, existential point about life. The premise I think is a bit more appealing as a movie premise to Western cultures because we, for the most part, do not believe in reincarnation. It seemed like the whole point of the movie was that our actions can have an impact on people that live long after us, which I definitely believe in and I don't think a lot of people could argue against it that strongly. However, I didn't see that any of the storylines actually connected in a meaningful way. It just seemed like all the characters got re-incarnated as someone else in each situation and you had to just play a ""match the face"" game with each story line. Also, they all seemed to be reincarnated as the same type of character each time. Now, I don't know much about what some Eastern religions believe about reincarnation, but the way I understand it, your starting point in one life is based on what you did in your previous life and you're supposed to try to do better each time around. I'd like to think that we change enough over one lifetime that we'd be unrecognizable from one life to the next; in other words, I'm saying the casting choices of this movie are not true to life even if they are cinematic and interesting.<br/><br/>I think there was also not really enough attention given to each storyline and they were a little too complicated to keep track of all of them. Say you have 30 minutes for each different story, you can't expect the audience to know where each one is at. That works for TV shows sometimes, but even then it's can get confusing. I didn't really care enough about each story to be invested in any of them, which I think indicates that they bit off a little more than they could chew. Also, the two futuristic stories felt kind of ridiculous, especially the language of the people in the future Hawaii. That was nothing short of annoying. It also seemed that those two were the only ones that were connected in any kind of meaningful way, which is another weak point for the story. <br/><br/>So I'm just going to suggest two ideas for how this could be re-made or at least tweaked in concept. One is a version where it follows one person over several different lifetimes, even though something tells me that's been done before. The other is a version that connects a few people from different times that are more directly connected, sort of like Interstellar or X-Men Days of Future Past. I think it would be possible and really cool to show two connected stories in parallel where the actions of the past person were directly influencing the events of the future person's life. The only person I would trust to turn this exact concept into a story that would fulfill its potential is Christopher Nolan because he has mastered using non-linear storytelling and has proven that he can blend concepts of time and human emotion/connection really well.<br/><br/>I would recommend this lightly. It's not bad, but its not as good as its premise sounds. I wouldn't try to keep track of everything because it won't really make it a better experience for you or anything like that. Basically, it's a cool enough premise that is well-paced enough to keep your attention and make you think a little, but it's not nearly as good as it could be. Overall Rating: 7.4/10."
"mailalputku","10","1","2","20 July 2017"," A spectacular aspect is given
","I clearly know that there are a lot of messages we can extract from this epic movie but the greatest of them all is an aspect of seeing the time and world as a whole with people's lives. As humans we can approach life from only 1 aspect. We suppose that the only results of our acts are bound to us and we are the only winners or sufferers of our acts, we are the only one who know them or gets effected by them. Reality is that time drags every single act and person with it. Bad, good or idealist no matter who or what kind of person we are, our kind will never ever extinct but only Will increase or decrease as numbers. But every individual is fighting for their survival, ideas, thoughts. For ideals (Hae Joo-Chang and son-mi) for the loved ones (Zachry) for work ethics Luisa Rey) for humanity (Moronym). No matter what we are fighting for, it is not for first time and it is not for last time. What we do and how we form our lives are in relation with people, people from past and future and their lives. As Sonmi says, ""Our lives are not our own, we are bounded to others, past and present. and by each crime and every kindness rebirth our future."" Even tough this is a reality there are very few people who are aware of it. Just like scientists and artists who bring this world new things and creations, they are never forgotten and they will always evolve from starts of their existences. The ones who are aware of this, know that not only one of them can achieve their ideals or the kindness they dream of, but with next generations and other people who act like them.

I have to admit that during the three hours (15 minute short of 3 hours) of the film, I was constantly struggling to understand it! <br/><br/>The stories themselves were pretty clear on their own but somehow I was not really into the message that the movie was trying to pass. It was really difficult to follow during the movie and to connect the dots. Tom Hanks was brilliant. For me, this movie served as a reminder of his greatness as an actor and his chameleon ability that has made him what he is. <br/><br/>The effects were awesome and it was quite unique to see all these eras blending in one big story. I think that it was too spread out for my taste or in general. It was difficult for the viewer to keep a coherent perception in his mind while watching the film.

Although the physical link between each story is weak, the idea of the cast acting several characters in different stories to represent the theme of reincarnation is quite cool and unique. It's to show that souls can evolve and change. A bad character may be good in another life. Apparently the same setting is transformed into different uses for the different arcs, hence they are familiar yet different. I enjoyed the six mini stories.

","I have watched this movie for over 5 times and have written down and recited its classical lines. Also, it is the only movie that has been downloaded on my computer. <br/><br/>It is really a comprehensive and exhaustive epic filled with stories about homosexuality, high-tech future, current problems and faithful belief. I really appreciate the love between Frobisher and Sixsmith, lament their separation and lost at last and relish the marvelous music. I really admire the courage of Canvendish to run out of the ""hotel"" his brother has sent him into. Above all, I like the story between Sonmi and Hae-Joo best: the transition of the feelings and mentality of Sonmi from ignorance of the outside world as well as her inner heart to the realization of love, hatred and humanity and their firm and faithful belief are all factors that make me engaged and enchanted. <br/><br/>However, if what I said above were all about Cloud Atlas, the film could only be ranked as mediocre according to the most common standard. Indeed, what makes this film outstanding and distinctive is its skillful arrangements of stories and excellent transition. If, say, the six stories in the film were to be extended to six movies, all the brilliance of this movie would vanish. That's it, because of the plot, all six stories seem full in background, information and implication, all six stories seem to be connected by force beyond human control, a ""fact"" gives audience infinite reflection of deems of good and bad, deems in the untouchable past and the unpredictable future and deems acted out of humanity. And above all, all six stories seem to be more convoluted which confused few film goers at that time, and which gives them something to chew after the film, something to discuss with counterparts and something to recall before sleep, and all these reflections motivate them to watch the movie again or search the Internet for more information to gain insights of the underlying and deep meanings of this movie. <br/><br/>And something interesting, I have spent great many of time discerning and figuring out what characters do each actors cast. It was a really grueling but interesting task for me!"

","This movie was recommended to me by a friend, and suffice to say I'm glad I watched it. Some may find such nonlinear films hard to follow or overly complicated, but I think this movie watched properly sends a powerful humanistic message. What we do does affect others. It is our duty as responsible humans to improve the world with our kindness, and not detract from it with our sins. Our actions may in fact be drops of water, but collectively they build oceans. From a technical standpoint, the acting was above average, the fight choreography excellent, and the score stellar. My least favorite parts of the story were the butchered speech of the post- apocalyptic humans, the unnecessary revenge taken by ole grampy, and the touching suicide of the bisexual Frobisher (whom I strongly related to), though I comprehend that the effect was powerful and why it was used. I haven't read the book, so I can't speak for how well the movie executed it, but the story the movie tells is superb. It is not one of the best films of all time: not up there with Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Shawshank. But it is a top-tier movie and a compelling story."

","I came to this movie having never read the book, I decided to watch it due to its stellar cast and intriguing premise and for almost 3 hours I was thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>The film attempts to fit 6 vastly different but intertwined stories spanning at least 500 years, past, present and future. The stories are each told through the perspective of a single character, and the narrative flits between them with only 3-10 minutes at a time being on one story. Surprisingly, although initially deliberately so, the stories are not at all confusing if you are paying attention, and there is something very special about the mix of genres and watching an actor play 6 different roles in the space of 15 minutes. Each of the main actors/actresses has a different yet similar role in several if not all of the stories, for instance Hugo Weaving plays the antagonist in several stories. In one he is in his classic role as effectively agent smith from the matrix, in another he puts on make-up/a mask to play a Korean interrogator/ archivist, and in another he is in drag and plays an overly strict nurse at a retirement home. <br/><br/>This brings me to my first qualm, the make-up.masks that the actors wear to play their different roles is not always perfect, and this gives the actors a strange look as if their eyes are sunk deep(er) inside their heads along with some other issues. Apart from this single issue the rest of the film looks terrific and the score is particularly strong.<br/><br/>The actors/actresses are all terrific, most notably Hanks and Whishaw, and the film kept me interested throughout despite its run time. My second, final and largest problem with the film is a direct result of its premise. The fact that each story on average gets less than half and hour of screen time leaves me less emotionally connected to the characters, and therefore the finale scenes and payoff were not the same as in a regular film. Thankfully I feel I was able to appreciate the film as something much larger. It may attempt to achieve too much, but to me at least, it achieves all it can 8/10"

","Engaging in every sense of the word and on all spectrums - intellectually, emotionally, visually and imaginatively. Cloud Atlas is so thematically dense that it is surely an enigma that will and should be debated about for the foreseeable future. <br/><br/>From a technical front, the original score is surely one of the greatest and finest compositions created solely for a film in the last 10 years, intrinsic to the film yet sweeping with awe-inducing grandeur - the re-envisioning of which only adds to the thematic accessibility and complexity of this epic tone poem of a film. The cinematography is stunning, saturated, and kinetic; distinct to each of the 6 sections without the shifts being jarring. The production design and costumes are intricate and lavish despite the need for each of the 6 different time-lines required their own different style.<br/><br/>But it is not without fault, the tone shifts don't always work, the acting swings from Donna Bae incredible to Halle Berry poor, and the much talked about makeup is an odd hit-and-miss process. <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is likely a contender for the most divisive film since at least Moulin Rouge, also a barmy but dazzling experience, but not equal in my view - you simply have to be on for the ride or not, there is no in between. <br/><br/>With all this said, it is still a great film, one of the best of the last 10 years even only for its sheer ambition, accessibility and thematic power; not to mention the visionary and surreal narrative techniques expanding the possibilities of cinema, or at least what is accepted (or not accepted) in cinema. <br/><br/>To not be bowled over by this film you must be a cynic (or just a critic)."

","Just the concept of six story's set in six time periods and Tom Hanks playing a total of six roles and all connected in several ways is amazing. The fact that they pulled it off is amazing. All six stories are interesting, some more than others, and you keep looking for the small or big connections through out the movie. They never make clear connections between the stories but this leads much to your own imagination. <br/><br/>This movie does much right. The casting is great and using the same actor for several characters in the different time periods are done so well that you don't care when you notice it. The plot is great and I noticed no plot holes. The movie is beautiful too and I found Seoul in year 2114 absolutely fantastic. mood, twists and jokes were made really well throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>So what does this movie not deserve a 10/10 from me? The characters weren't as good as I wanted them to be. There were so many characters that I can't recall their names and most of them lack depth. This is the only thing that bothered me in the movie. Overall Cloud atlas is a great movie that you should see. The complex story might put off some people but personally I loved it."

","Written about, praised, reviled, even censored but never ignored, I finally got the chance to watch Cloud Atlas (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt1371111/combined) on a small big screen tonight (Sadly, but as is typical in at least 1 of the 3 IMAX screens present, this did not have it's IMAX release in my town - Those who can watch it on IMAX uncut, I sure consider you more fortunate).<br/><br/>The audience with me responded very much like how they did to the profundity inherent (but never as obvious) in 'Cogan's trade'/'Killing them softly' by walking out, texting/talking throughout, feeling entitled to do that just 'cause they paid the price of admission (but that's a wasted rant for another day).<br/><br/>In spite of such nincompoops, this/ese tale(s) of inter-connected plots found philosophical coherence with me, based on the atypical use of narratives in certain sequences (voice-overs/perceptive views, juxtaposed against multiple tales, though they form the exposition for one). Most of the time, it works, esp. when the (amazing) soundtrack makes it's presence felt, or when the visuals are so sumptuous that they almost detract from the plot(s).<br/><br/>Hanks (though miscast in certain roles), Berry, Grant get a fresh lease of life playing a role each in all the tales, and they dig deep to find their characters, since the average runtime for each, never mind the inter-cutting among them, is about half hour. Hugo Weaving is given nothing new, but is serviceable, as are Broadbent and Sarandon. Whishaw and Doona Bae stand out, and Sturgess complements that age group as well.<br/><br/>As far as cinematic references go, I sure was reminded (in nice ways) of Blade runner (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt0083658/combined), Zodiac (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt0443706/combined) and the Red riding trilogy (more the latter actually - http://www.imdb.com/find? q=red+riding%3A+in+the+year+of+our+lord&s=all), One flew over the cuckoo's nest (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/combined), Amistad (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/combined), Waterworld (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114898/combined), The postman (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119925/combined) and The 5th element (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/combined). Those memories did take me out of the movie while they lasted, but I guess that cannot be helped.<br/><br/>Tom Tykwer (Lola Rennt/Run Lola Run, The international, Perfume..) co-directed with the Wachowskis (Matrices , Bound, Speed Racer..) and have not had good press for a long time, but I somehow think that they have probably outdone everything they did in the past with this one. Bringing it together and shepherding such an endeavor to fruition seemed to me a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and finding independent financing, along with good casting, vfx and production design could not have been easy.<br/><br/>Love it/hate it - do watch it (on the big screen)...and oh, ignore the birthmarks."

","Those who love David Mitchell's book would have sworn there is no way of doing his utterly complex narrative justice in a film. But when I watched Cloud Atlas' screen adaptation by Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis, I felt hooked instantly and deeply in love with its amazing powers of narrative only paired by its visual playfulness. The film represents the book's spirit in a truthful manner and yet, it is completely different. Maybe that's the secret why it actually is a valid adaptation of Mitchell's insuperable sixfold novel within a novel. The delightfully inquisitive minds of Andy and Lana Wachowski - both notorious visual perfectionists, combined with Tykwer's acknowledged sensibility and great visual talent (remember 'The Perfume'!) have given birth to a motion picture that will still be a cinema classic and venerated, when most much talked-about blockbusters are rotting and forgotten.<br/><br/>The initially dizzying game of multiple role-playing by the same actors turns out to be an act of complete genius once one had the time to get their head around it. To represent the vague idea of transmigration of souls by having the same actors playing the respective roles turns out to be such a clever and effective mean of story-telling, that one has to lift their hat: for the stroke of genius to do this and for the incredible performance each of the main actors delivers in their multiple roles. At this point I would like to commend the awe-inspiring work of those makeup artists working at Cloud Atlas. If anyone, they'd deserve all imaginable awards for their ingenious work of magic.<br/><br/>But back to the film itself: One major difference one notices between film and book is the completely different structure of the story. While the book uses an arch where the story evolves from the oldest chapter to the most advanced into the future and then retrieves its steps in opposite order, the film uses the chance of film editing to combine the six different time periods of the story into a vertiginous cross-looping between each and all of them. This allows the directors to emphasise on the inner relations between characters of the different chapters and to make instant connections to similar aspects of human nature within this complex story. The dizzying order of those snippets of the six interlinked stories force the viewer to put additional attention while allowing them to glimpse moments where all those completely different characters of diverse time periods have similar pursuits and comparable struggles to endure.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a brave adaptation, offering beguiling imagery and a maddening array of interwoven stories. But the most endearing quality of it is and will be the profound message borne out of basic human conflicts: whether you are willing to stand up for human principles no matter the cost and pain to endure, or if you choose the short cut, the easy way, the one that paves humanity's road to ultimate self-extinction.<br/><br/>Finally, what remains after watching the movie is this yearning for more and deeper understanding, for spending more time with those humans on the screen, for savouring those moments when they finally receive some justice or transcend some deeper truth for an instant or more."

I have read about the book and will get round to reading it soon.<br/><br/>So I will say I watched this film and I believe I understood it without any knowledge of the book. <br/><br/>It is fair to say I did not love it the first time I watched it. It is long and has several stories that take place in different times and places, from the South Pacific to the distant future. The fact that the actors all take on various roles including men playing women and visa- versa as well as some strange accents, make it difficult to fully engage early on.<br/><br/>Yet it haunts- it got under my skin and into my thought process that I found myself thinking it all over as I lay in bed.<br/><br/>So the next morning I decided to watch it all over again!

"violetelise3","10","1","2","7 October 2013"," Wow. Did not think I would ever see a movie this amazing/brilliant/profound/perfect in my lifetime.
","First of all, I have to say all the actors in this film are absolutely amazing. But I must give credit to Jim Broadbent for his absolutely brilliant acting job in this movie. He was perfect as Timothy Cavendish and all the roles he played. Each role was very different. He immersed himself in the characters and I have never seen any actor this amazing in any movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, has anyone been to the movie theater the past 5 years or rented a DVD? 95% of the movies are unbelievably bad in so many different ways. One reason: unnecessary violence, unnecessary sex, unnecessary crude jokes, unnecessary meanness attempted to be portrayed in a flattering light. I could go on and on. And these crude things most directors include in their movies are completely Unnecessary to the plot and completely portrayed in unrealistic ways. <br/><br/>This is NOT the case with cloud atlas. Yes, there is violence. Yes there is sex and nudity. It is minimal compared to most R rated movies out there and the most important part is it all adds to the plot and even more importantly it is all portrayed in a realistic healthy way. People who are mean and cruel and evil are shown to be this way. They do not try to glorify the bad guys or glorify sex outside of love or objectify women. It is so refreshing!<br/><br/>Thirdly, I do not even think 95% of movies are worthy to even be compared with this one yet I will do one more comparison. What is the meaning in most of these movies that Hollywood is producing? I honestly do not know except to brainwash people or something. Cloud Atlas has a LOT of depth and meaning in addition to many comedic moments and absolutely touching moments and just profound moments. If this movie does not change your life I think you need to watch it again!<br/><br/>The only thing that I could understand people criticizing this movie for is the scene where Felix Finch gets thrown over the balcony at the party. Yes, it does seem cold how they portray it in a somewhat comedic manner but I think it is a reflection of the time period it represented, 2012, basically today, where people are very desensitized to violence like this. I think it was a commentary on our times. That is just my opinion.<br/><br/>And one of my favorite lines is by Robert Frobisher in a letter to Rufus Sixsmith. Please excuse my paraphrasing. I tried to remember accurately.<br/><br/>""I know now that boundaries between noise and sound are conventions. All boundaries are conventions, waiting to be transcended. One may transcend any boundary if only one can first conceive of doing so. Moments like these I feel your heart beating as closely as my own, and I know that separation is an illusion.""<br/><br/>What movie can compare to Cloud Atlas? I don't think there are any contenders. Thank you to the people who put together the movie, the author who wrote the book, and all the actors who starred in this movie. <br/><br/>Really brilliant and life changing. Thanks!"

","Make no mistake: This film flopped due to an ill-organised distribution and marketing strategy and not because of its quality. Cloud Atlas counts as one of the very few films which will surprise you for its originality and freshness. The many quirks and twists which brought a good amount of criticism, only add depth and character to the film in my view. The virtues here are many: great cast and performances with a Hugh grant, Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent at their best. Exquisite locations and special effects. Brilliant script and cinematography. A quirky and unexpected editing which is probably the most surprising and innovative features in the film. An absolutely brilliant score which holds the film together and adds a sense of sensualness and meaning beyond the plot itself.

","A truly seminal film. It is more ""educational"" than ""entertainment"" and has so much to offer anyone willing to learn more about how our lives are inter-twined throughout history.

It explores how love can transcend time, how our purpose is to fulfill our physical desire for love, but ultimately to experience love of the soul, the spirit. Many people the world over, are involved in searching within for the spiritual side of our existence. It is that, through love, forgiveness, and every other virtue, which we all need to use at some point in time, to eventually, ultimately, return to God. Believe that, or not, but this film explores the links which exist amongst us all, from beginning to end, from the past into the future, from hatred to love and forgiveness, from the ego to the spirit."

","I have to say that it is a kind of movie easily making people confused. It is true that even to the end there are still some guys can not figure out what is going on here. Do not laugh at them unless you are brave to say you never got a piece of confused during the whole three hours. I admit that I haven't got any idea about the whole development of the story until I went through the first and half hours. Maybe that's why it gets a not so impressive score here. At least a master piece should get most of the audiences touched.<br/><br/>For this beautiful picture, I am impressed by its small stories. I like stories in different ages, in other words, actually I love history to some extent. Especially when the plots continue in different eras and have some kind of relationship in between. Of course, that is one reason why I spent more than one hour to get clear on this movie.<br/><br/>I can hardly remember how many stories are there, but one thing I will not forget is that those actors and actresses are same in each one. I have to say what a brilliant way to save money, LOL. Also what a incredible skill of making up. Even some small roles I can't recognise by their appearances until I saw the casting list. That's amazing, isn't it? <br/><br/>Last thing I want to say is that something I learn from this movie, in other words the thought it wants to pass to audiences. Obviously, this one believes the other lives as well as people are changeable. I don't want to talk much about the religion things as it totally depends on individual and has nothing to debate. But the changeable person is an attitude of living, here I mean we should remember it and see others with a changing sight. So face changes bravely and live with changing every moment."

","If this film does one things it's show off what state-of-the-art make-up artistry can do: a select all-star cast plays a ton of different characters across six different timelines which are all interwoven and interconnected. The plot (and film) is meant to be epic -it does look it- but it doesn't feel like that to me. Somehow despite all the excellent VFX, make-up, acting and poetry-like dialogue it fails to connect emotionally. It is however commendable that they at least try to engage the audience with a more complex story than say robots and screaming teenagers, but the utter failure of this movie at the box office doesn't bode well for the more intellectual type of scifi entertainment -even if it doesn't fire on all cylinders like this one.

","This film's upholders rave about how brilliant and meaningful it is, while its detractors rant about how pretentious and nonsensical it is.<br/><br/>I can see both sides of the argument, but let me just say this. One has to have 3 solid hours and a great deal of patience to spare before watching CLOUD ATLAS. Anyone who has those two things and views this film fairly attentively should at least see that the plot-line DOES make sense. Not having read David Mitchell's original novel, I know I missed a few things on first view, and the beginning in particular was mind-blendingly confusing. We generally expect the opening of a story/film to ""hook"" us, establish the basic cast of characters and conflicts, and all that sort of stuff. This would be hard to accomplish in a work of this sort, which is a bit like THE MATRIX meets THE English PATIENT.<br/><br/>I stayed with CLOUD ATLAS, and though it wore me out, I was able to appreciate the whole story of domino effects spanning over centuries of human history: How acts of both kindness and malice trickle down, ripple out, and so forth. There's nothing ""brilliant"" or even particularly original about that, but I know of very few films that tie together so many settings in time and place this well.<br/><br/>CLOUD ATLAS may not seem like the sort of thing to see for easy entertainment, but I think the best advice comes from those who recommend just watching this film for ""the ride."" The cinematography, setting and costume design, and special effects are all quite amazing even by today's standards. You don't have to catch all the details to appreciate what's basically going on here, and new stuff will emerge with each re-view.<br/><br/>And if you don't like it, well, just turn it off."
"DFClayton","7","1","2","1 June 2013"," 6 degrees of WTF?
","Cloud Atlas is a film adaptation from a 2004 David Mitchell novel bearing the same name. This is a montage of six different stories, in six different timelines and how they're connected. The plot is complicated as there's constant shifting between these stories and their timelines. Such connections are maintained by: many trinkets; tattoos or birthmarks; music; references to a deity called Sonmi 451; love letters from an earlier timeline; etc. All are cleverly placed in what gamers call an ""Easter Egg"" rich environment. However, As far as I can tell, these clues are not intended to be easily discovered in a first viewing. Rather it seems more geared toward the dedicated fan that will see this multiple times as a cult classic. But I simply don't feel that same dedication although as a home viewer I did watch this movie twice. For me it's simply not the go to movie that I'll repeatedly watch like Bladerunner to discover new details or de-construct the SPX scenes. That's because Atlas doesn't give me the same payoff as my other favorites. However, as a viewer you get more out of it. My enjoyment was mostly in the visuals and the joy of seeing some my favorite actors as well as a couple of new faces perform. Since the film has no forced over the top dialogue or performances, the filmmakers provide a cringe free environment that allows me enough flexibility that I can enjoy the movie the way I want and for that I'm grateful. They gave me a choice of whether to torture myself with the details or simply sit back and relax. I chose the latter. There is however, a couple of glaring exceptions regarding visuals. The CGI is mostly excellent except during a chase scene which very much reminded me of the horribly modeled uni-motorcycle chase in the movie Lockout. The makeup effects are the biggest offender which is simultaneously impressive and disappointing. For the most part I could tell who was playing the various Characters. And for those I couldn't tell or miss-guessed, there's a visual summation in the credits to clear things up. And I was pleasantly surprised in a few instances. The makeup artists use their expertise to apply gender and race bending. Such as: Ben Whishaw who is 007's new Q branch director, as a very attractive older woman; Susan Sarandon as a bearded male college professor; Xun Zhou's interpretation of a male hotel bell hop; and Halle Berry as a black reporter, a white girl at a party, and a 1930's Jewish gal pal to an aging composer. She's beautiful in any shade. However, one conversion is only effective in one direction. That is, the Non-Asian to Asian conversions. These are: comical, awkward, and some can say even racist. This comes off as convincing to me as John Wayne playing Genghis Khan in The Conqueror and handled with the same delicacy as a Popeye cartoon's portrayal of Japanese during WWII. The prosthetics are embarrassingly bad and look uncomfortable for the actors to wear. Their foreheads looked as if they were encased in a totally inflexible plastic. On the other, the Asian to non-Asian transformations are entirely convincing and extremely attractive when applied to Xun Zhou who plays a blonde, long haired village girl and Doona Bae as a slightly freckle-faced red haired woman. To summarize, Cloud Atlas in spite of a few flaws is an enjoyable movie. It's just not destined as one of my favorites in Sci-Fi. And I will see the next project from these movie makers. They're the same people who gave us the Matrix movies which I thoroughly enjoyed. They're currently working on Jupiter Ascending which will also have Doona Bae who I'm very impressed with.<br/><br/>Special features: this is also a rich tapestry of detail as the filmmakers effectively explain all the reasoning, scheduling, and methods used in this project. Each actor participates thoroughly and enthusiastically in interviews to give us ""their take"" on the film. They effectively convey a true belief in the project other than just drawing another paycheck."

","Imagine watching a film that combines various story elements such as a political thriller, a sci-fi adventure or even a British sitcom? That is exactly what you get from Cloud Atlas, the Wachowski sibling's bold and daring fantasy epic which continues their trend of visually-driven films that they previously achieved with The Matrix trilogy (1999-2003) and Speed Racer (2008). While it failed to land any nominations at the recent Oscars, it has quietly gained momentum as an artistic masterpiece that explores the way that souls are connected throughout its several segments. An appealing cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant adds extra spice to this voyage of a film....<br/><br/>Split into six different plot-lines, the film focuses on how the actions of individuals affect one another in the past, present and future. In 1849, writer Adam Ewing (Sturgess) tries to protect a black slave who has secretly boarded his ship that is sailing around America. In 1930s England, homosexual music writer Robert Frobisher (Whishaw) agrees to work with veteran composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Broadbent) as he creates the Cloud Atlas theme. In 1970s America, journalist Luisa Reys (Berry) tries to expose corruption at a nuclear plantation only to be pursued by hit-man Bill Smoke (Weaving). In modern day England, publisher Timothy Cavendish (Broadbent) tries to sort out a massive debt only to be confined to an old people's home by his wealthy brother. In 2144 Seoul, fabricate clone Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) is rescued from her built-in environment by revolution fighter Hae-Joo Chang (Sturgess). Finally in the faraway future, tribesman Zachary (Hanks) reluctantly helps a modified human named Meronym (Berry) as she tries to track down an ancient building.<br/><br/>Audacious is one way to describe Cloud Atlas as the Wachowskis carefully work hard to make this 'unfilmable' production a reality by adapting it from David Mitchell's best-selling novel. It demands a lot of attention from its curious audiences as they spend the next three hours intrigued and fascinated by this lavish epic and while the story lines are all completely different, the directing trio (including Tom Tykwer) manage to combine and intertwine the plots together rather than playing off each story as an individual one. Fortunately the mood of each part changes throughout as it goes from dark and thrilling to subtle and at times hilarity (especially when it comes to the Cavendish scenes). A sense of 'freedom' also connects the segments and becomes a running theme as we begin to realise that these stories do have something in common e.g. Sonmi's legacy being worshipped by the tribe. But what also makes this film remarkable is the way it merges together a talented group of actors and has them taking on several roles that mostly rely on tons of costumes and prosthetics. It also pulls off the visual effects scenes spectacularly well with the stunning futuristic Seoul sequences baring resemblance to the sci-fi world of Blade Runner (1982). On occasions, the makeup is completely inspired as we barely recognise some of the big names like Halle Berry as the white relative of Vyvyan in the 1930s or Hugh Grant as a sadistic warrior in the final story. While the film stands out as a rich and artistic triumph, the exceptional cast manage to contribute effectively in their multiple roles. Tom Hanks has a lot of fun as his different characters range from a corrupted doctor and a volatile Irishman to a heroic tribesman. Fellow Oscar-winner Berry reclaims some acting versatility from her Monsters Ball days courtesy of her different portrayals including the determined journalist from the 70s segment. Young British actors Jim Sturgess and Ben Whishaw continue to impress with their story arcs while Hugh Grant goes-against-type to play some creepy and sadistic villains who make us detest them whatever story they are in. However the two best performances come from British character actor Jim Broadbent and Asian actress Doona Bae. The former brings humour and weariness to his character Cavendish who is initially portrayed as a buffoon but manages to make us root for him as he finds himself in the awkward setting of an old people's home. Bae on the other hand is immaculate as the fabricate who begins to realise what her life has become and ultimately makes the gradual decision to try and inspire a revolution.<br/><br/>However the problem with a film of this magnitude is that it isn't easy to sit through. Some audiences may find watching the non-linear narratives a struggle to work out especially as you wonder about what exactly links them all (it's best to rely on IMDb for that!). Paying attention to that many story lines definitely requires a lot of patience and understanding even from the most intelligent film fans! While the makeup has its inspired moments, it can also be somewhat laughable and even racist at times particularly when the focus is on the Seoul segment. One can't help but feel sorry for Asian star Doona Bae as she finds herself sharing scenes with non-Asian actors covered in prosthetics who clearly look like they have just stumbled off the set of a Charlie Chan film. But it is poor Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from The Matrix) who finds himself looking silliest of all not just in that story but also when he is in full-drag to portray the Nurse Ratched-type carer from the Cavendish scenes and his later appearance as a creepy and unnecessary demon from the final segment.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's latest offering is confidently acted, looks majestic to watch and has the potential to be a genre-breaking classic but is flawed by its complicated narrative and (at times) ridiculous makeup. It may take a few re watches to appreciate this one better!"

","I'm a plot man myself. You know, A story, B story. even C story, but this film tried to have A - Z stories, which in my mind didn't quite work. Like a fabric, often a film layers multiple yarns to reach a stitched cloth. On first viewing, discounting the extraordinary poly-charactered performances, this cloth did not sew the pieces together enough for me, to make it a yarn worth spinning.<br/><br/>There are brilliantly disparate performances by this ensemble, notably from Doona Bae, whose androgenous sexuality is hard to dismiss (50 shades of Lena Wachowski?). Wonderful make-up, scenery and CG components that are capturing, but this film for me lacked an arc; and that may be because this film has no central heart.<br/><br/>We are asked by the film makers to suspend disbelief, without serious character analysis and journey.<br/><br/>We are instead asked to suspend a story arc in favour of a possible link in lineage, time and face. Face, because while we see the same characters play such disentangled roles, there's not a lot of structure to link one character, plot or emotion to another.<br/><br/>So what am I to think? I sure do need to watch this film again - to which I might write a completely different critique, but on first viewing this is, as was the Matrix 2 & 3, far too high a hurdle to jump, and far too wide a chasm of story for me to hold this film up as archetypal or game changing.<br/><br/>I fear I just want to say wtf?<br/><br/>I shall watch it again, and leave you to disseminate a film far in scope but potentially short in answers."
"eatfirst","6","1","2","26 February 2013"," A Magnificent folly of a movie
","Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis' ambitious joint-undertaking to bring to the screen David Mitchell's multi-stranded, epoch-straddling tale, has produced a striking but unwieldy behemoth of a movie. Long on invention, melodrama and scale... Perhaps shorter on discipline and a clear through-line of narrative purpose.<br/><br/>Pulling apart the symmetrical structure of the source novel and re- integrating its six story lines in a complex but still clearly delineated collage of characters and events is one of the project's more successful elements. There is a singularity of vision at work here that belies the portmanteau directorial approach, with the Wachowskis surprisingly tackling the quietly mannered tale of a 19th century sea voyage alongside the more obvious home turf of the two future-set sci-fi sections. Meanwhile the more art-house predisposed Tom Tykwer makes a solid stab at a dirty '70s thriller as well as the more restrained tones of his delicate inter-war period love story.<br/><br/>The film's major talking point has been the many multi-role performances by nearly all the principle cast. It is at once one of its strongest, and yet most flawed features. Let's get one non-issue out of the way: The minor controversy stirred up around a predominantly white cast playing other races is entirely bogus. There is a clear, one might even say vital, thematic purpose (even if narratively a tad obscure) to this decision, and it should also be noted that this is equal opportunities trans-ethnicity, with Black playing Asian and Asian playing Caucasian in the mix, before we even get started on the gender and age switching. It's a logical and often entertaining device that ties the disparate threads together. However, it is also highly distracting. Some of the more extreme make-over's are frankly just not very good. Fake, stiff and sometimes am-dram silly. Surprisingly poorly executed for a film with a substantial budget and directors experienced in period work and fantasy. This, coupled with some very shoddy accents results in the viewer frequently being pulled out of the drama for a few minutes of ""oh its him again, you know, what's-his-face from that other chapter"". Hugo Weaving gets a particularly short stick, bouncing from pantomime Nurse Ratched, via Mr Spock eyebrows to a painted, top-hatted shamanistic apparition that will incite guffaws of disbelief from anyone familiar with The Mighty Boosh. Possibly the first time in history that a film has sequelled its own spoof.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly then the most affecting segments are those that allow the actors to work largely free of such novelty. Halle Berry's intrepid San Francisco reporter, Doona Bae's tragic future-world slave replicant, and perhaps most touching and subtly played, the distant, clandestine affair of a young composer and his physicist lover provide the movie with at least some of the emotional centre of gravity it needs to hold the wilder elements in place.<br/><br/>The joy and frustration of Cloud Atlas is that when it is good, such as in those segments above, it has to abandon the threads too swiftly, leaving you craving to be immersed more in those characters and stories. When it is bad, (Tom Hanks' geyserish gangster and buck-toothed surgeon, Post apocalyptic Mad Max juju speak, Last Of The Summer Wine antics in a Scottish bar), it just leaves one bewildered at the point of it all.<br/><br/>In spite of all this. There is something both endearing and admirable about the scale, bravery and vaulting ambition of Cloud Atlas. It's as entertaining as it is awkward, and as breathtaking as it is daft. <br/><br/>A Magnificent folly."

","What you might feel after watching thiz movie? You may be confused, you may be disappointed or if you watch closely enough, you may find a hidden philosophy inside. Thiz movie has six stories with six different time periods, from little island in South Pacific to the post-apocalyptic Hawaiian Islands, from the primitive year 1849 to far in the future 2321. The stories come from any direction and finally meet at one point. The story is meant to be connected to one another, however, don't be surprised if you eventually find that the connection is very minor. In point of fact, you may miss the connection if you're not careful. ""Cloud Atlas"" is the latest project from Tom Tykwer and The Wachowskis, starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Ben Winshaw, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, Doona Bae and Xun Zhou. All Actors have more than one role during different time periods. As a matter of fact, some Actors are so buried underneath their makeup that we could hardly recognize them. To make things even worse, some of them are seemingly drawn into comical performances such as Hugo Weaving, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. The better performances come from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Ben Winshaw. And the scene stealer is definitely Doona Bae who depicts a genetically-engineered clone named Sonmi-451. Doona Bae delivers a complex and inspiring character. On the directorial side, Tom Tykwer carries out 1936's, 1973's and 2012's segment. On the other side, Andi and Lana (used to be Larry) Wachowski handle 1849's, 2144's and 2321's segment. Personally, I prefer Wachowskis' direction. They can keep up the pace of their stories and prevent it from being boring. It reminds us of how good The Wachowskis really are when depicting futuristic tales, just like what they did in ""The Matrix"" (1999). On the other hand, even though I love the previous Tom Tykwer's works such as ""Run Lola Run"" (1998), but thiz time, he seems to have put anything one-dimensional. In other words, Tom Tykwer's direction is boring. If it's not because of the intriguing futuristic tale of Sonmi-451 which is directed by The Wachowskis, thiz movie will undoubtedly become an unnecessary B-Class movie. In the end, thiz is something bigger than you think. It's all about a belief in the universality of mankind. Basically, there is no difference between countries, races and even genders, where white can become black, black can become white and white can become Asian. We are all one, we are all the same, learning and strive for a better condition.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","The Wachowskis have once again come out with a mystical masterpiece, co-written and co-directed by Tom Tykwer. Cloud Atlas interweaves several stories set in different times and locations, but which turn out to be linked. It is a breathtaking experience to watch what starts out as unrelated narratives being introduced one after the other, and their respective plots then taking turns being unveiled layer by layer. This device has been employed on film before, but Cloud Atlas' intricate editing really takes the cake. Adding to the fun are the actors playing very diverse characters in the different stories. The movie is a visual delight and despite its three-hour running time, one feels the length is justified."

I find it incredible that, at no point during filming or editing, nobody said ""Hey, this is kinda shitty. Maybe we should fix that.""<br/><br/>The film jumps between no less than six unrelated 'stories' constantly and without reason. There is no main character, no true story arc or serious progression. Nobody can get invested in these characters because they have no soul. It's kinda like the Phantom Menace: you want to like it, but you can't. It's just terrible."

","There were more jumps in Cloud Atlas than in a March Madness season, more cuts per minute than inside a Great Clips hair salon – on a busy day and more story lines than in the Bible. What a feat!<br/><br/>Too bad, it far-too-closely resembled the terrible movie-within-the-movie in Gentlemen Broncos. Actually, I would rather watch the fictional film within Gentlemen Broncos than Cloud Atlas again.<br/><br/>It's obvious this is a LOVE-it or HATE-it kind of film, and if only judged by the Oscar snub and America's Box Office receipts for this, I'm not alone in the HATE-it category. But, to be honest and fair, neither when the Academy completely misses a film or when a movie receives low Box Office numbers, it does not equate bad quality for I've seen plenty of fantastic films that basically made nothing and were rejected on award night. So, without using those to measure quality, I'll let this movie speak for itself on how bad it was.<br/><br/>The movie truly had terrible, uninspired and unoriginal dialogue and narrative. Further, the costumes and makeup seemed like they were from a first-year film student that didn't drop out but was kicked out. (I must've laughed out loud a few times with Tom Hanks' multiple of characters and horrendous outfits and makeup.) And while I would normally admire its ambitious drive to cram what could have been a six-part series of films in just shy of three hours, the choppiness of too-many story lines made it feel like the book it's based on had roughly 1,500 chapters, all of which began and ended in under three sentences.<br/><br/>Since I won't be seeing this again, I would just have to guess on how many abrupt transitions there were in between the story lines and timeframes. Probably, the same as my estimate number of chapters of the original manuscript. Again, I would normally rate a film higher that went outside the box and leapt all over the place with the different plots, all in a strobe light rapid pace. But, that feeling of admiration pretty much left me 30 minutes in when it all started to give me a headache. Sadly, as the movie speedily progressed, so did the number of sudden edits and transitions.<br/><br/>I guess the positive part of all the cramming they did in this, is that it gives me more hope for a Kiefer Sutherland 24 movie. It appears it's possible to condense 24 hours of footage down to about three hours.<br/><br/>As for the synopsis, that would be a tough one. And I just watched this film. Well, let's see, there's about 6-7 story lines, many, but not all, star the same actors in different gear and in many different time periods. Supposedly, all are supposed to connect and show a trend/bloodline from the 1800s to the, I don't know, 2500s. And that might be an accurate conclusion to the plot(s), but I either lost interest or was too bored. Even despite the rapid fluctuations of story lines, I found myself thinking of other things I could rather be doing during these three treacherous hours.<br/><br/>I got what I needed to out of it. I understood where each was headed – oh, and that's another thing, none of these 6-7 stories had any remote amount of surprise or originality – so, it was easy to let my mind wander.<br/><br/>When I did pay close attention, and when I thought: ""Hey, I might actually like this, finally,"" they shifted gears once again to more ridiculous and embarrassing characters, flat and completely humorless ""comedy"" and the CGI was so bad, the landscaping so insipid, it made 2008's Speed Racer seem more, well, normal. I'm aware who directed/wrote this so it shouldn't be a surprise that Agent Smith pops up quite a bit or that one, sorta main character (meaning, no one really is a ""main character"" when there's just about as many characters are there were extras in Braveheart) completely and unintentionally hilariously mimics Neo: Jim Sturgess's Hae-Joo Chang.<br/><br/>All in all, I might have to rethink my low rating I gave to The Tree of Life. While that was just as trite as this mess, at least the movie moved beautifully through some good cinematography and score. It was just as long and boring, but at least I had pretty scenery to move me.<br/><br/>SKIT IT. Duh."

Hollywood throws its support behind socialism and things such as the occupy movement, saying the wealthy have to pay more, but then turn around and film in Canada and other places to avoid high tax rates. Alec Baldwin firmly supported the socialist views of Occupy, yet still made millions of dollars for a credit company commercial.<br/><br/>And for the socialist collectivists out there that will love this movies let me ask you this, Do you think the 7 million Ukrainians that were murdered and starved to death in the year 1932 alone while Soviet Union increased it's grain exports would say anti-capitalist collectivism was a great idea?

","Three 'visionary' directors? Was that ever going to work? It sounds like a committee to me, and the result shows it.<br/><br/>I would have loved for this movie to have worked – there are good ideas in there – but it is over written, over CGI'd, overly complicated, and overly self-conscious. After more than two and a half hours, I couldn't wait for it to end, and it did about three times, but it just seemed to keep on going.<br/><br/>Early in the movie, Jim Broadbent as Timothy Cavendish, telegraphs the techniques used in the movie when he says, ""my extensive experience as an editor has led me to a disdain for flashbacks and flashforwards, and all such tricksy gimmicks"". This draws attention to the internal workings of the movie, which is indeed full of flashbacks, flashforwards, and many tricksy gimmicks. In my opinion, this breaks the fourth wall; when you ask your audience to buy into the pretence of movies, exposing the pretence undermines the contract of involvement with the viewer – it was a warning sign for me.<br/><br/>The film features a number of stories from the past, present and future. The scenarios range from a 19th century sea voyage, a futuristic, post apocalyptic society living in Hawaii, and the story of a Korean android who rebels against her masters. <br/><br/>Other episodes range in tone from broad, not particularly funny comedy to intense drama, all showing how the actions of individual lives impact one another across time. This is hammered home with sledgehammer subtlety, mainly through narration – the film needed narration otherwise it would have been totally incoherent.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Halle Berry feature in a number of scenarios. Hanks' strength is in his dependable, everyman persona, although these qualities are evident in some scenes, in others his performance seems more like a caricature. Halle Berry brings her magnetic screen presence to her roles, but she is asked to do some ridiculous things.<br/><br/>Most challenging for me are the sequences featuring Doona Bae as Sonmi-451, the South Korean android. These are interminable and often end in gun battles seemingly inspired by the mindless repetition of video games. We now have a generation of directors that have grown up in the video game era; unfortunately, this has begun to inform some of their work. <br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" probably would have worked better with some tougher decision-making and judicious editing. ""Mr Nobody"", made in 2009, covers similar territory. The difference is that ""Mr Nobody"" is the work of one visionary director, Jaco Van Dormael, and is an intriguing film full of charm, subtlety and a genuine sense of mystery. ""Mr Nobody"" is a masterpiece while ""Cloud Atlas"" is a mess.<br/><br/>One oppressive thought is that one day there will be a director's cut of ""Cloud Atlas"" that will even be longer – that's if they actually cut anything out the first time around. Although some sequences work better than others, I am not a fan of ""Cloud Atlas"". For this film to be rated too highly would lower the standard of what I think a great film should be."

","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>"" I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together."" - I Am a Walrus by the Beatles <br/><br/>Based on David Mitchell's popular novel, Cloud Atlas was given the full big budget Hollywood treatment. With a production team that creates many eye-popping visuals and its all-cast international cast ( Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, and Susan Sarandon are joined by Donna Bae, Keith David, Ben Whitshaw, Jim Sturgess, and James D'Arcy. ), the film seems to have high hopes and an even high pedigree. Directed and written by Tom Tykwer ( Run Lola Run ) and the Matrix Trilogy creators, Andy and Lana Wachowski, Cloud Atlas is a intriguing mystical journey, a messy but noble effort that is worth viewing. <br/><br/>Six stories become one in this sci-fi fantasy epic. The ambitious filmmakers tackle a difficult book that interweaves its varied tales with time-tripping details and enough style to disguise the black hole of a script whose characters, plots, and decades collide on a phantasmagoric journey about destiny, fate, and the question of our own existence in the vast cosmos called life. All those heady topics ( good versus evil, life after death, reincarnation, karma, and existentialism ) are explored and regurgitated ad nauseam. It's heavy thinking, dude, with a heavier sleight of hand at work. No wonder the film is nearly three hours long.<br/><br/>Visually, Cloud Atlas is a stunner, a thrilling spectacle filled with some wonderful action sequences. But for the most part, its screenplay remains inert, never building to a satisfying emotional or intellectual finish. ( I have to confess that I did unintentionally laugh a bit in the apocalyptic portion of the film where the ludicrous dialog with its rhythmic inflections kept reminding me of Barbara Billingsley's jive talk from Airplane. Sorry, but it really did! ) The stories try to unite the unending theme of oneness and our inability to control our own outcomes as the film takes on metaphysical proportions with the numerous characters involved, their wardrobe changes, and their specific situations. <br/><br/>We time-travel through different eras with decidedly mixed results: a slave ship adventure in the late 1800's, a 1930's love story involving two composers, an 70's China Syndrome action thriller about corruption and power, a present-day comic tale of revenge, a futuristic Blade Runner influenced parable set in Korea, and an end of the world precautionary tale that seemed to reuse the macramé wardrobe from Waterworld. This anthology structure of individual sub-plots that co-mingle with past, present, and future events may have intrigued the reader of the written page, but this film adaptation becomes a bit pretentious and labored with much dependent upon the moviegoer's level of believability and personal interest. Due to that factor, some of the time passages are more effective than others. ( Personally, the story lines that were 20th century bound resonated with me while the post millennium story lines were boring and bland. )<br/><br/>The directors may have saved some costs with their actors playing multiple roles in various ethnicities, genders, and races, but the overall effect in the execution suffers from that decision. While the majority of the make-up tricks are remarkable, other attempts fell short, particularly with Grant's old man disguise, Weaving's female Nurse Ratchet character transformation, and some of Sturgess' and Weaving's caked-on Asian make-up. ( In fact, most of the make-up for the Caucasian-turned-Korean roles were glaring missteps. ) This artistic choice weakened the film's impact as one continually guesses the true identity of the actor beneath the make-up instead of being drawn totally into the film's dense narrative. Another flaw is the choppy non-linear editing from one story to the next, a device which continually inter-cuts the action and tension of that individual segment.<br/><br/>Filmmakers Tykwer and the Wachowskis may have had their heads in the clouds while trying to rein in this demanding novel to align with their creative visions, but, at least, their vivid imaginations allow others to see the book come to life. Cloud Atlas is an unique movie-going experience, a visual treat that entertains in bombastic ways. Unfortunately, its plot structure and words ultimately undermine the film's strong imagery. <br/><br/>Although the thematic element of our oneness with the universe is a sound concept, the film seems to struggle to keep its patchwork stories cohesively together. To sum up my feelings about Cloud Atlas, it is best to quote the Beatles yet again: "" The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away...Goo goo g'joob. "" GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com <br/><br/>NOTE: Does anyone remember a little known 1960's whodunit called The List of the Adrian Messenger, a mystery film directed by John Huston? The film's main gimmick, similar to Cloud Atlas, was its attempt to disguise its cast with various make-up applications. Behind the prosthetic layers were famous actors like Tony Curtis, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas. That too had its share of hits and misses."

","The Wachowski...um...siblings attempt to make the epic movie to end all epic movies. That's part of the problem. They're trying too hard to make this something epic and it winds up feeling like a pretentious bore of a film.<br/><br/>The film is divided into many different stories that each tie back together in ways that are supposed to be profound but fail to feel that way. The South Pacific 1846 and San Francisco 1973 parts are wholly uninteresting, uninvolving endeavors. Cures for insomnia for sure. UK 2012 has a few amusing moments courtesy of Jim Broadbent, easily the best actor in the film. So far ahead of the others it's shameful. Tom Hanks, as in the South Pacific sequence, is hidden away behind a putty nose makeup job. The makeup in this film is terrible and distracting. Don't even get me started on the white/yellow/whatever face.<br/><br/>Neo Seoul 2144 is mindnumbingly dull and serves to be the movie's preachiest part. The 1936 part is also message-heavy. Despite this, it's the film's second best story. Big Island 2321 is probably the film's most interesting story, although it takes awhile to figure out what the heck everyone is saying. It's like watching a foreign language movie without subtitles sometimes. This is also the area of the movie where Hanks overacts the least. The acting in this film is uneven at best, with the best acting coming from the Brits and the worst coming from the Americans, particularly Hanks.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's a preachy ""message movie,"" with all of its messages being delivered with the subtlety of a jackhammer. You can see them all coming a mile away. For a nearly three hour film, this is a death sentence. If you can't surprise your audience, you really shouldn't take up that much of their time. This is a chore of a movie to sit through, anchored by a simplistic worldview and a desire to be something much deeper and significant than it really is."

","This film I guess is a valid attempt at a great film like ""The Hours"" that just fails to hit the mark. Pretty vapid and bad, the metaphors the morals, the quotes, the philosophy's expressed the time sliced plot switching are all awful, the parables trite, if this is representative of the novel, I pity the novel to. This film seems to be a barometer of those who think they can identify a quality film, whereas really its just an idiot test. The themes are played too much Hollywood / Disney style similarly the stereotyped characters, the oppressed winning through, the cultural reversal, the playing upon other story's too greatly, soy-lent green anyone ? its all so very child like and ham-fisted. And not helped by the fact they have used the same actors for so many parts with only poor make up, to set the characters apart as different from the small range of the actors faces used, and it doesn't really work, nor is it convincing or even logical, and certainly if the intention was to make the cross time parallel character scenario pairings rub nose obvious, its awkward and unnecessary, European's trying to play Asian's, Asian's trying to play western belles and Mexicans etc it just comes off as awkward in fact I don't see how its any less racist than blacking up, you want to portray people of a certain race ? why not simply hire people to play such roles ? instead of using makeup and prosthetics to this extent , or was it a budgetary constraint ? yes one can quite clearly see how it would tickle an actors ego, to be in such a film as they get to attempt to demonstrate their range in the same film, but really its just jarring for the film and there is an effort to try to crudely and artificially stitch the time lines to each other in some ways cross time to end up with some many lives interacting metaphor etc, but some of the lines in this film are heinous and hackneyed, most of the scenario and character relationships you see coming before they're even on the screen practically. The fact this film is rated is so highly is an indictment, I find it hard to believe people cant see through this films general film flam. Its valid to attempt such films but when it fails, its seems more dis-ingenuous, then those films that are at least honest about limited intellect popcorn schlock. It also mildly wreaks to some extent vague populist propaganda of white European's and intolerance of any sort to anything as bad and other globally exported American cultural philosophies. Worst point it plays to a American multicultural audience with ponderous stereotypes, the pseudo Mexican Asian woman (again real bad makeup) who quips ""don't call me a wetback"" over the corpse of the evil white gunman who she has bludgeoned to death for shooting her Chihuahua dead, this is cheesy playing to the audience style humour. The philosophical lines such as : ""love could outlive death"" and ""it will never amount to more than a single drop in a limitless ocean"" which was sadly followed by - ""what is an ocean but a multitude of drops"" - I mean really really  if this kind of trite display of child philosophies that appeal to the masses then I guess my review is nought more than  let me see  which rubbish metaphor shall I pick?  A drop of intelligence in an ocean of ignorance?"
"paul2001sw-1","6","2","8","13 April 2013"," Lack of structure leads unnecessarily to banality
","I quite enjoyed aspects of 'Cloud Atlas'; but to be frank, I didn't understand it. After watching, I consulted Wikipedia, which outlines the plot of the book from which the film is derived; and then it kind of made sense. The central ideas here are based on the notion of reincarnation and recurrence; of each story being told in its successor; and (in the book only) an explicit formal structure whereby each tale is split into two halves, so that each higher level is bookended by its predecessor. This lavish movie (with no less than three directors) abandons this device in favour of telling all six stories simultaneously. With the same actors appearing in many of the segments, the result is somewhat incomprehensible, especially as many of the segments have fantasy settings (and when the viewer is uncertain of the constraints on reality, it's especially hard to tell when one such reality ends and another begins). The individual fragments aren't badly done, but it's very hard to get a clear sense of a bigger picture beyond the banal message of ""everything is connected"". I would now be interested to read the book; but the film itself is too messy and undisciplined to wholly accommodate such ambitious material."
"Christian_Dimartino","9","2","8","16 February 2013"," Finally, after many years, the Wachowski's and Tyker have done something else worth mentioning.
","How do you approach a movie like Cloud Atlas? It's big, it's got a big concept, a big cast, big thoughts. It's slightly overwhelming, and wildly ambitious I might add. Well, some reacted the way I did. Some said, ""Yes, it's pretty awesome, but what exactly just happened?"" But most just said,""What the hell just happened?""<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas has big name stars like Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, and Susan Surandon playing a three-hour game of dress up. When I put it that way it undermine's the movie's qualities, but I really don't mean to.<br/><br/>I say that because part of the enjoyment I got from this movie was trying to figure out who was who. In one story, Halle Berry plays an Asian man. In another, Hugo Weaving plays a mean nurse. Some are completely unrecognizable, and for that it is a bit of a crime that cloud Atlas received no technical nominations at the Oscars this year.<br/><br/>I honestly don't really know how to explain this thing. It's basically about souls and reincarnation told through six different stories all in different periods of time. The souls, as I gave an example of earlier, appear in different forms. The movie doesn't exactly say this, but it brushes on the concept a few times. One story is in a futuristic Japan, one is in 2012 England, one is in a post-apocalyptic world, one is in the 70's, one during WWII, and one during the 1800's.<br/><br/>The film has three directors, Andy and Lana(formerly Larry) Wachowski, who helmed The Matrix trilogy and the God awful Speed Racer, and the other is Tom Tyker, whose only other memorable movie is Run Lola Run. All three of them direct different segments, and damn it they do a fantastic job. The cinematography is dazzling, as are the visual effects. The story is unique and complicated and at times maddening, but fascinating. <br/><br/>Sure occasionally you might laugh because, well, Hugo Weaving is playing a woman. Come on, it's funny. The story did lose me from time to time and you really don't know where it's going until about two hours in. But you can't help but admire the effort and ambition put forth. Yes it's way too long but how to you trim it? I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like it, and I may never ever again.<br/><br/>Of the best movies of the year, this one is by far the most flawed. I'd rank it up there with Inception as one of the biggest, boldest movies of the upcoming decade. It is one of the best movies of the year. Screw the critics, they're idiots. Maybe, in another life, the world can learn to admire this movie. But that shouldn't be a problem for me.<br/><br/>A-"

And that's one of the worst things, because this movie was approximately two and a half hours in length, so it really took forever to end.

"howard.schumann","6","2","8","25 November 2012"," Shallow characters and cumbersome stories
","The idea of soul mates reincarnating together and interacting through time is explored in Cloud Atlas, a thought-provoking film directed by Tom Twkyer with Andy and Lana Wachowski. Based on the novel of the same name by David Mitchell, the title refers to a musical composition whose notes suggest the movement of clouds across the open skies. In the film version, six connecting stories are interwoven over a span of five centuries, with the same six characters playing different age, gender, and personality roles. Most stories involve a decision a character has to make as to whether to rebel against a powerful oppressor and risk their life, or submit to authority and accept the consequences.<br/><br/>The stories do not always unfold in a linear manner and there is often quick movement back and forth across time which may create an obstacle to some viewer's emotional investment. In the first episode set in 1849, Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess), a lawyer involved in the slave trade, has his life changed when he saves a Moriori man Autua (David Gyasi) from certain death at the hands of Maori's and European conquerors and allows him to become a stowaway aboard the ship. The native man in turn saves Ewing's life when he is poisoned by Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks). In the 1930's, English composer Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), in love with a Cambridge student, Rufus Sixmith (James D'Arcy), is working on a piece called the Cloud Atlas Sextet, when he becomes an assistant to a prominent Belgian composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent). Egotism and greed lead to unwanted consequences for both men.<br/><br/>In San Francisco in 1973, reporter Luisa Ray's (Halle Berry) life is endangered when she becomes involved with the cover-up of a flawed nuclear reactor being proposed by a powerful conglomerate. She must decide if she wants to proceed with the inquiry and risk her life to expose the corruption. In the film's simplest and most entertaining section taking place in present day London, publisher Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) in money trouble hides out at a hotel suggested to him by his brother. The hotel, however, turns out to be a nursing home run by a tyrannical Nurse Noakes (Hugo Weaving in drag) where he is kept prisoner and formulates a plot to escape with his elderly companions.<br/><br/>The film continues in 2144 in Korea, now named Neo Seoul. A clone, Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae), serving fast food for twelve years for the Papa Song corporation discovers her true identity aided by Hae-Joo Im and begins to question authority leading to a confrontation and an interrogation. In the final episode set at an unnamed date in the future after ""the Fall,"" Zachry (Tom Hanks) a member of a primitive community who speaks in a new language, must fight off a tribe with painted faces bent on destruction. He is asked for help by Meronym (Halle Berry), a member of a group known as the Prescients, so that she is able to communicate with survivors.<br/><br/>In all of these sections, Cloud Atlas strives to capture the middle ground between an artistic ""message film"" and a popular entertainment that has broad-based appeal. In straddling the fence, however, it does not truly succeed in either genre and the result has little life. While the film has strong ideas about freedom, love, reincarnation, and the inter-connectedness of all people and lets you know about them – often, its ideas, particularly those of reincarnation and karma, are never fully explored and the characters have no inner life. Didactic pronouncements about the way it is are buried beneath shallow characters and cumbersome stories saturated with excessive comic book violence, murders, suicides, betrayals, and enslavement, none of which fit into a film that explores how love endures throughout time.<br/><br/>The film is not, as Tom Hanks futuristic character put it, the ""true true"" but the ""true false,"" a film that means to be inspiring but isn't, one that has a spiritual theme but with more special effects and technical wizardry than real spiritual feeling. The truth is not simply a good idea that can be explained, it must be lived in. It is only in the mystery of life and the experience of not knowing that we become aware of the truth, however dimly. According to the Zen saying in Mumonkan 18, ""You do not define the truth - you simply enter into it."" Cloud Atlas talks about it but stands outside."
"DarthPaul85","6","2","8","11 November 2012"," Impressively ambitious, but noticeably flawed.
","How can so many stories be told in one movie and be connected across so many different landscapes? The answer: with great (and often noticeable) effort.<br/><br/>Positives: First and foremost, I was impressed by each actor's ability to portray similar or completely different characters; Tom Hanks and Jim Broadbent especially, they were the characters I liked the most. No weak performances as a whole.<br/><br/>The writers also did a good job making nearly all the main characters in the story distinct; many of them using archetypes that are satisfying to see on screen (though I guarantee you will root for some and be bored by others).<br/><br/>The visual and editing styles of the movie are an art form in and of themselves. It deserves to be commended how they blended a historical movie, a fantasy movie, a sci-fi, a comedy, and detective movie all in the same film. The transitions are expertly done- going from one world to another often feels natural or unnoticed- it undoubtedly took great planning and great work.<br/><br/>The Negative: I didn't like two of the stories told here: I'll just refer to one as the ""sci-fi"" story and the other as the ""fantasy."" My complaints: First, not enough exposition or character development. When the world you're telling your story in is weird and alien, you have to include a lot more information for the audience to suspend their disbelief. Or barring that, at least give us characters we love and can relate to. This is a fundamental rule of sci-fi movies and I'm surprised the Wachowski brothers messed it up here. Both of these worlds are given to us at face value, with little or no explanation of when/where they are or how they got to be. And the ""plots"" of these segments are the weakest and most clichéd in the movie- stuff we've seen done better in dozens of other sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>Second, both of these stories suffer greatly from a very forced ""new language"" element. It takes a lot of effort to understand what the characters are trying to say in these worlds- one of them uses a devolved English dialect (which I found cheap and inconsistent), and in the other people talk like over-articulate robots- like the architect scene in the matrix movies (remember how *great* that dialogue was?). This made it incredibly difficult to care about these characters- we can't understand them when they talk. Beyond that, their actions are all basic ""survival"" stuff, none of which reveals any unique character (though there was one very cool element used to show one of the character's inner turmoil, it was nonetheless a trick we've seen before and didn't add to what we know about him).<br/><br/>Third, and I hate to say this after only seeing the movie once, but I fail to see how these stories are interconnected in any meaningful way. Maybe that's just me, but I was expecting a very clear indication of how and why these stories interrelate. Nope. It's all vague and analogous. Also unclear- are we seeing the same character through different lifetimes or not? One viewing wasn't enough to convince me that Tom Hanks in story A was the same character he played in story B. It *could* be that way, (I'm sure the book makes it more clear), but like I said, I wasn't convinced.<br/><br/>Fourth- Odd attempts to change actor's races with make-up. I have no problem with an Englishman being married to an Asian woman in 1843, but trying to make her look white is at best a ""nice try"" and at worst offensive. I'd rather they leave the actors faces alone or just use different actors- it's an impressive display of make-up and effects, but it calls attention to itself and takes us out of the movie.<br/><br/>Fifth- what was the message of the movie? No, really, what was it? Was it the line from the trailer? Was it something about love surviving between lifetimes? Was it anti-government? Was it that evil will always exist? I just saw the movie, and I can't tell you what the point of it was. Some of the stories involve broad statements about the human condition, and others focus on the humor in modern life. And unfortunately, no message here is strong, clear, or unique. It's all vague new age philosophy with symbolic (rather than relatable) justification.<br/><br/>So in the end, this movie deserves credit for being a genre-blending prototype. A film that does successfully show 6 different stories in one movie- but unfortunately, the quality of those 6 varies greatly, and connections between the them are only loosely if not superficially available.<br/><br/>Maybe save this one for netflix with your intro to psychology class."

","David Mitchell's ""unadaptable"" 2004 novel featured 6 different storylines in 5 different centuries: a nightmare for any Hollywood producer. The unpredictable Wachowskis however have managed to create what is for me the greatest film of 2012 ( a statement people will fervently agree and disagree with in equal measure).<br/><br/>To start with, the cast is flawless. This may be Tom Hanks's greatest role to date, playing multiple disparate characters with ease, whilst Halle Berry and Jim Broadbent also excel. Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant round things out playing a host of villainous characters, which makes for great watching. Piecing together the connections that each actor's characters have to each other is a fun exercise, and it's fascinating to see how each soul changes over the centuries. The score, especially the stirring music of the finale, has endless replay value, whilst the costumes, makeup (often heavy to the point of obscuring some actors entirely), and set design are exquisitely done.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength however is the wealth of emotions it conveys throughout, through its six stories which share common themes but are so fundamentally different in style. From the hilarious Broadbent-led farce to the paranoid 70s-set thriller with Berry and the most Wachowski-esque story, a futuristic dystopian story where Doona Bae takes the lead, the intricately-crafted stories interweave and diverge with such speed that repeat viewings are a requirement. The edits can become formidable at times, especially at times when multiple stories are entering climactic moments, but as the film progresses it becomes increasingly apparent that each edit has been perfectly timed to coincide with similar themes in a concurrent story.<br/><br/>I was left feeling (in a good way) overwhelmed by the sheer size and complexity of the piece, and immediately wanted to see it all over again: this is pretty rare. Understandably, it will not be a lot of people's cup of tea, but if you're into expertly crafted philosophical eulogising on the state of humanity, then 'Cloud Atlas' is the film for you.<br/><br/>97/100"

I understand where the bad reviews come from, this is a long movie and it is quite complicated at times! But to give this movie only 1/10 is ridicoulous... visually this movie is stunning and it makes you actually think and speculate! 
I've watched this movie a few times now and every time I discover something new! A new detail that's just so interesting!
I recommend this movie to new people I meet all the time, and either they love it and are fascinated or they are confused by it!<br/><br/>Please give it a try!!"

"nogodnomasters","6","1","3","10 February 2018"," Truth is singular
","This is one film most people will love or won't watch the whole thing. The stories concern reincarnation of the soul (?) although it goes far beyond that. The same half dozen or so people in one life are connected in similar ways in different lives. And a person who gets a scar or mark in the future, will have that mark show up in the past as a birthmark. Clearly this film goes way beyond any simplistic idea of reincarnation and makes it into a cult doctrine.<br/><br/>There are 6 separate tales, although the film seems to concentrate on the two future stories. ""Souls"" are connected by generally having the same people play different parts, or by connecting them through aforesaid mark. The beginning of the film was confusing as it presents the ending of the various lives.<br/><br/>The lives of these people are not simple. They are filled with trauma, killing, and intrigue. Scenes are connected by showing people doing similar things in different life times such as passing through a door, i.e. the so called ""smart"" and ""clever"" aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Rather than asks questions about truth and free will, the movie gives you David Mitchell's answers, which you may or may not agree with. For those who believe in some universal bond that links lives past and present to the seemingly inane point that things that will happen in the future will effect the past, you should enjoy this film for a full 5 stars. For me the film was too artsy, telling stories in a disjointed fashion that lacked depth and meaning to my life.<br/><br/> There are things that are easily missed and will need multiple viewings to grasp.<br/><br/>If they really wanted to make their case, they should have named Tom Hanks ""Wilson"" as an island dweller.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","3","10 April 2016"," Too confusing for me
","This film tells the story of several individuals, who are in different points of the time and space continuum. Though they might be years apart from each other, their stories are not as different from each other as expected.<br/><br/>So ""Cloud Atlas"" is a literary wonder, but when translated to the screen, it seems to be very confusing. It tells many stories in many different time points, and they share some similarities but are not identical. An hour into the film, I thought it was about the universality of human experiences, and how karma affects past and future lives. Then I realised that it wasn't about these themes, then I got increasingly lost. The story of Tom Hanks and Halle Berry confuses me the most. Maybe I'll have to read the book first before watching the film."
"TheFilmGuy1","9","1","3","6 January 2015"," Ambitious And Incredible
","Cloud Atlas is one of the most ambitious films I have ever seen. 30 minutes into the almost 3 hour film, I began to think that perhaps it was too bloated and all over the place to actually achieve what it set out to do, but a few minutes after that 30 minute mark the film started to prove itself to me, up until the very end when I had been completely won over. <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is not one story, but 6 stories. What's even more interesting is that almost every actor in this film plays a different character in each storyline. Sometimes you don't even recognize them because of mass amounts of makeup and prosthetics, or sometimes they will play a tiny role in one storyline but a main role in another one. The story lines do not occur one after the other like an anthology film, but simultaneously. We bounce back and forth between them because they are all interconnected in a way. Why? Because the main themes of the film involve past lives and karma. It also looks at other themes, such as love. It's jam packed, even for a 3 hour film, but it most certainly pulls it all off.<br/><br/>I would say that I enjoyed every actors performance. Sure, some are a little cheesy at times, but a lot of that is actually played off as comedy. Tom Hanks is great. Jim Sturgess is wonderful. Halle Berry is terrific. As I said, everyone is great. There's also a lot of unique style to each individual story. Some are more action packed and dazzling in their visuals, such as the Neo Seoul story, where as some are more simply beautiful and touching, such as the story of two gay lovers separated in 1936, which is a story that touched me and I would have loved to have seen as a full length film. In fact, all of these stories could have worked on their own, but in a way they work even better all in one story. When you see just how one story connected with the other, it's really satisfying and often emotional. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this. It's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but it's so incredibly ambitious that it deserves to be seen. I really loved it and was taken by surprise just how well done it was."

","What do you want in a movie? Good story? Good acting performances? Good music? <br/><br/>Cloud Atlas offers all three of them. It are six stories, which all connect. It is amazing how these links are made between the stories. Next to that, all of these stories heave different genres, which means the film has a very broad audience. The performances of the actors are staggering! All the lead actors have multiple roles, which is absolutely amazing! All of them perform at their utmost! Last but not least, the music! The music is great. Music which is at the top of the best film music ever!<br/><br/>Overall, this film deserves far more credits, than it has received."
"xaniver","8","1","3","2 October 2014"," Excellent adaptation
","I absolutely adored the book by David Mitchell, but I had no idea how they would adapt a genre-bending, structurally challenging novel into a two hour or so film. The directors had a mammoth task and I'm delighted to say they got almost everything right.<br/><br/>I loved the film but two things marked this down from a 10.<br/><br/>1) If you haven't read the book or at least know something about the book, it's nonlinear storytelling and overarching themes then I think you will be lost as some things definitely were lost in adaptation.<br/><br/>2) Certain themes so subtly woven through the novel are turned into hammers and used to bash home the point into viewers. I would've preferred a more subtle take on some of the philosophy here. Even the trailer with that voice over gives away far too much of what makes this story so unique.<br/><br/>If you like your sci-fi epic and multi-layered then Cloud Atlas is a film you'll want to and even need to watch more than once. If you're into sci-fi for cool tech and explosions, then this movie probably isn't for you."
"DennisLaursen89","5","1","3","24 August 2014"," Lacks a culmination
","Cloud Atlas is actually 6 movies in one movie. The concept is to tie the stories criss-cross. The 6 stories is actually quite interesting, but I think that the ties are few and unimportant, and in some cases even non-existing. The 6 stories could almost without problems be split up into 6 separate short-films at 20-25 minutes each. I watch the entire film, looking for some kind of culmination, a climax, a conclusion. But the movie didn't gives any. All in all, 6 quite interesting stories. But they jump too much between them, to indicate some kind of bond, that, in my opinion, don't exist. You could watch the 6 stories separately, since it seems quite unimportant to show and bind them together. And you really never feel connected to any of the characters, because you never really get a change to know them. And when you feel you are about to know them, they jump to the next story."

Then watched the movie again and thought it was, well, if not better  at least doing justice to the book. I think I will enter an infinite loop here, worthy of some of the characters, and continue reading the book and then watching the movie. It is quite simply a masterpiece of cinematography  truly excellent. Watch this as one of those movies that could just change your life. Ignore the issues during the first ten minutes when you will NOT understand a word of Tom Hanks' babel  but stay the course and it will be worth every second. I am ranting now, but the sentiment it real  an amazing movie!"
"michael-burnard","10","1","3","29 March 2014"," Literally the best-made movie I have ever seen.
","Based on the book by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas follows the various stories of six different characters as they deal with their problems in different time periods. This is actually the best strength of the movie, as instead of telling a story on it's own, it intertwines them with each other to create a fully fleshed-out world. The main characters are, in order: an 18th century business man who makes friends with a black slave; a bisexual composer who becomes the assistant to a former maestro; a reporter who must foil a hit-man sent to kill her; an elderly publisher confined to a home; a Chinese worker-clone who is freed by a stranger; and a hunter in a post-apocalyptic world who must team up with a futuristic Halle Berry to save the human race. It must be said that the makeup in this movie is beyond amazing, with actors changing appearance or even race. The most amazing of them is Hugo Weaving, who plays an elderly business man, a dark-skinned slave driver, a young assassin, a female nursing home worker (yes, he plays a woman), an Asian government official, and my favourite, Tom Hanks' demonic imaginary friend. Overall, I highly recommend this movie. It's not my favourite movie, but throughout the whole thing, I felt an unrelenting sense of awe. And you might, too."
"Daphneheijmering","9","1","3","31 January 2014"," The message of this film needs to be fulfilled.
","It is an amazing film, great actors and those graphic effects are outstanding. But it also contains a lot of violence, shame. It is only making the film worse, bloody. Above all there is a message in this film, a BIG one and a good one too! We need to focus on that. It is perfectly writing in the story lines of each character, so for any beautiful and catchy sentences you need to watch this film (you won't be disappointed, believe me). Spoiler alert, from now on. The message is pretty clear but everyone can give it his or hers little twist. In my opinion there was a big message to our food production industry, biomass. When the son mi were departed, they were made into 'soap' to feed the new son mi a.k.a. humans. Like chickens, cows, pigs, and all other animals we're eating. To bad. I'm also a meat consumer, but if I had to kiln them with my own hands 'cause there was no supermarket I would not eat meat. I can't take an innocent life of something where it belongs to.<br/><br/>There are a lot of thoughts going through my mind after watching this film, but I am happy with it. It reminds me how we're supposed to live, not by killing others but instead: to love them.<br/><br/>Death. Life. Birth. Future. Present. Past. Love. Hope. Courage. - Cloud Atlas (Better know as life)."

","This movie was very unusual. The individual stories, of which there were 6, had very little of interest between them. Somehow, however, it managed to keep my interest for 3 hours with the smooth and rapid transitions, the wonderful visuals, and the excellent music. I even empathized with some of the characters, despite the simplicity and clichéd nature of their stories. <br/><br/>I think it a shame that the individual stories were not better crafted, although I understand that drawing from a book brings about limitations. The weaving was very well done, and if the stories being woven had been of high rather than middling quality, this could have been truly incredible.<br/><br/>As it stands, nothing about the components of this film are complex or new, but together I found it to be quite the spectacle."

This movie takes TOO long to come together. Maybe if I would of stayed till the end, I would of got it, but it was too boring for me. Romance that wasn't appearing, action that wasn't happening, story lines that weren't giving any indication where they were going and I was half way through the movie already....<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie, to boring and complicated and completely a mess.

"mdcgames","8","1","3","9 June 2013"," Extremely Worthwhile View
","Unfortunately, this movie's reputation has been enormously vandalized.<br/><br/>Simply put, there is absolutely no way you could watch this movie and give it anything less than four stars, and I'm being somewhat generous. People who give it a single star are simply contrarians who likely heard how ""life changing and awesome"" this movie was with the preconceived notion that they would be the prophet to prove everyone wrong and then watched the movie searching for any reason to be disappointed.<br/><br/>While it's true this movie probably doesn't deserve ten stars, and the opposite can be equally extreme, for some people this movie can definitely ""hit home"" for them.<br/><br/>I greatly value movies that either provoke ideas and thinking, are spiritually ""cleansing"", or simply revolutionize an archetype. The mainstream movies with pointless twenty minute action scenes or incredibly try-hard drama just doesn't do a thing for me. Even if you don't like this movie, it doesn't belong with Magic Mike.<br/><br/>I also have a pretty strong bias for movies that investigate systems of oppression, which is ultimately what this movie explores through each storyline, and chiefly why I gave it a nice score. It kind of makes an attempt to maybe philosophically address this ""mistake"" that we seem to keep repeating, but it's not very direct and might not actually even be there. It has sufficient room for some interpretation.<br/><br/>TL;DR -- Not the best movie I've ever watched, but definitely one of my favorites. It explores human conditions of suffering and captivity of varying degrees and situations. Even if you're not into analyzing ideas and themes, the storyline stands on its own merits. It's also kind of fun trying to figure out who is which character in each storyline--sometimes they change gender even.<br/><br/>I'm not saying to watch this movie ASAP, just put it on your list and watch it when you're alone one weekend searching for something to do. You might genuinely be surprised to find you also have a new favorite movie."

Read really a lot of books, seen almost everything there is.<br/><br/>The following is my subjective opinion, of a sci-fan fan.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad, but not great either. If the sci-fi elements were left out, it would be be similar to standard girlie movies, pride and prejudice and similar. It combines elements of romance, rebellion, hope and sacrifice, but not in a really new way, just trying to mix the good ingredients as the result must be good. But not really, because movies are not linear sum of ingredients.<br/><br/>I find the story non-convincing, both individual stories of particular time-lines, and stories of characters evolving through eras. Predictable and unconvincing at the same time. Little bit of pathetic too.<br/><br/>Had big expectations, but after a few weeks, the impression is pretty bleak. If you read this review, you might be pleasantly surprised after seeing the movie. I read good reviews and was disappointed."
"lyy1992","9","1","3","28 May 2013"," Does cloud has ""atlas""?
","I like to see science fiction movies since I'm young. Many of this kind of movies I saw are mostly on adventurous and thrilling and bit technical. But, this ""Cloud Atlas"" changed my perspectives.<br/><br/>I was a little bit strange at the first scene, and I personally feel weird that whether this is a science fiction movie or not, but at last, it is definitely a science fiction movie. Anyway, what I'll like to point out is do not expect what you can see from the movie, but do expect what you can learn from the movie. This is a science fiction movie, graphically. But subjectively, eternity of love and hate, sadness and happiness, kind and evil, that is the true ""atlas"" in the ""cloud"".<br/><br/>That is not easy to show the true vulnerability of human being and the truth of human life through movie, but Cloud Atlas did it! Whether the world is in determined order or in randomness, if one door is closed, another door will open. The moment of hopelessness is the moment of hopefulness. The connections between century of life is so complicated and yet is just a simple order of nature.<br/><br/>That's the only science movie that made me look deep into personal thought and heart so far(It made me felt touched and emotional)! If you see this movie, I hope that you can forgive your enemy. You might ask :""Why should I do that? There is no reason to do that..."" I can tell you, there is no reason because you just don't know the reason! And that's why I strongly recommend you to watch it.<br/><br/>Although the plot is a little complicated, you need time to really get into the track. Once you get it, then you will be amazed by the spontaneous events across the time!"

The acting was what you would expect from Hanks and Berry, you won't be disappointed. It is definitely a Blue ray video that I will add to my library. The scenes and images are outstanding. There is one story line that the Tom hanks character I didn't realize was Hanks. It is video that can be view numerous times and still bring enjoyment. The storey line with the broken strange English is one I needed to watch again to put together the dialogue. It should have been given better recognition at the Oscars.

The future of Hollywood will be the writing. And in this case the movie and its writing is quite good. There is an actual plot, with a beginning and an end. <br/><br/>This movie is long! It is nearly 3 hours and I advise that you make time for the entire movie. No interruptions, no dinners, no side conversations. This movie is very intense and is riddled with details. What makes this movie special is its ability to tell a story and keep you interested. There are good parts, and there are bad parts, happy parts, and sad parts. It is a roller-coaster and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overall I thought this movie was refreshing and offers a contrast to the slew of actions movies.

Sadly, I expect that a large majority of less sensitive moderns will be to impatient and dogmatic to let it touch them before the other stories bore or enrage them.<br/><br/>You know, it's quite sad that sites like this can't fathom that a good review of a film might be encapsulated in less than 10 lines.It seems that ""Brevity is the soul of wit"" was not preached much in their generation.

","Wow..<br/><br/>When i first saw cloud atlas, i had no idea what to expect, and boy was i blown away. This movie was love at first sight.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis has really overdone themselves with this masterfully conversion of David Mitchells novel: Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>Like the book, the film follows six sets of characters in six different time-lines, and six different locations. All of the stories happened independently of each other, yet they are still revealed to be connected, and sometimes in the most surprising ways.<br/><br/>Not only are there six different stories, but the movie itself feels like six different genres. One is aboard 19th century galley, one is a 1930s love affair, one i a 1970s thriller, one is a modern comedy, one is a gritty depressing sci-fi action, and the last is a post-apocalyptic adventure flick. And it works! The actors are all recycled throughout each of the different stories and this is where it becomes brilliant. For the movie itself has two main themes: first, everything is connected, and second, karma and reincarnation! <br/><br/>And it truly is brilliant! Actors change from male to female, white to black, American to Korean, all in the blink of an eye. With excellent prosthetics, some of the actors are hardly recognizable, whilst other are deliberately familiar, so that the audience can connect with the other characters. Some have complained that when Jim Sturgess changes takes on a yellow-face to play a Korean is racist, but when the movie shows you his other characters connection with actress Doona Bae's characters, the argument face-plants. The use of the same actors over this broader scope of race and genders is deliberate! <br/><br/>The movie plays out slow in the beginning, taking it's time to patiently explain each of the different set pieces, before the pattern reveals itself, and when it does, it's spectacular. Together with perfect performance from all the actors and actresses, combined with an excellent score from also co-director Tom Tykwer, this one hit all the right spots. I had to fight the tears towards the end in this one, and not from joy or sorrow, but from simply comprehending the artistically masterpiece that is Cloud Atlas.<br/><br/>This is a movie i could go on about forever. It's visually beautiful, masterfully directed, perfectly acted and simply mind boggling good in story elements. For me this is easily the best movie of 2012, and perhaps even the best movie i've ever seen to date."

","I watched this movie a few days ago and I've now had some time to reflect on it. When I came out of the movie I wasn't sure if I'd watched a waterfall of pure imagination or a work of art. I'm now sure that it was both! Yes, this is a movie which will demand something from the spectators: we're asked to keep the parallel stories in our minds and then return to them as though they were tabs in our web-browser, and they all move forward, and yes, they are connected -although this is not immediately obvious, of course-. But, to be honest, this is very little to ask from us when we get so much in return! This is a movie with really outstanding acting. I've never been too fond of Hanks, but I was so impressed with the versatility and class of his performance that I think I've changed my mind completely about him!. I also think that Halle Berry was a brilliant choice also. This is also a movie with beauty strokes all over the place, the scenery, the photograph, the love between some of the characters... all wrapped up in a story that will keep you thinking long after you watch it, a story that will knock on some doors in your mind that you didn't think were there, and... maybe it's about time you opened them. Don't be deceived by the box office results in the US: the movie has made made +124 million worldwide (as of March 6, 2013). It's a pity that this movie didn't get the promotion it deserved. From a selfish perspective, that's just as well, for delicacies are better appreciated when the theater isn't full. ;)"
"SpiritFilms","9","1","3","23 March 2013"," Aspires to Humanity's Most Noble Search for Truth and Meaning
","Cloud Altlas in nothing less than an attempt at conveying a sense of the cycles of dharma, the Kalachakra, the wheels of time that we are bound to, and the archetypes and themes that move through history and through lives. At best it gives you a glimpse of the heavenly motion of the greater cosmic templates of which we are usually unaware. At worst it panders to the lowest common denominator incorporating cliché Hollywood techniques for engaging the audience in thriller style action and moment by moment gimmicks. The film is like a bridge from the gross to the sublime and the view from that bridge is as vast as the ocean of time. Like a James Joyce novel it is elevated, elitist, demanding of its audience, and at times tedious. I would say that it is one of the rare films that turns consciousness away from the film and upon itself, forcing the viewer to deal with their own resistance, to make sense of a complex tapestry of meaning or to walk away disappointed. It is truly a case where you get back exactly what you put into the viewing experience. The noble attempt to convey something of this magnitude, purpose and importance in an of itself must be something that we nurture in our society. There can be no greater challenge and reward for a film."
"Jonathon_Natsis","7","1","3","13 March 2013"," Falls victim to its own ambition, but the effort is more than commendable.
","Cloud Atlas reeks of the type of film destined to receive polarising reviews upon its release, earn a cult following in the next few years and ultimately, in tentwentyfifty years time, be revered as an indisputable classic of the sci-fi genre. But that is then, and this is now. And right now, it feels too much like a mish-mash of abundant creativity let down by flawed execution, further hurt by a punishing runtime that threatens to isolate its audience.<br/><br/>The film, co-directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, Perfume) and the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy) weaves together six different tales showing how people's actions, both good and evil, reverberate through time and place. <br/><br/>The stories follow a weary shipmate who is unwittingly poisoned by the vessel's malevolent doctor; a naïve youngster who becomes a protégé to the world's greatest composer; a feisty journalist keen to blow the lid off a corrupt plant; a lovable kook trying to break out of a nursing home; a cloned waitress who rejects slavery in favour of a normal life; and an uneasy pilgrimage shared between a Neanderthal and a futuristic visitor.<br/><br/>The plot shifts constantly between stories, and while the semantics of each story are simplified to ensure the attentive viewer doesn't get lost, much emotion disappears as well. Much in the same way that a coach must give equal playing time to every member of his Under 8s soccer team, so to does the overall performance of the film falter in an attempt to give each outcome equal polish.<br/><br/>Pleasingly, each story feels like it would make for compelling viewing in its own vacuum. From the romantic tragedy of ""Letters from Zedelghem"" to the prison break comedy of ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" and the neo-noir subtext of ""An Orison of Sonmi-451"", there is much enjoyment to be had from the galore of genre mashing here, but one fable's relevance to its brothers does often feel contrived. <br/><br/>The directorial trio is further pushed between a rock and a hard place when one realises this depth in storytelling goes hand-in-hand with a near 3-hour runtime, which forces demanding viewers to simply go through the motions for much of the last act, heavily stymieing what tries to be an emotional power-punch of an ending, but one that feels more like a desperate flail. <br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The ultimate interconnection of act and consequence from one life to another. The audience is treated to an exploration of the concept of destiny versus free will between specific characters who encounter one another in the past, present and future.<br/><br/>I have used the word treated because this film is a visual feast; superbly made, finely acted with some exquisite cinematography.<br/><br/>However, this is one movie that will make it hard for most to keep up with.

The most beautiful soundtrack ever brought to my ears.<br/><br/>The film contains six stories that all link with each other and they are heartbreaking, epic, wonderful and even hilarious!<br/><br/>The only thing that slightly disappointed me about the film was SOME of the makeup. Halle Berry's transformation into a white, German woman was very, very impressive but some of Hugo Weaving's make up was kind of unprofessional.<br/><br/>Great film, great score, great action, moderately great makeup, impressive set decoration and a great script.<br/><br/>In words: Daring, impressive and insanely epic. <br/><br/>Wonderful film."

","Cloud Atlas is a story based on string theory, and what I mean by that is, all things throughout our universe or multi-verse have repercussions on every decision we make.<br/><br/>In this film we see many stories with certain outcomes from what choices the characters make, a negative action can have a reaction to another life connected to it, and so can a positive action. It's like tapping on the strings of a grand piano. String theory basically claims that all life is connected in one way or another, kind of like the ""six degrees of separation"", it's a new concept, but an interesting one.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas gives us the view of different characters from different points in time, and also from different universe's. It's a very interesting story that makes us think beyond what we really are.<br/><br/>This film is filled with comedic instances also very horrific ones, it gives us a bird's eye view of such wonderful scientific theories in which we can not explain, as of yet. I enjoyed the telling of the intersecting stories that seem to have a few plots in common no matter what time, or universe they took place.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas, is a different kind of story telling, with radical ideas, I for one enjoyed this film, even though it is a long runtime, I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a story beyond our logic and beyond our dreams. This film just makes me wonder of who we really are, and most importantly what we are."
"HelenMary","9","1","3","24 February 2013"," an epic masterpiece film of a great book
","When I read the book, many moons ago, I didn't fully understand it, or I did, but was aware I was missing something. I looked forward to the film but was also - like most admirers of the book - anxious that it did it justice, and couldn't imagine how the pieces of broken stories would translate to film. What I didn't imagine was that the film would finish the stories, which I loved. The film and book together make a formidable entertainment experience and the film alone is simply spectacular. Using the same actors was an inspired decision, and each did their job brilliantly. I loved the make-up, styling and prosthetics employed especially the cross-nationality work. Critics have said that some of the prosthetics are like amateur detective disguises but I didn't have such an issue with that - though admit some were better than others. There are aspects where you have to suspend your disbelief, some of the CGI etc but taken in toto this film is an immediate classic, I am sure, original and groundbreaking and the SFX are in places jaw-dropping. <br/><br/>The story itself spans centuries and is told through six separate narratives and each speaks of evolution (of character), freedom, integrity, love and belief. It shows that all through time we are connected, our stories intermingle and bring us forward in time and time is transcendent.<br/><br/>The writing and direction is intelligent, witty and varied; there is love and passion, pain and suffering, honour and integrity, fear and prejudice and moments of comedy and also emotion. You may cry watching this film and you may laugh. It will make you think, stay in your mind and also you may learn something about human nature, and perhaps about yourself. The film is almost like a religious propaganda film, evangelical, written to advertise a belief system or faith, and perhaps that is just the passion that it was made with. All the actors were clearly incredibly committed to their roles, everyone was acting at 100%. I hope this film does well but I don't think it will matter if it doesn't get lots of gongs (despite fully deserving them). People are going to be against this film because of the story it tells, people may not understand it or agree with it's philosophy - it might be controversial. I think Tom Hanks' contribution in this film should be lauded, as he was superb. Hugo Weaving was also quite spectacular in some of his roles - I'll never look at Elrond the same way again. Jim Broadbent and Doona Bae were noteworthy, and Halle Berry, of course! It was such a big, well known cast, and everyone was so good.<br/><br/>I recommend this film highly and would emphasise that seeing it at the cinema and the big screen does it justice."

","Cloud Atlas, is the only brilliant film I've seen this year. Watching this was a spiritual experience, and fulfilled everything I expect from a film. Jim Broadbent, Bae Doona, Ben Whishaw, the entire ensemble, give some of the very best performances this year. The editing, art direction, cinematography, and the rest of that fabulous tech team, do a stellar job. In fact, imo, Broadbent gives the best performance of the year.His scenes with Whishaw are easily the best I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Compare this to what AMPAS has given us this year as Best Picture, and I can only shake my head at how easily herded voters are.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","29 January 2013"," Deconstructing ""Cloud Atlas""
","This movie may not be as enigmatic as some have made it out to be. Yes, there are six stories spread over a few centuries, way into the future. But in general, within each story, the narration moves in a simple, linear timeline. Yes, one of these is told in flashback but it is all in the same time frame and the flashback itself is simple linear. Apart from having to follow six strings, ""Cloud Atlas"" is actually much easier to watch than many of the temporally scrambled movies we've had in the last couple of decades.<br/><br/>The trick here is editing. By necessity, the movie jumps continually from one story line to another throughout the entire some 3 hours of running time. Considering how the order of the stories can be varied and how the length of each segment can be varied, the possibilities are virtually infinite. It is sometimes scary to remember that what we are watching is ONE out of an infinite number of ways this can be done. To be THE BEST out of an infinity of alternatives has a probability of virtually zero. But the end-product we see is certain among the best, if the THE best.<br/><br/>The six stories are connected by one key theme: freedom. In a way, they are all about the underdog's fight for freedom. This is all we need to appreciate the movie. But you must have heard about all the mysticisms of the inter-connection of these stories. In fact, in two of the stories, we see the protagonists watching video recordings made in a previous story. As well there are motifs such as mysterious birthmarks, premonitions, déjà vu. Depending on your frame of mind, you can consider these supernatural, metaphysical or Freudian. It doesn't really matter. How much or how little attention to attach to them will not affect your enjoyment of this movie that has just about everything you want in a movie.<br/><br/>You must have also heard about the mind-boggling multi-role casting. There is a simple way of looking at this: each story has ONE MAIN CHARACTER.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess is Adam Ewing, an ailing 19th century South Seas traveler who helps a black slave to gain freedom. <br/><br/>Ben Whishaw is Robert Frobisher in the early 20th century, a talented composer assisting a famous but over-the-hill composer who conspires to steal his work.<br/><br/>Halle Berry is an investigative reporter in the 1970s risking her life to expose a horrendous conspiracy.<br/><br/>Jim Broadbent is Timothy Cavendish, a present-day publisher whose windfall makes him target of gangsters. Seeking help from his brother, he finds himself betrayed and sent to an old age nursing home that reminds you of ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".<br/><br/>In future Korea, Donna Bae is Sonmi-451, an attractive part-clone-part-human service industry worker that finally finds humanity and fights for it.<br/><br/>Finally, even further into the future, in post-apocalyptic Hawaii, Tom Hanks is Zachry, a down-to-earth dweller in a village constantly under the threat of barbarous tribes.<br/><br/>These six protagonists are the keys in their own segment, carrying their respective stories. But then, in other segments, they play other characters, from important co-leads to frivolous gimmicky cameos. In their ""other characters"" they may attempt role that are entirely different from the true selves in gender, race and age. One example is a perfect swap: Donna Bae plays Tilda, Adam Ewing's 19th century, Caucasian wife while Jim Sturgess plays Korean resistance Chang, Sonmi-451's white-knight, rescuer and sweetheart. This just happens to be a simple swap. There are many, many, many other multi-role situations in every way imaginable and unimaginable.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, there are others, appearing in various segments: Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Keith David, James D'Arcy, ZHOU Xun, David Gyasi and Hugo Weaving who play a bad guy (gender-neutral) in just about every story.<br/><br/>This movie is so rich that the consensus is that you should at least see it twice."

Every minute of the movie is a climax which is commendable. Acting was par excellence. <br/><br/>As for the ending of the movie was quite blunt as the viewer is glued to every character of the movie and ending it abruptly.<br/><br/>My score for the movie is 8/10.

This movie needs to be seen on a big screen...it's a big screen movie - or sit very close to your telly, the make-up in particular is wow... distracting even but if you have read the book then there's two major differences; (a) The time-line in the book goes from past to future and then back to the past, it's a Christmas tree shaped time-line...in the movie it switches very rapidly and all over the place...it seems that in the first ?20 minutes it changes almost every two minutes...that will VERY much confuse the viewer..<br/><br/>(b) They have skimmed the story...so so much is missing, I was almost outraged at how much was skipped...the book goes into so much detail but the movie has dropped so much of the content that gives meaning to the scenes...<br/><br/>However, having said that I loved loved loved this movie, it works on so many levels and is so thought provoking, I just can't wait until they do it properly, the way it deserves, in a three movie deal."
"firaty","6","1","3","4 January 2013"," Watch it if you believe (or tend to believe) in reincarnation
","I usually like epic 3-4 hours movies. Cloud Atlas is like watching several mini-movies with independent plots. Each actor is playing a different character in each plot, and time to time one of them says ""oh, I remember this"" for something he supposedly remembered from one of his past lives and these moments are the only connection between the plots. <br/><br/>Yes, the old guy repeating ""I know, I know"" is funny. Sure, we all love Tom Hanks, And noticing in the credits who played each character may be surprising. But those wouldn't keep you entertained for 172 minutes.<br/><br/>I noticed there are multiple directors, this may be why the movie loses its focus throughout the stories.<br/><br/>I think the whole point of this movie seems ""to convince you that reincarnation is real"". If it is so, well, it didn't work for me, unfortunately I still don't believe in reincarnation.<br/><br/>So I think Cloud Atlas may be interesting for people who believe in reincarnation, for the rest of us non-believer souls, it is nothing more than a bunch of fancy pictures. I believe this is a highly overrated movie, and suffers similar issues with another overrated movie ""Crash"", which also had unnecessary effort to connect the stories with extraordinary coincidences. At least this one wouldn't get the Oscar, I guess :)"
"alfredosahagun","9","1","3","30 December 2012"," Never done before Multi role acting and chronological redundancy
","As I see Cloud Atlas its challenging to connect the stories and impossible to realize who the actors are because of the make up. The editing of so many diverse stories to fit into a long and overwhelming load of visual information, dialogs, acting and stories make it a film like none ever done before. I applaud the many roles or character acting and their interpretations. Once again Tom Hanks is brilliant at a couple of roles and similar at others, the story never thickens because it not transcendent though that's the point they're trying to prove, scripts made this way unconnected or ""shallow-connecting"" through coincidences, now karma-style or soul re-births, much like in K. Sutherland's new lost project ""TOUCH"" or one or two recent films promoting the same idea. Fully entertaining, innovative, exiting multi story film by the creators of the Matrix the Wachowsky brothers and joined by Tom Tykwer. The fact that the movie is so long, over 2.40hrs, is acceptable from the standpoint that its narrating multiple parallel stories, up to 8 different stories or more I believe, with a combination of characters played by a handful of good actors. The clear trend of the Wachowsky brothers, still not far from their Matrix vision, but more develop futuristic environment and storytelling is once more truly delightful together with its action scenes."
"nik111","6","1","3","28 December 2012"," Shallow insight into karmic intertwines
","Not so much impressed. Money invested into production are apparent on visuals and casting, on the other side if someone uses karmic inspiration to intertwine individuals and their life times, he/she should know a person is not locked all the time in one role whether oppressor or the victim. It changes as well, or else it is very narrow view of experience gathering on this planet Earth. Also overcoming fear or being reconciled with own death is one of many possible outcomes individual can get - sort of shallow offer from the writers of this movie.<br/><br/>On the other side it is also true, current Western civilization is not consisting much of philosophers or thinkers, mainstream is swimming its way through the life and so just only a couple of incentives play major role in decision making - e.g. fear, sex or manipulation,.. It would be more inspiring though to include intertwines with Eastern cultures or indigenous people which are also part of this planet. Insight into pollution of environment and disconnection with the Nature can serve additional feedback on moral stands and picking choices, just to name a few. Well, writers tried to impress by sort of complexity, but from my point of view the opposite happened and movie is pretty much straightforward and predictable."

The concept of meeting up with different characters over and over in our lifetimes is one that an interesting aspect as well as the idea of our karma also affecting us over lifetimes. <br/><br/>Hugh Grant has difficulty keeping his accent in one of his characters which is annoying. And the biggest annoyance is the language spoken by Tom Hanks and Halle Barry in the future characters - it's hard to follow what they are saying and it sounds ridiculous and almost ruins the film. But aside from that, it's worth seeing and I will watch it again to see what I may have missed the first time round."

So many different opinions on what the movie is about,what its trying to convey & so many reviews commenting if you haven't read the book then you have nothing to add about what the story is about & so on & so on. OK i haven't read the book so i can't review that but iv'e watched the movie so i can review that,besides,""not as good as the book"" gets boring really quick,what works on paper doesn't always work on screen & even the original author would probably agree that with hindsight he may have done things differently especially if he had any idea someone would eventually spend $100,000,000 making it into a movie. I don't know if the book conveyed that the characters were reincarnations of each other or how the author would have been able to convey that in the book,easy to do in a movie by using the same actors playing different characters in different time periods but that didn't come across to me i think that was just a gimmick (or rather a financial choice)that reviewers have made too big a deal about when they should have concentrated on the glimpsed birthmark,i saw it as each story was linked by the person with the birthmark, as these characters were related through the different relationships legitimate or illegitimate through time. Is this an epic movie?in my opinion no,but it does try,is it an epic story? yes, it spans hundreds of years of course its epic,for me there's just not enough of each story on screen to make it feel like an epic movie so i personally would have liked it to be 4 hours or so long but having said that it is so worth watching. The cinematography,acting,sets the different characters in each story are excellent & very entertaining. For me each story although set in different time periods with different characters all told the same story,the oppressed fighting against the oppressor ""i will not be subjected to criminal abuse"". Yes i could be wrong but this is how i see the movie,its very good very interesting & yes very different from other movies that are on offer but this is what sets it apart from those other movies not that it is ""epic"". To all the reviewers that have delved deep into trying to explain Cloud Atlas with big and intelligent explanations-its a movie made by people trying to make money & acted out by people who want to make money its just a movie. To all those reviewers that have been negative & unkind- easy go watch something else. And finally to all those on IMDb arguing & calling each other names & stating someone is unintelligent for not ""understanding"" the movie- stop it,its silly,even though it is entertaining to read."
"lasttimeisaw","8","1","3","2 December 2012"," Cloud Atlas
","If the source novel from David Mitchell is claimed to be ""the most impossible one to be adapted to a feature film"", the true grit behind the director trio alone merits some accolade. But the critical box-office feedback firmly suggests they will never retrieve the gargantuan budget (over 100,000,000$ for production and nothing else), while being under the barrage of divisive reviews from the critics, an ominous pre-watch hunch could never be dissolved until I finally watched it on the super-big screen (not as large as an IMAX) in the cinema, and I must confess it comes out far ""stunning"" than I had expected.<br/><br/>Graphically bountiful visual stunts of 6 inter-linked stories which stretch across different eras (from primitive tribe to a clone-ed future world) certainly has paid off its lengthy running time, 172 minutes passed by fleetingly with more anticipation was still hanging there when the ending credits inconveniently started to roll. CLOUD ATLAS is a cleverly designed omnibus, using same actors playing multiple roles in different sub-stories, consistently establishes a sense of reincarnation and an almost sacred disposition to influence a more elusive and conscience-contingent point-of-view into its viewer's subliminal comprehension. While being unfamiliar with David's novel, a first viewing may impede myself from a more comprehensive understanding of the various characters' inner liaisons, at least, it has accomplished a diverting and edifying piece of cannon to channel any soul willing to yield to a cobweb of myths and karma.<br/><br/>But, as one would expect from exploiting an astronomical range and sophisticated plot- piling, the sub-stories unfortunately have an uneven exhibition, to divide individually, Jim Broadbent's breaking out of the home-for-the-elderly is the jolliest of all; the ill-fated destiny of Ben Wishaw's prodigy composer has much more pathos than other episodes; Halle Berry's contemporary thriller of an individual fighting the evil energy company is the stalest and has an uncertain bathos in the end; the troubled tribesman Tom Hanks's prophesy adventure in the bleak future has an insidious devil inside to conquer while his more civilized outer-space allies has a more straightforward mission to ignite; the sea journey of Jim Burgess' young lawyer in the 19th century has its suspense hanging until a hackneyed rescue from a black slave; Doona Bae's anti-Neo (the savior) sacrifice has the most transcendent visual tactic to rally its award-worthy buzz but the reverberations of the doctrinal speech is a moot point. <br/><br/>Actors-wise, Jim Broadbent is superbly versatile apart from his usual comic comfort zone, who is my current Supporting Actor win and Ben Whishaw could never miss his chance to embroider a heartrending story with his own vulnerability and pure devotion. Doona Bae has to tackle with a much more difficult role as the robo-clone, but out of her poker-faced complexion, her key show comes off wonderfully and very much dilutes any deja-vu suspicions of her episode. <br/><br/>So, ending my review in one sentence, CLOUD ATLAS is an epic venture with (quite a few) narrative clichés, but is still able to make most of Hollywood commodities pale in comparison."

","Many, when it was announced that the 2004 novel Cloud Atlas was getting a film, cried out how ""unfilmable"" said novel was. Well, unfilmable or not, it has happened. The Wachowskis have teamed up with famed German writer/director Tom Tykwer to deliver what is unquestionably one of the most ambitious films ever produced. It stretches a single ensemble cast across six separate stories, which run the gamut from comedy to horror, from romance to hard sci-fi, and take place from the late 19th century to the mid 24th. That sentence alone should give you some idea of what kind of film this is. What I could also tell you is that each of the six stories is absolutely enthralling, and the connections between them tenuous (with one exception, which makes itself obvious during the film). I could also say that somewhere along the way, I ceased my attempts to connect the dots, and slipped into a kind of trance, in which I simply witnessed the film in front of me rather than think about it. This is a movie of breathtaking scope and awesome imagination, of fine acting and seamless technical quality. Looking at it only skin deep, this is nothing less than a masterpiece. However, penetrate any further and you will need to think, and think hard, about what is transpiring on the screen before you. You will need to understand, though not believe, some fundamental qualities of spirituality to appreciate some of the film's many messages and ideas. This is a movie that begs to be interpreted, dissected, and analyzed. And the viewers who find it rich and artful will be matched only by those who see it as pretentious and impenetrable. However, whichever side you take, you will find something to enjoy, be it the sumptuous art direction, the thematic depth, or the commendable performances. Whether this film is good or bad is all but irrelevant. Once you leave the theater, know that you have witnessed what is possibly the most important film of the year. In a year when movies like Paranormal Activity 4, The Avengers, and Taken 2 are topping the box office, here is one blockbuster that dares to break new ground.

","""Cloud Atlas"" is a 2012 film that runs for almost 3 hours and was made by the Wachowski brothers (""Matrix"") together with German director Tom Tykwer (""Lola rennt""). Oscar winners Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are the lead actors and many other famous names are in the cast, such as 2 more Oscar winners, namely Jim Broadbent and Susan Sarandon plus Hugo Weaving (""Matrix), Jim Sturgess and Hugh Grant. Also this film introduced Doona Bae and she is playing several major characters. This is also the core of the film. All the actors do not only play one character, but several and they live in completely different eras: the past the present and the future.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with the book that this is based on, but I must say that it was a decent watch most of the time. The stories are solid and make sense as much as this is possible in a film with so many futuristic and prehistoric references. Jim Broadbent is fun to watch as always and he elevates the plot about the senior citizen's home a lot. However, this film has one great weakness: There is almost exclusively black and white in this film. Characters are either completely evil or over-the-top good people There are absolutely no shades in here plus many of the actors only play characters which are on one side of the scale. Berry only plays good, Weaving only plays bad. Maybe this is also why this film did not manage to get in at the Oscars at all despite being considered one of the big competitors that year. Still, all in all, even if it does not even come close to fulfilling the ambition it had, it's still a solid watch and rarely drags, which is definitely a decent achievement for a film with such a runtime. Recommended all in all, especially if you like Hanks and the other actors, but nothing outstanding really."

","Like six movies muscled into one, Cloud Atlas is a raw, dense, ambitious mash of tangled wires and blinking lights. Needless to say, the film must be seen more than once to fully comprehend, and even then it's a nut that demands a viewer's complete concentration to crack. It's a mosaic, stitching vastly different subjects, atmospheres, landscapes and circumstances into the same cloth with mixed results. Things are so breakneck that, even at three unusually long hours, I felt like I was missing large swaths of story, merely scratching the surface of what was actually going on. The editing is partly to blame for that, with its dizzying leaps across generations (which, in some instances, occur several times in a single scene), and the heavy makeup effects - employed to cast the same actors in several roles, genders, ages and nationalities - are often a major distraction. For a film as loaded as this one, even a momentary pause to identify a vaguely-familiar face can tangle the feet, leaving us helplessly adrift in a sea of themes and imagery. It alternates between stunning and baffling in the blink of an eye, an experience that's both confounding and mesmerizing to behold. Kudos to the filmmakers for daring to try something so thoroughly different from the norm. It's magical on the rare occasions it all comes together and works as a single, monumental behemoth, but is also plagued by a swarm of ticks and shortcomings. I wonder if the time and effort necessary to actually access its thematic riches might be a steeper cost than many viewers are willing to pay. A complicated picture, both to ingest and to rate. Today's score may be subject to change."

Character relations in this movie are also very in depth and well thought out. I do not believe there is a single note missed for this story. it's an amazing adaptation from the book to be able to show all it covers in such little time.

"felisgris","9","1","4","6 September 2014"," Excellent and moving
","This very ambitious movie succeeds on most counts. It is artistically admirable, beautiful, and moving.<br/><br/>It succeeds excellently as eye-candy, giving us first-class costumes, sets, and makeup. Those who have wanted to revisit the megapolis of Blade Runner will not be disappointed. The period sets and costumes are a little less good - accurate, but without the strong impression of time that the very best period productions leave. It succeeds as a wow vehicle for the actors, especially Halle Berry, although the characters are a bit lacking in complexity. It is perhaps more story-driven than it is character-driven.<br/><br/>It succeeds, but not completely, in being deep and thought-provoking. It doesn't really succeed in demonstrating its theme that the actions of people in different times are connected. But it is a stirring meditation on how slavery recurs at different times and on the lives and sacrifices of those who fight it.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing and a movie that I will revisit many times."

","Very disappointing. When I first heard all the hype about Cloud Atlas, the three directors and the all-star cast, I was sure it would be an epic success, but my hopes were dashed to shreds upon first viewing.<br/><br/>It was a pretentious mess fueled by an incoherent script, sometimes inept acting and a foreboding feeling throughout that it was trying to force the audience into saying, ""Hey, this movie has a message for humanity and it best not be ignored!"" <br/><br/>To be fair, the acting was decent for the most part and the special effects were very well-done, but what was the problem with having Asian men portraying male Asian characters? Instead, they decided to use Caucasians with Asian eye makeup. Have male Asian actors abandoned Hollywood en masse? <br/><br/>All-in-all, an almost total disappointment, but I still give it 6/10. It could have been so much more."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","4 April 2014"," An ambitious novel generally well realised on the screen
","The 2004 novel by British writer David Mitchell was a hugely ambitious work which I enjoyed and admired. It is six stories with subtle inter-relationships between them: each one written in a different format, each constituting a different genre, each set in a different time. This was always going to be a formidably challenging piece of clever writing to bring to the big screen in a manner accessible to the viewer but true to the spirit of the original work. The film was written, produced and directed by the Americans Lana (formerly Larry) and Andy Wachowski and the German Tom Tykwer and, against all the odds, it works very well.<br/><br/>The first challenge was finding the money to make a movie which is so demanding of its viewers. During the four years of development, the project met difficulties securing financial support and it was eventually produced with a $102 million budget provided by independent sources, which makes it one of the most expensive independent films of all time. The risk paid off since the takings more than covered the costs, but critical and audience reaction has been variable. The next challenge was how to structure the work. The novel consists of 11 sections with only the sixth story in unified form and the other five split in two, set symmetrically around the core, so that the reader finishes with the second section of the story with which he started. The film adopts a totally different structure; the pre-title sequence immediately introduces the lead characters of the six tales and then the film itself constantly jumps between the different narratives. At first, this is really confusing for the viewer, but gradually one gets a mental grip on the inter-locking stories. One advantage of this approach is that all six tales come to a climax towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Another challenge was how to realise the many connections that the author created between the different stories. Some were easy, such as the reoccurring comet-shaped birthmark and the use of the word six as in the character Sixsmith and the musical octet. In fact, the inter-connections are done more obviously in the film than in the book. The main device for achieving this is to have the same actors playing multiple roles, although it is often not easy to pick this out since the make-up is very professional. The eight leading actors play no less than 46 roles between them. Tom Hanks is especially impressive in his six roles, but other stars are Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon. Another device for making cross connections is clever cutting between similar scenes or situations.<br/><br/>The final challenge was how to do all this in a manageable length. The novel is over 500 pages and the film comes in at little under three hours. To require so much concentration for so long is a big ask and not all movie-goers will have the stamina or inclination. But I found it a genuinely bold and original work that I enjoyed and will want to revisit before too long to savour the full richness of this unusually complex but thoughtful work."

"BrentAMG","7","1","4","23 January 2014"," Eh. Some Great Actors Doesn't Mean Great Movie
","I remember some time last year I saw the trailer for Cloud Atlas. It caused enough excitement that I pulled many of my friends into the lounge to watch the trailer. They all agreed: It was going to be a great movie. It created so much interest in me that I began to investigate it. I found out that it was based on a novel. For weeks I wanted to acquire it and read it, as I like to read novels before seeing the adapted films. However, the drive to read the book eventually passed as the semester, and life, unfolded. Until the movie came out. As I had been accustomed to seeing with many highly anticipated movies, it was receiving less-than-desirable reviews. Consequently, my urge to see the film diminished and I decided the viewing could wait. That is why I just saw the film.<br/><br/>After completing the film, one word came to mind: ambitious. The movie attempts to accomplish so much in just under three hours. (Needless to say, I will not be including a plot summary with this review.)<br/><br/>The first 15-20 minutes of Cloud Atlas dragged. It wasn't because it was something that is the norm; this movie is certainly not that. Rather, it dragged because it appeared to be a typical science fiction film (just plain weird) that did not offer anything completely riveting or profound that demanded my attention. Eventually that changed, thank goodness.<br/><br/>It took me awhile to get used to the flow of the movie. That might be because there is an absolute lack of a ""flow."" There are six stories told throughout the film, each of which take place in a different time period. The catch is that all of the stories are, in some way, connected. All of the main actors in the film play various characters. Some of these roles cross genders and actually surprise you once you realize who they are. SPOILER -> (Halle Berry is white in one of her roles.)<br/><br/>The crux of Cloud Atlas is that a person's legacy, and love, ripple throughout time. When a person dies it is not the end, rather a door opening. It is not hard to notice the connection to the idea of reincarnation. Aforementioned, each actor appears in every time period. However, in every time period the actors have a different relationship with each other; the dynamics change.<br/><br/>I will admit the film was enjoyable. Many emotions were evoked in this production and the visuals within the movie were stimulating. I am not saying that it was great, just that it provided entertainment. I did appreciate how each of the six stories was essentially a different genre. There was action, comedy, science fiction, music, and mystery. By the end (as I suspect was one of the producers' intentions) I felt that I had just finished something epic. (I use that in the literal sense.)<br/><br/>I have a feeling that this movie is much like poetry. Many of my poet- friends say that you take something new away from a good poem each time you read it. Additionally, poetry is open to interpretation, much like this film. I've made many positive points, but there was much room for development.<br/><br/>There had to be a less-confusing way to present the six separate stories. At times the concentration needed to comprehend the interwoven tales was enough to cause a headache. (Let me assure you, I am not saying that movies have to be simple, just that they shouldn't cause physical pain.) Some of the actors' talents were stretched pretty thin with some of the roles they played, especially, though not limited to, (SPOILER) Tom Hanks as an Irish gangster. Furthermore, some of the ""sci- fi-ness"" seemed to be present just for the sake of being strange<br/><br/>Overall, I would say Cloud Atlas is worth a watch. Maybe two. However, I would not buy it for my collection. 7/10"
"Lomedin","6","1","4","22 November 2013"," 6 movies in 1
","This film presents us with 6 stories in different ages (19th century, the 30s, the 70s, the present, 2100s and 2300s), linked together apparently by some sort of spiritual humanistic plot.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is like a mixture of Magnolia, The Hours and even Baccano! I wouldn't be surprise if they found ""inspiration"" in those or other sources, since certain directors/writers siblings like to take from other works. Anyway, it's one of those strange cases in which my expectations matched almost perfectly what I witnessed. No more, no less. I don't picture this movie as pretentious, although I see how pretentious people may love it. In any case, it's not for everybody.<br/><br/>Each of the 6 stories is somehow valuable (plot wise) on its own, and I found them interesting enough. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing boring. The toll of so many movies interlaced in one is the running time, close to 3 hours. It's bearable though. And you will find a bit of historical film, a lot of drama and mystery, some fantasy and nice scifi. Mind you, the fantastic and futuristic elements are there for the purpose of the plot only, not to show off. That doesn't rest importance to the nicely done special effects.<br/><br/>It's also curious to note how the same actors play different roles in all different ages. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that this film is yet another story that tries to inject spiritualism (non-religious) into our brains, in the again common current of seen humans through the eyes of humanism, and aiming for something bigger that the simple fact of us being just a sac of flesh.<br/><br/>OK to see if you like drama and human related spirituality. This movie won't probably say much to a person with a true purpose in his/her life (no wow effect/change of life after watching it). I suspect that, if you are trying to find something to fill a void, you'll like it more."
"BeneCumb","7","1","4","6 November 2013"," Distinguishable, with fine performances, but uneven episodes and long run
","The movie in question is a long and hectic narration (at times seems unceasing), with some elements of interlock, continuity and era-wise approaches. There are 6 different places/years, but not all of them are equally intriguing; my favorites are UK 2012 (with the funniest moments) and San Fransisco 1973 (most crime thriller), distant past and particularly distant future episodes used known turns and depiction too much. Joining elements are not always clear, same actors play different roles (with occasionally crude make-up), thus one has to stare the screen all the time, which becomes physically difficult as the movie lasts ca 2 hours 45 minutes. As for the cast, the finest performances are carried out by Oscar-winners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Jim Broadbent, the others were just average or spent too little time on screen (e.g. Susan Sarandon).<br/><br/>All in all, a kind of challenging watching: rather unusual script, but too sophisticated episodes and weak connection did not make tracking events easy. I would have preferred less time periods and more inter-generational links when deeds or ideas of older generations have direct impact on their descendants."
"starsteamer","6","1","4","30 July 2013"," A decent attempt but would have made a better TV series...
","As I have recently read the novel before watching the movie I feel that I can only critique the adaptation of the story rather that as a separate film. Before viewing I was intrigued by how a scriptwriter would fit the intricacies of the many narratives into one movie. I would not say I was disappointed. Each tale is told in snippets linked by similarities in plot while the writer has adapted more than a few details to work better as a film. (Which is something that should be admired. A movie is not an exact copy of a book. It is instead an adaptation of the story - a fact critics should remember!) The film is also beautifully shot with each time period portrayed in a visually wonderful way. Each actor is also very good although Berry and Hanks do not, I feel, have the scope to act in the differing ways required. This did not, however, have a negative affect on the film. Jim Broadbent Shows them up. However, there are some negatives to this movie. The first is unfortunately the prosthetics. Some are very well done but many could have been done better and somewhat ruins the visual experience of the film. In addition, the characters' stories have been largely condensed. I do not know how this stands as a movie independent from the novel as I have read it, however I think it may have translated better as a television series. I would have loved to see each character's story played out in similar detail to the book. It could have been very successful. Finally, be aware of the fact that the film has been 'Americanised'. In other words its plot has been smothered in unnecessary cheese. It is definitely a journey and the time flies by unnoticed. I would recommend the novel for the character and plot development. I think that the directors have done well with this movie but series would have excelled."

"Bob-45","6","1","4","2 July 2013"," Ponderous, missed opportunity by the Wachowski's
","Nearly Thirty years ago, Sergio Leone virtually wrote the book on flashback/forward movies with ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Only some unfortunate casting (Elizabeth Perkins) and under-exposition in the second half prevented it from becoming a bonafide masterpiece. Over ten years ago, David Lynch demonstrated its full potential in the near perfect ""Mulholland Drive"". Only an overly extended ""magician's act"" and graphic ""love scenes"" in the final act diminished its impact. Nearly fifteen years ago, Paul Thomas Anderson demonstrated how such a monumental task could be accomplished with a huge ensemble cast with ""Magnolia"". Only a silly (though historically plausible) deus ex machina marred this fine effort. On the other hand, Cameron Crowe and Steven Soderbergh cautioned us by example of the horrid results of the consequences of how difficult and unsatisfying a flashback/forward movie can be in the wrong hands. Yet, none of these films are nearly as ambitious as ""Cloud Atlas"" and the only film that comes close is Josef Rusnak's largely ignored and nearly forgotten ""The Thirteenth Floor"".<br/><br/>""Cloud Atlas"" spans at least five hundred years between distant past and possible near future, with multiple story lines,styles alternating between farce, melodrama and turgid drama. Worse, ""Cloud Atlas"" buries competent, if sometimes uninspiring stars under tons of makeup. Worse, the narrative is so choppy, one hardly has time to know WHERE and WHEN he is, before jumping off to the next time and locale. This makes empathy for the characters nearly impossible. Fortunately, Halle Berry, Ben Whishaw, Jim Sturges,Hugo Weaving and Doona Bae manage to pull it off. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks did not, and herein lies the crux of the problem. Hanks can be a fine actor, but his range is limited; Robert Downey Jr., Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce probably could, though even they would have struggled with that horrible ""pigeon"" dialect in the ""after the fall"" segment. Hanks alternates between either hammy or unintelligible, effective only when relying on his expressions to tell the story. On the other hand,Halle Berry makes it look easy; of course, Berry is so darned gorgeous that even watching her on screen is a feast for the senses. Bae, on the other hand, is an acquired taste, with her ""porcelain doll"" features, though her picture-perfect body is quite a treat. Bae hits all the right notes as Somni-351; unfortunately, this means automatonic mannerisms which undercut hers,and, by extension, the film's message. Fortunately, her chemistry in scenes with both Jim Sturges and Ben Whishaw is tantalizing and this young lady has quite a future in Western cinema if she chooses it.<br/><br/>As for the narrative, I could have completely done without the silly ""Timothy Cavendish"" segment. A great deal of time is spent on his misadventures, only to be wasted by its overly abrupt insertion into the ""Somni-351"" segment. Likewise, I was so distracted by Hank's, Weaving's and Berry's ""pigeon,"" in the ""after the fall"" segment, I barely understood, let alone cared, about the key points being made.<br/><br/>Since reincarnation and spiritual development are so foreign to Western audiences, I am somewhat surprised ""Cloud Atlas"" was even made. I can only imagine what brilliant Chinese director Yimou Zhang (""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Curse of the Golden Flower,"")could have done with it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately,as it stands, ""Cloud Atlas"" is little more than a curiosity and a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>I give ""Cloud Atlas"" a ""6""."

","Cloud Atlas runs almost three hours, and it could have used some editing. Although it has some beautiful moments, the constant abrupt jump from story to story in different time periods, is somewhat confusing. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are both very good in multiple roles. Hugh Grant and Hugo Weaving round out an excellent cast throughout. The main problem is the mix between serious drama and science fiction action elements which are loud as hell compared with the subtle scenes with interesting dialogue. I understand that we are all connected as human beings in a struggle to survive, and that all of our actions have consequences, some large and others small. The Wachowski's have done it much better before, especially with V for Vendetta, one of my favorite films of all time; they have deep and profound thoughts. Even with its flaws, Cloud Atlas is worth the ride."

It has multiple different stories and scenarios and time periods incorporated into this one visceral film. But isn't done in a way that is all that engaging or intriguing. In fact just about all of the stories in this movie has been done before and better. It tries to blend love, time, karma, sacrifice, rebirth, freedom and hope into this one film. The wachowski's are visionary directors but there just didn't seem to have all that amazing of a imagination for this one. This movie is almost 3 hours but felt like a 3 hour movie and just didn't find it all that entertaining. It might be one of those movies that take multiple watches to get completely but I just didn't find this whole experience all that clever. The stories aren't told one by one but show a bit of one of the story then move onto another story then come back to another story. It has some good editing but the switching of the stories seemed to quick to the point it got kinda irritating to watch. All the actors and actresses in this is alright but mostly forgettable. Tom Hanks seemed to really want to try all the different accent and dialects he shows in this movie. Anyways when it tries to blend all the stories together to a certain point I found it weak.

","Very.. opening, for lack of words. Let me first start off by saying I have not read the novel or had any insight to the story whatsoever prior to watching this film adaptation, and it was neither confusing nor a pain to watch even though it is complex in nature and it has a long running time of a little under 3 hours. I would say that if you were to watch this, wait until it hits DVD/Blu-ray and see it in the comforts of your own home, on a relaxing Friday night or weekend evening, with noise cancelling headphones or something to mute the world outside. This type of narrative, I feel, requires solitude and some time alone to become completely immersed in. I imagine if anyone had done so for their very first viewing, it would have had a stronger or more lasting impression on them.<br/><br/>I love movies like this, despite what some professional film critics may say. I just love them. Why? A lot of elements in the film and the film itself is open to interpretation. I feel like movies these days should be like this, and they should impose upon the viewer a sense of mystery, an air of brilliance, and a feeling of opportunity. To leave with a greater understanding of anything, of everything, and a willingness to understand—that is what great films allow.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, the several interconnected story lines which the film seamlessly transitions between succeeds in piquing your intelligence, not by serving the plot to you on a silver platter, as most films do these days, but by making you work for and think about it. Technicalities aside, I can only describe Cloud Atlas as a new type of film which bridges many issues in our world in present day and brings together the entire spectrum of cultural, geographical, and social differences, from sexuality to corporate corruption to discrimination to religion to segregation and more, all throughout multiple eras and periods of time in history and showcased as individual and separate, and yet at the same time, as one totally interconnected universe. It may be cliché but it is a necessary reminder and encouragement for all which has progressed and changed up to this day in our society. There is comedy, there is suspense, there is action, there is mystery, there is romance; there is a little bit of something in every genre that's been funneled into this one act and shaken up for someone to experience the combination of it all. The dialogue, especially the accents and dialects, can sometimes be hard to follow along, but it was done so to create the atmosphere of the story by giving off that feeling of foreignness. The landscapes, whether digitalized or filmed in real life, were plentiful and pleasant to admire. The actors are incredible in the way they manage to pull off several entirely different characters with distinct personalities. And oh, the piano, the music. The story wound itself around the centre piece ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", which ended off as a nice touch as a tribute to the whole movie. And while all this is perfect talk, this movie was just an adaptation of a novel I assume to be equally as impressive. But the medium in question is film, and films succeed in conveying stories and enticing audiences. And to that, I say, ""Cloud Atlas"" does one hell of a fine job.<br/><br/>A film which is a must-see, whether you end up liking it or not."
"phantom_11","7","1","4","7 March 2013"," A likable film not without its flaws.
","Cloud Atlas's disjointed story, though jarring at first, is a still a fairly watchable film. The stories interweave and twist and turn through the ages; as we meet each of the main characters and learn of their connections. I would have liked to have spent more time exploring each of the different character's stories, but alas it was more like brief glimpses at half imagined worlds that flicker off when the writer runs out of ideas, only to be briefly returned to once the ideas strike hot again. The idea is grand in scale: how different lives intertwine and how different people through different ages become the same person they were all along. The ultimate ending sees a far flung future and ties up the story to a satisfying conclusion. This does not compensate, however, for the fact that the movie falls short in the sense that it doesn't really deliver a whole story. It delivers pieces of stories that are loosely interwoven and then forgotten to make way for the next piece. The performances are fine, and the set-pieces often grand; there's definitely a lot to be admired, it's just such a shame that more could not have been done with the story. The source material doesn't really lend itself well to adaptation, however; and so, this slight annoyance can be overlooked. It is, after all, quite an enjoyable film and one that should be returned to and savoured, if only to figure out who is who throughout the film and where their individual stories connect. Overall, I give the film a 7/10. Definitely one to watch once, if not twice."

So zou maz tell me that the film is really starting to rock after the 46th minute.<br/><br/>For me I seldomly watched a more boring film. Camera was good, that's the reason it gets 4 instead of star. No meaningful plot, just a pile up of camera shots. People who like Pulp Fiction (I don't but I like other Tarantiino films) may like this one here, I don't. It looks to me this one is just becoming iconic because it pretends to be so all-encompassing. In my opinion this film is not comparable to Blade Runner, Brazil, Alien...whatever SciFi movies will be remembered."
"neftaliw","5","1","4","29 December 2012"," This is a very long opening for what could've been a masterpiece
","In the film, Cloud Atlas is the name of the musical piece that is being made by one of the main characters, so I see appropriate to analyze the film as if it was a classical music piece. The first half of the movie tries so hard to make a mystery out of one dimensional stories by hiding important ( and rather obvious)information from the viewer. And even though the narrator tries to explain everything to you two or three times, you don't get the movie until it's about to finish. However, just like in an orchestra you listen to different solos before the climax of the piece, so does Cloud Atlas builds for so long, that you think ""this is going to be so amazing"". The first two hours of the movie is like the ascend of really big roller-coaster, the problem is what comes on the other side. The climax in the movie (which is audio-ed by the climax of the Cloud Atlas Sixteth), is short, obvious and predictable, and the ending and conclusion is mediocre.<br/><br/>The movie is about two good stories, two not so good ones, and two bad stories glued up together with Tom Hanks trying so desperately to convince you that all of them are linked together. However, I don't see any reason why all the stories couldn't been fit into one time period (i.e. Second Wordl War), where one of the characters would be fighting to free the Jews instead of freeing the African - Americans from slavery, the other one would be a musician striving to get some fame in the middle of a war, the other a publisher / writer that's too old for his job, a reporter that risks her life in order to cover a war story, and a Jew (instead of a ""fabricant"") inspiring others to survive and free themselves before they're made into soap.<br/><br/>I don't understand how this movie got to have an 8.+ rating here, I think that people who didn't understand it rated it higher so they wouldn't seem stupid."

I especially liked the Korean future setting, that had its moments... but even that became a mix of Blade Runner and V for Vendetta without really reaching a climax.<br/><br/>Decent performances though. Tom Hanks brilliant as usual. Hugo Weaving didn't really have a chance to stand out. Gave me some flashbacks to Matrix with the voice too, but that has already been used.<br/><br/>Perhaps it should have aimed to be a mini-series."

","Who among us doesn't want to be remembered? To make an impact that will last lifetimes? It turns out everyone's life does, just not necessarily the way you might like or to the degree you might hope, or so says this latest offering from the creators of The Matrix trilogy based on a novel of the same name by David Mitchell.<br/><br/>Chronologically, the first character we're introduced to is Adam Ewing. Ewing (played by Jim Sturgess) is an American lawyer travelling to the South Pacific to conduct business on behalf of his father-in-law. He witnesses the enslavement of the native islanders, offers passage to one who stows away on the ship, Autua (played by David Gyasi) and falls ill as a result of exposure to a parasite. Once incapacitated by his illness, Ewing is ""cared for"" by the maniacal Dr. Henry Goose (played by Tom Hanks). Eighty-seven years later, we're taken to the UK and introduced to a young man whose wealthy father sees him as an embarrassment and has disowned him. That man, Robert Frobisher (played by Ben Whishaw), dreams of being a composer. While hoping to achieve that, he takes a job dictating for a man whose already achieved fame of his own, Vyvyan Ayrs (played by Jim Broadbent), whose eyes are failing him. Despite Ayrs unpleasant demeanor, Frobisher proves up to the job and it allows him time to further his own ambitions. Flash forward another thirty-seven years, we meet Luisa Rey. Rey (played by Halle Berry who also portrays relatively minor characters in the previous story lines) is a second-generation journalist writing a story about a nuclear power plant that is opening in her hometown of San Francisco. Unexpectedly, she meets Rufus Sixsmith (former lover of the now-deceased Frobisher played by James D'Arcy). Sixsmith (D'Arcy) is a nuclear physicist who knows that the plant is unsafe and hopes to relay his knowledge to Rey and provide evidence to substantiate it. What neither Ray, Sixsmith, or Dr. Isaac Sachs (another whistleblower played by Tom Hanks) are aware of however, is that they are all being hunted by a man whose employers wish to see the plant open, no matter the risk to the environment or local residents. Once again, we jump ahead. This time, thirty-nine years to the present. There we meet Timothy Cavendish (played by Broadbent). Cavendish is a publisher at a publicity event for an author named Dermot Hoggins (Hanks). During the event, Hoggins sees a critic who panned his work and throws him off the balcony. While he is sent to jail for his actions, his book begins flying off the shelves resulting in a financial windfall for Cavendish. Members of the Hoggins family wish to take the proceeds Cavendish is receiving from the sales as a result of Dermot signing away his rights to them before going to jail. Cavendish goes on the run and his brother Denholme (played by Hugh Grant who, like the others, played roles of varied significance in the previous stories) sends him to an establishment that he mistakes for a hotel but that is, in fact, a secure home for the elderly. Rather than capitulate, Cavendish plots his escape with help from other unhappy residents, one of whom only says two words over and over during the planning of the escape and the escape itself.<br/><br/>There are two more story lines which, together, span a time of two-hundred nine years into the future. Rather than describe them both, I'll simply conclude here with my thoughts on the film as a whole. Cloud Atlas, while not as brilliant as the hype made it out to be, is a great film. Hanks and company play all of their roles expertly. And though the connective tissue between them strains credulity at times, they each leave the viewer with a sense of hope and optimism that, in the end, things will work out somehow. That's not a large part of my particular worldview, but it's beautifully depicted and highly entertaining, nonetheless. See it."

","Having read the book before watching the movie, I must say that I am quite impressed at the job the directors did in putting this together.

I would recommend the book to anyone who likes to read. The first chapter is a challenge, but it become immensely readable, and highly enjoyable as it goes on. <br/><br/>I also hope that the directors will release a DVD/BR with the movie re- cut to match the structure in the book in the extras.

","""Cloud Atlas"" is jaw-droppingly, awe-inspiringly, eye-poppingly stunning in every way. I could leave it at that, for no review, article, essay or book could do a description of this movie justice (except, of course, for David Mitchell's original novel upon which the film is based. But even then, only maybe). What directors Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski, and Lana Wachowski have accomplished here is a film that is felt deeply, a film that is an experience through everything that makes us human, the good and the bad. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Hugh Grant, and many more play multiple roles across many ages of time. Their characters' actions cause ripples in the pond of endless existence. A curious birthmark, a common theme, and an unstoppable force of masterful pacing are all that seem to connect their stories at first glance. But the magic the filmmakers have accomplished occurs on deeper levels, within us, the audience. ""Cloud Atlas"" adds to you. It becomes a part of you. Let the film wash over you and inspire you to greatness. Who knows how your actions of today could affect someone generations from now. This film boldly visualizes that notion in an Oscar-worthy tale that is among the year's best. See it! Because if ever a film could boast that it ""has it all"", it is ""Cloud Atlas"".<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"
"ayoitselaine","7","1","4","10 November 2012"," Moments of amazement and moments of ""just why.""
","This movie... has both very well and horribly written scripts. I know it wasn't supposed to have a obvious and clear storyline to it, but I feel as if the film focused more having bold scenery rather than trying to pull all the pieces together.<br/><br/>The bold scenes were certainly successful in grabbing a hold of the audience and extracting powerful emotions, but frankly, some other scenes were just outright stupid (or should I say, tacky) and/or very predictable. Some 'lives' portrayed in the film (as well as some other scenes) were unnecessary and felt like fillers, as if the director tried to add more content to just for the sake of adding more content. You know, when some movies throw only so much information to stimulate the viewer, but it's to the point that you can only pick out what's actually important and what's not?<br/><br/>The script is of the same comparison; it has some memorable conversations and quotes, but at the same, some decisions were of very poor judgement. Like changing English to an altered and a more broken language. For example, at one point of the film, the word ""truth"" is actually ""true-true"" (If you want to know what I mean just watch or ask someone who has ...). This creates confusing gibberish that forces the viewer to rely pretty much only on the visuals to understand what's going on. And might I add that some phrases (spoken in true English) that were said seemed too hackneyed for it to be in such a complex and potentially great film.<br/><br/>I have very mixed feelings about Cloud Atlas, both good and bad but frankly, I was pretty disappointed overall. My more accurate number review is about a 6.5, but 6 seemed a bit too low of a review as it wasn't THAT bad, but it certainly doesn't really earn the rating of a 7 either."

"SimonJack","4","1","5","19 March 2018"," Too much crammed into three hours
","This film is nearly three hours long. It bounces back and forth between half a dozen different milieus in as many different plots. And, those are back and forth between past and future generations. The milieu are Hawaii, London, San Francisco, Seoul, the high seas, a place on another plant in our galaxy, and various other places around the globe at different times. If it sounds confusing, well, that's because it is. <br/><br/>I doubt that anyone who sat in a theater and saw this film when it came out, immediately afterwards could write down the different scenarios, varying periods of time for each, and who the main characters were of each plot. My guess is that few people could even list half of the plots, characters and time frames. <br/><br/>As for messages, this is a very hodgepodge of mores and morals covering family, creativity, sexuality, freedom, oppression, love, a type of pagan faith, and more. Numerous social issues are included in the movie. Among them are murder and mayhem, corruption and killing, stealing and betrayal, lying and cheating, fantasy and sci-fi, oppression and revolution, slavery and racism, tyranny and torture, fame and fortune, pride and power, music and creativity, superstition and mythology.<br/><br/>Seven actors appear as six different characters in the various scenarios and time periods. They include Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent. Another dozen actors have three to five roles. Several more have two roles. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to set a record for a film with multiple roles. They probably succeeded in that.<br/><br/>My guess is that the high rating many people give this film is solely for its entertainment in the plethora of scenes, settings, period costumes, and makeup. That and some imaginative camera work and lots of special effects. If those things are one's idea of entertainment, then ""Cloud Atlas"" is a winner. But it wasn't a smash hit at the box office. <br/><br/>I prefer good stories that I can relate to someone after seeing a movie, with specifics. No one without a photographic memory would be able to do so after watching this film. The various film genres in this movie are mind numbing. There's no comedy, sports or Western, but it has about everything else. Drama, mystery, murder, action, war, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, romance - all are here in ""Cloud Atlas."" <br/><br/>Outside of the music, which received widespread praise, reviews of the film varied. It received a standing ovation for its premier at the Toronto Film Festival, but it wasn't otherwise widely lauded. The movie finally topped its $128.5-million budget with worldwide release that netted a total box office of $130.5 million. <br/><br/>The movie was based on a 2004 novel by English author David Mitchell. Mitchell said that he doubted a movie could be made of his book. Well, a movie was made. But my guess is that readers of the book would have far more recall and memory about the stories. After all, who could expect an audience to remember much of a 500-page book, with multiple plots, time frames and characters, crammed into a movie of just under three hours?"

This such a case. Two hours and forty-five minutes? There is a reason why ninety minutes is good, so if you want or need to make a longer movie come up with a better, tighter structure then casting actors in different historical time frames.<br/><br/>If you obviously reference Blade Runner please come up with a novel idea about a future city don't rehash the futuristic-Japanish cityscape, but make for example a Russian-themed city.<br/><br/>If you have followed the last decade's history or so one can see Russia clawing back and they will survive and most probably win in some way.

","Was not impressed. Let me first iterate that I do not watch movies in order to attempt to puzzle together obscure clues nay, not even clues, items of information, to rationalize the movie as a whole. There are what, 6 different story lines? And I do admit, each is moderately interesting in nature and each could make for a moderately acceptable movie, but to mash them all together and toss in minute details to ""link"" them together truly creates one big horrendous monstrosity. When making a movie of this type the separate stories must end up being linked in a clever way, one the watcher did not expect but still one that makes sense to all the aspects of the movie. Cloud Atlas did not have such links, the connections were poorly constructed, easy to miss, and did not connect the stories very well. 6 OK stories on their own, but totally botched in putting them together leaving the viewer disorientated, confused and, most importantly, removed from the movie.<br/><br/>On another note. constantly during watching I was confused, not by the plot, but by how I was supposed to be reacting the situations presented to me. This feeling totally removed me from the movie to the point where I did not care about any of the characters anymore. I kept moving the mouse in order to see how much time was left before I could shut the dang thing off and go to sleep (I strongly believe in finishing a movie, no matter how terrible)."

I doubled check the program to see why on my TV said ""Cloud Atlas"" but instead they were running a comedy.

Unfortunately the horrid makeup and horrible wigs were all over the movie making it so unreal, so grotesque that was funny sometimes. The scene with Sarandon wearing a huge nose ""a la Groucho Marx"" was like a bad Halloween party from a B movie.

Elephant! Hooray! This movie has dots galore. I wasn't connecting the dots, or if I was connecting the dots it was turning out to be a dream-catcher, not a movie. I did get that it was a series or parallel of stories and I was able to ""care"" about several of the stories as they hopped and skipped about, but it wasn't going to mold itself into the science fiction time travel movie I had suspected in the beginning.<br/><br/>Maybe if I watched it a few times or if it had closed captions I would have liked it more. I'm still pretty sure it was like movies that start in the middle, go to the end, and end with the beginning. But this movie was juggling several stories at once while doing that jumble the plot thing. I think. Probably why some people raved about the movie as genius. I'll be calling BS on that one.<br/><br/>There was one part where I had a ""moment"" that I really enjoyed. Others probably not. It was where one of Hank's ""native"" characters was talking gibberish to an anthropologist (I think). I think that because the ""advanced"" person slipped in and out of talking ""normal"" and talking gibberish when addressing Hank's character. What sort of surprised me is I cogged the gibberish.

The fourth and fifth stories are my favorites, because the fourth one is good comedy relief and the fifth one is good science fiction, but 2/6th of a good movie is a pretty bad movie.<br/><br/>The movie is written by the Wachowski siblings, and has all the strengths and weaknesses of their Matrix movies, some good science fiction and a lot of mushy sentimentality that boils down to the phrase ""Why can't we all get along?"" Cloud Atlas was a book, so I will blame some of the shortcomings of the movie on the book, but since I never read the book, I don't know where the book goes off the rails. And three hours is too damn long for any movie.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but not by the big stars, Hanks and Berry just embarrass themselves trying different accents and hiding behind prosthetic make-up. Broadbent, Ben Wishaw, and James D'Arcy are very good. Doona Bae is a revelation, until she tries to play a Mexican woman in the 70's, then she embarrasses herself. Similarly, Wishaw and Darcy embarrass themselves playing Koreans, it is cringewothy. Hugo Weaving is great, but he is always great.<br/><br/>There is nudity and violence, so keep the kids away, and maybe Cloud Atlas will put the adults to sleep."

","Presented in large numbers of fragments which viewers are left to connect all by themselves, Cloud Atlas is without a doubt a very thoughtful, highly ambitious & deeply philosophical project from Tom Tykwer (director of Run Lola Run) & Wachowski Brothers (the creators of The Matrix Trilogy) but there's also no denying that it is way too overlong, very complex & not as immersive as was expected from it.<br/><br/>The movie features a complex, non-chronological plot structure that is narrated in fragmented segments, is supported by terrific visuals, dazzling cinematography, good performances, stunning make-up & amazing soundtrack and also covers many themes n elements of love, loss, betrayal, trust & spirituality throughout its runtime. But on an overall scale, this flick is a thought-provoking work that is destined to polarise its viewers.<br/><br/>As for me, Cloud Atlas had the scope to be one of the finest sci-fi films of recent years but it simply fails to hold up due to its sheer size & unnecessarily added complications to an already complex plot. Maybe another viewing in the future might change my opinion about it by some degree but for now, this sci-fi drama remains a major disappointment. Multiple viewings advised."

"crownofsprats","1","1","5","17 September 2013"," Contrived in every possible way
","So the book is already kind of hokey and, to quote my friend, ""contrived."" He was not at all enjoying the slog until he got to the part with the Replicants, and the futuristic world of Neo-Seoul. He thought it would be cool to see that in a movie so..here I am, letting you know not to waste 3 hours.<br/><br/>There is a way to connect themes and story lines into a coherent whole, and to make a point without being maudlin or blatant about it, and most importantly, without sacrificing cinematic entertainment value. This film fails at all that. Also, Tom Hanks is downright embarrassing to watch half the time.<br/><br/>The primary fault lies in the Wachowski script, which seems to have the attention span and the fixations of a media-addicted and intellectually-arrogant nine year old. I would wager that sometime in the last half a century or so, human beings lost an objectively- measurable amount of patience, and measuring the average time between camera cuts and scene changes in each major Hollywood production across the decades will show a steady decrease in the average. Like a catatonic remote clicker with only six channels to choose from, the film switches between its six narratives at an irritatingly rapid rate, never letting any of them breathe or be elaborated upon. The movie is almost three hours long, and I doubt there's a scene longer than five minutes in the entire thing. This may not be all that important in the slave-era narrative, which involves basic motives, requires little setup, and is mostly confined to a ship. But the world of Neo-Seoul is rich with great cinematic opportunity and plot detail, largely missed or discarded in favor of sleek and expensive CGI action sequences (presumably by the script-writers themselves, although one can only guess at the real number of human brains involved in polishing a script these days).<br/><br/>Clearly, the script itself has no patience for the atmosphere, leaving that job to the set designers, the CGI wizards, and Tykwer, who does his best to imbue this turgid wreck with some flair and confidence, and even manages to get some decent performances out of the other cast. (And sure, if I was watching Tom Hanks on screen at any point and didn't realize it, I would consider that a job well done for Tykwer.) So what does the film care about?<br/><br/>Well, for one, it's way into the Grand Theme of the novel, which is basically that the same story of actions and consequences is told over and over throughout time in different ways, and that Everything Is Connected. The deepest it ever gets is hinting at shared memory, karmic forces, and the endless historical cycle of stagnation and renewal, but because of the rapid pace, this is gloss at best. For the most part, endless voice-over passages are devoted to telling us that, yes, interconnectedness is precisely what's happening here, and whenever possible, the stories intercut between what amounts to the same thing happening in all of them (there's a Capture, here's a Capture - there's a Friendly Hand, here's a Friendly Hand!). If that doesn't sound kind of contrived to you, especially if I tell you how neatly it's all wrapped up and presented, then you will probably be into this. <br/><br/>Have I mentioned how contrived this was yet? Like, that all the main characters have these special comet-shaped birthmarks? ""That mark...I've seen it before somewhere.."" Paraphrasing actual dialogue there. Or the incessant meta-by-the-numbers moments when a character says ""someone should write a book about this"" or some variation thereof? Or that one of the (longer) scenes involves a futuristic escape with a narrow foldout drawbridge precariously slung over the depths of Neo Seoul with a harpoon, host to a high-wire gun-fu ballet as it is slowly being torn to shreds by large-caliber machine gun fire from attack aircraft? That's not in the book, by the way (on the other hand, you would have gotten mutants!), and neither are most of the other action scenes - a notable exception is an endearing moment when a retirement home employee gets his tooth knocked out into a beer at a Scottish pub brawl.<br/><br/>Is it a mere necessity - a consideration for the average moviegoer's attention span and general inability to follow complex, multiple threads without constant reinforcement? Or is such an already-contrived and over-hyped book a magnet begging for egoed hacks like the Wachowskis to make it worse? In any case, the best part was when the cat clawed the naked guy's crotch and he fell out of a window. And despite certain obvious sci-fi gimmicks, the fast food joints of Neo Seoul with their brightly-colored 3d-printed food and Soap-eating Replicant clones in revealing uniforms were neat, kind of like stopping at a Froyo franchise in the Fifth Element..."

I do know it's about how the life of one person affects others throughout time, but after that I don't know what to say. I'm sure many will figure it out and think I'm dumb for not catching on though. As far as what I thought about it...to me there was just too much of everything. The movie is basically little vignettes of characters that are supposedly connected to the others but it jumps around so much its hard to follow. Most movies like this have one main plot line they follow and branch off of that...this one just put them all together and I had a hard time following. The other big distraction was the make-up. I do like the way they had the same actors in each section to show their point but the whole time I was thinking...I think that's Hugh Grant, or is that Agent Smith? It seemed to take me out of the movie. It may seem like I'm bashing this movie but the truth is I couldn't follow it enough to form a real opinion. I will admit that by the end I thought I was following it a little better but this is one I am not smart enough for.

I could see some potential. The reality was disappointment after disappointment.<br/><br/>I found the plot to be confusing and hard to follow, filled with meaningless crap. There were vague, implied connections with other parts of the story, but a lot of it was wasted screen time. Maybe it would help if you've read the book, which I haven't.<br/><br/>There were a couple of good (too short) action scenes, which is the only reason I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of 1.<br/><br/>The acting was flat and uninspired. Lots of makeup, some wonderful sets, photography, colors. But no real story. I didn't care for or even like nearly all of the characters. The only exceptions were Doona Bae as Sonmi (partly because she's so gorgeous), and Keith David as Kupaka (a slave). Hugo Weaving was totally lost and wasted. Hanks and Berry were pretentious and annoying.<br/><br/>When a movie is really good, like a good book, you never want it to end. When this movie was half over, I still couldn't figure out where it was going, and couldn't wait for it to be over -- a bad sign, since it's nearly 3 hrs long.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, but this film feels like one where the big-name, high-priced actors insisted on writing or re-writing a bunch of their own lines, thinking that they know more than the writers and directors. Whatever it was, something went terribly wrong. This was one of the worst films I've seen in a long time."

","Cloud Atlas (2012) <br/><br/>Reviewed February 6, 2014 after 1st viewing (Free HBO HD) - Warner Bros (boo) – Directed by: Tom Tykwer, Andy & Lana Wachowski<br/><br/>Jumbled conglomeration of The Matrix intertwined with Amistad and Apocalypto that piggybacks on abolition to succeed in driving its message home<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start I will preface this by saying that I am an open-minded, intelligent, empathetic person who generally enjoys films of this genre. That being said, I spent the first half of this movie just trying to separate the plot lines and characters. The incoherent pacing jumped story lines so much, the use of the same actors for each made it all the more confusing. The undesired effect was to distance the audience from the characters to such a degree that you felt little if anything for their plights. The score tries so hard to draw you in and evoke emotion, but I had stopped caring at the halfway mark.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography were great but altogether not that astounding. The make- up and prosthetics were divisive and distracting to say the least. Alas, the Neo/Trinity parody was so obvious, by the time abolition and genocide enters the picture and you're just starting to feel something for the characters, you're too distracted by the blatant use of elements from other successful films. To me, it was nothing more than a collage of other movies, which is clearly more on the screenwriter's and director's side, being that this is based on a book and had every opportunity to hold its own. This film is so complex and convoluted it actually makes The Matrix read like Green Eggs and Ham.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are so many plot elements and dialog that does not make sense. We're supposed to believe the Prussian (Halle Berry) is a higher being, but her accent is Southern?! That was easily the *most* distracting element of the story. By the end, I still didn't understand how each part intertwined to make a whole. This is a classic example of too many hands in the pot, with the multiple writers, directors, production companies— Incoherent and incredibly frustrating.<br/><br/>Believe me, I went in wanting to like this movie, especially with some of my favorite actors and minds behind it, but I can't help but find it to be an epic fail. In three, long, excruciating hours, it fails to establish interest or connection with the audience, and in my opinion, if you can't manage these simple elements, none of the rest of the piece matters.<br/><br/>5.0 out of 10.0"

","Before I watched this movie I was very excited. I thought it would be allot better than it was. I thought it was too long. They tried too hard to make it mysterious. After watching the movie I felt nothing. I was expecting to be mesmerized, but instead I was disappointed. It seemed to me like the writers had tried too hard to make it seem mysterious. The overall effect backfired in my opinion. It looks as though they didn't know what they were doing or possibly wrote the script in one day. I suppose with better writers, or writing, it could have been a major hit. Another thing I had a problem with was the character makeup that was used to make them look different. To me it made them look ridiculous. I thought the facial features were over dramatized and looked completely goofy. In turn this made it look unbelievable and was yet another flaw. I decided to watch this movie again to see if I liked it better the second time around, but again I was disappointed. I usually love science fiction movies especially high budget movies like this one. I tried to enjoy the computer graphics and special effects, but the second time around I couldn't finish the movie. I thought this movie was indeed what the title suggests. Cloud Atlas. It was a cloudy view of a world that doesn't make sense. To some people I can see how they can imagine this to be a profound and life-changing story, but I would say the views of that person clearly are unintelligent or need to watch better movies. If you do watch this movie be prepared because it's long and may be confusing for some viewers. I would not recommend this to most people, especially young kids. I would have to give this 4.5 out of 10."
"siderite","8","1","6","2 March 2013"," Bound to polarize
","Like Matrix before it, Cloud Atlas is bound to turn people into either lovers or into haters. After all, it is a movie with a great cast, fantastic special effects and a complex story; in fact so complex that at first, when the movie ends, you feel like there is a lot you have missed, that the movie should have made you understand something, but you couldn't. And, just like Matrix before it, it is just a feeling it creates, not the truth. As I see it, the truth is that the story was not complex at all, it just seemed like it, as was the moral of the story, which was not something Earth shattering, just a vision of humanity's interconnectivity.<br/><br/>The appearance of complexity comes from all the effort that was obviously put into the film. Would it make any sense to tell a simple story in a complicated way and invest to much money into it that it becomes one of the most expensive movies of all times? Yes, it certainly makes sense, because you don't go to the cinema unless the marketing convinces you it is something great and then it is simple enough so you don't feel an idiot for not comprehending it. The skill is in making you feel like you watched something intelligent and yet you understood it easily.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the film is a great realization compared to most other movies around now. A great cast and fantastic effects skillfully complement an intelligent story, told right. However, even if it is definitely worth watching, do not expect the film to be anything that it isn't. After all, its purpose is to make you buy the ticket, not teach you anything new and the moral of the story that our souls are inextricably connected isn't more profound than when you heard it any other place (and there are plenty of those to choose from). A pretty cool film, however, even if it leaves you with that ""is that it?"" feeling when it ends."

","For those who expects another epic like Matrix, this may be a disappointment. But this doesn't change the fact that Cloud Atlas is a great film. Six different stories are told throughout the movie which at the end come together to manifest the message.<br/><br/>Art direction, costume design and production design are great. For acting, I can't think of a word that would describe it to you. All actors and actresses are brilliant. I only felt the Korean actress playing Somni was a bit flawed but the rest did great. Especially Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving and Jim Broadbent. All six stories have different tones but still the movie works fine and audience never feels any disconnection between the stories. The characters are very realistically portrayed and you really feel for them. You laugh when they laugh, you cry when they cry.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie is the make-up. Koreans are so annoyed that they call this movie racist. They are right at some point because white actors who are made Koreans have only slant eyes as make up and the whole East-Asia skull and face structure are ignored. The delivery of the message is also lame at some parts. There were moments when I felt the delivery was very childish. First story can be considered very cliché. But the rest are really good, especially the one that takes place in todays world, the one with Jim Broadbent in the lead. Music is fine as well but felt a bit minimalistic. You will probably not remember anything from films soundtrack after you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to you. Wachowkis are probably the most passionate directors alive today. I also send regards to Tom Tykwer."

","Hi guys, I watched the movie yesterday with the only knowledge that it was produced by Waschowski brothers and nothing else so I was not so much prejudiced.<br/><br/>The film, in my opinion, was a bit too long to describe the main topic of what the whole thing is about. It takes some time to realize that the lives of different persons living in different times and places (or planets) are connected somehow. After you realize this, you keep looking for something new. But nothing else happens. And in the end it terminates with the classical conflict between status quo and rebellions.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the music was very similar to the one in ""Polar Express"" which I watched more than 5 times.<br/><br/>Sorry guys but I gave 6/10.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","7","29 October 2012"," The kind of grand film going experience that lingers in your mind
","Cloud Atlas is the kind of grand film going experience that lingers in your mind. Once you've see it, then you sit back and replay it in your head trying to piece it all together. In piecing it together again, you discover things that you didn't catch while watching it. That makes you want to see it again just to check your math. What is so wonderful about the film is that it is deliriously entertaining even when you don't completely understand what is happening at all times.<br/><br/>Like Metropolis or Star Wars or 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is a grand and visionary science fiction experience, a movie with wonderful sights, wonderful characters, wonderful technology and great drama, but wisely never loses sight of the human element. This is a movie that is about a lot of things but the thread running through the center is that no matter what happens to us as human beings we are always linked by the map of the human heart. That is what the best science fiction has always been about.<br/><br/>The story is told in six different episodes which take place at various time periods from 1849 to 1931 to 1973 to 2012 to 2144 and the then post-apocalyptic future of 2341. All of the stories connect in one way or another, and the actors – Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess – play different characters of different nationalities, races and genders in each episode (this film will win the Oscar for make-up next spring). The fun is trying to figure out which actor is currently buried under the make-up. The performances are key and we admire how hard each actor has to work playing eight or nine different people.<br/><br/>In each episode, we meet a variety of people who are facing one form of repression or another. The hero of the 1931 chapter named Robert (Jim Sturgess), for example, is a homosexual musician whose composer employer (Jim Broadbent) holds him hostage with this information to keep him from leaving. The hero of the 2144 chapter named Sonmi-351 (Doona Bae) is a ""fabricant"", a fabricated human who was genetically designed to be a hotel servant, until she begins to learn on her own (what she discovers about humanity makes Soylent Green look quaint). The hero of the 2012 chapter, named Tom Cavendish (Broadbent again) is being held against his will in an old folks home by this conniving brother (Hugh Grant), and engineers the clumsiest escape in movie history. In the end, these stories come together, but the film doesn't make everything so clear cut that we aren't left with something to think about. This is one film that demands to be discussed when it is over.<br/><br/>In the book by David Mitchell the story was told chronologically, but that would have made the movie boring. Instead, we hop back and forth between each story so that we can follow them evenly as they progress. The creative editing doesn't confuse us but evens the tension in each section. Along the way we are treated to some breathtaking sights. The 2144 section for example has the same kinds of cityscapes that are reminders of Blade Runner. The 2341 section takes place in the distant future in which man has reverted back to his tribal nature and speaks in a dialect that is somewhere between Cajun and Gungan. What is amazing is that each chapter adds something to the next so that we see the stories coming together.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas was directed by three talented film artists. One is Tom Tykwer, a German director whose films, like the great Run Lola Run always have a visual fire. The other two are The Wachowskis who have been responsible for The Matrix trilogy and have outdone themselves here. They take a story that could be disastrously confusing and put it together in a way that holds our attention at every single moment. Their story breaks free of the confines of simple-minded narrative storytelling and sets itself free to tell a story that explores the boundaries – for better or worse – of the human experience. They have created a story about human relationships all through history. The story is about the people we meet and the choices we make and how they can affect the future of mankind. Here is a movie with a lot of violence and human repression but ultimately turns out to be one of the most positive and hopeful science fiction films ever made."

","""Cloud Atlas"", despite its secondarity (reviews nodding to ""The Fountain""), New Age filling (profane doctrine of karma and reincarnation, shamanism, eclectic mixture of religious stamps, Gnosticism, and so on.) and disparity of the story lines, quite suddenly drew my attention. What makes this movie interesting? Its partly Mighty Hollywood level plot, with confrontations, special effects and a happy ending in spite of all odds. But this alone is not enough - any average Hollywood product is full of such stuff.<br/><br/>In my opinion, bias adds the ""nerve"" to ""Cloud Atlas"". In fact, to whom if not to himself Larry Wachowski once asked the question sounded at the beginning of the movie ""if God created the world, how do we know what things we can change, and what things must remain sacred and inviolable?"", while trying to become Lana Wachowski? Did he asked himself, ""Do I have a right to change my nature and become a woman""?<br/><br/>Well, if you have a passionate desire to do something, rationalization comes into battle designed to justify any passion. What do main villains in ""Cloud Atlas"" say? ""There's a natural order to this world. And the truth is this order must be protected"". So God, who created the world and natural order of things is also a villain. If Creator is bad (as, for example, the creators of the ""fabricants""), you just need to break his rules.<br/><br/>""All boundaries are conventions, waiting to be transcended"" - this ""great discovery"" reveals to us positive heroes of ""Cloud Atlas"". ""Voila!"" - Larry exclaims - ""my desire is not only justified, but noble - almost like Solzhenitsyn battle against totalitarianism"" - and he becomes Lana.<br/><br/>Still, an amazing tool, the human mind - with a strong desire it can introduce to you the blackest darkness as the brightest light, and any lie as truth. Of course, this will only happen in your solipsistic consciousness and, in extreme forms, will lead to mental illness - but who cares if you really really want?<br/><br/>To what in the end mankind and main characters come? They dirtied the Earth and flew to foul a new planet, to reborn again and again for a mindless rebellion.<br/><br/>In general, ""Cloud Atlas,"" is quite dull, if not primitive movie, but I must pay tribute - it may be quite fascinating for the general public because of its seductive Gnostic pathos, behind which lies a personal tragedy and a personal search of a man who is lost in the darkness and wants present it as a light.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

There's no big idea, no great revelation, no twist. It's simply just another B-class sci-fi, nothing more. I was really disappointed at the end, but let my emotions settle, still after two days I feel the same. Nothing could save this weak story, nor famous actors, nor famous directors.

","A raindrop. Manifesting its elliptical shape at the edge of its existence. Building up water, the stream of life to which fauna and flora live by. Its heavy weight causing the drop to depart from the material that transpired it. Some drops smash onto the dry ground, absorbing its essence. Forgotten. Others collide with bodies of water, producing a profound rippling effect that contributes to the volumetric space of its whole. ""No matter what you do it will never amount to anything but a single drop in a limitless ocean"", highlighting the insignificance of one mere contribution to a greater action. ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops"". Mitchell's original novel, complexities and all, describes it himself as a ""pointillist mosaic"". Carefully arranged dots or fragments orchestrated to comprise a monumental piece.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is the same conceptual thinking through a literary method. Minuscule lives can impact one another across time itself. Past, present and future. An antagonistic killer moulded into a heroic saviour through reincarnation, where one single action can ripple across infinity to inspire a revolution for the masses. An American lawyer documenting his parasitical journey across the Pacific in 1849, only to be read by an aspiring English composer in 1936 whom composes his own masterpiece, that is then tracked down in 1973 by a journalist whom exposes a conspiracy to create a nuclear catastrophe during an energy crisis, to which is then written into a manuscript and read by an ageing publisher whom accidentally commits himself to a nursing home and attempts to flee in 2012, a scenario that is produced as a film and quoted by human clones in 2144 which inspires a revolution against a dystopian authority, cementing a ""fabricant"" as a deity in 2321 in which her recorded testimony now acts as sacred text for tribespeople. And, breathe...!<br/><br/>The Wachowskis and Tykwer attempt to adapt, what many consider is, an ""unfilmable"" book. A novel so rich in thematic depth, narrative complexity and imaginative tonalities that it could not possibly function as a cohesive feature. Yet, here we are. Independently funded, four years of development and arguably the most ambitious sci-fi extravaganza ever committed to celluloid. It's an impossibly astonishing product that is equally flawed as it is beautiful. An orchestration of meticulous narrative manipulation that just cannot be comprehended in an initial or subsequent viewing. Its composition consists of six short stories, harnessing differing tones, characters and worlds. Each piece works as a functional strand of dramatic storytelling. But, insert Berner's near-impossible task of editing these stories to create one three-hour behemoth of totality, and Cloud Atlas becomes a mesmerising beast entirely. It categorically should not work.<br/><br/>'The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish' and 'An Orison of Sonmi-451' tonally are undeniably different, more often than not clashing with each other to create an inconsistent pace. A light comedy escapade interwoven with a sci-fi revolutionary blockbuster, sprinkled with a blaxploitation plot and a period drama across the sea. For the initial thirty minutes, these changes in style and genres fail to resonate, as The Wachowskis attempt to introduce each story whilst interlinking then together. However, Berner somehow manages to join the narrative beats of each story and merge them as one feature. The more thrilling aspects of the various stories, including Sonmi-451 escaping her fast food imprisonment and a stow away Moriori slave proving his worth as a potential crew member, are associated together. Indicating that each tale, more often than not, follow the same narrative beats and can therefore be connected together to produce an overarching feature that does not juxtapose its own tones. It's sheer lunacy! To comprehend such a task, finalise its contents and create a cohesive product, well, it's masterful. It really is! The Wachowskis' solid direction throughout, even if some stories had far more screen time than others, meant that the thematic presence of reincarnation was maintained constantly.<br/><br/>What assisted with this, was the recasting of the same actors in various characters. Grant started off as a reverend and finished his timeline as a savage cannibal. Hanks from a parasitical doctor to a conflicted tribesman, wobbly Irish-pirate accents and all. Berry, Weaving, Sturgess and Whishaw, to name a few, all undergoing substantial transformations to materialise the continuity of souls. Undergoing astounding makeup and costume design, forcing viewers to double take when a man would portray a female character and vice versa. The only questionable decision, was the application of eye makeup during the Neo Seoul segment, transforming white actors to become Korean characters. Personally wasn't needed, as the Unionists could've been multicultural and then devoid the controversy immediately. The decision was understandable and integral to the story, yet exerts an ethnical question mark. The other qualm, despite the overbearing tonal changes, was the dialogue in the 'Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'ryrhin' After' chapter. Extremely difficult to translate given the almost Shakespearean style and muffled grumbling, so activating subtitles is advised.<br/><br/>Regardless, Cloud Atlas is a film with plenty of film. Six if you want to be precise. An intricate orchestration of various compositions that symbolise the impact of even the most insignificant of actions, rippling across time and space to produce something greater. It's an anomaly. An impossible feature that is just as compelling as it is tonally flawed. Yet, in an age where franchises control Hollywood, isn't it about time we supported a film with as much ambition as Cloud Atlas? For that reason alone, it gets my full support. Much like the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", beautifully composed like the rest of the score, it eternally haunts me. Pushing me into performing small acts of kindness that can affect the lives of others in the future."

And a person who gets a scar or mark in the future, will have that mark show up in the past as a birthmark. Clearly this film goes way beyond any simplistic idea of reincarnation and makes it into a cult doctrine.<br/><br/>There are 6 separate tales, although the film seems to concentrate on the two future stories. ""Souls"" are connected by generally having the same people play different parts, or by connecting them through aforesaid mark. The beginning of the film was confusing as it presents the ending of the various lives.<br/><br/>The lives of these people are not simple. They are filled with trauma, killing, and intrigue. Scenes are connected by showing people doing similar things in different life times such as passing through a door, i.e. the so called ""smart"" and ""clever"" aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Rather than asks questions about truth and free will, the movie gives you David Mitchell's answers, which you may or may not agree with. For those who believe in some universal bond that links lives past and present to the seemingly inane point that things that will happen in the future will effect the past, you should enjoy this film for a full 5 stars.

Also, with so many characters I easily forget about some of them and what they were up to, with the jumping backwards of forwards between stories and timelines. It is an interesting concept, though, but a heck of a lot to digest. The actors does a brilliant job, especially Tom Hanks. The make-up and visual effects are incredible, the music awesome. I loved how the individual stories ended, although I must admit I did not see the one impacting the other, apart from the fact all the stories had the same theme: cry for freedom.<br/><br/>As the film contains so many genres, it really is difficult categorizing it.

The hard part about reviewing this movie is that I don't think this can have a normal, fair review. This is a very long movie. It has a run-time of just under 3 hours, but it feels like it's 4 hours. I think this directly correlates with the problems in tone. The movie tells multiple stories, ones that span across centuries. The movie just has a hard time, keeping a solid tone. From one second you will go from a gunfight or an ax battle, then to a a character ascending to some kind of spiritual order. Honestly though the biggest problem in the messages the movie wants to give are of many, but the main point simply does not carry too much weight.

","In general films released today follow a broad structure of three acts, with the setup, the obstacle and the resolution. There are some films however that bend and manipulate this structure and try and create something more fluid. Then there are films that are pure and utter madness. A chaos of ideas and themes that distinctly do not follow the classical structure. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, Cloud Atlas is a sprawling epic, historical, science fiction film that covers six distinct time periods from early settlers in the United States to a post-apocalyptic savage land after the 'fall of humanity' and it's quite unlike almost any other film around.<br/><br/>To say that Cloud Atlas gets confusing would be an understatement. Directors Tom Tykwer, Lana and Andy Wachowski have suggested that artistic expression is meant to be confusing and boundary-pushing and they've certainly put their money where their mouths are here. The narrative sweeps along tying characters and their actors together by shared roles and themes, investigating fate, history, love and progression.<br/><br/>The film itself was never destined to be popular. When David Mitchell published a novel featuring six different stories set in six different time periods, nested one inside the other like Russian dolls, Hollywood said an adaptation was impossible. When the Wachowski Siblings bought the rights to the book, studios were still doubtful. Even after the film had been financed, investors backed out left and right. Nobody but the filmmakers seemed to believe that audiences could handle a movie this big.<br/><br/>Although, despite the haste, I adore Cloud Atlas. It's huge, smart, ambitious, profound—everything a Hollywood film ought to be. And I'm not alone in saying so. The movie received a ten-minute standing ovation at its premiere at most Film Festivals—a sign that the filmmakers had created something very special. Only later did the negative buzz begin. But those movie-goers who enjoyed Cloud Atlas didn't just like it—they loved it, passionately. Some have even called this film a masterpiece. So who's right?"

","This film is larger than life. It's highly admirable for its ambition and scope. Unfortunately, the execution of its concept is flawed and lofty. Too often it fails to make sense of its own concept, often winding into disjointed and nonsensical territory. There are a few moments of genuinely great filmmaking and storytelling, but those moments unfortunately get caught up in the rest of the grand mess. Nevertheless, a unique film."

And this movie was a good attempt on that part.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the set pieces, acting, and script. The plot can get muddled, but once the one hour and thirty minute mark kicks in(yes, a long movie) that other hour and thirty minutes is what makes up for the dragging pace.

","I've just realised why this film was so bad, the Wachowski brothers got their hands on an incredible story and over-edited it. I loved the book, the way it changes from one time in history to the next each chapter and you slowly realise that each character is linked to the last; this is what makes it so compelling. Instead the Wachowskis gave away the central plot within the first 10 minutes. <br/><br/>The film is cast and shot well but whoever edited this should have been fired, the nonstop quick cuts from one time to the next make this film barely watchable. I am seriously considering re-editing this myself so it follows the book because then it actually might be a half-decent movie."

","The truth is I actually liked some of the stories of this film and for the most part it was good and visually beautiful. And yet in the end Cloud Atlas is like a fruit that looks gorgeous and juicy from the outside but that you cut open only to reveal green rot inside.<br/><br/>The film was utterly ruined by its need to deliver The Message and its anti-religious preaching. Its plot is a thinly disguised vehicle for political propaganda. It is just impossible to enjoy a movie when you are repeatedly being slapped in the face.<br/><br/>Leaving that aside, with all its bitter aftertaste, I can still see how it could be justly liked by those already part of the choir. Its many stories are well intertwined and come together nicely, even if you have no idea to what exactly.<br/><br/>There lies possibly the movie's biggest fault is that as you ask yourself in the end – what was the point – and you come away with nothing. The film is a plot built around inspirational quotes that sound deep until you actually stop to think about them for a second.<br/><br/>Overall Cloud Atlas is a well made film but, and I think the box office reflected this, it's not a film for everyone to enjoy."

","While ""Cloud Atlas"" is anything but a boring movie, the directors had bitten off a bit more than they were able to chew, and as such, certain perts of this grand tale became a bit too jumbled and at points it seemed like the directors just completely gave up. It was a bit too much with all the jumping around back and forth between story lines and between time periods.<br/><br/>The storyline was interesting, but it was shot in the foot by wanting to accomplish too much and becoming a bit strained and confusing along the way.<br/><br/>Visually then ""Cloud Atlas"" is spectacular and pure eye candy. The CGI was great and quite real, adding a very lifelike and believable atmosphere to the movie. And, for most parts, it was interesting to see the cast in all those different roles and characters. I say for most parts because when they turned the Caucasian cast into Koreans, it was just horrible to look at. They looked nothing like Koreans at all. They ended up looking like mutated burn victims. It was so bad to look at. And the same for turning the Asian into a Caucasian woman. It just looked too forced and unnatural. And this really kicked the movie on the shin and sent it down a notch.<br/><br/>The cast was just impressive, to say the least. They had some really talented performers in the movie, and they delivered well in each of their many roles.<br/><br/>It was a shame that the directors were tripping themselves with their over-ambitions and the God awful attempts of changing people's races, because ""Cloud Atlas"" was on the bring of being phenomenal.<br/><br/>An interesting story, aside from the horrible flaws, and ""Cloud Atlas"" is well-worth watching.

","Honestly, I don't love this film enough to write a review about it. But people around me are exclaiming and admiring this film like it's a great invention. Advertisements campaigned for this film by throwing out a slogan: ""Only those have an IQ beyond 160 can understand what it's saying."" So no one dare to spill half a criticism about the film. When coming out of the movie theater, every mouth eagerly showed off tints of understanding, desperate to prove that they are smart enough to interpret its content. Well Einstein has an IQ of 162, and he's basically the smartest guy on earth, so it's safe to say 99.99999% percent of population are too vulgar or dumb to understand this masterpiece. Why bother putting it on market in the first place?<br/><br/>That's what I indignantly thought after watching it the first time.<br/><br/>I watched it over 3 hours ago because I was attracted to James Darcy's gorgeous face. This time I take our my patience from the vault and watch the film squeezing it in my hand. Fortunately, I understood it 3 minutes before the screen blacked out. It was trying to taught us to do good and break the discriminations, because every good deeds we do penetrate to our afterlives. People are never, in true meaning, dead. As the explanations online articulate, the six lines of story are entangled with the birthmark and the form of religion, movie, diary, novel, letter and music. Most sensitive yet dramatic scenarios are presented, like the sailor being poisoned by his own doctor who craved for his wealth, like a gay composer being blackmailed by his renowned employer, like an oil company try to fail a nuclear-reaction experiment to keep the gold in its bowl, like an old abominable publisher being held custody against his will, like fabricants being fed with their own flesh and being murdered thinking they are going to the wonderland, like the girl you have a crush on spit on your religion.<br/><br/>When reflecting upon the relationships and logics, the emotional turmoils reach a sophisticated balance that tells the necessity of rebelling against granted believes. In this film everybody is in an equal position, every actor/actress is playing 6 incarnations in 6 different eras, and there are 3 directors. So there are no leading actors, no head for the film. According to the interview, the set is harmonious and merry. <br/><br/>I don't know why everybody keep claiming it epic, maybe because it blends so many genres together, many because it makes an impossible book into an Oscar-winning movie, maybe because the stellar cast is itself a major piece of news. But the only moment I reach the urge of crying is when Sonmi is up in the French Window, recording the video that lasted for centuries while witnessing the death of her love. She swallowed tears and went on with the speech that supported generations of brave souls, I was tremendously moved by the glory of humanity in that millisecond.<br/><br/>I could write a 3000 word essay analyzing the symbolism and how it creates the compelling sensation when nobody(not even the actors) understand the theme. But again, we are there to kill time and entertain ourselves. Let's just shut up and enjoy the bad-ass special affects."

All lines of conventional moral restrictions need to be ""crossed"" in order for human ""progress"" to continue. Thus it can make no distinction between genuine moral principles of good and evil and merely human prejudices and traditions. It offers nothing really helpful about the human condition, since it cannot make this distinction. For the ideology of this film, all conventions are of merely human origin, and are therefore fallible and temporary.

","This is a smokescreen movie, like Donnie Darko. Like Donnie Darko, it involves different time periods, and the events in each build a complex plot. Or, do they? Donnie Darko actually didn't make sense at all, and the connections between the stories in Cloud Atlas are actually, in the main, irrelevant. The leaping from story to story, time to time, may be considered clever and challenging, but it serves to further add unwarranted complexity to the five or six strands of the whole. Yes, some characters in some parts are relatives of those in other parts,but this doesn't really have any influence on the story. This conceit is illustrated in the episode on the sailing ship in which our protagonist is reading a book, half of which he can't find because its propping up a table leg. The book was written by the central character of a different story - so what? The only effective use of the vehicle is in the futuristic episodes, where the 'manufactured' serving girl turns out to be the god worshipped by a later generation. I've read the book as well, and my disappointment extended to it too. The film looks good though, and the acting is fine. For me, the theme music is the outstanding aspect of this overrated movie."

","David Mitchell's bloated novel of thin ideas was told in a nesting doll manner, with five chronological stories interrupted while climbing to a complete sixth story and then stepping back to complete the remaining stories, ending at the first. The odd but appealing combination of writer-directors Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis prefer to tell the stories through cross-cutting--and turn in a more satisfying experience than the book ever was. It's a good, not great, film, primarily because Mitchell's concept--that we are connected, even by such tenuous connections as a birthmark, making us a sea of change--is hardly impressive enough to sustain a film running close to three hours; and there are also glaring plot holes in the script borne by the Wachowskis' insistence on stuffing in action sequences which didn't exist in Mitchell's narrative. But the stories are told with grace and the fact that the majority of the cast (which includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and the Wachowskis' go-to for bad guys, Hugo Weaving) play multiple roles--many of them performed in drag--does more to advance MItchell's ho-hum concepts than he ever could."

Yet again, if I'd to do the same with the direction and scenario, it would take a 4, maybe 5 on a good day. <br/><br/>This film of almost 3 hours length, greatly fails to fill in its pace and storyline for something that was not necessary. I really felt that the whole film could have been shown from one ""world's"" prospective, and have the others at the end to shower us with a cinematographical explosion to close the film with a great way to validate its point and meaning (which was indeed a nice seed to think, but nothing extraordinarily philosophical or very deep). <br/><br/>As quoted on the title, something like heroine, a good looking and well made box, having many other smaller boxes inside, of great quality, and so on and so on, and at the final box, hundreds of shiny marbles before we find the purposed object of the hole thing; a somewhat clissé catchy philosophical quote written and wrapped on a fortune cookie paper. <br/><br/>To be fair though; must I once more praise the very good performances, cast, music, cinematography, photography and costumes."
"grantss","4","0","4","17 March 2014"," Ambition far beyond its reach or grasp
","Cloud Atlas' ambition far exceeds its coherence, or extent of having a point. Nearly three hours long, set in six time periods, this is really a try-hard movie. Try hard, but fail, that is. <br/><br/>Incredibly ambitious, though you often get the feeling that the ambition was to win a Best Makeup Oscar, some of the stars are so well disguised.<br/><br/>And well disguised they have to be, as the producers' ambition also seemed to be to see how many different roles they can get out of as few actors as possible. You would think that the obviously large budget of this movie would allow the producers to hire many actors, but instead they have Tom Hanks doing six roles, Halle Berry six (one as a white woman!), Jim Broadbent five, Hugo Weaving six, Jim Sturgess six, Doona Bae six (including one as a white woman, one as a Mexican woman), the list goes on and on. The recycling of actors got very ridiculous, very quickly. It was laugh-out-loud stuff.<br/><br/>You could have excused them if there was a link between the different roles of the same actor, but there isn't. (Except for Hugo Weaving, who plays the villain in each scene. Well, that was a given, after The Matrix and, after all, this is directed by the Wachowski siblings).<br/><br/>At least when Stanley Kubrick used Peter Sellers in three different roles in Dr Strangelove it was for a good reason: budget (plus, that was Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers - you don't argue with cinematic icons like those).<br/><br/>This all said, some of the stories are interesting (though none are better than okay). The 1970s nuclear power plant one was probably the pick of the bunch, followed by the 1930s musical composition story, the 22nd century one (even though it borrowed from Soylent Green) and the 19th century one on the ship. The 2012 retirement home one was silly and the Future Vikings Meet Halle Berry Alien was plain pointless, and random.<br/><br/>No performances of note, especially as it was incredibly tedious and irritating seeing the same actors appear in every story, in different roles.

"zsuzsannaladu","4","0","4","13 March 2014"," Requires Subtitles as well as an Extensive Knowledge of the Book
","This movie, although in English, we had to watch with English subtitles for three reasons:<br/><br/>1. The dialect spoken at times only vaguely resembles English and it is wholly impossible to understand from start to finish without the actual writing on the screen - I am wondering how the people who saw it in the theater were able to understand it, as I assume they did not have subtitles all the way through.<br/><br/>2. Even with the volume at one-hundred percent, we couldn't hear much of anything. It wasn't the television or speakers, as the volume of the other features on the DVD nearly blew out the speakers at that volume. I don't quite get it - it has to be the ""quietest"" DVD we've had to date - even the gunfire, car crashes, and so on, were hardly audible. Stranger still, other DVDs are almost too loud at ten percent volume. Are there not any industry standards?<br/><br/>3. The way that the actors spoke throughout was often quite stilted and bizarre as well as most acting as if they were in a short skit on stage rather than a movie - it was as if they were trying as much as possible to speak without opening their mouths (or perhaps it was all the makeup that made it impossible to speak clearly). Very strange. So, even with additional auxiliary DJ speakers connected all you hear is an indecipherable murmur, which is often not in normal English anyway, so you still need subtitles even if you can hear it. Watching a movie with subtitles is certainly not a problem of course - I'm just surprised people have apparently seen it without the subtitles.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting to watch, but without the knowledge of the book, it is mostly a concoction of seemingly unrelated stories, which again, is not a problem, but that was not what was intended. It would have made far more sense as a more even miniseries on television with better integration of the relationships between the different time periods. As it was, I didn't have the slightest clue what was going on with anything at all in the post-apocalyptic story or even the theme or what Halle Berry was looking for or why, or even what actually happened at the end.<br/><br/>I do think it would have worked far better as a ""The House That Dripped Blood"" style anthology without all the random remote-control switching around. Who wants to watch a movie where someone else is continuously changing the channel, especially between action scenes? What went wrong there?<br/><br/>What was really embarrassing was showing Maori as Africans and yet speaking a dialect of modern Jamaican. Wow, again - what went wrong there? Why are there so many movies made by people who seem to have failed first grade and kept themselves on a desert island ever since, should they accidentally or absentmindedly discover a book with real information? I'm giving it a four out of ten in that it doesn't really deserve a one, but certainly is of far lesser value than the book. To this day, why do people persist in cramming a long, complex novel into a movie? It doesn't work, and again, should have been a miniseries with less of a continuous ""channel changing"" feeling."

The fact that Hugh Grant, Tom Hanks were also starring in ""Cloud Atlas"", made me want to watch it a little, but I guess all good actors have their bad days.

","""Cloud Atlas"" is a very complicated movie. From what I gathered, it's about how people are connected over the centuries and how one action can be related to another. Of course it's not a light movie for a tranquil night, but a film that gives you lot to think about. Unfortunately, Cloud Atlas had too much to tell, that in the end it was very tiring. The length of the movie was too big, understandable though if you consider the number of the stories that had to be presented to the audience. However, I truly believe that if the stories were less in number, the final result would have been better, as it is not a book so that can last longer than three hours. The jumping from one story to the other was confusing, as you were trying to grasp the one you were introduce to the other. The characters were changing as well from one time period to another, so it was hard to comprehend them. Some of the stories were quite entertaining, like the one taking place at 2012 or the other on the boat. However I found the blood on the scenes too much, like an exaggeration on the violence that obviously the audience could make out from the general idea without the additional bloodshed. The performances were good, but that is expected from famous actors and actresses. All in all, Cloud Atlas seemed to me unable to pass through the massage that was intended to give, but ended up being a mass of different movies, that the only entertaining part was to find which actor played which."

","When i first heard about this movie, i was really excited because of the fact that it was to be directed by the Wachowskis and Tom Hanks was going to be a part of it. It couldn't POSSIBLY be bad, right?<br/><br/>WRONG!<br/><br/>I have to admit that the movie wasn't boring, but it wasn't interesting enough to keep me watching without taking breaks every ten minutes. Some of the ideas (parallel universes, a futuristic city, a fabricant going rogue and becoming a god in a post apocalyptic world where a tribe of cannibals terrorize the villagers) were good enough to make me watch until the end, but the ending was incredibly dull and disappointing. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, like:<br/><br/>1- I haven't read the novel. So i just jumped into a world with A LOT of flashbacks and flash forwards. And the actors played different characters in each scene. What is not explained throughout the movie is WHY? Are these parallel universes? Or do they actually get reincarnated after death and for some reason no one says ""Hey, i just saw a picture of a guy who looked exactly like you, FROM 18-GODDAMN-49?!"". <br/><br/>The preferable answer would be parallel universes, obviously, but the movie doesn't give you a clue and expects you to just ""roll with it"". If you're one of those people who think ""Some things are best left to the imagination of the audience"", you're right, but leaving the ending to our imagination and leaving THE ENTIRE PLOT to our imagination are two ENTIRELY different things. I like the plots to be more clear, otherwise it just leads up to people not understanding them pretend to understand, and makes the movie look worse than it is because of it's pretentious fan base (aka: inception syndrome)<br/><br/>2- When i saw the futuristic city, i immediately wanted to know more about it, it's social structure, the vehicles they used for transport, why the old city sunk into the sea and why future people have weird eyes.<br/><br/>Instead of showing me more about this city, the movie decided that gay romance in 1936 was more interesting. After a few more scenes of letters from a musician to his lover that no one cares about, the story of Luisa Rey trying to uncover a plot that NO ONE cares about, and then when we finally return to the future, the interesting part, the fabricant suddenly falls in love with his savior and it turns into another ""Robots have feelings"" story THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT.<br/><br/>The movie just INSISTS on not showing people what they want. And really, a movie can't just have multiple contradicting themes like ""sci-fi, romance, action, comedy, conspiracy etc."" after all, themes are USEFUL for movies, because they determine what sort of audience will like them. So instead of mixing up all of these, they could just use the last two stories, the story of a fabricant standing up against the oppressors and rising to godhood apocalypse.<br/><br/>3-The ending. Seriously? I expected the movie to have an end so mind- blowing that i can't POSSIBLY expect , but instead the movie doesn't connect the dots and just says something like ""Death is a beginning, do good stuff because you're gonna return here eventually, and btw, EVERYTHING IS LINKED... though we don't know how... or why..."". This, is the type of ending i hate the most, the one that's meant to be educating and mind-blowing, but is so cliché and simple that it sounds like a nine year old's thoughts on life. And no, adding a complex parallel universe theme to the movie doesn't make it look smart, it just makes it complicated and silly because of the lack of explanation in the movie. But the plot is from a novel so we can't really blame the movie for this. <br/><br/>I wish they would think everything through before just jumping in and making a movie."
"KidHorn","5","0","3","30 January 2014"," Wasn't great but not terrible either
","I think the movie had good intentions in that it would tell 6 individual stories that were interconnected in some fashion. The problem is the move is 3 hours long and it wasn't enough time to explain everything. I don't understand how the stories are connected other than through a comet looking birthmark on many of the main characters. I could guess ways they are connecting in that anytime you have 6 stories, you can imagine some sort of connection, but I'm not sure what connection the film makers were trying to show. Are they trying to convey that some people are good and some people are bad throughout history? Maybe. Who knows? Each story was full of holes that needed filling. For example, the last story chronologically took place in Hawaii sometime after an apocalypse of some sort. What was the apocalypse? Nuclear war? a powerful strain of flu? Why is Tom Hanks living like an aborigine while Halle Berry has futuristic technology? It reminds me of Star Trek where they have to use the prime directive around primitive cultures from other planets, but in this case everyone is from earth.<br/><br/>Why was there someone who looked like a green chimney sweep from the 1800s popping up and taking to Tom Hanks? The only story I liked was the one with the Korean replicant. But, somehow she became a deity without any explanation. Did she have anything to do with the apocalypse? All in all, the movie was full of holes, but it wasn't as bad as many have posted. I at least cared how the movie would end and watched to the end even though I felt the movie didn't end with a proper explanation."

It's a bit jarring and disorienting and doesn't really work until the end when all the various story climaxes are about to meet at the same time. <br/><br/>The acting was quite good all around. Kudos to Hugh Grant for taking on a few roles you'd never see him normally do - without an English accent to boot. Tom Hanks looks like he had fun with his short but memorable role as the author of ""Knuckle Sandwich"". The role of the young musician was very well acted and was a standout for me.<br/><br/>Part of the fun and the distraction was trying to recognize the various actors in different costume/makeup in the various scenes. <br/><br/>Definitely not a perfect movie by any means but if you can put in the effort in the beginning, the payoff at the end is worth it. <br/><br/>8/10"

I also really liked the idea that when we die it's not just ""heaven"" or darkness (or whatever your belief is), instead it's another door opening. Super cool idea, and it really resonated with me.<br/><br/>Acting, of course, was top notch. These of some of the biggest starts in the business, so we should expect nothing less. <br/><br/>The sound, music, and ambiance of the film was excellently done as well, and helped focus my attention in this long movie.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend it to friends. Especially deep thinkers, and people who enjoy a strong message. I really enjoyed it."

","It took me a very long time to see this movie. I work in a DVD-rental store after Uni and people kept coming in after renting Cloud Atlas and while some feedback was positive a lot of people told me they found the film confusing. 'Didn't get it' was a comment I heard quite a lot. Today I finally watched the film and I was utterly mesmerized. I understand, I think, the trouble some of our customers had with it. Overthinking. It is confusing. It is also spellbinding, visually stunning and brilliantly acted. I'm quite certain I didn't fully get it either. Gonna have to watch it again. This movie is a philosophical journey. Karma, reincarnation, the immortality of love and the enduring human soul. Strangely, it rarely bothers people to let some inane, redundant action film simply wash over them. But that is precisely what one should do with this film. Allow it to wash over you, through you and into you. Let it slip you away and wonder at what and who we are, were and maybe one day will be."
"leonblackwood","2","0","5","8 September 2013"," Confusing and quite boring. 2/10
","Review: I really tried my best to get into this 3 hour epic movie, but I just wasn't interested in what the hell was happening. It's does get top marks for the way it looks, but the storyline was way too confusing, and bloody long. I didn't have a clue what was going on but I think that the moral of the story was, different circumstances can change the course of your life, I think. I don't know why the director had to make it so complicated, and judging by the money that it made, the audiences didn't take to this movie either. This has to go down as one of the most disappointing movies made by Tom Hanks ever, which is a shame because he isn't taking that many projects lately. Maybe if someone could explain the 6 different stories because I just didn't get it. Very Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie must have been a nightmare to make because of the 6 periods that it covers and the many different actors that were use. The make-up looked a bit ridiculous and the storyline seemed like they were making it up as they were going along. I did hear that the book was much better than the film and that it was easier to understand, but there is no way that I am going to put myself through that project again. It would have been a much better movie if the director just concentrated on one of the 6 different decades, but I suppose that, that wouldn't have been true to the book. You can really tell that the makers of the Matrix had something to do with this film because they made the last 2 movies in that franchise just as confusing.<br/><br/>Budget: $102million Worldwide Gross: $130million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who like there fantasy/adventure movies, but prepare to get pushed from one decade to the next. 2/10"

","I am almost always willing to watch a Tom Hanks movie. Except for those Da Vinci Code movies, he has chosen characters I would enjoy watching. So along with Halle Berry, they get to play make-up and dress-up as they gleefully play a multitude of roles in this reincarnation movie. As the thread of the different characters in different time periods unfolds, there is an exuberant feeling that there is some brilliance behind the filmmaking. I think of the densely detailed ""Fight Club"". Some very visceral events are presented with such gravitas that you could find yourself gripping your seat.<br/><br/>But then the movie presents new stories with more conventional (meaning less realistic) plot points that weaken the film as a whole. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the extended runtime as we watch this story weave it's way to the resolution. Initially, these episodes pack a punch that feels as though there was a heavy emotional payoff coming. But then there is perhaps an overreach in trying to deliver more conventional third story action pieces, not-so-surprising twists, and that cliché last second rescue from certain doom. I lost any deeper emotional connection with our main characters at that point.<br/><br/>I still appreciate the matrix-like view of reincarnation, affecting all of our personalities as they simultaneously exist across many time periods. It could have been brilliant. But then it starts to look like ""Attack of the Clones"". It is definitely worth renting the DVD like I did."

","I rate ambition over comprehension in many cases, and Cloud Atlas is no exception. The film is an extraordinary feat of creativity, while asking extraordinary patience from its viewers. <br/><br/>That said, I am glad it was made and that there are people in the world who aim to make films of this magnitude. It covers centuries in time, a multitude of characters, often played by the same actor, cutting back and forth so relentlessly between time periods, story lines and realities that at a certain point you have to sit back and either accept it, or reject it. If you reject it, you are in for a long haul, if you accept it, there are many layers of magic to be found beneath the surface. It warrants repeated viewings. <br/><br/>Sometimes the mixture feels like two different films battling for the same space, and indeed it was made by three filmmakers, all accomplished in their own right. An interesting experiment, and it yielded a mind bending film. But good luck explaining it to anyone unless they're prepared to sit over a cup of tea and a note pad."

","If your like me, you've read some plot details and say to yourself ""this is crap."" I was like that for a long time, until my wife put on some previews and I saw there were some futuristic scenes! Very reminiscent of the 'air bikes' of the movie ""The Island."" So I gave it watch, oh man.. the first 10 minutes I was ready to turn it off. They just threw us into the water with several stories flowing at the same time. It was a mess to make sense of. After I got acquainted with the characters, I tried to understand it, to try and predict where the story was going. Needless to say, the movie kept me hooked from then on out.<br/><br/>The character stories were great, but most of the stories do allude to other works of art (novels and movies) like ""One Flew over the Cookoo's Next"", Soylent Green references, and then other plot devices where just generic ideas. Like the 'primitive future.' All in all I was hooked, but for me I felt that some pieces could have been developed more. Hey, I stuck it out for 2 hours, give me some closure! More closure could have upped to a 9. Also I had a real bad time understanding the futuristic pidgin English, some subtitles would have been nice."

But if your not into these, like myself, then don't watch it. The Story would have been better, in my opinion, if instead of jumping around, like they did, and went with a more straight forward approach. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Hugo Weaving did a phenomenal job, it was just the movie that sucked. One other aspect I hated about it was that it was very difficult to understand what the heck the people were saying; it was very, very difficult for me."

","I picked up this film as a Bluray not having read the book (or even knowing that the book existed) and never having heard of the film. Good cast (especially Tom Hanks), good directors, guaranteed to be a good film, so I thought. The box said something about 6 story lines across several centuries. The story lines themselves were interesting, the special effects were good. But what was the connection between the story lines? I finished the film none the wiser. Only on reading IMDb did it become clear that this was to do with reincarnation and an act of kindness in the earliest story was repaid in the last story line. On a re-seeing I might get more from the film now that I know this. However to my mind a film should be stand alone; it should be obvious at some point what the film is about without prior knowledge and preferably fairly early on, otherwise one spends the whole time wondering what the heck is going on. As with this movie. Don't watch it until someone has explained to you what the movie is about."

The middle movie was philosophically interesting but suffered from middle-movie syndrome. The last wasn't even up to comic book standards and ruined the whole series with a denouement I could hear every Sunday in church if I wished to.<br/><br/>I predict Matrix fans will hate Cloud Atlas. Complex and sophisticated in its story telling, and deeply philosophical, this also makes it hard to describe. You really have to not just see this movie, but truly experience it, and even then it leaves a great many open questions. <br/><br/>I am not surprised that those who didn't get the movie also by and large call the future- dialect ""unintelligible.""

"safari-taha","9","0","3","13 July 2013"," Cycle the circle
","What ""CloudAtlas"" means in word is a kind of map or encyclopedia of clouds, their positioning, movement, genre and so on So imagine yourself sitting under a tree in a sunny midday of summer looking into sky and daydreaming: visualizing with clouds and making shapes with them in your thoughts. Yes your mind and imagination plays an important role in this masterpiece, where we _maybe_ get an atlas of human's life through ages, a pattern that has been cycling and happening over and over again. Love is most bright passion. But passion itself is an ambition to concern in story. Let's take a quick look toward the story, 6 parallel lines in 6 different time of history happening. Writer (David Mitchell) experiences different genres and paints them perfectly in our minds and be honest, these three director did an astonishing job to illustrate it on cinema curtains. Peoples living life, in aspect of whom are fighting for freedom, and whom are resisting them. A never ending fight that happened over and over again, isn't it? Movie is so partial, so enigmatic. It requires consciousness and awareness along of watching, and in my opinion more than once watching. Story is not in a simple-single line that can be understood easily and by it I mean the layers beneath. There are different views and reaction toward ""CloudAtlas"" I've seen its name in best movies of the year, or even worst movie. It might be cause of a Movie with more material of soul, imagination, delusion and humanity is less wanted than ""World Saving Hero Popcorns"" like avengers so viewers with such a taste will not find a longer_than_2hours movie easy to watch in such a procedure. Cloud Atlas , in my honest opinion is a masterpiece. A phenomenon has took place in technical part of cinema industries, make ups looks like a joke, genres , colors, style, ages are changed, and THAT good you won't even be able to recognize the actor/actress! Movie is long, but tempo is fast, during movie many time you think ""these are final scenes"" but nope, you're wrong and there is another hour or even more to end! There's a lot to say, but I have to finish with only mentioning some of them. There are some ideas about plot, is it a story about reincarnation? Yes it might be. But in many of aspects, cycle isn't working perfectly at many parts. For example Tom Hanks on a doctor and as a man in post-future doesn't match. So with all signs of reincarnation I'm not sure if it's actually about it. The only pure bad-man in all 6 stories is Hugo Weaving which at the end turns out to be devil himself. So beside that everyone are in fourth and back of good and evil. Start at first story, is where Ewing breaks a habit and (in their opinion) goes a different way than natural order: he gives a chance to a black slave. Later on (at third story) we see a black journalist who is not against the natural order anymore. Furthermore we observe that so called ""natural order"" is totally changed, now white peoples are slaying each other and undoubtedly are uncivilized. But in same time, black peoples are ruling, they're civilized and technologically sophisticated but then they don't believe in infamous ""natural order"" they treat white peoples nicely and try to help them, and no, there's no slavery. So there comes a feeling, Ewing's decision _whether he sacrificed his life like Sonmi _ has took its place in history and affected next generations. Yes decisions matters. Many of us (including myself) believe that nothing worth sacrificing, not to be negative person, just being conservative and passive: ""minding our own business is way of life in this planet"". Story tries to prove it wrong. At future part (fifth story) there's a doubt in ""Unanimity"", they call themselves ""Purebloods"" and the original eastern peoples are called ""Fabricants"" now. The spot of master and follower has changed? World is upside down? Human's made Fabricants and now it's vice versa? What does it means? Even if we're living in a different planet (end of story), even if we're Fabricant and 'not-made by hand of god"" even if we lived in our well-known world, with no matter of genre, color, nationality Freedom is same as what Ewing felt for Autua, So is love. Passion for truth comes in every aspect. You know the structure above is changeable but you won't be able to change the basin: changing the roots of humanity is impossible. But unfortunately fight between good and evil is permanent, as Taoism believes:""contrary forces of light and dark are interconnected and interdependent"",and I would say this is the ""natural order""."

","I didn't see the movie on the big screen, so when it came out on BlueRay I had, apart from some comments here and there about how unusual it is, no idea what i was about to expect, except that it wasn't devoid of action, what convinced me that i wouldn't totally waste my time.<br/><br/>What i got was not what i expected and surpassed my expectations manifold.

"hennyxu","7","0","2","8 July 2013"," A compilation of separate moments within various people's lives intertwined by reincarnation and most importantly the viewer's own interpretation and imagination.
","Let's start with something important namely respecting people's opinions. I know most people on- or offline despise this movie, mostly because it was too long or it was too convoluted. If you are one of these people I would like to say that I respect your opinion and I would like to ask you to respect mine. In the end movie reviews, good or bad, are just people sharing their opinions within a network of movie lovers.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is a movie that is focused on various peoples within the past, present and distant future. These peoples are reincarnations of themselves experiencing events that are mostly different with slight recurring themes. As aforementioned this movie can be compared to a compilation of stories written by a writer that is using certain custom themes to reflect his own personality. Personally I think that this aspect of the movie should have been explained better or at least emphasized at the start of the movie. The lack of this explanation made this movie look like a plot driven story creating expectations for a big revelation at the end. Even though there is a plot, like most movies, it isn't the focus of the story. I perceived the story as a character study focusing on different events throughout time and space. Where past events are recurring in the future and how different characters, but the same person, make certain decisions.<br/><br/>The acting is good as expected from Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving and Jim Broadbent; however I do have to admit that it felt a bit strange seeing the same actors wearing masks to change their appearances. The idea is interesting but the execution wasn't done right, to see Hugo weaving in drag or as an Asian really pushed the limits of my suspense of disbelieve. But apart from that the actors did a good job in portraying the world and their emotions.<br/><br/>Music wasn't that special it was okay and it succeeded in creating the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>Atmosphere is essential in all movies and I personally think that the Wachowski brothers have made a movie that oozed atmosphere. Every moment had its own color and feel that complimented the stories. The worlds were beautiful with a rich culture and much detail. I especially liked the language that was used in the future.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion Hollywood is making a lot of movies these days that is following a fixed overused pattern. A pattern that has been considered the standard and when you deviate from this standard you'll be either loved or hated. So if you want to watch this movie please forget the standard and consider this movie as an art movie with many symbolisms and openness for you to interpret as a viewer (much like the movies Mister Nobody or Holy Motors). Please have an open mind, no expectations, and try to be invested in all the stories, not just one, because then you'll see how good this movie truly is.<br/><br/>Most people are not going to like this, but I'm giving this movie a 7."

","This movie was great, BUT it requires extreme patience. I went into the movie telling myself that every great review of this movie stated that the first 45 minutes were rough. This is true. Getting a grasp on the pace and style of storytelling is difficult and leaves the viewer wanting to give up. I was watching this movie with my dad and his girlfriend. She ended up walking out at about the 30-minute mark. I was tempted to but stuck in there, and I was heavily rewarded. This movie is very rich, and asks a lot from it's viewers. But if you have the patience to wait it out, you will sit through a magical experience. The acting= mostly superb. The story= excellent (the ability to combine this many stories into one ending that makes sense is virtually impossible, but the movie did it). This movie was once considered an impossible endeavor. I'm still amazed at what was pulled off here. Stories of past, future, and present emerge into one final moment. There is love, there is romance, there is war, there is slavery, there is the future, there is a bit of everything. The reason this movie is an 8 (and not 10) is because of two things: (1) The slow/confusing beginning that makes most people want to give up; (2) one of the multiple stories that is merged together was a tad boring and out of the pace with the rest of the movie. I LOVED every story except for a weird futurist world where Tom Hanks is a crude villager and Halle Berry is a futuristic scientist really didn't work for me- that story just didn't fit the flow and energy of the movie in my opinion. OVERALL= VERY GOOD MOVIE, I recommend to everyone who is willing to show patience and sit through 45 minutes of confusion to get to the grand prize."

I understand the intent of the film makers, however, I DID find the story hard to track. There is a fine line in story telling between being cleverly subtle, and seemingly vague.

","I will put it bluntly. This is a fantastic movie with a multitude of spectacular messages. An interesting concept which comes together surprisingly well. The stories each have their own feel to them, yet all manage to connect into a coherent whole in the end. The score is fantastic and so is the make up. I enjoyed the way the movie is not afraid of providing possible solutions to the questions it posses. It acknowledges its own concept (for lack of a better word) multiple times within the stories, but each time it feels right. Just as us the viewers are beginning to try to connect a new plot point of one plot with the plot points of others, the movie subtly acknowledges this connection. Sometimes it will offer evidence at the right time, others it will allow the characters to hypothesis the possibility of a connection, thus queuing in the viewer to the connection. Overall, it is a deep, thought provoking movie that does not ram its message down your throat.

","First thing you should know is that this movie is made up from multiple stories, and some of them are seriously ambitious cinema. Some of the stories are great, really fantastic. Others...well they don't quite pull it off. Nevertheless, I really respect the actors and directors for such a brave and different movie.<br/><br/>As there are several different stories, I will review each separately<br/><br/>South Pacific Ocean, 1849 - Seriously predictable, mushy, sentimental and very difficult to believe. Good anti-racist message though. 4/10<br/><br/>Cambridge, England and Edinburgh, Scotland, 1936 - Charming, well acted, delightful. Gorgeous depiction of a homosexual relationship, no cheese. 9/10<br/><br/>San Francisco, California, 1973 - Pretty average. Pretty good performance from Halle Berry but comes of a little conspiracy theory- est. Not Berry's fault, but her character kept changing. I didn't feel like I knew her. 5/10<br/><br/>United Kingdom, 2012 - I know most people found this part boring because it was about old people, but I thought this was hilarious. I could have watched a whole movie about just this. Stunning performance from Jim Broadbent. 10/10<br/><br/>Neo Seoul, (Korea), 2144 - This was by far the most ambitious plot thread and I thought they really pulled it off. Beautiful special effects and a gruesome, haunting vision of the future. Also a fantastic performance from newcomer Bae Doona. Gives Bladerunner a run for its money. 9/10<br/><br/>The Big Island (dated ""106 winters after The Fall"", in the end credits and book cited as 2321) - Again this was very ambitious but this time with less success. Truthfully I thought it was silly. 4/10<br/><br/>Obviously all these stories link together and it's WAY too complicated for me to explain how. Because of this complexity, the movie is very long and yet seems to skip over everything quite quickly. Not a lot they could have done about that though. Movies are movies. I'm not sure I really understand Cloud atlas, but I would advise anybody to see it because I think we could learn a lot about the future of cinema."

I thought it would have some sort of meaning. also, they didn't really explain why the 2144 world located in Seoul was so corrupted, or if the revolution they had affected anything. also why was the research that the gay old man had so important, they never really tell us, and if so does it affect the rest of the generations of the the world. really, they don't explain it that well. overall though the ending was good, with the exception of some plot holes. and it definitely had a lift on emotion throughout the film. not to mention the acting was good. oh one last thing I didn't like the old man that gets trapped in the nursing home, that was dumb and shouldn't have been in the movie."

","..That said,it was certainly a commendable effort by the writing/directing/acting team as Cloud Atlas was without a doubt a huge undertaking.(I'm usually late with my reviews as I seldom see them in theaters and wait for the DVD and this time, no exception -sorry). Having read the book, I was able to ""fill in the blanks"" but I have to wonder if the whole thing was just too confusing to someone who hadn't read it. The constant jumping back and forth between all 6 plot lines would have to be dizzying to someone just walking in and one has to wonder if that is why the movie didn't do particularly well. I found it particularly disappointing that Robert Frobisher's story wasn't delved into more. His was one of the most interesting. The character Eva was completely eliminated - why? - and although I don't remember Robert making ""a pass"" at Ayrs (although maybe he did and I just don't remember), I seem to remember their discord was over Ayrs discovering Robert's affair with his wife Jocasta. OK, I digress; I realize movies and TV shows deviate all the time from their literary ""parents"" but I don't know. This was one of the best books I've read in ages and I guess I just expected more. And - really - did the dog need to be shot? I'll give it a 7 anyway for amazing sets, costumes and the sci-fi stuff is sweet! I just don't know whether or not you should read the book before watching or not! Thanks, Jeb..."

","Written, Produced & Directed by Lana & Andy Wachowski & Tom Tykwer, 'Cloud Atlas' Is The Most Ambitious Film from the 2010's Yet! Here's a film takes imagination to a new level. This is Once In A Lifetime Cinema the delivers multiple stories in one film. <br/><br/>'Cloud Atlas' Synopsis: An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.<br/><br/>'Cloud Atlas' is absorbing at most parts, but, despite the tremendous effort put in by the entire cast & crew, the film suffers from some faulty writing. No, the long running-time isn't the problem, but the writing, at times, is. Out of the many stories, some appeal entirely, some appeal in bits. My Personal Favourite was the one Set In 2144. It has a strong story & astounding visual effects! <br/><br/>'Cloud Atlas', despite its flaws, cannot be missed. I was astonished by the execution & the creativity involved into it. Its been made on an Epic Scale & it carries a Grand Look all through. Its stunning to look at. <br/><br/>Lana & Andy Wachowski & Tom Tykwer's Writing isn't power-packed, but has its share of amazement too. Their Direction, is absolutely beautiful. They have surpassed as far as Imagination is concerned. Cinematography, Editing & Visual Effects, are incredible. Make-Up is nicely done.<br/><br/>Supremely Talented Actors such as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Keith David, Susan Sarandon & Hugh Grant appear in Multiple Roles, enacting a part in every story. They all are magnificent. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Cloud Atlas' may not have the Greatest Script, But It Still Is One Hell Of A Movie! Recommended!"

","Cloud Atlas is one of the movies that is almost on par with its literary template. Unfortunately, due to six loosely connected stories, there were cuts to be made in order to bring them to the screen. This is felt during the movie, even if you haven't read the book.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloud Atlas is a great experience, both visually and as a story which is rather complicated to be retold. I was not able to sense the broader philosophical context which has been mentioned by the authors during the movie's promotion.<br/><br/>What i appreciated is a happy ending, despite the fact that it is not in line with the original story."

","I seriously thought this looked too ambitious and would just end up pretentious and dumb.<br/><br/>If anything, it ended up being a movie made up of separate parts that flowed so well together that you felt it more than understood it. Often, that is a point of weakness in my opinion (Babel, anybody?). In this case, though, good directing, acting and editing made the whole thing work.<br/><br/>As with most people, some parts fell flat, but it was like watching a massive episode of ""Lost"", where you have some favorite characters, some not so favorite, but it all works together. If you're looking for a film that wraps up everything in a really obvious but cool way, watch ""Fish Story"". If you'd rather have some interpretation left to interconnecting worlds your entertainment, watch ""Cloud Atlas""."

","A film almost 3 hours in length can easily turn into a drag, not so with Cloud Atlas. I was - using a bit of a cliché - stuck from the first minute until the last.<br/><br/>What's so amazing is not how the stories are interwoven, since they are only lightly so. Instead it's the quick pacing, giving us sometimes a few minutes, sometimes only a few seconds from each and every story.<br/><br/>It's also a wonderful mix, from the comical with a failed publisher locked up in a nursing home to a criminal story straight out of the seventies to a dystopia set 200 years from now.<br/><br/>The actors - famous names most of them - are doing a good job, especially Halle Berry as the reporter and Ben Whishaw doing an amazing portrait of a homosexual composer fighting an uphill battle.<br/><br/>The only one feeling slightly misplaced from time to time was Hugo Weaving, not because he's a bad actor but because he to my generation will first and foremost always be the menacing Mr Smith from The Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>I hope I will carry the same warm feeling if watching the film a second. If so it's very well deserved all the praise I above have given."
"Tomas_T","7","0","1","6 April 2013"," Mesmerizing, yet imperfect scifi epic
","Cloud Atlas offers a mesmerizing scifi experience which at the same time might just be too big of an undertaking for filmatization. The gargantuan proportions of the 2004 source novel does not dishearten director trio, Wachowski siblings and Tom Tykwer, as they bring Cloud Atlas to the big screen.<br/><br/>Talking about epic undertaking, Cloud Atlas novel is composed of 6 loosely interlinked stories taking place from 19th century to mankind's distant future. Each story share some variation of the main characters and depict how their actions have direct consequences for the future. Sounds confusing and there is no denying that Cloud Atlas is a challenging film to grasp initially, but once the viewer gets the hang of the story mechanics the film transforms from confusing mess into something thought provoking.<br/><br/>Not all Cloud Atlas' stories are equal and I felt more drawn towards the dystopic and apocalyptic scifi worlds of the Wachowski siblings which were so very unreal and yet managed to stay completely credible at the same time. Unquestionably Wachowskis futuristic worlds lack the human touch of Tom Tykwer's stories, but to me the stylistic realisation of these unreal visions of future were simply inspiring. No matter which of the stories the viewer prefers the entire production is paced and edited seamlessly making the film coherent experience overall. No easy feat with 6 different stories and 3 different directors! In addition to technical praise extra notation must be given for the films actors who give out solid performances. One is however above others and I was positively surprised to see veteran actor Tom Hanks really break away from his comfort zone and provide terrific performances through the film.<br/><br/>Despite the overall positive impression I got from Cloud Atlas, it cannot be overlooked that cramming 6 separate stories into single film is poised to generate problems. This becomes especially evident towards the end of the film when it becomes clear that there simply is not enough running time to allow all 6 stories to fully develop to their maximum potential. This could have been overlooked alone, but honestly I was disappointed to see that the film lacked a climatic closure where all the stories would merge together.<br/><br/>Despite the films shortcoming Cloud Atlas offers a unique film experience and undoutbly withholds content to last multiple viewing sessions. It is a film best assessed with feeling rather than reason to ensure best end result."
"agmoldham","6","0","4","29 March 2013"," Complex and entertaining
","Before seeing Cloud Atlas I knew that it was a movie that tended to inspire polar views ... most people either love it or hate it. Whilst it is in no ways perfect I found the movie to be quite entertaining and kept your attention for the 3 hours running time.<br/><br/>The movie consists of 6 story lines that are set in different time periods. The movie flips back and forward through these story lines. The idea being that what happens in one story line influences what happens in another. <br/><br/>The cast are well known and all play multiple roles. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Hugo Weaving are obviously well known and all the cast seem to be very committed to the project judging from their performances. It is nice to watch a film and engage with the characters.<br/><br/>The film is well shot and directed by the Wachowski's. It is pretty difficult to keep up with and will certainly merit another viewing. The fact that it merits another viewing must mean that it is both complex and entertaining which has to be a good thing."

","CLOUD ATLAS<br/><br/>Wow this is a confusing movie.<br/><br/>Visually it is a beautiful film. There are so many gorgeous scenes. Lovely colours and great effects. The only thing is, there are so many different stories in this movie and it goes on for so long that I just could not understand it all fully. I am not the only one I watched this film with 3 other people and all of us were the same. I recently watched an interview with the cast from the film, and they were asked if they could explain the movie to everyone, and all of them said that they couldn't explain it.<br/><br/>Speaking of the cast, it is very impressive. Tom Hanks is one of the main cast members Tom is one of my top 5 favourite actors. He has made so many great films, and this is good, but not up there with his best. Halle Berry is also in it. She does a great job. I find Halle to be a bit hit and miss. She is a great actress, but she has not got the best judgment in choosing movies. It also has Jim Broadbent in it. I know Jim from various TV shows and a couple of movies and I have to admit, this is his best role to date. Susan Sarandon also makes a couple of appearances. But he big surprise of the film has to be Hugh Grant I am not a big fan of his. He has made some good movies, but I don't really rate him as an actor. He has been typecast as a romcom actor and all of his films are very wet. But not in this film. He does a great job and it shows he can do other things other than romantic comedies. I know he was in Extreme Measures which was not a comedy, but he struggled through that. He looked so uncomfortable and out of his zone, but in Cloud Atlas he is awesome.<br/><br/>The film is on for nearly 3 hours another long movie. Why are all the films these days so long? What happened to the days where a film could be on for 80-90 minutes and that was good films do not need to be dragged out to 3 hours. This film does feel long too sometimes when I go and see a movie and it is a 3 hours epic, it doesn't feel that long and the time flies but not here. It felt very long. That is not necessarily a bad thing, I did enjoy the movie, I just didn't understand it. I could not explain the story to you sorry.<br/><br/>I will give this film a 6 out of 10...<br/><br/>Too long, very confusing but visually very nice and some great performances.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"TheSquiss","6","0","4","11 March 2013"," A spectacle that entertains while simultaneously numbing the brain.
","Cloud Atlas is the latest event in the Wachowski brothers' adventure in cinema. Depending on which stage of their career path you look at, their name on the credits either excites or sinks the stomach. Beginning with the superb high of Bound, shot rapidly and cheaply to 'prove' they could be trusted with a mega budget for The Matrix, their career trajectory has been downwards ever since, bottoming out (hopefully) with the ill-judged, stodgy mess that was Speed Racer. Four years on and they're back with, well, what is it? Cloud Atlas is a spectacle. It's beautiful. The cinematography and effects edge towards astounding, are mostly satisfying and make for a very attractive, no, a stunning film. Visually, that is. Much (most?) is shot against green screens, which has allowed them to sculpt worlds that present to us that which swirls around in their minds. It's a trip most will enjoy looking at immensely.<br/><br/>For me, the visuals are the principal selling point. The contrasts between the closed sets of a study and ship compared with the expansive realms of forests and cityscapes are expressed wonderfully; the costumes and make-up are vivid, imaginative and prompt silent games of Guess Who as the star names play multiple characters, Halle Berry and Jim Sturgess leading the pack with seven characters apiece.<br/><br/>On the subject of stars, Cloud Atlas is packed with them: Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon It's no mean feat watching each of them bounce between roles, so it must have been one heck of a task for each of them playing them. Each, without exception, manages to differentiate between characters suitably but, man, it's hard to keep up sometimes.<br/><br/>Cloud Atlas is so chock-a-block full of worlds, times, characters and story lines that it becomes cluttered and confused early on and doesn't ever let up. Perhaps the best advice to heed when viewing Cloud Atlas is to approach it like Shakespeare: Don't attempt to understand every syllable of every word (or even every soliloquy, for that matter), just sit back, go with it and then assess what you've absorbed as the credits roll.<br/><br/>I've said it before (most recently with American Mary) it's not a good sign when a film requires two directors. But three? Really? This is a classic case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Maybe the Wachowskis were so concerned about their rapid descent through Hollywood's hierarchy they felt they needed to bring in Tom Tykwer (Perfume: The Story of a Murderer) to save them. Perhaps they should have employed him and left him to it.<br/><br/>Instead, despite/because three men shared the megaphone (as well as writing and producing duties), we have a three-hour head spin that entertains while simultaneously numbing the brain. Brevity is not in the directors' vocabulary; hell, you can even watch the 'extended' trailer, which is a full 5 minutes & 42 seconds, the length of some short films! So what is it actually about? Cloud Atlas is summed up perfectly in the final few minutes when Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) states, ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future."" It's a beautiful sentiment that allows our thoughts and imaginations to journey across worlds, times and planes of existence and it's not the slightest issue that the journey Tykwer and the Wachowskis take us on is eight minutes shy of three hours. The issue is that feels like three hours! There is a more succinct explanation courtesy of Stephen King in his Dark Tower epic: ""Go, then, there are other worlds than these."" <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"fariska","6","0","3","4 March 2013"," Good visualisation of a great book.
","Yesterday I finally got around to see Cloud Atlas. I was with my girlfriend who hadn't read the book.<br/><br/>Visually speaking the cinematographers did a great job: camera, photography, VFX and especially acting is top notch. And discovering which actor is which under such heavy (and finely done) make up in the different stories adds to the enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>But unfortunately this isn't enough to make the movie great and enjoyable as the book. The main problem lies in the fact that the stories, in the book, are secondary. The main aspect is the literary virtuosism with which of the story is narrated and written: the plot, the language and the style of each one is what really shines in the book: the birthmark the intertweening stories are just expedients to a refined display of literary power.<br/><br/>The fact that what makes the book inerhently great couldn't be translated as a movie, was my big worry when I heard about a film to be made. The writers and directors had to fall back on the stories as the underlying glue. And the result falls short: the different stories are compressed, and the continuity links between them are sometimes just one unfocused short line of dialogue, likely to be missed (and the fast editing doesn't help if you're trying to follow). The filmmakers, because of the limitations of the medium, have decided to tell and not really show the message of the film, which unfortunately makes it preachy and new-age flavoured.<br/><br/>Given the starting material probably this is the best possible film adaptation of the book, unfortunately it isn't enough to make a great film. My advice is to read the book and watch the movie afterwards so you are able to fill in the (many) blanks while enjoying the great visual side of the film."
"rubenvanbergen","7","0","2","2 March 2013"," A good cinematization of an okay book
","It was only weeks before seeing this film that I had read the book it is based on, so I suppose this might have taken away some of the excitement I might have felt had I watched it ""unspoiled"". Since I was already familiar with the central premise of 6 narratives intertwined and interleaved across time and space, its ingenuity might have dulled on me somewhat, so I will attempt to combine my impression of the plot from reading the book with its cinematic realization. <br/><br/>Although I found the theme of interconnectedness appealing, I never felt that it had been developed to its full potential. I continuously had the feeling that we were building up to some great revelation or insight, which would give meaning to the connections. That is, not an explanation in a metaphysical sense, but a purpose for them in the narrative. We were promised, to quote the IMDb synopsis, ""an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future"", but instead the film offers only loose links and similarities, save perhaps for the implication that the same ""souls"" keep finding each other in different lives. <br/><br/>Some have praised this absence of a message as a strength. They argue that David Mitchell and the Wachowski siblings have done well to leave the story's themes open to interpretation. However, just as a painting needs colours and contours, so does a story require decisions from the narrator to give it definition. In this particular case, I believe, the picture has been left too blurry.<br/><br/>That said, but for a few minor flaws the film is a graphically stunning recreation of the book, especially in the more futuristic segments, which does much to enhance the cosmic scale on which we are meant to see it. The same can be said of the way the different stories are cut together, which is a well-chosen departure from novel. I do confess I would rather have been spared Tom Hanks' attempt at a non-specific English/Scottish/Irish accent (which at times even has hints of pirate- speak in it), as well as the cross-dressing and cross-racial make up of some of the leading actors, all of which seem to have been done in the interest of the connectedness theme, but ends up feeling somewhat forced and more than a little toe-curling. But these are minor complaints which I am happy to overlook when calling this film a remarkable effort, somewhat limited by the story it had to work with."
"Troy_Campbell","7","0","3","1 March 2013"," Flawed grand-scale story telling.
","Six separate stories taking place in six vastly different time periods and six varying locations, yet thematically and spiritually linked; a group of actors playing a bunch of different characters regardless of age, race or sex; genres covered include futuristic sci-fi, journalistic thriller, slapstick comedy, period drama, apocalyptic adventure and poetic melodrama; 172 minutes long. It's safe to say that Cloud Atlas is not your usual mainstream epic. Adapted from David Mitchell's acclaimed novel by the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix) and Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) - all three of whom also direct - this is an ambitious, intriguing and commendable motion picture that is undoubtedly best to experience on the big screen. Visually sumptuous - whether stuck on a boat in the mid 1800's or flying around in Neo Seoul in the 22nd century - and boasting an amazing sound mix, a home viewing won't be able to do it justice. It's a shame then, that there are also glaring faults that are hard to shake off. Most notable is the choice to push the boundaries of which actors play which characters; whether it's purely because of bad make-up (Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant portraying Asians just doesn't fly) or due to serious miscasting (Tom Hanks as a cockney thug), it's often distracting and a huge miscalculation on behalf of the creative team. The lack of a powerful ending also diminishes the overall oomph of Cloud Atlas, yet it remains a recommendable piece of grand-scale story telling that is rarely seen in cinemas today."

","CLOUD ATLAS is a multi-layered mosaic,sometimes plodding, sometimes frenetic, spanning various centuries, with top-drawer names in multiple roles. If you get past the sometimes unintelligible dialog of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Susan Sarandon (others speak more clearly), and the yawn-inducing slow pace of the film's first half, much can be enjoyed from the directorial trio of Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowksy (helmers of the MATRIX films) and Tom Tykwer, as an experimentally ambitious project. We are given a kaledeiscopic ride of history, romance, villainy and intrigue, and lends us ponderous insight into the workings and vagaries of the human soul (and human mind). The story arcs overlap and intersect, some with bittersweet endings, others with catharsis and hope. The sci-fi subplot (with medieval Hanks and alien-like Berry) goes on a bit too long, but the other stories fare better. Comic relief comes deliciously from Jim Broadbent, as is villainy from Hanks and MATRIX costar Hugo Weaving. The sets are fantastically designed and the music, throbbing, is excellent"

All other actors contribute the essence of the idea ideally to the story. Even Hugh Grant is perfectly placed into it.<br/><br/>I would have loved the outlook of the whole movie more comic-book-like. More like ""300"" or ""Sin City"". It would have made it more independent of the times of the different stories and their plot.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, a movie worth watching it more than once.

","Oh wait, that was Lorax. After reading the first dozen user reviews searching for someone who reads this film's thesis as I do, I am quitting that quest and putting fingers to keys.<br/><br/>The film's unique convention is to employ seven key actors portraying several lives they have lived/are living/will live across centuries, into the future. Reincarnation, not simply, ""Tom Hanks plays several characters.""<br/><br/>The arc of each life is therefore much more expansive than in traditional storytelling, and the rules in force tell us that actions in past lives carry forward and must be reconciled in some future life, for a life to be content. <br/><br/>The non-linear inter-cutting of multiple situations and arcs starts in the first minute and challenges the viewer to connect dots until a unifying thesis emerges - that institutionalized oppression is evil and overwhelming, yes, and must be challenged by individuals, no matter how long the odds seem to be against the individual. <br/><br/>There are countless stories across time that tell of a hero's quest to take action to defeat evil and restore balance. Quite unlike most of them, this film has a wildly expansive and elaborately ornate unfolding. It is, in singular moments, very funny, very shocking, wonderfully swashbuckling, downright spacey, and magical/mythical. On the flip side, the main storyline with Halle Berry's impossible to understand futuristic traveler character is full of sketchy material that raises more questions than the film answers, and none of it is important (who put that mountain on earth - the one that can be converted to a huge satellite dish with a blue laser beacon at the touch of a button, and for that matter, WTF was she doing on Earth anyway? She flew in on what looked like a pretty slick, perfectly functional spacecraft?) All this detracts and confuses, and in a three hour movie, it's just too much sht squeezed into one sack.<br/><br/>Others call this a masterpiece. Well, certainly the production quality is sky high in every regard, and that is where a large portion of the audience form their impressions.<br/><br/>My takeaway: this is a very creative, very well made, very challenging to follow and hugely indulgent vehicle for the author(s) to make their point. <br/><br/>One odd detail: most people die of head trauma. If there is a significance that makes this vital to the thesis, it remains obscure to me in hindsight."

It does, however, feel like you are watching six movies at the same time and it is just a montage of scenes from movies Hugh Grant, Hugo Weaving, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry have featured in. I'm trying to avoid spoilers here so I'm going to be as vague about the following as I can possibly be. However, if you have not seen the movie and wish to go into it knowing nothing about it beyond the long-winded trailer, I suggest you skip to the brackets after these next two sentences. The first scene with Tom Hanks as a tribesman features an emotional event we are clearly expected to cry at. In short, we don't. (YOU CAN START READING AGAIN) This nearly defines the movie in it's entirety. We are thrown between stories so often that we don't have time to grow attached to any of the characters. The efforts of the directors to go into as much emotional detail as possible proves futile as we know far too little about the characters. The characters are so complex that it would take far longer than half an hour or less (which is what we are given) to feel any personal link between the two. The most emotional scene in the movie still is not enough to bring a tear to the eye of a person watching it for the first time. It might, however, work on someone who is watching the movie for the third or fourth time because they have been given time to break down the character. We are left trying to figure out what happened in story A and how it connects with story B while we are being shown historic events in story C and, while we are seeing these time-changing events unfurl, we are still too preoccupied trying to figure out why the hell that happened in story D to know what is happening. It can be argued by some man who calls himself film geek that ""superior intellect is required to understand Cloud Atlas"" but that is not true. The stories are not THAT complex, you just need more time than you are given in the cinema, where you can't pause or rewind, to think about it. It will become some sort of cult classic because people are going to start reading too deep into the story when really all there is is that people are living the same lives at different times over and over again. It is quite an interesting concept that souls are crossing paths again and again and that people, for example, feel as though they have seen something before because they saw it in their past life. Redeeming features are the photography and one small, quite detached story about an old publisher in debt who is tangled up in a series of unfortunate events that act as the porter in Macbeth, providing very little more than comic relief. In conclusion, I do recommend the movie but don't get your hopes up. It is not all it is made out to be by the trailer, falling just short of six minutes. The movie would make more sense if it was the, lets say, 35-plus hours long it would need to be to explain every story properly. Each story is beautifully crafted but just not long enough. It's more like the book was a collection of short stories that are loosely connected than a novel."
"vindstilla","5","0","3","27 December 2012"," A confusing failure
","I personally like fantasy and the escapism it provides, but a fantasy movie with the pretensions of being a drama is always at risk of becoming more of an unintended joke than a serious and gripping story. Unfortunately, Cloud Atlas completely fails to live up to its high set goals. The storyline feels forced, likewise the acting, and it is painful to see how hard everyone is trying to hold this impossible saga together and force some sense into it. There are loose ends everywhere and the multiple plots are confusing and poorly interconnected. The movie makers are trying to deliver some kind of universal and powerful message, but at the end of the movie that message still has failed to reach me. All I see is Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant everywhere, dressed up as different silly characters that has nothing to do with each other. It all makes me smirk, but at least that means the movie is entertaining in a way, and I thus manage to endure the drawn out three hours."

","All the starts that I give is for the music and the CGI or SFX. The plot is too rusty to understand. Yet some plot points are way too chafed and over-clichÃ©d. Cloud Atlas failed to impress me because even though it has my favorite non-linear type of narration, the plot slips into ambiguity. What is the writer trying to prove or convey here? The pivotal thing remains a secret, however.<br/><br/>The cast is good, with some serious acting by Tom Hanks, but Halle Berry quite didn't fill up the cavity which I see as a flaw. The Michael Caine impersonator was funny, though!<br/><br/>It is too long (around 3 hours) to sit and watch plus it doesn't throw any new, inventive or thrilling points for us to consider. Cloud Atlas, boasting as the costliest independent film, is not at all a good movie to enjoy your Christmas, or any other day for that matter. I am fatigued.<br/><br/>WATCH OUT FOR: Huge Weaving's phenomenal performance.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 60% NO<br/><br/>Language: No | Sex: Strong | Mouth-Kiss: Yes | Foreplay: Yes | Gore: Yes | Nudity: Strong | Drugs: No"

","Cloud Atlas is certainly the most ambitious movie of the year, with dual directors (the Wachowskis and Tom Tywker both shot all scenes dually), six time lines, actors in six roles and nearing three hours. I still cannot entirely describe what the movie was about, but nonetheless Cloud Atlas is an impressive ride for its entire length. And while the story is difficult to follow, it hardly is a failure: Cloud Atlas sucks you in anyway. And I suspect another watch will clear up things. The cast is all-round impressive. The make-up even more, with actors turning into hardly recognizable character, sometimes changing gender or race. Hugo Weaving is a scene-stealer. Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant are surprisingly versatile as well. For now a 7, quite possibly an 8 on re-watch."
"jeroen-106","6","0","2","23 December 2012"," Too ambitious
","I guess this story is so complex, it belongs to a book - not a movie. I've been staring at great visuals. The storyline is...something. But it all feels insignificant. Just before I start to care about the character, I'm thrown into another era with the same characters dressed as someone else. I just makes me...not care. They seem to transcend death anyway so why bother?<br/><br/>Everything is presented at a level of perfection and in so much quantities. Epic is an understatement. What's left for the viewer to imagine? <br/><br/>I cannot escape the fact the animators are a team of designers with a mouse. They're not auteurs. They're not feeling anything as they animate. Great graphics. So what? The greatest animators put a ton of subtlety and personal feeling into their work. The world of Cloud Atlas just feels sterile."
"Sage-c4","6","0","2","7 December 2012"," A patchwork pastiche or an omlet du homage
","Filled with accomplished acting, but like everything else about it, uneven. The multiple roles played by the principle actors seem to have been given varying attention, and the mediocre makeup does not conceal the poor casting for some of the roles. Sadly, Tom Hanks never vanished into any of his roles. He remains the American Everyman whether playing the post apocalyptic Hawaiian tribesman with the Beyond Thunderdome dialect, or the despicable physician with the Austen Powers teeth. Then there's a bewildering mashup of Fu Manchu makeup, Bert the chimney sweep accent, and Caponean efficacy (where's the baseball bat?). Hanks remains. Hugo Weaving essentially reprises his Matrix Agent twice, once with heavy makeup and once without. He does a campy turn as a Cuckoos Nest nurse, and a mesmerizing and convincingly diabolical job as an Elm Streetesque phantom, marred not by his acting, but by some of his lines, seemingly lifted from the recent Exocist Begins (or is it Xorcist Origins?) film. Still a stunningly creepy performance. Hugh Grant does a fair James Caan for a Brit, vanishes into exotic tribesman makeup, but then the olderizing makeup fails poolside - wierdly, he didn't even appear British in that scene... I am not a Halle Berry fan, but her work in this film is refined, maybe the understatement makes her stand out alongside the Tarantino- infused characters. I believed her characters, despite the transforming makeup. The rest of the film is just good. There is some real emotional poignancy to the Do Androids Dream of Logan's Run segment and the closet melodrama about the music (I swear I've seen that before, but I can't place it). Cloud Atlas is not an original, but an assemblage of homages to other films, unfortunately of several genres, ranking from camp to high art. The uneven application of talent - script, acting, makeup - is not an achievement worthy of praise. Nevertheless, the good pieces shine through, and are worth watching. If one wasn't constantly distracted trying to remember where one had seen each scene in another film, it would rank somewhere above Waterworld and on a par with Fifth Element, somewhat below 12 Monkeys, and half an order of magnitude below Inception."
"mr-davis85","7","0","1","4 December 2012"," Kept my attention, was interesting, yet fell short of epic [*** of four]
","The concept of Cloud Atlas is most fascinating, to view the Hindu New Age/ Eastern religion and philosophical notions play out over a period of about 500 years. The movie's philosophical messages remains consistent to the very end. There is a portion of the movie at the very end that is a fulfillment to a theme present throughout the movie...it's all I can say about it, the movie ends on a great note.<br/><br/>The make-up/ special effects are like no other...Halle Berry playing a Victorian era white woman using hair color and colored contact lenses is amazing. Asians playing Caucasians and vice versa...men playing women...Hugh Grant as a post-apocalyptic war chief who solely grunts....truly amazing. However, some portions of the movie caused this movie to fall just short of epic to me and ventured into being ridiculous.....for instance, that a Mystery Movie Theatre style movie about a nursing home break out that took place app. 300 years earlier inspires a revolution that inspires a system of organized religion hundreds of years later on seemed ridiculous to me. Also, Tom Hanks speaking some form of pigeon/ Caribbeanesque English was hysterical and that's just the ""true-true."" . The movie is well connected, a major and essential feat for this kind of movie....no other movie spans 500 years so easily in one continuous thread and going back and forth as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Cloud Atlas is enjoyable, it's entertaining, and keeps your attention the entire almost 3hr running time, but some inherent plot flaws in the continuous story from the present day forward as well as some poorly done acts and scenes cause this movie to fall short of the epic it could have been. Overall, it is a movie worth checking out. Like I said, the movie ends very well in a way that subtly fulfills a main theme of the movie."
"Radu_A","8","0","3","1 December 2012"," Epic bonus, but something's missing...
","I love epics, but they can be a drag - if you have to wait too long for the resolution of a story you can make a good guess at, the pleasure of watching a well developed story can turn to pain. 'Cloud Atlas', however, never runs into this dilemma because it presents six movies bundled up into one, set in time-lines from 1849 until a dystopian future. What could have been confusing is held together quite nicely by the overlaying theme of reincarnation and - perhaps more importantly - purpose: no individual effort, as hopeless as it may seem, is ever in vain, as it transcends the time to influence the actions and feelings of others, like music does (the title-giving 'Cloud Atlas' sextet).<br/><br/>The way the stories are edited to meander into another is definitely the most interesting aspect of this largely German production - it's kind of rewarding to see about a hundred million of our tax dollars spent on an honest artistic effort, rather than the bottomless pit formerly known as Greece. And still, notwithstanding the great ensemble acting, some of the stories work better than others, which suffer from a bit of oversimplification and predictability. Top of my pick would be the present-day set retirement home escape plot featuring a brilliant Jim Broadbent, because it's keeping to the essentials and still features quite a few surprises. The Hawaii-set post-apocalyptic bit is also impressive due to a somewhat logical (if from my perspective pessimistic) conclusion. And this story also features Hugo Weaving's best part.<br/><br/>Less convincing to me, however, was the futuristic part; the replicant, pardon, fabricant played by Doona Bae - who does a great job reminiscent of her part in 'Air Doll' - too strongly recalls 'Blade Runner' topics without devoting sufficient character development time. And the look is way too similar to 'Matrix' - the Wachowskis would have been better advised to go for an unestablished style, because this way, you can't help trying to associate the story with 'Matrix', since you're visually coerced to do so. And because of this, the 'Messiah' aspect of the story feels overplayed and out of sync with the more lyrical parts of the movie. The composer bit set in 1931 also felt a little shallow, kind of like 'Let's add a bit of Merchant-Ivory E.M. Forster flair here for contrast'. Too much focus on style, not enough focus on acting credibility, as is mostly the case in Tykwer's international oeuvre. <br/><br/>But all in all, it's definitely one of the more intelligent and yet entertaining outings this year: It's never boring, and it's never dumb. It's just not quite a masterpiece. As far as anti-progress stories are concerned - and you'll notice that all six stories in 'Cloud Atlas' are in some respect anti-progress -, nothing beats Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto' in my opinion. As far as time jumps are concerned, 'Mr. Nobody' by Jaco Van Dormael is far more elegant - a must watch if you liked this film. And as far as opulent visual style is concerned, 'The Fall' by Tarsem is far superior. Still, watch it on the big screen while you can, because epics are rare cinematic pleasures these days, and usually the German Film Fund doesn't have this kind of money."
"ecchi-169-864027","9","0","5","19 November 2012"," Very good, but not great.
","It is silly, but the main problem with this movie, is that it is too eager to please. This movie is epic and petty-minded, intense and slow, funny and sad, romantic and action-packed, critical and naive, complex and entertaining, religious and scientific. There's so much of everything, that it bursts at the seams. For the most part, this lack of integrity is intangible, but I can point out one good example: Each member of the main cast plays several different roles. Between roles,they are visually transformed by make-up and prosthetics. You remember the guy who played Neo's main antagonist in the Matrix trilogy?(He also played an elf in Lord of the Rings.) Well, imagine that guy dressed up and made to look like a woman. It is funny and kinda fits that bit of the plot, but it throws a bad light on the serious characters in serious situations that just look involuntarily uncanny.<br/><br/>Some very personal critique: (The following two paragraphs can be considered big spoilers.)<br/><br/>A big part of the plot is inspired by ""Soilent Green is people"", but with the purpose of shading light on things that happen in the contemporary food industry. It is such a heavy subject that it should not be made into a fraction of a movie that is about something else and nothing and at all.<br/><br/>The movie contains hard science-fiction, but the entire story is based on the ideas of karma and rebirth. To me, that's like sitting on two chairs. But, to be fair, almost every good story features an element of karma. In the end, the bad guys are punished, as if it were some sort of divine retribution for their sins. That is what we want to see. <br/><br/>Finally: This movie is worth your time and money, it will stay with you and maybe make you think. And in that sense, it offers you far more than most movies.<br/><br/>For me personally, it's very good entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less."
"patryk-czekaj","7","0","4","9 November 2012"," Cloud Atlas set the bar far too high
","A mind-numbing, philosophically-challenging movie that wants to achieve too much with its complex, erratic plot-line. Intertwining five different stories, Cloud Atlas ponders many intriguing topics, such as reincarnation, determinism, faith, metamorphosis, and the way people's lives in different eras combine and form history as we know it. While though-provoking and engaging, the film doesn't necessarily arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory enough for the audiences.<br/><br/>Even though - through its most Hollywood-like ending - Cloud Atlas tries to answer all the question stated in its over-complicated mash-up of interconnected tales, the manner in which it philosophizes might sound too superficial at times. It's safe to say that the movie purposefully wants to drag the viewers into its prodigious, unfathomable universe with an especially incoherent storyline (still, connecting all the dots by oneself gives great amount of pleasure). Furthermore, it's a rather weighty mixture of genres, all wrapped up in a neat package of astounding visual effects and eye-popping landscapes.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the same actors play unevenly in various segments, and the blame is on the directors' side (there is a distinction between the way all the parts are directed and it's significant to note that there is a visible difference in the filmmakers' styles). Cloud Atlas is an epic film, but in that case it's not a strong and authentic compliment. Its premise is undeniably enormous and smashing, but the substance calls for some sure rewrites.<br/><br/>In defense of the whole movie it's crucial to say that the book of the same name was named one of the most 'unfilmable' of all. By trying to play subconsciously on people's imagination, the picture invites us to an unknown world filled with artificial characters with too many plastic surgeries, and to a place where some stories seem too redundant and insignificant in the final evaluation. While ambitious, Cloud Atlas evaluates its themes briefly and arrives at a conclusion that's not to be grasped wholeheartedly."
