"gogoschka-1","Null","113","132","28 May 2016"," Sadly, this doesn't feel like a complete film at all - but it offers a surprisingly realistic portrayal of a totalitarian society on the brink of an all-out civil war
","It appears I'm in a minority here, because I actually liked 'Mockingjay: Part 1'. Now bear with me for a moment before you rip this review to shreds and please at least hear (or read) me out.<br/><br/>I do absolutely acknowledge that unlike the two previous films, 'Mockingjay: Part 1' doesn't feel like a complete film; it is practically all build-up and doesn't have a proper ending, and I agree that splitting the last book into two films was an inherently stupid, purely greed-driven decision by the studio. Also, due to that idiotic split of the last chapter, the film is largely deprived of the action/adventure elements that so many fans loved in the first two films, which must be especially disappointing to non-book-readers who didn't expect such a drastic change in tone. But if we ignore its most obvious flaws for a moment, the film has actually quite a few things going for it.<br/><br/>For instance, it offers a surprisingly realistic portrayal of a totalitarian society on the brink of an all-out civil war, and unlike other Hollywood adaptations of such tales, it dares to put the emphasis on the human drama instead of the special effects. And it remains faithful to the book: it would have been fairly easy to invent a couple of heroic battle scenes to amp up the spectacle (Hollywood is notorious for such disregard of source material - and such disregard for the fans), and I must say I appreciated the film precisely because of its NOT solely action-driven narrative.<br/><br/>But the most impressive aspect about 'Mockingjay: Part 1' is how layered it actually is. This is not the good-against-evil story of the first two films anymore: this is a really smart study on how propaganda works and how one fascist system is about to be replaced - albeit with the best intentions - by another. This kind of moral ambiguity (and again: faithfulness to the novel) is not what we usually get in blockbusters aimed at teenagers, and for that alone the film deserves some credit.<br/><br/>Also, what the film does masterfully, is showing how Katniss transforms upon the devastating realization that she has helped - or has been instrumentalised - to set a process in motion that she can neither stop nor control, a process which has already led to a terrible loss of human life for which she now feels responsible. She is torn apart by inner conflict because her hate for Snow and everything he stands for is bigger than ever - yet at same time, it begins to dawn on her that the leaders of the rebellion employ methods which don't seem to be all that different. The lines between what is morally acceptable and what is not start to blur. A very wise person once said: ""War makes fascists of us all"" - I believe 'Mockingjay: Part 1' does an excellent job at getting that point across.<br/><br/>Unlike in most popcorn movies, there are no mere black and white characters here (well, except maybe for Snow); instead, we get a story that - for once - hasn't been dumbed down and functions as a sincere exploration of an escalating civil war that threatens to consume everyone. And unlike most YA adaptations, the film doesn't shy away from showing what that means: the audience is left in no doubt about the human toll this revolution will take in the end.<br/><br/>Maybe the current situation in countries like Syria after the initially peaceful revolution that was the Arab Spring made this film resonate more with me than it should have, but I was surprised at how un- Hollywood-like this was done. And I can't stress this enough: Jennifer Lawrence MAKES this film; the whole franchise, really. The emotional intensity she brings to Katniss feels so real; it's the kind of performance that, in this kind of film, sadly often gets overlooked, but I sincerely doubt a better Katniss could ever have been found.<br/><br/>So my final verdict on the film: 'Mockingjay: Part 1' offers intelligent entertainment that doesn't solely rely on special effects and one mindless action scene after another. It's a fitting continuation of Katniss' journey, but - and that is the one serious downside to this film - it doesn't lead that journey to its logical conclusion. That the studio wants you to pay once more to see how the journey ends may be understandable from a financial standpoint, but it is a major flaw in the storytelling of an otherwise very good film. Likewise, the final chapter in the series (Mockingjay: Part 2) will likely suffer from having to do without all the dramatic build-up that Part 1 offers. <br/><br/>Still, there is a lot to like in this film and it is far from the boring mess so many reviews made it out to be: 7 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"Vartiainen","Null","35","39","31 January 2015"," Why is this in two parts?
","The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it's about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we've had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.<br/><br/>Not to say you shouldn't see this one if you've liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they've always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.<br/><br/>What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There's very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.<br/><br/>Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you've seen the movie.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form."
"coatic","3","443","654","20 November 2014"," Very Slow Pace; Almost 2 Hours of Melodrama with No Payoff
","Let me first note that I am an avid movie-goer, but not a reader of the books. I did, however, watch the first two Hunger Games movies and was pleasantly surprised by them. They kept my attention, with plot and performances intriguing and action-packed enough to get from one scene to the next without a dull moment.<br/><br/>This latest installment is the exact opposite. The movie opens with some melodramatic scenes where Katniss (JLaw) suffers from previous trauma, then scene after scene just keeps rehashing the same weepy look on her face partnered with some sentimental background music. ""Remember how President Snow tried to kill everyone in our district? Sniff."" followed by ""How could he do this again in this district? Sniff."" then ""Why is he doing this to my friends? Sniff."" over and over until the end. Imagine that for 2 hours. That is essentially this movie.<br/><br/>Other scenes later on are just variations of the same - different scenery (a town in ruins, a mountain lake, a bomb shelter), different characters to ruminate with (the old flame Gale, old allies like Finnick and new ones like the District 13 folks, the sister Prim) - but they essentially are the same scene. I really wanted to tell the director the whole time: ""Ok I get it, they are all angry and hurt. Now what? Please advance the story."" I understand this treatment is beneficial at the start to provide some exposition on how the characters are brewing in their discontent and how it all boils over later on, but that's also what the first two movies already established. To fill 2 hours of the supposedly climactic final chapter with further exposition is just too much, perhaps unless you truly are a solid fan and have the patience to wait it out.<br/><br/>There was one final part in this movie that was intended to be a climax of sorts before the cliffhanger. It's the only scene that promises some sort of cathartic, action-packed sequence, but they skip the meat and flash-forward until after the event concludes.<br/><br/>There were, however, some good scenes of rebels rousing here and there that were quite entertaining even if they were also just more exposition fodder. At least they reminded me to wake up from time to time.<br/><br/>I think this is the unfortunate fault of the cash-grab strategy of trying to split the last book into two parts. The movie just feels so out of place with regards to momentum, which was a very positive thing going for the storyline in the first two movies. Even though Catching Fire was essentially just going back to the Hunger Games, it still felt fast and different enough to keep me tuned in. This movie managed to rehash itself endlessly and leave me feeling like nothing of gravity happened after my viewing experience... and it tried so hard to make me care via the melodrama, yet I am left unsold."
"jimscant6901","7","36","47","20 March 2015"," Please stop comparing these films to Battle Royale!
","They're totally different in mood, feelings, and content. Hunger Games gets to see a female lead and one who doesn't have to use sex or promiscuity to be powerful! That alone makes this book/film franchise a winner in America. People, please remember that most stories are merely adaptations of other stories told before, just like with Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, etc. There have simply been too many creators writing for too many years for anything to be truly fresh and original anymore. Almost every story you read or film you watch is lifted from a story told before (think about Disney-Almost none of their films are original, yet everyone loves them!). So while you're bashing all of the Rip-Off artists, like Suzanne Collins, just think about how many of your favorite books or films may have been stolen from someone else's idea, perhaps even hundreds of years ago."
"jmacdavidson","4","368","570","21 November 2014"," Is there such thing as a set-up movie?
","I had never heard the term ""set-up movie"" before today. There has definitely been a trend of splitting up a story into multiple movies. These movies don't have a beginning-middle-end the same way other movies do but at the very least there's some progress. <br/><br/>The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly made. In fact, there is a lot of excitement in this movie. The problem is that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes. If you look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they are in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens in the very end. Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much of the effects of her actions.<br/><br/>I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning. I just can't give this my seal of approval when I left the theater feeling like I saw half a movie. By the time the story gets its payoff my memory of this movie will be worn-off."
"seanandrewstevens6","1","41","57","13 December 2014"," Minor Stuff goes on in a bunker for 2 hours: The Movie
","I came out of the movie theater annoyed, and I felt like I wasted my time. The acting wasn't very good, and the plot felt like it was moving at an extremely slow pace. The action scenes were cheesy, and nothing actually happened besides rescuing the captured tributes. This being shortened into a one hour movie in my opinion would have been much better.<br/><br/>The movie should be renamed, 'Minor Stuff goes on in a bunker for 2 hours: The Movie'<br/><br/>I really hope the next HG movie makes up for this one. All of the dialog was cheesy, and unrealistic. A 3 hour Mockingjay movie would have been much better."
"memefactory","1","294","463","21 December 2014"," Dull as dull can be
","Like watching paint dry. Boring to a mind-numbing degree. How many times can we see Katniss be horrified and/or emotionally distraught? Maybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their characters. Well, they were wrong. Instead we, the audience, sit through one scene after another in which really nothing happens at all. This whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes and then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the film. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises. Not good storytelling."
"lianpeled","3","456","739","20 November 2014"," Slow, boring with poor acting
","Let me say it right now; I hated this movie. It was bad. Look, the concept of a film being cut into two parts just does not work. The whole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and moving uncomfortably in my seat. There really isn't anything special going on as it progresses, too. There is war going on, but they do not really show it and it doesn't suck you in. It's very slow paced with lots of teenage drama and not a lot of ""games"" or ""hunger"" as in the previous films (which I liked, by the way). And now there's Jennifer Lawrence's acting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; thus making the first half boring, isn't a very good one. And in this case ""not very good"" is a compliment. 3/10"

"vistheindian","6","68","104","23 November 2014"," Sprint to a dull crawl
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After the events of 75th Hunger Games, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescued and brought to District 13 where the rebellion is brewing. Now she must become the face of the rebellion as both sides use propaganda against each other. Meanwhile, Katniss is overwhelmed by balancing her responsibility to the people of Panem with her desire to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Mockingjay Part 1 is strong when it comes to the acting talent involved and showing the behinds the scenes propaganda of war. However, the decision to split the story into two parts has really hurt this movie by making it feel incomplete and filled with overstretched melodrama. While it is not a complete failure, it may be better to hold off watching this movie till Part 2 is released.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I never read the books but I enjoyed the last two movies in the franchise, especially Catching Fire. While I can't say I was aching to go see Mockingjay Part 1, I was interested to know how the story progressed after the cliff-hanger of the last movie. I was concerned that splitting the story into two parts may have been a detrimental choice, unfortunately my concerns were legitimate.<br/><br/>I know I'm coming off really negative but there are definitely some gems in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, were the best part of the movie. Watching them clash and play strategic moves against each other was intriguing. The rest of the cast do a good job in showing how they have been affected and changed by this war. This is the first time we see the world outside of the actual Hunger Games and District 12, which helped enrich this movie's universe. Uniquely we get see how propaganda plays an important role in the war. I can't remember the last war movie that delved into that aspect. On top of that, these propaganda pieces were very moving thanks to the rage fueled words of Katniss and the fear mongering of Snow.<br/><br/>A lot of the problems for this movie stem from the fact we are spending 2hrs on half a story. This led to us having an entire movie where Katniss keeps crying and moping about either Peeta or the people of District 12 being dead. The feeling that the movie is overstretched is only compounded by how several scenes are just a rehash of a previous scene, for example the recording of a propaganda (3 times) and multiple scenes per character sulking about the people suffering. Look I'm not heartless, I understand those are devastating things to happen to a person, but we want to see the story move forward. I can honestly say that apart from Katniss becoming the face of the rebellion, there is no significant plot development since Catching Fire. There is all this slow build up but that's all it is, a build up to an end that is unsatisfying. Essentially this is a 2hr preview ad for Mockingjay Part 2, and quite frankly I felt mad about this when I left the cinema, and that doesn't happen often.<br/><br/>The pathetic cash-grab moves by studios to split the movie into two parts is the root of all the problems for Mockingjay Part 1. To fill the run time the movie is stuffed full with melodrama without much weight to make you care for long. All the momentum that the previous two movies had built has now come to a dull crawl. I'd recommend skipping this movie till Part 2 is released and hopefully enjoy a more complete story.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"angelino-878-406789","3","36","52","10 December 2014"," What have happened here?
","No, seriously? I thought I made a huge mistake and went to a kinder garden movie or something. At the end of this film there was a very serious dilemma in my mind – to cry or to laugh. To cry for the time and money I spend, or to laugh at what I just saw? To cry for the people who will be misled by their expectations from the book, or to laugh about the people who actually put a lot of effort in creating this ""thing"".<br/><br/>Where to begin? Directing. May be Francis Lawrence idea was to show us that he is capable of making bad movies as well as good ones. Constantine was good. A little bit above average. I am Legend was very good! Especially for the fans of the genre. Water for Elephants was a soap opera but it wasn't bad. And now this  My guess is that he left his skills, his talent and everything he knew about creating movies and started from the bottom. I felt like the director of this movie was learning how to direct during this shootings  Usually what we see on the screen is the director perspective of the story. We see how he sees things. If this is his perspective about this potentially good plot, than he is the one to blame for the crap we see.<br/><br/>Adaptation. I didn't read the books. They weren't so famous in my country when the first movie came on the big screen. At first I was interested. I am a fantasy fan, a sci-fi fan I love this kind of stories. Some things didn't make sense but it was all right. Then the second movie repeated everything from the first one. Why? And on top of that the story doesn't give anything original or unique. I have read a lot of similar books and I have watched a lot of similar films. Where is the one thing that is supposed to grab the attention? May be the book is better. But there is nothing in the world that can make me read it now.<br/><br/>Dialogue. OMG. This was seriously the worst part of this movie. Who wrote that script? Hello! We are not that dumb, okay? Most of the sentences were as simple as they were written for children. Every scene was so obvious that everyone should be able to predict it! Most of the lines for the main characters were extremely lame and flat. You can hear your mind finishing the speech before the actors said it.<br/><br/>I can continue more and more but this is enough. The last thing – *SPOILER* the scene with the sister where she left her cat and she ran to save it. HA-HA-HA :D. 5 minutes of creating funny tension with loud sounds and creepy music. Just a lot of shouting and running up and down. A scene totally unrelated with the plot, completely useless in terms of creating or developing character (if there is developing of any kind :D) and absolutely boring. <br/><br/>1 point for Jenifer Lawrence, 1 point in memory of Seymour Hoffman and 1 point for the movie."
"patrickfile","4","20","27","9 December 2014"," HALF MOVIE ---> a pride for the ""industry""...but a shame for entertainment.
","This film gets the primary goal for its creation: to MAKE MONEY.<br/><br/>They had to use 2 parts in order to sell lot of tickets, twice if possible, and to do that they dedicated to extend EVERY POSSIBLE SCENE to a lenght and tedious dimension I thought I would never seen in this movie series.<br/><br/>From the moment I saw the trailer, I started to suspect, but with the benefit of the doubt, went to the theater and man, what a disappointment.<br/><br/>It does not deserves a 0/10, lets make this clear, because the acting is not bad. But it does not deserves, in my opinion, more than a 4/10, since we have been given HALF MOVIE.<br/><br/>I feel robbed, and I feeli should be allowed to see the second part FOR FREE."
"chaos-rampant","Null","10","12","8 March 2015"," Propped artifice
","This is the third time I'm going to note about one of these that they're a product of the most blatant cynicism where Hollywood ""sponsors"" pretend to educate about things they don't believe in and have consigned beyond the sphere of having any relevance.<br/><br/>This is obvious here in a revolution against oppressive authority that can only happen with a video crew tagging along and turning it into film, with spontaneous speeches and reactions because the heroine is being paced through scenes where she can be filmed in them.<br/><br/>Underneath it all of course we're supposed to see real destruction, pain, oppression, but in context of this cartoony world what is it but more unreal and distanced? No contrast escapes the mawkishness; nature is pure, democracy a drab necessity, oppression a blatant evil.<br/><br/>And however much value it purports to place on the power of image, the truth of spontaneity and so on, it ends up doing the opposite, image that has no real power, spontaneity that has been staged, the real thing beyond anyone's grasp and care; it's enough for images to be stickied on a narrative that justifies the means.<br/><br/>In this sense it's disastrous work that closes portals in the imagination, but then again I'm not fussed; teens and preteens will outgrow it like we did the inanities of our time and grow to find value in something that chronicles the hardships of making sense without the contrivance.<br/><br/>If I could nudge them in that direction it would be Harmony Korine, a film like Spring Breakers; a film without pretense of an important message, whose truly radical importance is a balancing it demands of the viewer between the colorful urge to revel and truth of its value."
"jadepietro","3","30","43","25 November 2014"," Hunger Pains
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is the third installment of this series. And it's getting progressively worse. This Hunger Games 3 is an incomplete complete mess. It should be more accurately called Hunger Games 2½, as it ends abruptly with the sole purpose to rake in more money from its movie-going audience. However, I do agree with the downtrodden in this film: let's start the revolution, but aim it against the Hollywood studios and their greed.<br/><br/>The film starts off immediately from where we ended in Part Two. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has be taken by rebel forces and her love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), has been left behind at the Capitol, captured by the evil President Snow while her close friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) pines forlornly for her. Katniss discovers that her hometown, District 12 has been destroyed and a new band of fighters have joined forces to overthrow the corrupt government, led by female president elect Coin (Julianne Moore, speaking in a low monotone voice that is suppose to resemble authority) who wants Katniss to become their spokesperson and leader of the uprising, its Mockingjay. <br/><br/>Misdirected by Francis Lawrence, who doesn't build any tension in this part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is so S-L-O-W that it appears lifeless. While the other previous films had some spark and wit to them, this one is dreary and sanctimonious. Everyone is way too serious or bland or ready to cry a single tear to show that they are really hurting inside. Believe me, it's the audience that should be crying! A feeling of distress felt by these characters overcame me in the same way as I watched this dreadful film.<br/><br/>The actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine and a smirking self-righteous Donald Sutherland, do a yeoman-like job with a script that is filled with filler and lots of talk, but very little action. The script by Peter Craig and Danny Strong plods along with none of the speechifying being credible or interesting. Many of the more colorful characters established in this series are undervalued and underused. Fleeting moments of pleasure are given by Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and the aforementioned Josh Hutcherson. They are mere afterthoughts to the dull sluggish plot. Only the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a controlling empowered publicist Plutarch Heavensbee and Elizabeth Banks as the vain Effie make an impression, giving the film a hint of comic relief it sorely needs.<br/><br/>For a sci-fi adventure film, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 has very little of both, and no hunger games at all. This is one of the more disappointing sequels ever made, not deserving of one more chapter, let alone two. Teens may enjoy this dumb movie, but I suffered hunger pains watching this insufferable movie.

At the beginning I liked it, because many parts of the book found their way into the movie. But I realised transferring the story of a book 1:1 into a movie isn't that good.<br/><br/>(NO SPOILER) As an example they need about 5-10 minutes just to go down a staircase, back upwards because ""missing"" something and down again. And nothing really happens. All the time absolutely no excitement rose in me and I just got bored. And I am pretty sure this should be a part where your heartbeat is meant to been rising.<br/><br/>Sure there are some nice and decent scenes but most of the stuff is just lame. In the book it works but clearly not in the Movie (plus the showdown of the book is missing because of the split).<br/><br/>But at least I enjoyed the screenplay of Josh Hutcherson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, which lifted the Movie ""up"" to 3 Stars.

I don't see how they couldn't make mockingjay just one film, even if it lasts 2 and a half hours. I haven't read the books so I'm not sure how much is left to see but nothing happens in the film.

But this is Hollywood greed and short sightedness at it's absolute worst.

","I really wanted to like this movie, trust me. I tried giving the books a shot and didn't like the style, the first movie was alright but the second was pretty good. This movie however, is filled with the most arbitrary plot points a five year old could possibly conceive. It seems that the entire resistance movement spends the movie convincing themselves that Katniss and her boy toy matter in the scheme of things. Honestly I'd be spoiling the plot if I elaborated, but it involves dropping flowers after a bombing run, throwing around intel like hot potatoes, and the weakest sleeper agent anyone could find. Honestly the presidents actions have become so contrived that every scene he had was him being filled in on how stupid his enemies were and then just staring off into the distance and muttering something cryptic. There were so many stupid scenes that I laughed out loud several times. There was seriously a scene where a deer looks at Katniss pointing a bow at it and just casually looks away. Gale then mutters ""it's never been hunted before."" Apparently the screenwriters believe fear and fight or flight are conditioned responses. There was also a scene with Katniss, a flashlight and a cat, where she plays that game that everyone plays with cats where they chase the light.

","This movie, as indicated in the summary, did not have a plot. When saying this, I am aware that the movie was produced from the first half of a novel, and is expected to omit the climax of the novel which will come in part 2, but this motion picture was simply boring. <br/><br/>From the very beginning, the film features slow cuts and a plethora of dialogue that nearly lulled me to sleep on a weekend night. In contrast to its prior two films in the series, Mockingjay had no combat, no conflict, and effectively nothing to do with the Hunger games.<br/><br/>For two hours, I watched Katniss walk around a deserted area completely desecrated from warfare, while she was filmed with the hope that she would say something inspirational. It was on par with a documentary of the world's worst group of advertisers attempting to shoot a commercial. At one point a child risked her life to save a cat, and the antagonist rained white roses around a building he destroyed after an hour and forty minutes of nothing. To top it off, the movie ends with the main characters boyfriend trying to strangle her, with absolutely no resolution. <br/><br/>It is clear to me that the developers of this film failed to recognize that a single novel has a fully developed plot, but taking the first half of it and creating a film, leaves out half the plot. <br/><br/>My advice is to wait a year, and watch the two movies together when part 2 is released, because this one alone is a giant waste of time."

","I am truly disappointed! I loved the past 2 hunger games movie and i was excited to see Mockingjay, but i sat in the movies with my eyes begging to be shut. It is terribly boring. I'll go straight to my point, the trailer is misleading because the plot doesn't go anywhere. It doesn't build like a normal movie plot should, no introduction no climax no ending no nothing. I spent 2 hours sitting there waiting for something to finally happen. For a war to break, or someone to die, or the setting to change, but the actors just talk and talk and continue talking right to the end. I understand the directors or whoever is in charge is trying to make this movie two parts to gain more profit but this is a total rip off. I don't know if it's just me but I don't quite get whats happening most of the times, I haven't read the book so i was a little confused about the story in Mockingjay but shouldn't book adapted movies be watchable to everyone. I loved the actors and their acting was good in the last two movies but i find them not believable in this one, including Jennifer Lawrence. Many people might not agree with me but i think the actors kind of lacked effort in Mockingjay. There is one thing i liked in this movie, and the only one, which is the song Jennifer Lawrence sang. The song was written by the writers of this movie and i think its beautiful and haunting. I give Mockingjay 3/10"

","If i were you i wouldn't go to the cinema, I've already wasted my money don't waste yours too. The division in two parts is merely commercial, they haven't earned enough money with the first and the second movie (sarcasm). In principle the division could have been a good thing for the scenography, the narration and so on, but they have cut the story in the wrong point. In the end we have a slow and boring movie. In the most of the film there wasn't any action, just one arrow is shot by Katniss through all the movie! And in the majority of the film there was no tension. I didn't like the scenography, i.e. what they have chosen to play. The book is so much better. So, my advise is: Buy the book and read it, Don't Watch this crappy movie!"

","After the bombing of District 13, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) finally accepts the request of President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and becomes the symbol of the rebellion, the Mockingjay. However, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol broadcasts a message of Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) live contradicting Katniss. She believes that his life is in danger and convinces President Coin to rescue Peeta and the others Victors. But she has a surprise with his reaction.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is a disappointing movie too long for a short story with a lead character hysterical and too sentimental. In the other two movies, the plot was tense and full of action. Katniss is irritating with her reactions and despite the destruction of the Districts by Snow's army, her major concern is with Peeta. Prim's attitude leaving the bunker to save her cat is ridiculous and why Peeta's broadcasting is live is hard to understand.

","The Huger Games has clearly grown up in Mockingjay. Social criticism is much stronger than previous movies. Films theme is much more brooding and ominous than before. But that doesn't save this picture totally. Dividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake. Many scene are way too long and some of them are clearly just vain. Topmost feeling is just making more money. It would be much better to make only one movie instead of two. One three hour long movie is much easier to keep together, than two over length movies. It is clearly Hollywood's greed to capitalize on movie (and book) series fans. How many times more the audience will accept that? Jennifer Lawrece is great at her role as Katniss, but somehow Josh Hutcherson as Peeta's role as brainwashed puppet doesn't convince. There is a lot of good elements in this movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money from the fans. Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie that end up in green money making. Good movie ends up to mediocre action flick and that is shame."

","Is it just me who didn't think this film was better than the first? All the scenes were drawn out and there were so many stupid and unimportant scenes slotted in. ( Despite the fact everything was explained so a twelve year old could understand. Not only did it pretty much copy the first film. It started with Gale and Katniss hunting, like the first. All of it was a cliché and barely anything unpredictable. It's a shame that Jennifer Lawrence is incapable of making her role good. Just plain good. Nope, she's too bad an actress for that. After seeing this film, I doubt I will ever go to see another 'Jennifer Lawrence' film again unless my friends drag me to it. Save your money, do NOT spend your money on this, you will regret it. It's an awful film which contains: Clichés Plot holes the size of the state of Texas Ignored subplots Flat, boring characters Unrealistic ideas (I don't CARE if it's the future, some of the stuff is just plain stupid) Lack of acting skills. Only Phillip (R.I.P) could really do some decent acting. Even then, it was ONLY decent. Phillip was a brilliant actor, he let himself down in this film by not giving the best performance, but oh well. Finally, the most horrible thing of all: Overall. If I could rate this film, it would not even get 6 on IMDb. It'd get less than Disaster Movie, at least 1.2 stars. Do not see this film, unless of the age 12-14. If you're older, it's not a good idea. The film is not suitable for you. Honestly, the plot devices and conveniences are like they've been written by a (profanity removal) 12 year old. I feel as if the director didn't make this or his inner 12 year old allowed the script. I have no clue how Jennifer accepted the stupid childish ramble in her lines. Yes, the lines are all childish ramble. Nothing deep or clever placed into the script. It's effortless, but it is not well written. Jennifer Lawrence seriously needs to learn to pick appropriate roles. She's not a bad actress, but this is making me think she is.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the film is so bad because the books weren't great, but even so, this film should have been written properly to make sure the script made sense. If you want a good film... watch Battle Royale 2: Requiem, you'll enjoy it way more than this and so will your children."

","War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.<br/><br/>The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.<br/><br/>And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR2 'fans' look more justified than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering how entire sequence are shot for shot ripoffs. How can this go unpunished?"

I HATE THE HUNGER GAMES BOOKS, MOVIES, HELL, THE WHOLE FRANCHISE! It's a sad day for society when reviewers are giving this load of crud a 10/10 stars. And the main character, whom my little brother and I have dubbed 'Catpiss' in place of Katniss, is so UGLY! A terrible acting job from her, and from most of the other actors as well... ugh, don't even get me started on the soundtrack, and the plot is just a sci-fi Twilight copycat. There's nothing even remotely creative or intelligent about this franchise, this addition is just as bad as the previous two movies. The CGI was horrible, and reviewers are seriously calling this the best movie of 2014, ""a heart-pumping dystopian masterpiece"", they say! Ewww! Obviously they've never watched real movies, back when people still had brains, dystopian movies like Soylent Green, The Omega Man, Eraserhead and Logan's Run... I feel depressed to think of what the world is coming to, accepting this cow patty of a movie as anything good to watch... maybe I'll build a concrete bunker underground, climb inside with movies and books actually worth paying attention to, and wait for the idiots in society to disappear. Still, when Mockingjay comes out on DVD, it'll be perfect to burn in my annual Canada Day bonfire this July! If you follow in my footsteps, I respect you for retaining your dignity... if you still think The Hunger Games is a good thing, I pity you and hope you can find a good doctor to help you get back to normal sanity.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is pathetic, rips off other series' ideas and is just a way to suck money away from teenagers who think it's cool. Apparently part 2 of Mockingjay is coming out soon, kill me now! I don't think I've seen a movie so dull, cheap and stupid in a long time! What ever happened to good movies, movies with some substance and not just a flashy poster and trailer? Now I feel like going back in time to the Eighties with my laptop, Super 8 camera and collection of books and living out life in a decade where people weren't devolving back into apes...<br/><br/>My god, what a BAD movie!

The plot consists of Katniss finding a bunch of nothing and talking to people once. She barely does anything at all that genuinely has anything to do with the plot. The movie is abysmal at best and should be avoided so movie companies stop ruining finales by splitting them into 2 parts. The same thing happened with Harry Potter.

","I just got home from watching this movie and had to express my frustration. This had all the foundations of a solid movie. Great production. Good cast. Decent story- although they were working with half a book worth of material so they stretched it out until it was pretty thin sometimes. There was less action in this movie than the other Hunger Games- this one was more of a political intrigue focusing on character portrayals with Katniss at the center; lots of focus on her inner turmoils. <br/><br/>So a lot of the movie focused on Katniss. And Jennifer Lawrence's acting was just horrible. She was crying and being hysterical like four out of every five scenes that she was in. Lots of sophisticated actors and actresses in the movie and then there was Jennifer Lawrence like she was straight out of high school trying too hard and overdoing everything. It was very irritating to watch her for two hours. Imagine having to watch a teenage drama queen have attitude followed by breakdowns for two hours. To tell the truth I am surprised because she came across as a sophisticated and mature actress in American Hustle. <br/><br/>Her performance reminded me a little of Shea LeBoef's acting in Transformers. Just neurotic and way over the top. Some people might like it. Not my style. <br/><br/>Was it not for her, the movie was pretty good. She just managed to singlehandedly drag it down.... a lot."

In order to add some excitement they are adding small scenes that have nothing to do with the story or the story boarding. <br/><br/>I have forgot all about the characters from the last movie - and I don't care. The only thing I can do is to be amused/entertained by Donald Sutherland's evilness. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is not a bad actress at all - but her acting skills are not sufficient to save this movie alone.

Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Suzanne Collins and her company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Suzanne Collins's kept saying she's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Hunger Games is totally different from Battle Royale 2 or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from Battle Royale 2, Suzanne Collins intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale 2's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words.

","Acknowledge: as a book-reader who did not like the third installment in the first place, you may find my review a bit biased.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" series has failed to grab my attention on both the big screen and on paper. However, due to the vast improvements made between the first and second installments of the film series, I was rather excited to see how the writers would continue to improve upon Suzanne Collins' disappointing finale to the book series. Unfortunately, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (Part 1)"" delivers no such improvements and is just as slow and frustrating as the first half of the third book. If you go to see this, when you walk out of the theater, please seriously ask yourself, ""what was accomplished in this movie?"". The answer you give yourself should have one, maybe two, bullet points despite the 123 minute running time. This movie made it painfully obvious that producers only want to squeeze as much money out of fans as possible; there is absolutely no reason to have a two part film adaptation of Collins' ""Mockingjay"".<br/><br/>I do not believe screenplay writers should keep true to books they base their screenplays off of, that is totally up to the original author and the writer. That being said, book-readers should be happy with any changes that were made, and mad that more were not implemented. This was a BORING movie. It also makes you hate the characters we are meant to love by making them seem like the most selfish and naive people despite the experiences they have lived through. While the acting is not bad (quite the opposite really, the actors are excellent with what little they have to work with), I was relieved when the main characters were taken off the screen in order to show what was happening outside of their ""bubble"". I found myself much more interested in the stories of the extras rather than the boring and almost irrelevant plot that follows the main characters. It makes you want to slap them and scream ""stop throwing a pity-party for yourself and do something useful for a change"".<br/><br/>I gave this film a 4 because, while there is no doubt in my mind that I will see the final installment in theaters as well, I urge movie- watchers to wait. Wait until you have the chance to watch the first and second parts together, otherwise you will be mad and anxious until it is released. Hopefully by doing this, you will have a better impression of the film(s) than I have."

Snow has gone from being a cold but efficiently ruthless ruler to a parody of a dictator deliberately setting up his own downfall. Instead of taking the opportunity to destroy the mockingjay, he decides to play into her hands by wasting a hospital (no spoiler needed as this is clearly shown in the trailer). Don't waste your money going to see this movie as there is nothing to learn about the events that will end in the second Mockingjay. You will be able to go and see MJ2 and pick up the storyline immediately. The feeling of 'something is missing' are all in this movie. How did all of this suddenly come about? Sophisticated underground bunkers, rebel presidents, captured technology, etc., ad nauseum. You know what is truly annoying? It has all been done before and done much better. Can you say Matrix?"

","Katniss criticized her sister went back to save her cat and said the cat was stupid cat, her sister can do whatever she wants. I really hate her with no mercy with animals, and acted like she was kindhearted in the movie, such a hypocrite. Jenifer Lawrence's acting was awful, for example, at the beginning when she step on the skull, that is not how a person will act in real life, face expression is more complex than just cover your mouth and shred a tear, for people who are more emotional unstable they would even hold their fists so tight and tremble, but her character does not fit in this category and she has experience of seeing dead, so all she needed to act is complex face expression."

Every second word in this movie was about ""peter"", and about how she didn't care about anyone in the big picture just about saving her peter, whilst constantly collapsing in tears, endangering her peers and blowing off her boyfriend who wants to be loved but instead is ignored because of a less attractive scrawny pipsqueak, who is also blown up to be a hero undeservedly.

Although, i didn't expect they could bring the whole book into the screen, i expected it to be AT LEAST able to keep it up with the first two. But no, every single scene is stretched out to meet the requirement of minimum length for a feature film. The film is darker than prequels so imagining it's just getting longer and longer without a purpose, its very frustrating.<br/><br/>3 stars rating is for the acting as the cast has fulfilled their roles beautifully as always.

","Firstly, I loved the first two movies. Hunger Games was good and Catching fire was great. Now there's this... Mockingjay AKA Losing Fire. <br/><br/>(Just a ""little"" Summary)<br/><br/>It starts off with our Mockingjay (Katniss) in hospital and then she meets President Coin, who tells her something ( I forgot, it wasn't really that important). She goes all sappy about Peeta ( Ugh) and leaves to see the ruins of District 12 (Insert burnt bodies and skulls for dramatic effect). After seeing this she suddenly agrees to be the Mockingjay (I think that's what Coin asked her, I just remembered). <br/><br/>For the rest of the movie, she becomes a puppet for propaganda videos (Terrible actor, bad bad Katniss) and goes around showing her lovely Mockingjay face. (Insert bombs killing innocent patients and some hovercrafts being brought down by explosive arrows). <br/><br/>District 13 is discovered, by the Capitol, and blown into pieces - not really. (Insert white roses for Katniss from Pres. Snow). <br/><br/>More videos are made for the propaganda and... eh. You get it. (Oh the Capitol has a black out. Again, because of the bombs).<br/><br/>Eventually, Peeta and the others are rescued, safely. (He strangles Katniss and she dies. Just kidding - she lives and finds him tied up, forcefully trying to unstrap himself).<br/><br/>The end. (Insert Song by Lorde, which I liked)<br/><br/>You can obviously see what was wrong here, there was a lack of action. All the action was replaced with bombs, everyone was bombing everyone. (I want the girl on fire, and well, all we see is a dying flame).<br/><br/>This movie was okay. If you miss it, you might still enjoy Part 2. Not much is revealed apart from District 13 and the victors being saved. Oh and did I mention that almost everyone is depressed. These people have killed and survived the hunger games (Twice) but they are all just depressed... Meh. <br/><br/>Other than that it's still a nice movie to watch, it is the ONLY movie series that's actually captivating. <br/><br/>I feel awful about this review, but I was sitting in the cinemas, begging for it to end. (Yet the previous two movies left me wanting more.)<br/><br/>Actual Rating: 6.5 (The bombs might have killed many people but they saved this movie.)"

Katniss is ""so much in love"" with this troll that she can't walk straight in this whole movie which turns it to a complete parody. I never liked this character from the start but I was willing to let go. Now his presence (and the importance bestowed upon him) is simply unbearable to watch. Another thing that is really lame in this film (which kind of worked in the previous ones) is the fact that the fate of the revolution depends on whether Katniss will wear leather of silk this evening and whether she will have a ponytail...

From watching the previous movies, I know these films aren't exactly 10/10 material, but they are quite entertaining and have some emotional high points. The ones here were few and far between, and Katniss's many emotional breakdowns were not any of them. You know it's bad when the main character becomes a drag and isn't nearly as inspiring (nothing against J-Law). While Haymitch and Effie were awesome once again, they could not salvage everything else. Torrid acting and drawn out sequences that were re-played over and over helped make the story so predictable that even those who don't know the books could figure it out <br/><br/>Overall: If you're a fan of the books, you might enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality work that entertains you, moves you, and gives you the chills you got in the previous entries, skip this one.

","It seems that nowadays it's a trend to make two movies for one book and fill it with scenes that we don't need to watch. I haven't read the books, although i've heard good things about them, but since nothing happened in the movie I automatically assume that it didn't cover many things from the book. We see endless ""boohoo"" scenes that are not even touching that lead to nothing and when we think that ""finally, at least we will watch the first battle of this war in this movie"" again nothing happens. The only good aspect of this movie is the interesting game with politics between president Snow who tries to scare everyone and prevent them from joining the rebels using Peeta and president Coin who tries to rouse everyone to fight using the Mockingjay, Katniss; all of this propaganda using the media. But again, it takes too long for nothing. At least the previous ones had some action.<br/><br/>Of course the problems of the first two films continue. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth just can't make you care about these characters. Everyone is like ""come on go with Gale he is more pretty"". In this movie we think for some minutes that Gale might die but no one really cares! Jennifer Lawrence gives an average performance, but doesn't live up the audience's expectations comparing to her talent.<br/><br/>I will watch the last film hoping it will be better but this one...

"kluseba","3","16","22","17 December 2014"," Bore Inc. 3.1.: Mocking Gay
","I appreciated the first two movies of the dystopian coming-of-age franchise that is a little bit too closely inspired by ""Battle Royale"" but this first part of the third and last instalment is a massive waste of time and a cheap attempt at grabbing some cash from the numerous fan-boys and especially fan-girls. In my opinion, both occasional viewers and faithful fans should ignore this release, read the novel instead, and come back to the cinema for the second part of the grand finale. This movie only prepares for the last part of the series, a little bit like ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" but it's even worse.<br/><br/>Everything that I enjoyed about the entertaining first two releases is completely absent in this movie. The story has no tension at all and consists almost only of hollow dialogs. One could almost say that there is no real story. The rebels are trying to turn a few propaganda movies, the population is demonstrating against the Capitol and that's it. <br/><br/>Instead of survival action, we get to see depressive and lengthy chamber play scenes in grey bunkers. The colourful and exciting locations are gone and replaced by dark concrete structures that make even the most functional Soviet cities look beautiful. The special effects in this movie are not even close to the breathtaking images from the first two parts. Even the soundtrack of the movie is a lot more generic than before. One of the worst parts of the movie was when main actress Jennifer Lawrence suddenly started to sing. It sent shivers down my spine but in a very negative way and it reminded me of some lyrics from an old Puddle of Mudd song: ""I never wanna hear you sing, you sound just like a little kid."" Jennifer Lawrence' vocal performance must be the worst I have ever witnessed in cinema. Nothing improved in this movie and everything that made the Hunger Games franchise so popular is gone.<br/><br/>Even the acting is a lot less convincing than in the first movies as it mostly feels numb and unreal. Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin is pale and not credible at all in her role as nobody would follow such an uncharismatic leader in real life. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee looks like an annoying and old guy who thinks he is funny and cool but happens to be only embarrassing and stupid as he acts like he was mentally retarded. Even the characters I appreciated in the first two movies seem like pale copies of their former selves. I was eager to see Woody Harrelsen in his unique role as Haymitch Abernathy again but he only has a very small role and feels like a completely different character all of a sudden. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket is a lot less colourful, eccentric and sarcastic than before. I'm aware of the fact that the general mood of the movie is supposed to be darker and more mature but the acting hasn't become more credible but simply shallower. In an unfitting contrast to this, Jennifer Lawrence is simply overacting her role as Katniss Everdeen. Every five minutes, you see her crying in a corner of her bunker, exaggeratedly hobbling through some ruins and yelling at everybody and everything when she's not pleased with something. In the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie, this acting seems like a welcome change to the tame acting of the others but a few minutes later one gets the impression that the main character has not only become a lot less mature than before but that she is simply out of her mind and dealing with important mental problems. It's not realistic at all to count on a bipolar princess who acts less mature than a twelve-year old and who only cares about her lover even though this is one of the least credible cinematic love stories I have ever seen to lead a revolution. At some point, her cringe-worthy emotional outbursts become unintentionally funny and would rather fit into a slapstick comedy movie.<br/><br/>It was incredibly hard to sit through the entire movie. I kept believing as I was hoping for an explosive ending and the only interesting scene of the entire film takes indeed place in the last fifteen minutes but it isn't worth the wait either. Giving three points out of ten in here is still extremely generous. Instead of making me impatiently wait for the final chapter, I'm now seriously asking myself if I should not give up on the franchise. I really liked the first two movies but this one here is plain awful. As I said before, read the novel or a short synopsis but avoid this hollow flick at all costs. It's not worth spending money on it, it wouldn't even be worth watching it if it was for free. This movie is easily the biggest cinematic disappointment of the year."

","I wasn't a fan of the first 2 Hunger Games movies. I thought that the first one was a bad version of Battle Royal (yes, no matter how the writer denies it, there are too many similarities to the story for it to be a coincidence). The second movie I just found terrible. I didn't plan on going to see this third movie, but my friend convinced me to go anyway. I didn't plan on reviewing this movie, but I was so annoyed by it that I had to. The writing for this movie is just awful. I can't blame the actors for their performances, there is only so much they can do with the material. I think they did okay with what they had, but that didn't make it good. Overall the movie was just boring. The pacing was really slow. Not a lot seemed to be happening. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, Katniss starts to sing a horrible song. And when I thought it couldn't get worse than that, a choir starts to sing along with her! I would never ever recommend this movie to anyone. I must not be the right audience for it. What I would have liked to have seen in this movie was Katniss and Peeta get together and be forever referred to as either KatPee or PeeNiss. I'd settle for any one of those."

This is one of the few times where you would truly lose out on a beautifully tragic experience. This isn't the typical foreign language to English port where some things are lost in translation, yet despite a few missing scenes or poor acting the story is still conveyed. This is practically a complete rework, however, it still manages to (almost) come to the same conclusion. Consequently this ruins any chance you have of watching the original and being able see the story unfold the way it's meant to, because the whole time you know how it will end (even as the other 99% will be new to you).<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch the original, it's really worth it this time."

Instead of getting on and leading the rebellion, Lawrence instead grieves for her lost love, held prisoner by the other side. Whenever you see Josh Hutcherson's eminently punchable face you wonder what all of the fuss is about. It's a film with no beginning, middle, or end, over-obvious throughout, simply treading water before the last in the series. In other words, it's a total bore."

In my opinion one of the worst teenage disasters of 2014 by far. Shameful character development and a huge waste of money and manpower.

Basically, there's an hour and a half of the exact same thing. Almost nothing happens in this movie. They all are in one place, doing the same thing. Breaking it up into two parts was a bad idea. Now that they broke it up into two parts, they had to make the first one long. Apparently, they didn't know what they were doing and just made a long, boring plot. Yes, it did have good action. In the first half-hour. At the beginning, it was action-packed and felt like the rebels would rise and fight back at the capitol. But instead, they just died down and started loosing.

"Jachinthebest","4","23","34","24 November 2014"," Worst in the series?
","I've never been a fan of 'The Hunger Games' films. Having read the book trilogy a few years ago, the idea of having a film series based around the novels seemed like a good idea... Unfortunately, none of these films have lived up to the hype surrounding them. I walked into the cinema expecting something far better than the previous films, and by the end of the movie I was more disappointed than I have been with any other installment in the series.<br/><br/>As with the previous films, what felt like an hour of time was completely wasted at the start. The time is taken up by boring dialogue and meaningless, confusing conversations between characters that feel like they were written simply to extend the running time of the film and serve little to no purpose at all. The second half of the film begins speeding up, but even then the majority of the time given has been wasted on those 'does anyone really care' scenes from the previous films. Then there's the acting. In both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire', Jennifer Lawrence's acting has been one of the few things in the movies that was actually done properly, when compared to the poor acting of the rest of the cast. In 'Mockingjay' however, Lawrence's performance is extremely overdone... Luckily some of the supporting cast manages to do a fairly good. Lastly is the fact that Mockingjay is being split into two films. It's common for a single book to be made into multiple movies (I mean, just look at The Hobbit), but the issue with Mockingjay is that the entire novel could have been adapted into a single film. As I said earlier, the amount of time wasted in this film is insane... The entire Mockingjay novel could have easily been into a 2 hour film if those 2 hours were actually spent properly. <br/><br/>Personally, I think this movie doesn't deserve the 7/10 rating it currently holds here. Unless your a 13 year old girl and/or really don't care about the pacing and acting in this film.... I wouldn't recommend it."

","The screenwriter team for this movie was obviously under pressure to extend beyond reason the simplistic narrative of this movie. The result: over two hours of acting without substance.

Emotions are simply not credible, and only inspire scorn.<br/><br/>I want my money back. I want my time back. What a waste of effort to extend this film beyond one installment. Had they compacted the movie in 1 hour, then probably all the bad cinematography would have been eliminated.<br/><br/>Sure producers will make a profit at the expense of unsuspected viewers and several (perhaps demolishing) hits on actors careers. I will NOT view the last installment. I refuse to give my money away for nothing.<br/><br/>The saddest part is that this movie could have been great. The acting talent was there. Technical resources were available. But he most inexpensive part of the production was neglected beyond belief: storytelling. The screenwriters in this movie are not idiots. It is obvious that artificial constraints were placed to extend the story to two parts.<br/><br/>SAVE YOUR TIME, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT WATCH THIS BAD, BAD MOVIE."

On the other hand, the bombing from Snow never occurred to Katnis that she is indirectly responsible, yet she's still manipulated by the 13th District propaganda like an idiot. Extremely poor suspense scenes, thundering music when Katnis' sister was rescuing a cat? For real? I just feel obliged to write a 10 line review...

","For those of you who like the Hunger Games: I suggest you do watch Mockingjay, the third installment in a four part movie series based off of the Hunger Games trilogy written by Suzanne Collins, but only if you wish to be disappointed. This movie was clearly split in two in an attempt to make more money, emulating the last two movies in the Harry Potter franchise. However, this movie was unlike any of the Harry Potter movies. The movie was riddled with poorly edited shots, weak dialog, and in certain parts, very poor research. I was forced to endure too many close-ups of Jennifer Lawrence to count and cringed every time that I heard her scraping whiny voice. This was probably due to poor direction and useless producer. Now, I only watched the first half of the first Twilight movie (the disc, luckily, was scratched) and I believe anyone who would agree that that poor excuse some producers like to call a film, was bad, would also agree that this movie, was a catastrophe. The movie was doomed from the start, because both the producer and the director saw fit to take a nap on their jobs and overuse Jennifer Lawrence, the cash cow, perhaps a very good actor (no one could tell with the poor writing camouflaging everything), so much so, that not even the presence of Woody Harrelson helped. If we are lucky, perhaps Mockingjay will come out as a single movie, while completely ignoring whatever this film had that passed for a story, perhaps with both a successful director and producer in charge."

","I am a big fan of the first two movies specially the first one.How can you say: ""since I thought it was way better than the first two""? What is wrong with you? This movie Is long, boring and nothing happened in the last two hours. It is worst than Catching Fire is worst than The Hunger Games and The Worst of the series and all Hunger Games movies. Katniss does not do nothing! All she does is winning and crying about Peeta trough whole god damn movie. Peeta, Peeta, Peata...cry, cry...I lost them both....... cry"" In this movie their is not enough Haymitch, President Snow, Effie, Johanna only at the end of the movie and she is bold what happened?, Caesar and Finnick.None of the actors or actress is good enough or did a good job except Jennifer Lawrence. I did not pay to see Katniss being a whinny selfish cry baby trough whole movie.I pay to see a bad-ass and that's what in this movie wasn't and killed the previous movies and the third sequel. All she did was walking and talking and winning about Peeta for 2.hrs. What an embarrassment awful boring disappointment! The Hunger Games (2012) the first movie of the series in my opinion was the best of all the three films ever made from the novels. I thought was pretty damn good awesome start of the series from it's books I love it and it is my favorite. Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) was pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. The first hour was boring, the second hour when they were in arena and it was shown in an IMAX version was really pretty surprisingly, amazingly awesome and so very intense that you could not shut your eyes and not see what will happen next. Katniss killed one person and a few apes that was really pretty awesome for the second Hunger Games movie like was the whole movie Rocky II. IMAX version was at least 49 min shown. Katniss finally showed real feelings for Peeta and not just an act like she did in the first movie and trough whole 2.hrs in the second movie. That's what I thought the movie was so interested, that there was a real romance in it and not just an act. The second movie was pretty damn good but did not beat the first one. The third movie The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 (2014) is the worst one of the three and awful terrible sequel of the first two movies and it is a sad true disappointment. I hope part 2 redeems it self and get's better than this movie is. I also own both the previous movies of on Blu-ray discs and this movie will not come near my Blu-ray collection! I wanted to see Katniss rescuing Peeta shooting with the bow and arrow,kill at least a few enemies that deserve it , getting closer to President Snow and Capital. Katniss been a bad-ass and tough, trough whole movie but sadly she was not. She was a cry baby and she did do anything except winning.I excepted so much more from Katniss than just this: more intense what will happened in the next scene but there was absolutely nothing. Nothing! It took a real bad turn. Katniss been hot and interesting but instead she was gross. Effie and Johanna gorgeous but no sadly they weren't. My final question for the people who like this movie is : Why do you like this movie so much? When is not what it is supposed to be for us true fans and what we expected and wanted to be. A true disappointment!"

","""Catching Fire part 1"" is not only the worst of the series, it is arguably one of the worst films released ever. It reeks of greed and the worst thing is that it is actually making money.<br/><br/>Usually I would take the time to talk about the plot however this film has a very thin plot, it is a 2 hour film completely based on a side plot. It is mostly about Katniss and her obsession with Peeta. Of course Peeta being in the ""Capital"", however I do have a vague recollection of that being mentioned at the end of the second film. This films' plot could have easily have been 10 minutes in a full length proper film based on the novel. One would think that a cast of such heavy hitters might redeem the film however here is the problem, Phillip Seymour Hoffman has roughly about 4 minutes of screen time, Donald Sutherland round about the same, Woody Harrelson round about one minute, actually no character except Katniss has more than 10 minutes of screen time. There are literally scenes of Katniss merely walking around, scenes of Katniss crying and scenes of Katniss crying. One cannot deny that Jennifer Lawrence can sometimes deliver a moving and riveting performance however in this film, she seems bored, wooden and downright silly in some scenes. Juliane Moore seems disinterested in the plot and is not even convincing herself of her character.<br/><br/>The acting, bad as it might be, is nothing compared to the camera work. I started feeling nauseas during the film because of the constant shaking of the camera. Another thing is there are certain scenes that will most definitely affect people with photo sensitive epilepsy however there is no warning attached to the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the second film, I did not feel that the first one was a bad film, I just did not enjoy it. My girlfriend on the other hand is a major fan, this morning started out with her being excited and full of zest, ready for the day. At the end of the film she was in a foul mood. However she soon returned top her happy cheery self, whistling the mockingjay sound and ending it with a fart sound. I must admit that is the best description of this film, you keep on believing that a plot will develop but it never does.

This is about cinematography, the art of script-writing, telling an interesting story, creating suspense, of which this movie lacks all of it. The only instance of suspense was such a dumb and dull example of template-based Hollywood scripting that I wanted to rip the screen apart: I mean how creative is a scene which creates suspense by using the lever of an emergency situation, where within a 1-minute countdown all doors are closed in an underground bunker? And of course the heroine rescues her friend and the affable dog just 2 seconds before the massive steel doors would have crushed her bones and spilled the screen with blood. <br/><br/>Having read the review of another IMDb reviewer where she details how the author of the Hunger Games series actually copied and stole the ideas from a range of Japanese movies and mangas, I totally believe that. Because this is just a dumb, uninspired copycat attempt of doing something, but lacks the heart and passion.<br/><br/>Above all, what the hell is so interesting anyway about a teenage girl becoming a soldier? Is this a trivial attempt to recruit more female soldiers into the army? Because that is exactly how it looked like: like a remake of Top Gun for girls.<br/><br/>Another tidbit: who on earth goes out to fight in the battlefield only armed with a bow and a handful of color coded arrows against a fleet of remote-controlled fighter jets? And above all what is the sense of color codes if the arrows are behind your head where you don't see any colors ...<br/><br/>This movie is so flawed, I don't even know where to stop ..."

","I get it. A part one is to lead into a part two, only except, this wasn't really a part one. More of a mini series stretched into a part one. Basically, Katniss is alive. Where Katniss is from the place has been demolished. Katniss tours the place. She finds a live rose in a bouquet of dead roses (an envision of Dr. Snow occurs) and Prim Rose's cat. She finds out Peta is alive and she is reunited with some of her old fellows. Together they will fight back but they don't in this part 1, they just plan to. Every time Peta appears on screen he says something that isn't true to his heart and he looks tiresome. Katniss puts two and two together and realizes he is being tortured. Katniss does a lot of starring off into a slight panic with teary eyes. Her character says no more than a paragraph of three sentences every scene. A lot of the scenes had no meaning to move the story line forward. Example: Katniss walks towards a river. She sits on a rock. Gale joins her. (or maybe visa versa) She leans her head on him. His pager goes off and Gale says something like ""they want us to come back."" He heads back, the camera refocuses on Katniss face. End of scene. Near the end, Katniss realizes Peta is being held and tortured because of her. Obviously, Katniss put two and two together but she didn't get four... YOU THINK! Dr. Snow eventually gives up Peta. Peta is returned bruised and he has a moment of chocking anger against Katniss. That is where the movie got interesting."

But in this movie I have to draw the line. everyone can clearly see that the separating of the finale in two parts was not necessery. This movie is just a 2 hours trailer for the finale. The only scene worth watching is the one that climaxes with Katnis shooting down a plane and that can be seen just by watching the trailer. I can think only two reasons they made this Part 1 movie and there is no way there is a third. Either to make more money by two separate movies instead of one, or because they wanted to put all the unessesary melodrama in one movie and keep the action for Part 2. Or both. Either way the 2 minutes trailer was very promising and the 2 hours trailer we watched was very disappointing.

So I now expect Part 2 to have over $200 million worth of quality. I may not even watch Part 2, like I said in the title I have almost completely lost interest in the franchise due to this film being so utterly boring that only the cringing from Lawrence's overacting stopped me from falling asleep in the cinema. <br/><br/>The entire film centered around Katniss' transformation into the Mockingjay (something that whether you've read the books or not, KNOW is going to happen) So to make it a 2 1/2 hour ordeal is just offensive to the viewer.

I have read all 3 books as well as watch the other 2 movies.<br/><br/>If you read the book you would have seen this coming from this series. While first 2 books keep a good balance between inner dialog and the plot, the last book was emotional driven swamp that almost slowed the plot to a stop. (forgive me ladies) It read like the writer was going through her menopause for the entire 3rd book. It was just that bad, the only motivation that had me finish the book was my desire to end the series. The books series was clearly written by a inferior writer than the recent book-to-movie authors. The movie was accordingly was horrendous. <br/><br/>Instead of introducing the character's feelings while the plot unfolds, the writer chooses to keep the reader on the character's emotional roller-coaster while giving vague news about the actual plot (revolution). The characters have no depth to them and the plot plays too close to archetypes. <br/><br/>The movie was barely not worth watching therefore a 4. There isn't the quality or the quantity of action to be a serviceable action/adventure and the low quality of the actors/actresses doesn't save the terrible writing. The camera work or the directing isn't top shelf by any means, might be one of the worst big budget work I've seen in decades.

","Let me qualify my summary: It's not any worse than the movie that launched this series, period. Trapped in a plane in an intercontinental flight, the choice was THG:M1 or movies I had already watched. So I selected it. I had not seen THG, but I had heard good things about it. I was not expecting a life- changing experience, but something entertaining. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is a life-changing experience, in all the wrong ways. Not only was it unable to relieve the intense boredom of a long haul flight - it made it worse. This movie has not plot, makes no sense, is ridiculous from beginning to end. There is no saving grace to it, not even Miss Lawrence, who seems to be lost in the movie herself. As for actors like P.S. Hoffman, J. Moore and D. Sutherland, one wonders why they acquiesced to get involved in this brainless trash - I doubt they need the money (albeit you never know.) In order to make sure that it was not the lack of knowledge of previous films in the series that was spoiling the experience for me, I made a point of watching them, even if cursorily. I watched the first one, and that was enough. The Hunger Games is the most ridiculously hyped and overrated series of movies ever. Addressed to teenage public, this series seems to assume that teenagers are collectively brainless and stupid. This series is an insult to intelligence and discrimination."

Don't get me wrong, i couldn't be more excited for the second part, but there isn't really happening something in this movie like the last ones. Ofcource is there some action scenes here and there, but it has nothing compared to the last books. I would like to say, that the actors are doing a REALLY good job. Their acting is really good, and you can clearly feel the emotional part going on their lives, and the directors did a good job making the audience feel the same way. I would like to say tho, that if you have read the books, and you know whats coming and what its like, you will properly like the movie (not giving any guarantees. I've heard that it matched the book pretty well. In my opinion isn't should there be more action, or there should be more excitement.

"FilmMuscle","4","50","84","21 November 2014"," The Plot Thickens, Or Does It?
","Just when we thought we had a new complex and interesting female character—a true heroine—this latest entry shows her spending half (or even more) of the time talking about and crying over boys. Her motivations become so muddled by yet another generic YA love triangle (screaming over Peeta and listlessly kissing Gale). This all certainly isn't helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence seemingly just doesn't understand the acting technique of subtlety. Her highly hysterical/overreacting character leaves much to be desired in regards to actual nuance—a case that would allow the viewers to look into her eyes and judge for themselves. Lawrence's sheer overacting has dominated most of her work since the Oscar win (actually, including Silver Linings Playbook as well) with this manner becoming even more noticeably cringe-worthy with Mockingjay Part 1. Her loud- mouthed/attention-provoking, apparently ""real"" persona has won many people over and her way of forcing her ""acting"" in audiences' faces (weeping, yelling, or generally acting in aggression in almost every other scene) makes it unsurprising as to why she's still in the public's favor.<br/><br/>As for the narrative, the stakes always appear so heightened and forcibly gloom, but the resolutions are always so perfect to the point where it's difficult to seriously believe in the peril of the story's characters. In this addition, Katniss Everdeen has fully assumed the ""Mockingjay"" symbol—a public leader for the final revolution against the Capitol. More and more of the district's citizens have become aware of the atrocities committed by its government and the vileness of the Hunger Games. It's time to courageously fight back! Each one of these films possess very obvious—perhaps, even heavy-handed—analogies to the contemporary climate and the world's current circumstances when it comes to ""radical"" revolutionaries, government control/failure of democracy, media influence, etc. <br/><br/>Considering that the series' premise centers on people who're forced to kill each other in order to survive, our primary characters always end up fine by the conclusion. ""Is he dead?"" ""Did they die?"" No, not for a minute am I convinced that anyone is on the brink of death. Maybe they'll make the drama and danger genuine in the finale next year, maybe not. Then again, it's the same annoying issue every expensive blockbuster suffers from these days, especially the Marvel films. (Yes, I know this is a film adaptation of a book series that's following an already-created narrative; it still doesn't change anything about the tale's quality or the right to criticize it.) On the other hand, this time around, we thankfully don't have to deal with the utterly predictable and tedious hunger game sections. Part 1 of this two-part climax reminds me of the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in that it focuses more on the set-up and grounded drama rather than the explosive ultimate battles, meaning that I'll likely prefer this one to next year's (yes, I much preferred the first part of Harry Potter's finale to the last half).<br/><br/>Moreover, the stunning visuals/cinematography really does improve with every installment. The look of these films always seem to darken and grow starker with every new entry; the style of the franchise is very much its distinctive own. As a matter of fact, the exceptional sound mixing and grand production design drastically help distinguish this franchise from the innumerable cheap YA rip-offs that came after its success. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the overall cast, filled with bland pretty boys and unremarkable veteran performances, makes the entire film (which, keep in mind, is considerably shorter than its predecessors) feel like somewhat of a bore to get through. The objectives for the characters are set into motion fairly quickly, but most of the film is wasted on needless dialogue and repetitious scenes (""I love Peeta,"" and then, ""we have to rescue Peeta!"" about a dozen times throughout). It only makes it that much more obvious that the studio simply separated the films to blatantly cash in on the property—the newest irritating trend in the industry."

","I've never been a huge fan of the hunger games movies that came before this one, but I found them to be passable. However, this movie feels completely unnecessary. I cannot think of anything worth even mentioning in this movie, other than a solid final(?) performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman. I mark all of my reviews as spoilers, but I really can only think of one thing that could be considered a ""spoiler"", but before that I want to talk about the ""smart"" political schemes of this movie. Smart is in quotes because all they do is go around and film stuff the evil capitol has been doing. That's not that smart, to be honest. I mean effective, sure, but I could have thought of that and i barely pay attention to these movies when children aren't killing each other...(wow I'm a bad person). The only other thing that is done to fight the capital is make propaganda (like an ""evil"" government would do) and when katniss shoots down TWO bombers with a *beep* arrow. Nice job, whoever designed those things. Oh yeah, and a bunch of people somehow got like a million bombs in the middle of the forest so a bunch of capitol soldiers could follow them, and the people could climb into the trees without being shot somehow, and blow up all the soldiers without a single tree starting on fire in a bloodless explosion and WHOSE PLAN WAS THIS!!! Also, some other people blow themselves up to destroy part of a dam to stop the capitol from getting electricity. Why did they do this, you might ask (after you ask where they are getting these bombs from)? Because they heard Katniss singing. Well I guess Jennifer Lawrence's singing career has gone down the toilet if her first song makes people blow themselves up. Anyway the capitol retaliates with a bombing that doesn't kill a single person (but Katniss' sister almost dies for a cat) as Katniss' other boyfriend and some nameless people go to rescue her other boyfriend and some people whose names I can't be bothered to remember (or care for). They're successful, but oh no! Peeta's evil now! This will surely be of some consequence... or the movie could just end. 4/10."
"CinemaClown","Null","6","7","22 March 2015"," Exists To Only Set The Stage For The Finale
","While the splitting of the final novel in the Harry Potter film series was more than justified by the adaptations that followed, it also gave these major Hollywood studios another idea of how to milk any franchise for all its worth, thus resulting in few unnecessary expansions of final chapters of many other franchises into two films & The Hunger Games series is the latest to join this particular league.<br/><br/>While I wasn't completely won over by the first two films in this franchise & watched them with half-hearted interest, the films weren't as terrible as I expected. Both instalments did make up for some nice lightweight entertainment & fabulously exhibited the screen power of Jennifer Lawrence but the only reason why The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 exists is to set up the stage for the upcoming finale.<br/><br/>Set after the events of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Part 1 continues the story of Katniss Everdeen who finds herself in District 13 after being rescued from the 75th Hunger Games arena which she destroyed in the last chapter. Very much aware of the mass riots that has risen against the Capitol, Everdeen reluctantly agrees to become the symbol of rebellion in order to unite all districts against one enemy & also tries to rescue Peeta from his captivity.<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Lawrence, Mockingjay - Part 1 lacks many elements that made the first two instalments click so well. The action is very much missing here, the story feels longer than its actual runtime, nothing much happens in the movie plot-wise & it's pretty evident that the idea of splitting it into two parts was indeed a stupid move. Jennifer Lawrence still delivers another fine performance while the contribution from both Julianne Moore & Philip Seymour Hoffman is a welcome one.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, there isn't much to talk about The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 for it's a definite downgrade in almost all aspects when compared to its predecessors, carries over the usual political themes of the series but never does anything with it, is predictable from start to finish, is stretched beyond its threshold point & even has Lawrence exhibiting signs of weariness in her given role. Easily the weakest of the three instalments so far, Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be a worthy sequel but it nonetheless succeeds in setting the stage for the grand finale."

Being a fan of this franchisee i had so many expectations but the movie is so slow that even if you go out and grab a cup of coffee you will come back to see that the movie has not gone anywhere. I admire Jennifer Lawrence but this is probably her weakest performance till date. She has sounded screechy and devoid of emotions for most parts which is a surprise considering what a fine actress she is.The movie is unbelievably stretched out that it gets to ridiculous proportions as you start praying for the movie to end.<br/><br/>The Mockingjay should have been a one part movie but as we all know for commercial interests a 45 minutes plot has been dragged out for two painful hours. Only Jennifer Lawrence has hogged the lion share of screen time while other actors like Woody Harrelson are criminally wasted. The direction lack vision. The editing is probably the weakest part of the movie. The story of the movie can be told in 5 lines and they have made a two hours movie out of this. The high rating for this movie is surprising to see."
"Meven_Stoffat","5","59","101","20 November 2014"," The longest and most expensive trailer ever made
","I have a rather wishy washy relationship with The Hunger Games. I had read and watched Battle Royale before but I love the idea of people being forced into a fight to the death by the government. It's terrifying and so that's why I even read the book in the first place. Because knowing it takes place in the future, I wanted to see how Collins would interpret it and how it was marketable to young kids- hell, I was in grade 9 when I watched Battle Royale, and I remember throughout that year loaning my bootleg copy to several friends and before you know it, almost half the school was talking about it. And so that's why the idea of THG excited me- even though BR is an adult movie first and foremost, teens can relate to the issues presented, and i can say without exaggeration that I was not let down, because even though it's wasn't as good as BR, I was pleased that the intensity and brutality of BR was not lost with Collins' interpretation. Sure it isn't the most well written book, but it was so intense I found myself on a cold autumn afternoon in 2009 at home, on the edge of the couch and frantically turning each page to see what happened next<br/><br/>And then the sequels came, and I was disappointed. CF had so many great ideas but didn't utilize them properly, and Mockingjay was a mess of ideas that failed to resemble a story. Skip to a year and a half after the release of Mockingjay, I was at a midnight screening of the first movie, and as much as I found it problematic as an adaptation, it at least was entertaining. A year and a half later, I'm back at the same IMAX auditorium to see the sequel, and amazingly, I loved it enough to consider it one of my favourite films of the year. It captured the intensity the book couldn't. The ideas were there, but a book wasn't the best way to capture it. Now it's a year later and I'm just back from a preview showing of Mockingjay Part 1 and wondering why I was left so cold even though I went in knowing exactly what I was in for. Gut instinct, maybe? I hope<br/><br/>Mockingjay is not going to change your mind about the book if you didn't like it, but because of my completist ways, I went and saw it anyway. And the problem was that it was too much like the book- a scattered collage of entertaining bits with equal amounts of filler. In fact, this film is beginning to make me wonder if maybe the series only seems awesome because of the first book's honest storytelling and the second movie's sheer intensity and electricity<br/><br/>The problem here is that it only makes Collins' seeming inability to balance out blazing hot action with quiet drama, and a movie-exclusive problem is that it seems to fail at emotion and drama altogether. The scenes where a brainwashed Peeta is forced into feeding the districts pro-Capitol propaganda as a devastated Katniss watches should be heartbreaking and saddening- problem is they are for the wrong reasons. They're heartbreaking and devastating because there's so many blown opportunities and you could almost imagine the writers go, ""have them start crying, that will trick the audience."" The same thing happens when Katniss visits District 8 all armed with a documentary crew and visits a hospital only for Snow to have soldiers blow it up. I should be sad and depressed to see this hall ending but the only thing that depresses me is how horribly executed it is with no emotion <br/><br/>I'm not even going to get started on the fact that this really did not need to be two movies because if anything, I do think there was a way splitting it into two movies would have improved the story as a whole. The book's problem is that the first half is too slow and the second half is too rushed. They could easily trim an hour of fat and being some stuff in from the second half to make the film more intense. The book lacks emotional connection the same way this movie does, and so there's so many opportunities. Problem is, it's too much like The Deathly Hallows, where part 1 was filled with padding to the point where the whole thing could easily have been one movie<br/><br/>So what did I like? Well, I loved the storming and bombing of the hydroelectric dam. I loved the ca few flying in to rescue the hostages. I loved the final conversation between Snow and Peeta. I loved the bombing of the forest. I loved the emergency sheltering. These are enough to warrant the 5/10 I gave it, because those scenes were truly gripping and engaging. Had these kinds of intense scenes been in the movie more, maybe, just maybe I'd have walked out with some level of anticipation for the next part<br/><br/>Otherwise there's really no reason to spend hard earned cash to watch a two hour trailer for the actual payoff. The whole thing feels like a big, two hour long trailer. It's clear they only did this to make the audience want to wait for the next part. Oh, I'll be dressing up in my district outfit and going to see the next movie for sure but not because I'm excited to because at this point I feel obligated to do so"

","Hey everyone.<br/><br/>I went today to the cinema with pretty high expectatives from i have watched in the past movies(1st wan was pretty fine for me, and 2nd one, i think was even better). Leaving behind the fact of poor actings, i wasn't even sure if the film that i was watching WHOLE joke or what. But no, the minutes were passing, and i was still at this punishment based really really awful history filled with poorer scripts. I was counting every seconds to get out of that crap. Save money guys! I really mean it!! With that amount of money you would be able to buy a couple beer, hangout with and ugly girl, and you won't regret more than have watched that disaster movie.<br/><br/>For the last, i have to say. THIEVES!"
"john_seater","4","11","15","2 January 2015"," 2 hours of packaging, 30 minutes of substance, and then some weaknesses
","Somewhere around 45 minutes into this film I noticed I was rather bored. Hardly anything was happening. By the time the movie was over, not much more had happened. I liked the first two installments of the ""Hunger Games"" series, so what was the problem here? The problem is very simple. This is a movie that never should have been. The substance should have been condensed into the 30 minutes that it deserves and then used as the opening half hour of the final installment that will be released later this year. If you like the ""Hunger Games"" series, you will have to watch this one just so you know the (few) plot developments and meet the new characters. That, I presume, is precisely what the producers wanted: a way to extract more admission ticket money from the audience. Too bad. In doing that, they have reduced the overall value of the series.<br/><br/>It's also strange that the production team did not do more with the 2 hours they had. (Slight spoiler follows.) For example, we get endless scenes of Katniss being horrified, shocked, upset, emotionally stressed, outraged, angry, sad, etc., etc. Then near the end we get a mad dash to finish, with the raid on the capital given short shrift and making the file look amateurish. A small bunch of commandos go into the capital but then are let go in so obvious a way that they know they have been let go. Yet everyone is too dumb to try to figure out why the nearly-omnipotent and omniscient President Snow and his baddies let this bunch go. Shades of Star Wars IV. There are other similar kinds of weaknesses in the plot or its development, where something that could have been interesting or useful was ignored for the sake of showing more scenes of Katniss in emotional pain.<br/><br/>(Another slight spoiler.) Speaking of the omnipotent/omniscient Snow, that's another irritating aspect of the film. Snow has hidden cameras and spies everywhere and miraculously knows nearly everything going on. Why hasn't he blown the rebel base to smithereens before now? Why does he wait until this movie to do it? Makes no sense. Why does he not send in ground troops to ensure destruction of the rebel base after he has bombed it? Makes no sense. The right way to do would have been for Snow not know where the base was or even that it existed - but then there would have been no excuse for the uninteresting bombing scene with its fake drama of the barely-rescued younger sister and her cat.<br/><br/>There's another low-budget element that irks me in a high-budget undertaking such as this. How does the capital city manage to survive while it is bombing into oblivion all the productive cities in its periphery? Where does it get its minerals, silicon chips, food, fuel, plastics, planes, cars, guns, asphalt, cement, cloth, machinery, nail clippers, scissors, kitchen utensils, spices, books, ink, paper, toys, diapers, diaper pins, etc., etc. Does it make them all itself? Do you know any city on Earth that comes even remotely close to being able to do that? Of course not. Shades of the potentially good but ultimately trite film Divergent.<br/><br/>Given the high quality of the first two installments in the ""Hunger Games"" series, we had good reason to expect another good show this time. Unfortunately, we didn't get it. The acting is good, and the plot does advance a little, so overall I give the film four stars."

","To be frank- lets be real and get down to the nitty-gritty - (NO SPOILERS)<br/><br/>This was a total waste of my time and money. The two movies prior to this one were very good to say the least, however, what used to be an EAGERNESS and NEED to watch and enjoy the series, turned into a disappointment and a mere subtle want to FINISH the series. This was a boring annoyance that was more a waste of my money and time than anything else. They just wanted to drag out the series, when really... you honestly could just skip to the end of the movie where the real action (or whats actually important) happens out of the entire movie. You wouldn't have even needed to see the first hour and a half. The entire first hour and a half was ""okay, now what?"" ""seriously storyline? get to it, nothing is happening"" all complete FILLER until the end where they want to leave you with a poor excuse for a cliff hanger. Pathetic. VERY DISAPPOINTED! For those of you who say ""oh well this was still an entertainment and still worth watching, and (justification justification justification, blah blah blah) still watch it""- I absolutely disagree. <br/><br/>It would be more worth it to wait until you can rent it, or watch it on Netflix just before the next (hopefully redeemable) movie comes out. For those of you who say ""This wouldn't have fit into one movie?"" BS. It was all boring filler until the end."
"slicedbread117","6","23","36","25 November 2014"," A Series Stripped of Its Power
","After walking out of the theater having just seen The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, my initial reactions were a bit conflicted. My first thoughts towards it were quite negative. Then I had to think of the film coming from the standpoint that it is, after all, a lead up to the grand finale, hence the Part 1. But then I came to the conclusion that whether viewed as a standalone or set-up film, Mockingjay - Part 1 fails to meet the high expectations set by its predecessors, leaving a juggernaut series deprived of its power.<br/><br/>As a lead up to the (hopefully) bigger and better Part 2, Mockingjay - Part 1's job is simple: deliver an exciting film that builds the series' current momentum forward and creates mass anticipation for the eventual finale. At the end of the day, Part 1 doesn't meet that goal. Not only was it borderline boring but more importantly, my high anticipation for the final chapter of this series has been heavily damaged. I was far and away more excited to see Part 1 following Catching Fire than I am for Part 2 following Part 1, and in a two part film finale, that's exactly what you don't want.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the actual movie a bit. We pick up right where Catching Fire left off. Lead character Katniss Everdeen as been chosen to be the face of a revolution against the tyrant Capitol and the movie makes it seem like all Hell is going to break lose. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the film suffers from being slow, shallow and uneventful. Too often does the movie trap itself in sluggish scenes while trying to make the audience care about the mass conflict between the Capitol and Rebellion. Any momentum the movie picks up is almost immediately shot down by another slow, heart-felt seen about being sad or angry at the past or at the present situation. The pacing of the film is that of a disjointed sloth, leaving little to zero space for the viewer to become eager for the next scene. All of this makes the movie seem like it's stretching itself way too thin, making you wonder if a two part film was even necessary in the first place. <br/><br/>Action is scarce, something that is undeniably critical to create success for The Hunger Games name. I mean, Katniss fired ONE arrow the entire movie. Not exactly the idea of exhilarating. There are a few intense action scenes, but they're often too quick to get excited about. One clear downfall of Part 1 is it's lack of an actual Hunger Games. While I understand that the story bases from the book and may not exactly be the fault of the writers, what sets the series apart from others is The Hunger Games themselves. Now that you take that away, it just becomes another action film which happens to use past Hunger Games as a background. In terms of overall story arc, it doesn't hurt as badly because of the continuing development of the franchises's story. But in terms of the immediate story and the film's enjoy-ability, the absence of the franchise's most dynamic feature hurts. When it comes to action and intensity, Part 1 talks the talk, but certainly doesn't walk the walk.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is now the glue holding this once great cast together. After having such words of praise for the film's cast in Catching Fire, most of the major players didn't seem to bring their A game for Part 1. Outside of Lawrence, I still deeply enjoyed the performances of Donald Sutherland as antagonist President Snow and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom the film was dedicated to. But unlike the earlier entries in the series, they same cannot be said for Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson and especially newcomer Julianne Moore as President Coin, who never captures the essence of her character's power and influence. For most of the cast, it was almost as if they were just dragging through the movie, like they were saying ""get on to Part 2 all ready"". This seems to be partially due to a poorly written script. Luckily Lawrence saves the day with another wonderful performance and stops the entire cast from completely nose-diving.<br/><br/>The positives are still there, if minimal. Along with the acting of Lawrence, Sutherland and Hoffman, as a set-up film Part 1 does get some things right. Although dull, the character development and charisma between the characters grows deeper so when Part 2 comes along, we'll all ready known who everyone is and what they stand for. Some new characters are welcome additions, and though unexplored in Part 1, the background was set up nicely for Part 2 to blow people's minds.<br/><br/>Some people say it was all for the second half and that you have to look past the minimal action and slow pacing. But my mind has been set. The painfully sluggish pacing, dismal scenes of unexciting dialogue, lack of hardly any action and overall poor acting puts the fire right out for this massive franchise. It may be blowing up the box office, but make no mistake, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is like a joke with no punch line; it's half-hearted and leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"jz3532","5","19","29","30 November 2014"," A Huge Disappointment
","Besides Noah, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 was the worst movie I have seen from 2014. The repetitive boring nonsense that made up the film literally put me to sleep. The movie followed this single formula for the entire film: 1. Make Katniss propaganda movie. 2. Show people in Districts get mad at Capitol. 3. Capitol gets mad and either attacks the districts, makes Peeta make a propaganda film, or both. 4. Repeat. It is also completely ridiculous how stupid the final attack from president Snow is. How was Peeta going to kill Katniss when he knows there are going to be guards around her? Why didn't he hypnotize all of the other tributes? Why didn't he just say, ""Bring Katniss here or I will kill Peeta."" Then send videos of Peeta being tortured to District 13 and drive Katniss crazy? The whole point of ""Hunger Games"" is so there can be actual ""Hunger Games""! Not some boring political bull sh*t. The first movie was entertaining. The Second was an improved version of the first. The third was a boring pile of sh*t."

","I hesitate to add my underwhelming review to the rapidly growing list of IMDb User Reviews that are saying what this movie is - money grubbing at the box office with a franchise that already had a somewhat difficult premise to accept - youngsters fighting to the death. But this time the marketeers really did get the job done - Mockingjay - Part 1 - they have undoubtedly killed this series right there, Part 1 of 1.<br/><br/>It's difficult to find anything good to say, and the other IMDb Reviewers are already laying bare the faults: The movie just drags and drags, the plot is so thin and trite there really isn't any, if you've seen the TV previews you've already seen the only real action sequence, and the dialog is just awful. Long, lingering shots of the admittedly handsome young guys in the movie might appeal to 14-year old girls, but the rest of our audience - mostly Seniors - was seriously nodding off, even SNORING, way before this mess reached its agonizingly long run time of two hours and three minutes.<br/><br/>Interesting actors/characters - with the exception of saying goodbye to Philip Seymour Hoffman - are almost totally missing. President Snow (Donald Sutherland), arguably one of the more interesting characters, is almost absent, and Caesar Flickerman's (Stanley Tucci) appearances are little more than cameos. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) without makeup and the character's goofy outfits/hairdos is hardly recognizable, and Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) is left with so few memorable lines that none of us would have blamed him if he really had been drunk.<br/><br/>In summation, if you want to see Hollywood at its uninspired worst, this movie will git er done . . . if ""Noah"" didn't already."
"JulianHamman","5","24","38","21 November 2014"," Why?
","I'll start out by saying that I'm a huge fan of The Hunger Games franchise. The first movie was really average for me, but I loved Catching Fire for scene after scene of powerful film-making. I've read Mockingjay so I went into it expecting it to be a cash grab and I wasn't disappointed?....<br/><br/>The film started out fantastic for the first minute, and thats about it. Most of the acting was fairly good, Julianne Moore was a good casting choice for President Coin, Woody Harrelson was great, Philip Seymour Hoffman always does good etc. Jennifer Lawrence was good as always, except for 2 moments when I laughed in scenes that were meant to be taken seriously, maybe a tad overacting.<br/><br/>However why was this split into 2 movies? They added Effie's character into the story to stretch out the run time, and talking about stretching out the run time, The entire finale was about 2 pages in the book! In the book it worked because when the eventual twist did happen, we weren't there for the initial scene, only the aftermath. And because there isn't any actual Hunger Games in this movie, they felt like they needed to stuff some action into the movie which again just feels so forced.<br/><br/>Also Donald Sutherland? Hes a great actor, he was fantastic in Catching Fire! The entire capital seemed really threatening in the last movie, here it just seems so forced, they shoe-horn him into the finale just so he can get some sort of screen time at all.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned how a lot of the characters feel pushed into the storyline. But even Katniss doesn't feel genuine. Katniss is still the same person as she has always been, she doesn't learn anything new but cry awkwardly over dead bodies at least 3 times. I thought we'd get more time with Gail and Finnick since they haven't had a great amount of on-screen presence but nope. They are wasted here. I missed the conversations that Gail and Katniss shared in the book, but without comparing it to the book, Gail just seems like a piece of wood anyway.<br/><br/>The movie looks the same as Catching Fire, it's color graded darker and the cinematography is pretty sleek looking. But there was some shaky cam in there... What the hell? The last movie accomplished beautiful wide shots of action, not awful shaky cam - its not even done effectively. <br/><br/>At least with Harry Potter, the book was around 750 words, so there was a lot of content to grasp in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Here i feel like they could've just taken a risk a made it a 3 hour movie for the fans. But even if you haven't read the books, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is terribly unsatisfying and can't help but feel like a 125min trailer for the next movie. By itself, it sucks as it's own movie.<br/><br/>OK ill stop now, enough ranting! There isn't a thing about this movie that is horrendously bad, but there aren't the powerful and thrilling moments of the last installment. Mediocre plays a more prominent role than any of the shoe-horned characters in the movie. A generous 5/10"
"lawrencelimkj","5","24","38","21 November 2014"," A passing mark for an overall underwhelming watch
","After watching Hunger Games original and Catching Fire, I honestly had high hopes for this movie. I must say that I was disappointed greatly as the plot was dull and painfully slow to the extent of the movie becoming stale. I felt as if I was paying money to see President Coin make speeches or Katniss getting interviewed by a camera. The plot isn't horrible by any means, but the whole movie has a lot of unnecessarily long scenes, and yes, I am referring to the speeches and interviews. I felt that will such a painfully slow movie, it would have been better had they decided to launch Mockingbird as a whole, but money I guess. The acting is not horrible, don't get me wrong, but a really, really slow and boring watch really doesn't get me rolling over a movie. If anything, I am not convinced into watching Part 2 when it comes next year."

","This is my first review ever, just because the movie was so terribly lousy that i had an urge to write something... There are hundreds of movies where you have to suppress the tears just by hearing some cello, or some emotional acting. In this one...even they try soooo hard... there is absolutely nothing... no emotions at all, no sparks nothing... just never ending meaningless conversations. (Sadly not even the music can fix that) It really is nothing more than a preview for Part 2, which I certainly won't go to watch it... I wonder how it can get so many positive reviews.... are people really that easy to satisfy, or am i asking to much of a good movie"
"prospectus_capricornium","6","204","391","19 November 2014"," A Two Hour Preview of What to Expect in the Final Movie.
","You may want to save your money and time seeing this movie and wait for the last installment to come out next year, instead. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence, this movie offers nothing more than just a long and tiring tale of preparation for an impending rebellion.<br/><br/>Readers shouldn't get surprised: Mockingjay's first half chronicles District 13's efforts to groom Katniss as their heroine against the ruthless ruling Capitol. The process of transforming her into what they call the 'Mockingjay', a symbol of revolution, is engaging enough to ignite interest, but only up to a point, when long speeches and depictions of what the Hunger Games' downfall has caused, have almost become the only few things eating up the biggest slice of the movie's airtime pie. There is nothing much to see here, and while its refreshing to finally see the landscapes to have finally shifted away from the arenas, lack of action eventually makes the scenes that are almost only showing the events in the confinements, hard to appreciate, not to mention difficult to extract sense from.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it has Jennifer Lawrence, and that alone, is enough to pull the entire movie away whenever it leans toward making the audience fall to sleep. Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars."
"mezzoholly","3","20","31","24 November 2014"," Huge Disappointment, It had such potential
","People may say I'm harsh, but it isn't without good reason. This is what happens when you take a long book and try to split it into two movies- which, I get it, they really just wanted more money. If you make it into one, people will argue that it's a bit too long, and you may end up losing some great scenes when they make cuts on the director's floor. But this movie dragged on and on, so many references to the previous movie that we didn't need, and I was getting tired of Jennifer Lawrence: 1) Staring deadpan into the camera in a ""deep"" connection, 2) Crying at the drop of a hat and constantly having an emotional breakdown, 3) Only talking about Peta and basically not giving a damn about anybody else, 4) The lack of any kind of REAL action for at least 3/4 of the movie. I get it, and yes, I have read the books. Katniss goes through a lot, and I understand that mentally/emotionally that takes a toll on any person. But Lawrence falls incredibly short with this one (though it's really not all her fault by any means). Where I used to be rooting for the characters, now I was getting more annoyed with their movements, bored and uncaring with their problems, wondering where the STRONG connections in the first books went between SO MANY characters, and wondering why when their were breaks between characters none of it was really played out or portrayed in a way that would make sense to the audience member. I saw it at a movie tavern, and I watched people walk out THIRTY MINUTES before the movie was done. I was incredibly tempted myself but I figured I paid so I should wait. I didn't even stay to see if there was an easter egg- I ALWAYS STAY TO SEE IF THERE'S AN EASTER EGG- because I was so over it and just didn't care. Don't waste your money in theaters, a dollar rental or a download to your T.V./computer will do just fine- there was no real action to see in this anyway, save for the last 2 minutes of the movie, and even THAT I'm sure you can find on youtube. So sad, I'll probably just download the last one online when it comes out, not getting duped and wasting my money like that again."
"theblackscythe","3","20","31","24 November 2014"," Utter mediocrity, dull and disappointing.
","Although I am not a particularly huge fan of this franchise, I have enjoyed the movies up to this point. The first was highly flawed but mostly enjoyable, and the second a large improvement, actually among the better blockbusters of that year. This third entry takes the franchise into a dull, predictable and hugely underwhelming direction however.<br/><br/>The first thing to note here is the acting. It is generally subpar. Lawrence gives the least interesting performance of her career, clearly either tired with the franchise or not engaged by the weak script. The supporting cast is generally filled with talented actors, Harrelson, Hoffman, Moore, Sutherland and Dormer. However they are almost all wasted, given little to do and often spend time filling the screen with no real purpose. The is most glaringly obvious with Harrelson, who spends the majority of the film wandering around in the background with zero purpose. All of these great actors are shelved in favour of the dull mediocrity that is Liam Hemsworth, who is given a huge amount of screen time here. His presence is comparable with a small moist stone in your sock, irritating and uncomfortable without arousing much of a direct reaction from the victim. The only good performance of note is Natalie Dormer, who is given a passable amount of screen time and appears to be the only actor enjoying themselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography, CGI, lighting and set design are all dull and forgettable, not worthy of description or discussion. As is the predictable and horrendously repetitive script, which features around four separate scenes wherein Lawrence's character cries whilst surrounded by rubble and debris.<br/><br/>Finally, I will look at the film from the perspective of somebody who has in fact read the trilogy. Mockingjay is a bad book. It has some of the most rushed pacing I have ever seen, and has no character of emotional depth to it. However this film is bad in a totally different, if equally offensive way. It is bland, personality free and lazy to witness. The action is tacked on and boring, the characters are as dull as in the book, and the pacing non-existent. This is a massive disappointment, and a sad collapse of an otherwise decent film series. I would say I have hopes for Part 2, however the second half of the book is a hilarious disaster already, so I am very sceptical."

","I liked the first movie, despite the strange allusions to Willy Wonker, and the Sequel with its introduction to the world of Victors which actually seemed a bit more realistic.<br/><br/>But the 3rd movie seems to be a glory fest for the main character and her love - a bit like Twilight meets Jesus Christ Superstar all of a sudden. Everything else - even the war - the other characters - take a physical back step.<br/><br/>I found it ridiculous that in the midst of a genocidal war, a technological war even - the main character can go rambling around doing her own excursions in a battlefield area - at one stage even having a picnic out in the open in a warzone. The Capital didn't have drones? They didn't have snipers? The Capital didn't have the radar or even a nuke missile?<br/><br/>It seems more like a wet dream dreamed up for the Socialist International. Look I hate the excesses of the capitalist system as much as you do - but having unarmed people storm machine gun stormtrooper soldiers who are so technological advanced that they don't have barbed wire barricades and where everything is hinged on the whims of a teenage girl armed with a bow and arrow fighting in a super advanced war is about as believable as a porn plot but not half as amusing. <br/><br/>This is a ridiculous story - best to watch this if you're drunk."

When I left this movie, I had the same opinion I had about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Just when things are about to go down for real, the credits roll, which is really disappointing.

If I had to do it over, I would wait and watch this on Blu Ray right before the final movie releases next year. Save your money and the frustration of sitting through the first half of this film. <br/><br/>The second half picked up nicely and we got some story.

"manuel-zizek92","5","17","26","8 December 2014"," I Feel Confused About This Movie
","First of all, Im not a big Hunger Games fan. I like the previous two movies, but I did not read the books (because Im not a reader. The Only books that I have read, are the Harry Potter book-series, because I am a big fan of HP).<br/><br/>I liked the first movie better, than the second. I know that many people would disagree with me, but I like more the indie lower-budget movie style (1st movie) than big budget, that just wants to impress you (2nd movie).<br/><br/>About the 3rd Hunger games... I have mixed feelings. It is definitely the weakest of all movies. It just isn't satisfying. It feels so empty. Everything that is in the movie is good or great, but than, when you look at the whole movie again, it is just 1 hour and 45 minutes of talking and 15 minutes of action. It is kind of boring. Smart, but even smartness after an hour turns in ""boringness"".<br/><br/>Like I said, I did not read any of the books (but I heard that Mockingyaj is the worst one), so I can not really know if this is true, but I got a feeling, that the novel was split in to two movies just for the money. Because, you know, you just have to do that. HP started it (witch was clever, because that book really needed to be made in two movies) and now ALL the novel based teen-type movies do it.<br/><br/>So, to sum it all up, this is a money grabbing movie, with clever dialogue & powerful acting. But this was definitely not necessary to THG movie franchise. It kind of ruined lot of respect for the till-now-praised movie series. It is the same, what is The Hobbit to Middle Earth, or Star Wars prequels to Star Wars franchise. Not bad, but the worst.<br/><br/>But, the thing is, you have to watch this movie, to understand what will be going on in the next. Well done Linsgate, you failed with this one, you sell-out!"
"ArchonCinemaReviews","6","19","30","5 December 2014"," Purely for Profit Unnecessary division of 3rd novel yields droning Part 1
","Lionsgate chooses to break up the final film of the Hunger Games series, and in the process produces a rather droning Mockingjay Part 1.<br/><br/>The film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 starts where its predecessor ended. Panem is facing a revolt started by Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence, as set up at the end of Catching of Fire. In which previous victors of the games were once forced to fight for their lives knowing there would be but one left alive.<br/><br/>After being thrown into the Hunger Games for a second time when Katniss thought she was safe, and having seen her friends die and Peeta held hostage by the Capitol, she is traumatized. Kidnapped and taken by the rebels to District 13, she is once again thrust in the heart of the revolution that she helped to ignite as the symbolic face of the effort.<br/><br/>As far as adaptations go, The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 follows the story set forth by Suzanne Collins pretty accurately. Having split the final book of the trilogy into two parts allows the production company some freedom in faithfulness. Having read the books myself I know the third book is the odd narrative of the bunch, focusing more on revolutionary warfare than the cruel realities of the games.<br/><br/>While I understand a potential film would have been a behemoth in length had the book Mockingjay not been broken up into parts, it seems that not enough content is in Part 1. It drones on for the first 40minutes at District 13 while Katniss comes to grips with her role as the symbolic mockingjay when this transformation easily could have been abridged substantially. The increased time invested in showing the rebel effort allows a lull to occur by the one hour mark when viewers realize they still have an entire second half of the movie to endure.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is relatively well acted though monotonously toned in the emotions of their characters. None go through any sort of transformation or evolution and by the end of the film all are exactly as they started. Mockingjay Part 1 does divide the book at a very appropriate point, though the film should have ended three minutes earlier, and still leaves audiences excited for the much anticipated conclusion to the series with Mockingjay Part 2.<br/><br/>For more FULL reviews of ALL the RECENT releases, please check out our website."

","I literally had to force my eyes open during the movie. My friends kept asking me if we can leave the movie in the middle. This is how boring and slow this movie is. I really find no reason to divide one book into two movies besides money in few pockets, of course. <br/><br/>Some people argue that you had to split the book into two movies to develop the characters but I dare to ague. If you cannot develop a character in one scene for a two hours movie then there is something wrong with your direction, Mr. Lawrence. The movie lingers on the same subject again and again. They keep talking about the same thing. Repeated dialogues between sisters, with Gale, with Finnick, with team from Panem, with President and Heavensbee. How to make Katniss a rebel kind? Wasn't she a kind from the beginning of this series? What is the need to keep telling her that she is the face to the revolution? I think it was made pretty much clear to her in Catching Fire. But somehow every character in the movie felt the need to convince her that she has to lead a revolution. Come on now. How much prepping up does Katniss need?<br/><br/>On the brighter side, the movie has really done well in special effects, creating cityscape and spectacular visuals. Showing gradual decline of the Pita's health is also a smart move. But in spite of that, movies has failed miserably to keep the audience engaged. This is because the story just refuses to advance. Some sequences are unnecessarily prolonged, even the action sequences. When everyone is running to find shelter why is it necessary for the cat to stay behind thus stretching the scene. Suddenly, in the middle of revolution saving the cat became high priority.<br/><br/>The movie has too many flaws. In an advanced world with top class weaponry two fighter planes have to circle around multiple times to hit a target. Now, the target is not one person. It is a huge hospital building for crying out loud. When you are forcing an enemy to broadcast a message in your favour isn't it a good idea to record the message, edit it and then broadcast it. Not that you give him every chance to say anything on a live feed. I am sure, in a technically modern world, this wasn't a difficult thing to do. And where is this war going on that everyone keeps talking about like a cheap play on the stage. But there are hardly any scenes of war. On top of that, there is a confusing love story between Katniss, Gale, and Pita. What is with her obsession of saving Pita? She is not even sure if she love him or not. When everyone is planning to revolt against Capitol she doesn't mind endangering the mission by only talking about how to save Pita. Focus girl.<br/><br/>Besides the special effects, other good thing about the movie is Philip Seymour Hoffman. The man just doesn't stop to impress me with his subtle improvisations in acting. In a room full of actors he can simply steal all of your attention. I am not sure how much he has completed the second part but he might be the only reason I will risk my reputation to watch it. <br/><br/>In conclusion, movie is just waste of time and money. Do yourself a favour and watch something else."

"StevePulaski","4","20","32","24 November 2014"," A film that needs to be justified before it can be praised
","I've made my lukewarm opinions about ""The Hunger Games"" film franchise rather apparent in my reviews of the last two films. While being enjoyable for a short period of time for their action sequences during the actual games and the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen, the previous two films have always found a way to include some sort of feature that prevents me from giving them positives reviews. The first film was burdened by mediocre direction, which felt almost constantly off balance or unsteady in its videography, and the second film found itself including too many hokey sequences before descending into tiresome survivalist action.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is the first of the two part finale to this series, and can effectively be summed up as a two hour trailer for the second part. Being a film conducted in two parts, the first part is inevitably setup for the second part, which will undoubtedly be the climactic part of the two films. With ""Mockingjay"" being only ten pages shy of four-hundred, splitting the film into two films over two hours in length is a questionable decision. Taking a book that is already questionably long enough to sustain two parts and making the first part a dreary plod through exposition and talky setups is enough to make me lose the limited amount of appreciation I had for this franchise.<br/><br/>The film sees Lawrence reprise her role as Katniss, and reminds us of how Katniss destroyed the annual Hunger Games and essentially left her home of District 12 in ruins. After being relocated to District 13, Katniss, suffering from severe flashbacks and trauma, is recruited by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), a rebel leader, who wants to use Katniss as propaganda for a potential civilian unrest. On top of this newfound gig, Katniss is also trying to rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) from the capital, who have taken him prisoner. Katniss blames old District 12 victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) for Peeta's capture, who promised to save him before her. The film follows Katniss's many battles with what seems to be some type of post-traumatic nightmares, her fragile emotional state, and her gig as a propaganda figure for the potential capital uprising.<br/><br/>For starters, any outcries of praise for Katniss being a dominate and strong-willed female character should dwindled to faint muffles after the complete character reversal we see occur in this film. Katniss, who has always been something of a clichÃ© of herself or, at very least, an archetype, has no resorted to being a character who whines and cries powerlessly with every event. Never do we see the same determined and incorruptible force of a character we saw in the previous films, who is innovative and selfless, but instead one who is far less interesting and cursed with a weepy and fragile ego.<br/><br/>On top of that, we get dreadfully boring exposition in the way that talks about the rise in propaganda in Panem. What could've been rich with commentary unfortunately finds itself remaining stagnant in terms of simply existing and providing little payoff. Scenes involve Katniss, Coin, and a gaggle of other characters talking about potential civil unrest in the districts before we see Katniss having another traumatic nightmare inside a hospital, desperately crying out for Peeta. The film keeps circling itself in this manner, and it doesn't help that Lawrence, who, as I've said before, is a gifted actor when she's playing human characters in realistic environments, handles the emotional scenes with an evident element of overacting that neither intensifies or captivates but instead finds ways to offput.<br/><br/>The contents and existence of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" will be justified by the devoted fans of Suzanne Collins' book series as necessary for a complete adaptation, to which I do not disagree; we need elements of setup and narrative articulation not only for clarity but so the climactic parts can succeed on greater, more emotional levels. The issue is we don't need two hours and a separate film for the events, and what perhaps could've worked out at least adequately results in nothing more than a blatant cash-grab for a franchise Lionsgate clearly doesn't want to only be worth three films."
"3xHCCH","5","22","36","23 November 2014"," Should Have Just Made One Big Film
","With the first two parts of the Hunger Games films doing so well critically and in the box office, anticipation for the concluding installment was very high. Following the path previously set by the Harry Potter and Twilight Saga franchises, the producers also decided to divide the last book in the series, Mockingjay, into two parts. Now that I have seen the first part, I thought this decision may have been misguided.<br/><br/>This film begins right where the previous one stopped where Katniss wakes up in District 13 where she was taken by rebels after she destroyed the Quarter Quell arena with her arrow. Katniss becomes the symbol of the rebellion by appearing in incendiary promotional advertisements, but Katniss was angry with them because they left her partner Peeta behind at the Capitol. Backed with the technical knowhow of Beetee, President Coin of District 13 sends a covert mission led by Gale to rescue Peeta and the other Victors from their captivity. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is far and away the best performer in this film. Her face is really rich in unspoken emotions. Josh Hutcherson gets to flex some of his acting muscles more in this one as the brainwashed Peeta Mellark. It was good to see old characters played by Woody Harrelson, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Hemsworth, Jeffrey Wright and Sam Claflin, though their roles were very limited here. New to the cast, acclaimed actress Julianne Moore is rather one-note in her performance as President Coin. <br/><br/>The best moments of this film for me actually had to do with music. The first would be that sublime moment where Katniss sang the haunting tune called ""The Hanging Tree."" The next one would already be during the closing credits when the incredible new song of Lorde ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" was played. <br/><br/>Overall though, I felt disappointed that this film cannot stand on its own. Unlike the action-packed first two films, this one was just a lot of slow talky scenes which the talented actors cannot do much about to make them any more exciting. That one awesome scene where Katniss shot down a plane with an arrow was even already shown in trailers. No other action sequence matched that one. This whole film clearly served nothing but to just set-up for the big concluding episode to be shown next year. <br/><br/>There were a lot of scenes which were unnecessarily prolonged just to pad up the running time. The scenes showing the destruction of District 12 were actually shown twice. The escape to the underground bomb shelter scenes were extended too long. I thought judicious editing could have made these scenes tighter, so that the whole story could have been told in one big spectacular film. Judging from what happened to this one, dividing the last book into two parts may have just succeeded to make the last two films two incomplete films.<br/><br/>Anyway as US box office receipts come in making ""Mockingjay Part 1"" earn the biggest domestic opening weekend this year ($123M!), I'm sure fans will still all watch this whatever critics and other people say. And definitely, we will all be hanging on for one more year for that explosive Part 2 to come along and blow us away. 5/10."

Acting is bad; especially the main role actress does the 'credit'. I will admit that previous parts entertained me to some extent, but this one not only disappointed me. It made me so angry, that I wanted to complain to OFCOM. The trailer showed completely different film. 2.5 hours of boring talking about nothing with poor acting!

"lasttimeisaw","5","16","25","30 November 2014"," Where do they spend the monstrous budget in this character-driven episode?
","This third installment of THE HUNGER GAMES arrives as appointed, although the money- grubbing maneuver to divide the final book into two movies can automatically repel those who are not in the fan-base, and feel disgusted by its rapacious appetite. Actually it is where I belong, unfortunately, Moore is the new addition in the cast, as President Coin, leadership usually is not in her wheelhouse, remember CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10)? Plus my perfectionist side urges me to continue since I have watched the first two THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10) and THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE (2013, 6/10), for better or worse, I will definitely watch the final chapter next year to wrap it up, sorry to fall into the machination of capitalistic greed. However, I will keep a clear mind to next year's INSURGENT (2015) and MAZE RUNNER: SCORCH TRIALS (2015). <br/><br/>One thing I do appreciate from this film is its subtle inclination to obscure the absolute dichotomy between the capital and the rebel and puts Katiness (Lawrence) into a moral dilemma, her unassuming personality and indomitable bravery enables the heroism which can motivate the suppressed hoi polloi, but here she is so easily being demoted as a propaganda weapon to wage a war against the capital, which for herself, she is not quite sure too. What's the difference will be if the rebel finally wins? The sacrifice will be grave, and no one can assure the new government will not follow the same old road to ruin. The story actually has a clearer mind towards the political game, but eventually the author and the filmmakers would all pander to what readers or audience want to read or watch: the final combat with barrages of visual spectacles and the corny love stories in the battlefield, so much for YA demography. <br/><br/>Due to the fact that Part 1 only covers the preliminary measurement of the endgame and lacks of substantially tantalizing action pieces, apart from using her arrow shot down two bombers, Katiness is barely in the move, instead, she broaches a more dramatic mental reconstruction in the movie, Jennifer Lawrence noticeably has more close-ups on her rational struggle and personal revelation, she needs to fight her own conscience to be the war instigator, even it is under the name of righteousness, and finds her own place of being ""the one"" instead of a replaceable pawn in the plot. It is her powerful acting (plus a mediocre singing) makes up for the discouraging inertness, still, it is not enough, especially for such a heavily budgeted tent-pole, the film never shows where do they use the massive money? <br/><br/>Peeta (Hutcherson), although retreats to a talking head most of the time, Hutcherson in fact eventuates in a more admirable performance than rest of the group, especially he is the key variable in the final stage. Moore, with a fruitful awards season beckons, in here, what she pulls off is President Coin's affable persona, her air as a true altruistic leader, her gentle but affirmative deliverance is formulaic yet, under such circumstances, is affecting. As a Moore devotee who have never read Collins' novel, my wishful thinking is that there is a dramatic twist here to explode in the culmination concerning Coin's patina of inscrutability and caginess. <br/><br/>Since Katiness is the sole center of the narrative, the bulky supporting crew is relegated to bells and whistles, it will be a shameful waste for Dormer's killing coiffure if her Cressida remains so characterless in the Part 2. Finally, it will be remiss not to mention the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, although it is really a nuisance to end his luminous career with such effortless offerings, he will be warmly remembered."
"blossoms-733-387580","2","25","42","24 November 2014"," Katniss Everdeen is an alpha female, Jennifer Hudson not so much
","I was so disappointed with Jennifer Hudson's portrayal of Katniss Everdeen. In the book ""Mockingjay"" Katniss is a complete badass. Vulnerable at first she gradually becomes self-assured, confident, decisive, rebellious, unyielding--the commander of an army and the de facto leader of the rebellion. She barks out orders and they are obeyed. She is at times violent, tough, fearless, and commanding. Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games"" book series reminds me of the daughters and nieces of Ghenghis Khan--some were such skilled warriors on the battlefield that they remained undefeated by any man or woman to their dying day. I had questioned whether the much more conventionally feminine and milder Jennifer Hudson would be able to depict Katniss as she really is in Suzanne Collin's book, and I was right--she could not capture the leadership qualities and self-confidence of Katniss Everdeen. Katniss is an alpha female, Hudson not so much.<br/><br/>Hudson's Katniss is unsure of herself and full of self-doubt. She spends half of the movie crying (or clinging to men while crying). While the movie accurately highlights Katniss's deep concern for the people she loves, it doesn't allow Katniss to be the commanding leader of a rebellion as she is meant to be.<br/><br/>Is it because Hollywood is uncomfortable with strong female leads? Or is it that they just want to ""soften up"" Katniss to be more palatable to mainstream audience members? I don't know, but Jennifer Hudson's Katniss is a flimsy shadow of the real one.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed with this weak, non-threatening, offensively submissive version of Katniss that I am voting with my money and will not be going to see ""Mockingjay - Part 2"". The Hunger Games books, if you haven't read them, is young adult fiction intended for a mostly young female audience. The books do a great job in inspiring girls to be bold, strong, take risks, and be in charge. These are the kind of books that I want my own daughter to read. This movie stripped the heroine of all her strength. Hollywood executives once again prove themselves to be increasingly out of touch with public attitudes and cling to old, outdated ideas about gender roles."

But there is just something about these movies that makes me hate them...<br/><br/>In fact, there is quite a few.<br/><br/>The actors, for the most part are not that appealing. This is made even worse with the characters they play, with such over-acting and pantomime like approach.<br/><br/>Their character names are some of the most annoying I have come across, and cringe when each and everyone says Peeta as if they have a speech problem and just want to call him Peter.<br/><br/>Regardless, and for the sake of my husband, I had to endure the first two, of which you can find my reviews there. There is too much nonsense and typical Hollywood goofs to go on about, but with part 2 slightly better than the first, I went in to this one without complaining much, expecting a rip roaring adventure that may see the actors a little more comfortable in their roles that would lead to enjoying them a bit better...<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>Thumbs up for creating a darker, more bleak version of its previous movies, but having hardly any recollection of how part 2 ended so abruptly, I was lost from the get-go.<br/><br/>What I did find however, was that this was more Divergent than Hunger Games, layered somewhat over the blue print of the Matrix Revolutions, which in itself was a big mess of a movie!<br/><br/>Once again, the sheer appearance of the chubby faced Lawrence and not-so-pretty Hutcherson had me cringe each time they appeared on screen. Other characters were less pantomime which was helpful, and yet again, the mess of Hollywood goofs kept me entertained to the end...<br/><br/>Katpiss' arrows always staying the same number even after being fired. The Capitol being able to broadcast video even during a power shortage. And my favourite, the Hollywood CCTV camera!<br/><br/>Even with so many 'talented' crew and film makers on board, this one never fails to amaze me... We, as the viewers, watch as Katpiss shoots down some aircraft that are after them. Then later, we see a cleverly edited video of her doing so in a promotional effort, that includes many of the shots used by the film makers for us.<br/><br/>That means, those in District 13 would have had to contact the producers of THG: Mockingjay 1 and ask for said footage, which in theory we all know would be a tricky thing for them to do. But somehow, it all happens for them. Amazing!<br/><br/>A film about democracy, that sees all of those in the corner for it, dressed alike, living alike and chanting alike, in a very communist way... All that state of the art technology underground, and they are still serving slop, dressing in boiler suits, and don't even have a coffee machine.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Part 1 will do for the fans no doubt, but it was long winded, boring and then some. No doubt when we all see the last instalment, we will then get a better idea of what they could have chopped out to make one big film that entertained.<br/><br/>Until then..."

Her acting skills seemed weak in this movie and at times she looked as bored as I was watching the movie. <br/><br/>This movie just does not work in its two part format. The previous two movies has well rounded stories and build up of characters but in this movie the story was jumping all over the place. <br/><br/>Although I applaud the directors focus on the different elements of war i.e propaganda, rescue missions, bombing raids I found some of scenes of Katniss with her old flame and friend boring and dead. <br/><br/>The movie seemed pretty thin on the use of SFX which I attribute to the saving of the budget for the second part of the movie.

","This is the third movie in the Hunger Games series. I better state right away that I have not read the books so I do not know how good the books are or if the movies actually follow the book. However, if the movies are any indicator then I will probably not bother to read the books. So far these movies have been a display in over-hyped mediocrity as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>The previous movies had a somewhat ludicrous setup with people running around in ridiculous hair-do and makeup. I was not too thrilled about it but at least it gave the movie some originality. So did the games themselves. This one lacks all of that. It could be any one of a dozen post-apocalyptic stories.<br/><br/>The movie plods along at a fairly leisurely pace, sometimes it is quite dull and slow, with some outbursts of action. Katniss herself is really not taking much active part except for being a front figure and propaganda element for the rebellion. In order to milk the series as much as possible for money (I see no other reason why it was done) it was decided to break the third book into two movies. I would say that this movie is a good example as to why that is generally not a good idea.<br/><br/>The acting is on par with the movie. It is decent enough but nothing to write home about. Then since most of the movie really is about Katniss hulking and moaning about the unfairness of it all it is maybe not too surprising that I found most of it somewhat uninspired and dull. The same can be said about the special effects. Actually I found most of them to be rather underwhelming. There were also a fair amount of lost moments. For instance the attack on the dam. It could have been made into something nice but instead we get a ludicrous display of a bunch of unarmed people running straight against machine guns planting some bombs and then poof goes a model dam.<br/><br/>Having now seen three out of the planned four movies I am of course going to see the fourth one as well but I am definitely not going to be in a rush to go and see it."

The only action is revealed and actually seen in the official trailer.<br/><br/>The characters are totally ruined and Katniss in spite of her previous acts of sacrifice, becomes very selfish, ready to let the whole nation bleed for her own feeling of satisfaction. The new characters are not properly developed and some old ones have rather random appearance, making the plot a set of mostly random and unimportant acts and moments.<br/><br/>The young adult previously fighting for her life (and the lives of others) and prepared to kill now becomes a teenager totally lost in her little sorrows and feelings. Again and again and again until the film is over.<br/><br/>I had some expectation after the first two instalments and this felt like a let-down."

","I can tell that really I was so excited about this film getting me watched it on the first day of its showing with my family who are also a big fan of this movie series. Hmm, but despite of the great acting of the actors, (I do love Jennifer Lawrence), the delivery of the script, scenes that are effective/captivating and with good story flow.. I don't know, I'm still bit disappointed that I'm actually waiting for something that I know the the first 2 movie installations have in it. I know that with some parts I'm still thrilled and amazed but I was really expecting something that really don't happened or i guess something that I wanted to happen that doesn't then took place. With all the lines of the actors, it then become more of a drama than of having an action-packed film that made me thrilled and hooked with it in the first place. But still, I'm gonna watch Mockingjay: Part-2 just not thinking of this Part-1 that kinda made me bit disappointed. Hoping that the 2nd one will have all my expectations that I know will overcome what then happened with this 1st one."
"Chiller7","2","8","11","26 April 2015"," Blandest movie-going experience in recent memory
","I casually enjoyed the first two films, but was not a major fan or anything like that. I thought they were watchable enough, watched them one time each, did not obsess too much about them and did not read the books; so, walking into this third film, I didn't have any sort of high expectations for where the story was going or what would happen to the characters - I didn't even remember any of the characters' names aside from Katniss, Peeta, and President Snow. I was just in the mood for some action. That's it. It's all I wanted. Just as long as there was some action in the movie, I would have been satisfied. But... this movie failed to deliver even that much!<br/><br/>There was only one scene, involving some evil attack-planes, that can qualify as a genuine action scene in the entire movie, but even that sequence was rather short - in fact, the most exciting moment in that scene (and the whole movie) was one they'd already shown us in the movie's preview trailer, when Katniss shoots her arrow at the planes.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just nothing but extended scenes that go nowhere, in which nothing much happens, dragged-out far longer than they needed to be. In fact, with our main character stuck in an underground bunker for most of the movie, almost all the action primarily happens off-screen. Whenever something potentially exciting happens, we generally don't get to see the action itself, just a bunch of people in a room staring at monitors.<br/><br/>The movie also had a big problem with feeling repetitive, continually showing us scenes that establish nothing except what we already know. For example, the first time Jennifer Lawrence wanders through the wreckage and rubble left behind by an attack from the Capitol against the innocent district-dwellers, we get the sense that the Capitol is bad and they do horrible things and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad; we get the idea. But then later on, she wanders through another scene of wreckage and rubble in another long-and-drawn out scene. And then we get yet another scene just like that! We get it already! How many times do you have to establish that the Capitol are the bad guys and that Jennifer Lawrence is sad? Hurry up and get on with it already!<br/><br/>But they don't get on with it. It just keeps dragging on and on until by the time the movie ended, I found myself asking: That's it? The movie's over already? Really? But nothing happened yet!<br/><br/>Without having ever read the books or knowing what's going to happen next, even I can tell that they did not need to split this chapter into two segments. Instead of this dull, unnecessary episode, I'm sure there's no reason they couldn't have just squashed all the events of this film into the first act of the final film.<br/><br/>What a disappointment."

"JeromeGrosen","Null","32","57","17 November 2014"," Feminist and Communist Revolution
","When I first watched the Hunger Games movies, I pictured Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence's character) as a kind of modern-day ""Robin Hood"". Through her mastery of the bow-and-arrow and through her brilliance as a tactician, Katniss Everdeen becomes an inspiration to millions of poor people who are being oppressed by a tyrannical government.<br/><br/>Yes, I really did try hard to like the Hunger Games for what it was. Unfortunately, by the time I got to this third instalment, I found it almost impossible to ignore all the modern-day progressive propaganda that these films were pushing.<br/><br/>I apologize to the Hunger Games' fans. I know a lot of young people have been inspired by the these movies, just like many young people have been inspired by Communism. But as an avid moviegoer, I think it is important to analyze the messages being conveyed by the movies you watch, and not just blindly (subconsciously) soak them in.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the Hunger Game movies are promoting every progressive agenda on the planet: violent communist revolution, hatred for the rich, moral indifference, affirmative action and radical feminism, to name just a few. <br/><br/>In this latest instalment of the Hunger Games, we see Katniss Everdeen completing the Communist revolution that she unintentionally began in the first two movies. She becomes the leader of her rebel movement. She uses the media to ignite rebellion among the people. She inspires them to fight against their Capitalist overlords. She really does become a modern-day Che Guevara.<br/><br/>While the Communist propaganda in Hunger Games is very overt and obvious, the feminist propaganda is more subtle. We see Lawrence's character constantly out-witting, out-thinking and physically dominating her male competitors.<br/><br/>Katniss is ambitious, cunning and ruthless. She will do anything to achieve her goals, even if it means manipulating (or outright betraying) the men in her life. Through her ruthlessness she achieves political power and becomes a hero to all women who want to be freed from (fictional) male oppression. She is a Feminist dream.<br/><br/>If you're a radical progressive, then, by all means, go watch this movie. On a superficial level it will appeal to you because it is a great action movie. But it will also appeal to you on a much deeper, subconscious level; because underneath the surface it is radically affirming all of your deeply held progressive values.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a great piece of propaganda."

I think dividing a movie in two parts is pretty much the way to kill a movie, I think that maybe whatever happens in the second part could have completed this. now it has no real conclusion. No action at all, sometimes the dumbest solution ever (katniss' sister running for the cat during the bombing). Still like slow movies, but this truly doesn't have any true event happening until second part of the movie.

"wichio","6","18","30","23 November 2014"," What a way of insisting in making a 2 part movie.
","I know the tendency initiated by the Harry Potter saga is a way of (1) making the movie more faithful to the book and (2) the production company to make more money. I assume that when Harry Potter did it, they were struggling with a way of resuming too many important details in 2 hours. 3 tops. From then on, screenwriters have done the opposite, which is focusing in the not so important details of the book to make a 6 hour script and 《then》being able to make two separate movies. <br/><br/>In this case it was fairly evident. The scenes were slow at many points, too many longer than necessary dialogs and sequences. (Like Katniss repeatedly singing her symbol song, Katniss and Gale going hunting, and Katniss repeating at least 10 times ""President Snow, can you hear me?""). <br/><br/>The movie can be resumed in the capitol being a bunch of corrupt mother f***ers and the districts rising against them with Katniss as their symbol. <br/><br/>Most of the most exciting action sequences in the movie didn't even occur around the main characters and the ones that did, were not ones that put them in a difficult enough situation to keep the audience rooting for them on the edge of their seat. <br/><br/>Basically, it becomes just a transition movie, unlike many other movies made out of extracts of a book, it doesn't count with a strong beginning, middle and end. It turns out pretty much flat and the inflection points throughout the film could have come out a lot stronger to keep the audience interested."
"moviescoundrel","6","19","32","25 November 2014"," Hope Part 2 Redeems Part 1
","What to say here? I was reluctant to review this one because I was hoping that after a week of thinking about this movie it would maybe get better or maybe I would want to see it again. No such luck. The same director of the last ""Hunger Games"" film ""Catching Fire"" is back again, only this time...the character development is not as present, the action is not as intense...and it's just...lacking. It does seem to do an okay job of depicting what happened in the book, it's just that the first half of the book is not that interesting as far as a movie goes. I don't think it's that different than the book, it is just difficult to do it justice on the screen as a lot of the first half deals with internal conflict and darkness within Katniss, an area that can be difficult to adapt, although I do think it could have been dealt with better than this. I'm not sure Gary Ross (director of the first Hunger Games film) would have done a better job necessarily, but we'll never know. It seems that the studio always wanted to stretch the final book over two films so it was going to be inevitable as far as the adaptation goes. It just would have been better if we would have been privy to the second half of the book at the same time, here's hoping the follow up this summer is a slam dunk."
"matthewm3109","5","10","15","2 January 2015"," A weak drama that bit off more than it can chew
","First off, let me say that the first two movies in the series were very well done. However, I was disappointed to find 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' to be shallow and weak. <br/><br/>If you want to see the movie for the action, don't. There are very few 'heart-pounding' action scenes. But I get it, the book series matures into a larger statement about oppressive governments and the concept of freedom itself. That said, the movie was neither political nor philosophical. A good example of a stellar film in this category is 'V for Vendetta.' <br/><br/>The greatest disadvantage this film wrought was its insistence to focus on Peeta's personal struggle. It was hard to sympathize with Peeta's problems because the film dragged it along for so long. In the end, the movie was boring and sluggish. It was neither romantic, political, philosophical, nor a simple action film. It was a dull combination of all of these."
"hudakj-1","4","6","8","14 March 2015"," Teen soap fan-fic masquerading as deep futurist commentary
","I was intrigued by the first film. Sure I eventually discovered that the teen romance took center stage despite building this up as some dystopian future epic (or a fantasy world, I couldn't figure out which). The politics/social commentary were a bit simplistic but perhaps they were saving the real meat for part 2. It still whetted your appetite for learning more about this world.<br/><br/>Catching Fire started out decently enough with some passable allusion to the lifestyle of celebrity/political couples and introduced an interesting concept of discontentment within the seemingly loyalist Capitol City elite. However this is where the series started to irritate me with its endlessly generic love triangle, elementary school level black & white politics/social commentary, and downright absurd leaps in suspension of belief.<br/><br/>This latest entry only furthers that downfall into inane tripe. In addition to following we already had to stomach -Sat.Morning cartoon evil empire vs plucky youngster and the most powerful force of all: Hope! If ""hope"" is so dangerous, why have the games at all? Why not just make them entirely broken slaves? -Twilight style soap opera level romance where the female lead spends most of the movie trying to figure out her one true love. More than trying to survive or topple Dr Doom's regime it seems.<br/><br/>-Villainy for the sake of villainy. Why kill off thousands of your slave labor when human beings are supposedly in very short supply. Also, why obliterate your expensive infrastructure when your have lethal poison gas at your disposal? -Technological leaps of faith: We have mind-blowingly stunning futuristic technology (much devoted solely to gladiatorial combat) and can genetically modify bees with hallucinogenic drugs, but can't genetically modify more food for the masses? Those slave work horses are less likely to rebel if you give them a fresh supply of oats.<br/><br/>-Breaking suspension of disbelief. In addition to the questionable tech, we get weird stuff like skin ravaging gas (entirely cured by water) and being blown yards away by electricity while not so much as leaving a visible scar. That and the nagging question: If Katniss is such a threat, why does Snow not just up and kill her? You have no problem killing scores simply for making a hand gesture.<br/><br/>Mockingjay adds the following -It's the third movie and we just now discover another entire rebel army and military HQ has been conveniently waiting behind the scenes this whole time. Apparently for 75 years! -Am I suppose to believe no one in that entire rebel army was capable of sowing the seeds of rebellion or inspiring the slaves to rebel. For an entire 75 years?? -Seriously, why were these guys never mentioned in prior films? -If they've been underground that long, how can they be expected to cope with the sun on the surface? -If the Capitol had the power the brainwash people with drugs, why not brainwash Katniss into a timebomb to discredit her instead of pitting her into another contest? -Yes the Capitol is evil and does evil things. Surprisingly, this is news to people 75 years into its history. And apparently suppose to be surprising to the audience who sat through the past two movies -Snow saw Katniss and the rebels walking among the ruins, yet chooses to bomb the hospital instead of bombing the rebels? Why not both? -I just witnessed a single arrow fired from a bow taking down a futuristic bomber aircraft in a massive explosion. Why did they rebels bother firing hundreds of rounds from an anti-aircraft rifle when a single arrow fired from a bow was more effective? -How many times did Katniss break down over a setback and shout NO!, NO!, NOOO!!! in an agonized expression. How long before she's aware of the dystopian primal world she was born into.<br/><br/>-Peeta appears on TV repeatedly in worse and worse condition over the film. It's suppose to be chilling to notice how ragged he looks in each successive appearance, but the movie doesn't think we have eyes and requires Katniss to spell out every detail that appears on screen before even the audience gets a good look: ""My god, he looks awful!"" ""What have they been doing to him!"" ""Look at him, how terrible!"" repeatedly almost 20 times. Similar things happen throughout the movie.<br/><br/>-They have the ability to hack into the entire capital without consequence....why was this never attempted in earlier films? And why did they need Katniss in particular if they could pre-fab their own propaganda? -For someone who is suppose to be a standard-bearer for the free world, Katniss doesn't spend much of the movie thinking about it. Most is spent on worrying about Peeta, that is between the time where she isn't actively pursuing Gale. Subtle commentary perhaps, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>The movie has a few good ideas, namely that the rebels may not be as noble as they appear and questioning the downright terrorist acts the rebels resort to to win. The first 5 minutes give a false sense of a dystopian visual feast before descending quickly into banality. Also, you can't go wrong with a boyfriend timebomb. It's interesting and cheesy enough to at least grab your attention.<br/><br/>I honestly wouldn't be so hard on this if it wasn't trying so earnestly to be taken as a serious look at a dystopian future and a serious romance-drama despite being, at its core, teenage fluff.<br/><br/>I really should just consider the whole series a lost cause. I seriously doubt it will get much better. But there's one more left. I think I'll manage that just to witness the resulting ""thud"" the this series (or, if a miracle occurs, be pleasantly surprised)."

","It is strange that a book got split into 2 movies. Is it financial or did the sudden success of the prior film cause this? The last movie seems mush longer than this one. Might it be that this decision to make it into 2 parts is a concession to production complications and the loss of Hoffman?<br/><br/>I believe we have to wait until the next installment to see the answer. Another look at Jennifer Lawrence isn't such a bad thing. In this one, they seem to have made her a more conflicted person yet a person being forced to take on a mission rather than having a choice to not do it.<br/><br/>This is a war game of more than just war, it is a game of media coverage trying to convince both sides what to do. This one does have some action, though not as much as the previous film, and a slower pace than the earlier film. This is an action series so fans of action might not like this one as much.

Some less necessary characters are missing and others, like Effie and Snow are expanded upon from what was in the book. The set up appears perfect for what comes next and the sets and action scenes looked really good. I think the slower pacing of the characters is very important in this movie, because of all the changes that are happening with every one of them. I like what this movie did to fill in the gaps of what we could know in the book, because we could only see what Katniss saw in the book. It gives me more to look forward to in each movie. I wonder how much Plutarch will need to change in the last sequel because Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't finish filming his parts before he died?

They ignore so much.<br/><br/>Some fans of Japanese cinema have still been unable to forgive The Hunger Games' resemblance to Battle Royal. They miss out on the bevy of differences and the depth of the setting within The Hunger Games. However tantalizing the world within the movie may be, most reviewers are prone ignore Mockingjay Part 1's greatest strength: Lawrence. <br/><br/>No, not Jennifer Lawrence, though she still plays the part well (albiet a tad too heavy handed). The director Francis Lawrence does a grand job of utilizing visual storytelling and cleverly grafting it in with the plot. Also, this is one of the best edited movies this year, next to Interstellar and Edge of Tomorrow. The soundtrack is notable and Lawrence expertly uses and properly represents the power of music in Mockingjay Part 1. <br/><br/>Addressing the other common complaint - splitting the source material into two movies: Many condemning Part 1 as a shameless cash grab, they wearily buy a ticket and pout while maligning the talent, time, and money (yes, movies COST money) online by engaging in an aggressive campaign against this ""overrated"" and ""plagiarized"" series.

"sesht","Null","14","24","2 December 2014"," Cash-grab, nevertheless.....
","Well. I'm not sure how to review this, since it is incomplete. On purpose too. Just like they did it unnecessarily with 'Breaking dawn' (I know, barf), and since that model proved successful for Lionsgate, they've decided and done the same here. Something that would've made a powerful movie, 3 hours long, has been split into 2, around 2 hours each. While I do grant that this approach allows the characters to breathe, unfortunately, there isn't much material here to justify the split.<br/><br/>Anyway, the rants can go on, but key decisions have been made, and the movie exists in this form, so there. <br/><br/>The bold decision (by the author, not by the makers) was calling the series 'Hunger games' still, though the games ended with the last Quarter Quell that had some very unforeseeable (for us) consequences, that have brought the unrest between the Capitol and the districts into full-on war mode, in spite of all efforts by the Capitol to control the flow of information with all of their in- your-face propaganda (a not-so-clever metaphor for how all media is controlled by the real- world economies).<br/><br/>We have to appreciate the aspect of the author preferring to focus on all the politicking that goes on in this context, and keeping us away from most of the action going on in the background (what the movie does, esp. this first part of the 3rd book, is something else entirely) and instead focusing on how our leads are exploited in the bargain, no quarters given.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman (sadly no more) and JenLaw are all fantastic in their roles, and the casting director should be complimented. Donald Sutherland, at his age, is playing one of the most chillingly evil villains of all time, whilst being topical and relevant to us audiences as well, and once again, this is a job well done by casting, as well as the performer.<br/><br/>Who absolutely stands out from everyone else, in spite of them being acting powerhouses, is Josh Hutcherson, who has undergone a transformation as chilling as the one Christian Bale underwent for 'The Machinist' (or even 'American Hustle'). He perhaps has the most difficult role of all, since this is a narrative with characters playing out deceptions-within-deceptions without the crutch of non- realistic scenarios, and his presence is almost more powerful than Sutherland's.<br/><br/>There are a few instances where the makers show us snippets of what's going on outside of D13, and those sequences seem shoehorned in, but, from a narrative perspective, this movie holds together much, much better than most PG13 examples of YA novels being brought to life these days (think, 'Divergent', 'Maze runner' and the like). <br/><br/>And remember the debt all these authors and film-makers HAVE TO pay to both 'Battle Royale' and 'Lord of the flies'. Unfathomable indeed, in spite of the fact that they seem to have done well in terms of quality, while not exactly treading new(er) ground.<br/><br/>I'll still have to reserve my opinion until I see Part 2, but it makes sense that this one is a good quality addition in the series, as good as the 2nd one was (and that IS weird, since Gary Ross, who directed the first one, is more solid a film-maker than his successor, Francis Lawrence, who has nicely carved himself a niche-kinda position within the context or confines of this series).<br/><br/>The technical aspects, as in the 2nd one (the first one was not as polished, IMO, though that might have been on purpose) are all top- notch, and I'm looking forward to how the sequences have been captured in the one coming next.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt unlucky that this could could not be watched on IMAX, and would have loved to do that. Splitting this one might be costing the team 1/more Oscars as well, but they do get paid, and what's an Oscar worth, in any case, eh?"

It drags along the scenes of JL being sentimental and more motivated for the cause, forcing to develop her character into the rebellion but pathetically failed. At times you feel that Katniss' character was forced to be made a symbol of rebellion when so many other characters could do better.<br/><br/>The movie starts off slow and ends at the same pace. The only thing that saved it from more blushes is Francis Lawrence...what a great director! Background score is as bad as the plot of this movie. You end up thinking what really happened, what has changed and come up with actually NILL.<br/><br/>Acting and Direction are good, and this movie will run good because of its fan-following, but totally lacked depth in the storyline.

The action sequences are drastically lesser as compared to the first two installments, but it works well as a bridge to connect what has already happened previously and to expect what is yet to come. It is clear to see the main intention behind to separate this adventure into two parts, which might look necessary providing that it has just covered a quarter of the last book, but unfortunately rather than presenting further details, it keeps on dragging certain unnecessary parts even though the political satire seems to be quite smart, if audiences are patient enough to follow the dialogues. As the core of the story line, Academy Award winner - Jennifer Lawrence undoubtedly performs extremely well physically, mentally and emotionally once again as Katniss Everdeen, it also presents a stunning ending compared to Catching Fire; not to say boring but overall this chapter appears to be a little bit overlong and weak, causing the lack of powerful revolution and rebellion spirits."

"wareaglegurl","6","16","29","27 November 2014"," Good, not great, mostly killing time/setting the scene for Part 2
","It was exactly what I expected essentially. First of all, after reading the book, yes, a lot happens in the third installment, but it does not need to be split up into two movies. They could cut out a lot of the slow parts in the book and easily condense it into one movie. However, since this is clearly just a money making technique, they reserve Part 1 simply for killing time and setting up the action that will come in Part 2. This movie consisted solely of Katniss running around depressed and confused in District 13, struggling with her inner conflict of whether or not to accept her role as the Mockingjay, all the while worrying about the safety of her lover Peeta, a romance that after dragging the movies out over 2 years, is pretty dead and lacks chemistry in my opinion. I think that Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress, but it is often very difficult to show Katniss's emotional side in the movies due to the fact that the audience is not nearly as ""inside her head"" as the first person perspective delivers in the books. Honestly, she just comes off as a mopey hard a**, and gets less and less likable and emotion evoking with each movie. <br/><br/>Like I said, it was good, kept me entertained, but I would probably wait, save the money, and just rent it if you want to see it. Just like Harry Potter 7: Part 1, it's really nothing special and just sets the scene for Part 2. If you've been following this series strictly through the movies, it'll probably do more for you than if you've read the books and already know what's coming."
"carlyrist","6","16","29","24 November 2014"," Shining moments, but overall dull (from a fan of the books)
","When I read Mockingjay, I really liked all the character development that happened in the first half of the book. Seeing it translated to screen was disappointing and boring. Jennifer Lawrence stole the movie once again with her phenomenal acting, but I thought that Katniss's character was handled poorly. Her PTSD was prevalent in the book and here it only took hold in a couple of scenes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the other standout for me, giving depth to Plutarch. I especially enjoyed the scene where he is in command while being bombed, as he brought real emotion to that scene. Apart from those two, I thought the acting was overall flat. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth both had strong moments, but for a lot of the film they paled in comparison to Lawrence. I also didn't like how they put Effie in district 13. She felt awkward and it made me uncomfortable rather than making me laugh. I was also disappointed with how Finnick was replaced by Gale in many of his scenes with Katniss. Finnick and Katniss had a really great bond in the book as two of the only people who understand what they are going through and a lot of that was lost by the script and by Sam Claflin's on-and-off performance. There were shining moments, such as Katniss singing ""The Hanging Tree"" and the bombing of District 8. I also liked that they let the audience see the rescue of Peeta and the others. However, Peeta's clearly CGI weight loss was sloppy and annoying. And, other than a few scenes, the movie was mostly just people talking which is not what we come to the Hunger Games to see. I enjoyed it in the books, but it didn't translate well on screen. It was also frustrating that despite the fact that they are making two movies when they only need one, they still could not fit in many important scenes from the book. Overall, this was the weakest movie to date and I can only hope that Mockingjay Part 2 provides the epic finale we are all hoping for."
"movieguy96","5","16","29","24 November 2014"," Underwhelming but entertaining enough
","I like The Hunger Games series. I'm not a die-hard fan by any means (I haven't read the books, nor am I into teen fiction), but I enjoyed the first two films, especially Catching Fire, which displayed a great combination of thrills, humour and tragedy.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Part 1 felt like a bit of a letdown in comparison though. By all accounts there was really no need to split the third book into two parts anyway, and it's all too clear to see on screen. It's like what Deathly Hallows Part 1 was to Harry Potter, a slow plodding instalment in the franchise, made purposely to make more of a profit for the studios involved, and to apparently flesh out the characters' backstories and plight.<br/><br/>Someone obviously forgot to tell the writers and director this almost kills the movie dead, and reduces the whole thing to a snail's crawl.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the movie by any means. There's a few good intense scenes in the film to sustain one's interest until the end, and it's interesting to see how the overall story of The Hunger Games develops here, plus the cast, as with the previous entries, is a joy to watch, notably Donald Sutherland, still quietly menacing as President Snow, newbie to the series Julianne Moore as the commanding President Coin of District 13, the always watchable Woody Harrelson, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, who brings some much needed warmth and humour to the film. <br/><br/>Among all this though, nothing much really happens in the end, aside from a few skirmishes to keep the viewer entertained now and again, and Jennifer Lawrence delivers an unusually one-note performance, compared to her other stints as Katniss. It's like she's been told to act more moody and glum than usual so we feel sorry for her, which backfires, with certain set pieces made to show her anger and rebelliousness towards the Capitol, which here somehow feels a bit too fake and staged. She does try hard though with a rather uneven script, and doesn't disgrace herself. <br/><br/>All the young cast acquit themselves well with the plot, especially Liam Hemsworth, and Josh Hutcherson, but some people, such as Natalie Dormer, are virtually wasted. Not that it harms the movie, mind.<br/><br/>Overall though, compared to the colourful excitement and buzz over Catching Fire, this film feels like the brakes have been applied to the franchise, and is consequently all the more dull and soulless because of it. Hopefully Part 2 will put everything firmly back on track, because after watching this, you will feel satisfied enough, but because the inconsistent pace and mood rather distances the audience from the characters and the movie itself, it also puts a dampener over the overall hype of how it will all end in the last film."
"PyroSikTh","8","65","144","22 November 2014"," Mockingjay would've been a rushed mess as one movie
","When it was first announced that Mockingjay was going to be split into  two movies, I gawked. It's one book. How can there possibly be enough  to fill two movies? It didn't help that my sister also found it weird,  having read the book. She couldn't see any obvious place for the split.  Despite what feels like everyone else on the internet is saying, I  actually support the split now. Mockingjay marks a massive tonal shift  in the franchise, so it would have been a bit jarring introducing this  tonal shift for the final movie, leaving you no time to settle into the  new status quo left from Catching Fire. The biggest reason for my  support though is how rushed everything would have been.  When a book is adapted into a movie, there are certain time constraints  to be taken into account. That inevitably means things are cut, which  leaves many fans unhappy with the final product. With Mockingjay they  decided to give it time to flesh out the characters; give everyone a  bit of limelight, expand on various elements in the book, and just  generally make sure it doesn't frenetically jump from scene to scene or  cut out important plot points. Having now scene Mockingjay Part 1, I  can't imagine it being compressed into half the running time without  sacrificing the emotional resonance or rushing through everything.  The emotional resonance is the big selling point of Mockingjay. For  some it might be seen as boring, drawn-out melodrama, but for me it  made Mockingjay a darker, more harrowing movie than the previous two,  which says a lot about a franchise hinging on a fight-to-the-death  between children in order to keep the tyrannical dictatorship in place.  Katniss has lost her district, lost Peeta, and now lives in hiding with  a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the Capitol. To not dwell on  how that affects her and the people around her would have been a  massive misstep. The franchise needed to slow down and focus on the  characters.  To say it's only half a movie is misinformation as well. It feels like  a complete movie, at least more complete than Catching Fire ever did.  As I mentioned, Peeta is kept prisoner by the Capitol, and he's being  used as a propaganda weapon in response to Katniss' propaganda by the  rebels. The whole plot of the movie is about this cat and mouse of  propaganda as the two opposing sides try to get an upper hand on the  people of Panem. The big final climax feels like the big final climax  of a story, bringing this cat and mouse to an end. It's final moments  are a resolution to the beginning and middle, and in that respect it  absolutely has all three acts. Of course it has a cliffhanger moment  right before the credits to segue into the next movie, but so did  Catching Fire (and Desolation of Smaug, and Fast & Furious 6, and every  Marvel movie etc. etc.)  Everything else ticks all the right boxes as well; the acting is  top-notch, especially from Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman  (with a little memoriam for him in the credits). The visuals are on the  nail. District 12 is now depicted in ruins, the CGI of the various  ships and futuristic cityscape of the Capitol is flawless. There was  also some fantastic use of CGI on Josh Hutcherson to make him look  progressively thinner and beaten up as the movie goes along, showing  the torture he must have been enduring. The musical score is fantastic,  with the Mockingjay theme coming well and truly into it's element, as  well as a fully fledged song that brings the rebellion to full strength  in the propaganda war.  Mockingjay proves that milking extra movies out of a franchise doesn't  necessarily have to be a bad thing (looking at you, Desolation of  Smaug). It slows the franchise down and gives you time to breathe  before the big conclusion next year, injecting plenty of heartfelt  emotion to the whole situation, fleshing out the world, developing the  characters etc. However it's not without it's higher-octane moments.  There's a number of action scenes despite it's calmer narrative, which  expand what was in the book to blistering effect (the fantastically  suspenseful climax is apparently just a few lines in the book, largely  glossed over). It's tense, unpredictable, emotional, yet has it's  light-hearted moments. I give Mockingjay Part 1 a very good 8/10. It's  made me very excited for next year when I can marathon the whole  franchise in one go."

","I have been a Hunger Games fan for as long as I can remember and this movie was a perfect book to movie adaptation. It included every important aspect and detail, and even went more in depth than the book did.<br/><br/>I was amazed with Jennifer Lawrence's acting, it was convincing and real seeing that she has gone through 2 hunger games and now is suffering with PTSD. People need to remember that Katniss is not supposed to be this strong, fearless leader, she is a 17 year old girl suffering with PTSD and only wants to save her love from torture.<br/><br/>I thought all the action scenes were intense and visually stunning, everything looked real and made you want to sit on the edge of your seat. I was very impressed by the CGI effects.<br/><br/>As for Peeta, I think that Josh Hutcherson did a phenomenal job capturing his character. He's so different from the Peeta we saw before, and to see him deteriorate slowly through out the movie made my heart ache. The last scenes of the movie were well acted, and I think that Josh captured Peeta perfectly as a victim of the capitols hijacking. <br/><br/>Everything about this movie was so well done, the acting, the characters, the visuals, I could go on and on. <br/><br/>For those who are disappointed that there wasn't enough action, that's not what it was mainly about. There's more to this movie than that. Katniss' character is severely depressed and has PTSD, so to expect her to be this incredibly strong heroine is unrealistic. There's so much more to this movie than the action scenes, and if you fail to see that then this is not the movie for you. <br/><br/>I cannot wait for Part 2, I think it might even be better than part 1, but it's hard to top."

","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" tells an intriguing tale of how one girl fulfills and becomes the ultimate symbol that changed the world and ignited a rebellion against the Capitol. Although as interesting as it may sound, the film falls short because of the 2 part cash grabbing finale formula that has become a recent trend.<br/><br/>If you are planning on going into the theaters to see a satisfying movie that will end on a high note then you are completely wrong. Having read the books a thought kept circling through my mind before watching: ""This movie will surely end in an unsatisfying manner."" having read and realized how short and quite mediocre the book was, and as predicted it ended at the climax and will force you to give more of your money for next year. The movie started well and was faithful to the source material. However, when the climax was nearing it all just fell apart. You have scenes which will bore you and just doesn't get you engaged well enough. JLaw and the veteran actors did well and gave their best, but they do little to save the movie. Visuals improved way better than previous films and were one of the most notable improvements. Shaky cams return and ruin the experience for the most part when there is a tense moment. As for the action, if you've seen the trailers then you've seen most of it. The only high point of the film is the propaganda between the Capitol and the rebellion. It was clever the way the two parties threw their propagandas at each other. Without the propaganda there would be no plot whatsoever rather than the annoying goal of saving Peeta and the love triangle. <br/><br/>The film also spends too much time on the bunker rather than showing more of the rebellion and interesting stuff out there. The reason for this is because it's a two part film, of course they'll show more of the interesting parts in the finale. This is the result of a clever excuse for a money grabbing two parter in which you will have to wait for another year to see the next one and for them to steal more of your cash. If this was just 1 whole film, then it could have been better on it's own right judging by the length and simple narrative of the book.

","Fortunately, it has Jennifer Lawrence, and that alone, is enough to pull the entire movie away whenever it leans toward making the audience fall to sleep. Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars.

","When I went to the cinema to see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 I was expecting to see a film close to The Deathly Hallows Part 1, and that is exactly what was delivered. I am convinced that Mockingjay part 1 almost takes the plot structure from Deathly Hallows part 1 and recycles it, just with Mockingjay's story. Here is my evidence, both films start with the lead character struggling with a major change to their story that happened at the end of the previous film, both focus on a sub-plot in the overall story arc, both feature limited fight sequences, both feature one of the main character's friends being away from the story and both end with a cliffhanger. Now, do not be confused and think that I am saying that Mockingjay and Deathly Hallows are bad films, no I think both films were enjoyable. What I am saying though is that both films were created for one reason, and that was for the money, now you could say that both films were needed however I would respond by saying they could be combined with part two. Part one's are just sub plots that have been extended out to be longer, so the companies who are behind the franchises can rake in some extra cash. <br/><br/>Now Mockinjay Part 1 is a good film, the acting was fine, the character development was average, I don't think I would consider Katniss to be a true hero yet. I liked the secondary characters such as President Coin and Finnich, however I am disappointed we didn't get to see some action with Finnich and his trident, note to Part 2, use Finnich and his trident otherwise I will be disappointed. The writing was fine, it really isn't worth talking about. I enjoyed looking at the sets, the costumes were cool, however I do feel the story did stray a little when they began to focus on Katniss's fashion, it just took me out of the film and was one of the reasons i don't truly see Katniss as a hero yet. Now finally, the directing, the tone of the film I felt wasn't as dark as Catching Fire, the pacing of the film did wobble from time to time but one thing did return that annoyed me, the shaky cam, it only appeared for the action sequences, but it was still annoying and it took me out of the film, i don't know why it was brought back, but it was a bad move none the less. Overall, Mockingjay Part 1 is an enjoyable film, that any fan will enjoy going to watch, however it does stumble into the shadow of Catching Fire. Therefore Mockingjay Part 1 receives a 6/10."
"raymondobasildon","7","26","54","24 November 2014"," It should have been only one film
","There seems to be a fashion for splitting final movies of a film series into two parts. I understand some of the reasons for this. Often in a book series, the earlier books include a lot of thoughts and internal conflict in the protagonist, which has to be portrayed by a few carefully selected images in a film. Whereas the last book is often full of actions and it is difficult in a film to decide how to cut any of them. Nevertheless, the film makers should take these hard decisions. The problem with splitting to two movies is that they are inevitably splitting what is in essence a single story. Stories have an important structure. Splitting them destroys this. The first part becomes an introduction and some of the middle. The second part has the rest of the middle and the conclusion. Basically neither have a proper structure. The result is a loss of impact. I have read the books and Mockingjay is a great and thought-provoking finale to the series. The film Mockingjay Part 1 worries me. It wasn't impactful. It didn't even work as a great trailer to part 2. To split this story into two parts has been I think a grave mistake."

In this one, Katniss is not in the Hunger games, but she is forming an alliance against the capitol. The ""Slightly disappointing"" part about it is that I thought it was going to be long, but it actually is pretty short. The good thing about it is the acting, action, and few other stuff. Its weird how this film is 2 hours and it was short. Godzilla 2014 was 2 hours, but it went on forever.

"neilbenammar","6","24","50","22 November 2014"," Mockingjay Part I fundamentally fails to capture the essence of Rebellion.
","Now before the Hunger Games fans try to gut me for this review, bare in mind I am writing this review without having read the books- which may or may not cloud my judgment, depending on different opinions. Firstly, I would like to preface my review by pointing out that compared to the shallow garbage we see nowadays the Hunger Games franchise is considerably better both in its ability to convey emotion and assert compelling themes ( FYI: they are also coherent). It has been a while since we've discovered a tale of tyranny - via the abuse of power, told from the perspective and voice of the people being subjected with violence. The theme of Injustice has been tackled countless times by Hollywood studios over the years and 90% of the time it was misrepresented or wrongly/poorly depicted. The strength of the Hunger Games is that the underlying motive of Revolt drives every character's story-arc and as a consequence universalizes the plight of the 13 Districts. From the very start of the trilogy, Katniss Everdeen brought conflict straight to the Capitol as soon as she won the Games. Her act of defiance not only sparked a series of events but it eventually exposed the autocracy of the Government- all this purely by accident ( Katniss reminds everyone in this third installment that initially, she did not willingly want to cause the uproar in Panem). Ironically, Katniss volunteered to fight in the Games, however she is made a symbol of the Mockingjay Rebellion involuntarily. Most audiences will be moved by the emotional journey Katniss undergoes throughout the film- however it was paramount for Francis Lawrence to capture the rebellion of the districts with the utmost sincerity and power. Unfortunately, he ultimately fails to do so. What works in the Hunger Games is that it explores an enthralling and extremely vivid background/back-story- namely ""The Districts, their diverse terrains and their inhabitants"". For instance, in ""Catching Fire""- we had a glimpse into the lives of the people living in District 12( and some other Districts such as 8)- this made us empathize with the characters at the helm of this blockbuster because it gave the plot a humane cause. The brave and hard-working people of Panem were given a soul and not just Hollywood props to play around with. To be quite frank, I was quite skeptical to watch Catching Fire after I heard Gary Ross was not attached to direct. Fortunately, to my surprise, Francis Lawrence did an outstanding job and kept the series with a fervent sense of conviction and audacity. Francis Lawrence's greatest accomplishment with Catching Fire was that he explored a plausible juxtaposition of sorts, which was: while The Capitol tried to dehumanize the people under its rule they gained the bravery to humanize their cause through the eyes of innocent Katniss Everdeen. This might sound complicated to understand but at its core is the primary motor for the denouement of the story. The political undertones of the Hunger Games have always been present in the shadows- this made it more than interesting for Lionsgate ( the film production company behind the Hunger Games phenomenon), as they had a young adult adaptation, which at the time of release, coincided with the political issues of today's day and age. From the very beginning, Mockingjay Part 1 had a daunting task to extend both visually and spiritually the magnitude of Panem's universe; in order to give us a look into the mind of the Rebellion- both through Katniss' eyes and the individuals who rally behind her. All in all, the essence of the Hunger Games was not entirely there as the movie failed to capture the Mockingjay Rebellion with enough heart and insight. That being said, I still think the first 2 installments deserve all the praise they get for defying the Hollywood ""status-quo"" and I'm glad The Hunger Games trilogy was acquired by Lionsgate-( a smaller independent studio compared to the normal typical ""powerhouses"") as they kept the movies relatively in-sync with the books and allowed both Gary Ross and Francis Lawrence to portray Panem without any influence from higher-ups( to a certain extent of course ). I certainly hope that when Mockingjay Part II hits theaters at the same time next year, we will dive back into a truthful and honest representation of the people of Panem and their fight against injustice. Finally, although Katniss singing ""Hanging Tree"" evoked the main ideas behind the revolution- the rest of the film falls short trying to do so."
"lucy908","6","12","22","24 November 2014"," Disappointing for book fans
","While the first installment of Mockingjay did have its merits, it really disappointed me as a fan of the books. I think everyone can agree that the trend of splitting a single book into two movies is profit-mongering in a case like this, where the content could have easily fit into one film. However, I'm not averse to having a less-action-packed movie-- as long as the extra time is used to truly bring the book to life.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was the loss of the depth of the bond that forms between Katniss and Finnick in the book. In the movie, even with all of Katniss's crying, it felt like both of them were too sane, as opposed to the book, where they both literally end up on the ground sobbing and have to be sedated. Finnick is the only one who can understand and lessen Katniss's pain, knowing that Annie is being used to torment him long before she figures out the same. To me, Finnick's limited screen time was a huge loss, and I hope it will not lessen *Spoiler for fourth movie* the impact of his death in the final movie.<br/><br/>Another of the things I felt were detrimental to the film was the omission of Katniss's prep team and her failure to demand to kill President Snow herself. While I understand that Suzanne Collins made the call to replace the relatively-unknown prep team with the crowd-pleasing Effie, I don't think that was a reasonable substitution. Finding the prep team, neglected and mistreated in the dungeons of District 13, is a turning point for Katniss is some ways. Not only does it show the audience how she cares for these people, even though they supported the culture that put her through two brutal arenas, but it also demonstrates the darker side of the rebellion and Coin's own corruption. In the book, Peeta's urgings to ask herself who she's working with actually cause her to doubt herself, and there are long discussions regarding Coin's fear of Katniss becoming more powerful than she is. In the movie, Coin comes off as a hard-liner, yes, but appears to be motivated completely by the need of the people. Along with Katniss's missing demand, this may mean that *SPOILER for fourth movie* Katniss will not kill Coin.<br/><br/>In spite of all this, I still felt that the movie was a fair interpretation of the book and good in its own right. I thought that the acting was great, and I loved seeing new perspectives that were not possible in the book."

","If Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2012) was an archetypal example of how to one-up an original movie and create an enthralling and captivating movie franchise, Mockingjay Part 1 is the all too typical way of crushing that excitement. What was shaping up to be a memorable franchise that would become logged in the public discourse and be mentioned in the same breath as Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia was unceremoniously extinguished by a completely lackluster third installment. Disappointing in many regards, it lacked so many of the things that made the first and, especially, the second movie so fun to watch. Whatever momentum the series had before this was lost in something that was simply a mediocre sequel.<br/><br/>What made Catching Fire so good? It was the intense and unique action in The Games that never let you relax for a moment. It was the reliance on heavy hitting talent in Jennifer Lawrence, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland. It was the beautiful imagery of The Capital and the contrast to the bleak existence in the cities. It was the sense of fulfillment in seeing an oppressed society rise up against its oppressors. Most of this was lost, or at least made bland and boring in Mockingjay Part 1.<br/><br/>One of the most unfortunate critiques in this movie compared to the last is the fact that it is entirely generic and forgettable. It feels like you could plug this movie into almost any science fiction fight-against-the-man type of film series. Was this The Hunger Games or was it Maze Runner? Or was it Divergence? One could imagine a nearly identical course of events in almost any anti-establishment narrative. Clearly, the story couldn't just repeat the Hunger Games for a third time or it would become stale, but these are not the only things that make the world unique. You have the exorbitant extravagance of The Capital Citizens. There is the uniqueness of each of the 12 districts and how they interact with each other. There are the Gamemakers and their sleuthy, creative killing methods. All these things and more were forgotten in place of a plug-and-play rebel alliance story.<br/><br/>Another disappointment was the onscreen chemistry of the actors and the lack of use of some amazing actors. In Catching Fire, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Finnick (Sam Claflin) play a strong supporting role to Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), who puts in a masterful performance in being a broken, scared girl to growing up and accepting the challenge and becoming the heroic figure. Plutarch (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is an enigmatic wildcard with a sly smile who keeps us guessing. In Mockingjay Part 1, Lawrence gets very little time to shine. The intense action scenes which she does so well are few and far between. Hutcherson is rarely in scenes and when he is, his acting abilities are subdued. Hoffman is made to take a backseat as only a mere pawn in the grand scheme of things. And unfortunately, Julianne Moore (who plays President Alma Coin) put in a less than inspiring performance as the aspiring leader of a rebellious uprising.<br/><br/>Catching Fire gave us a sense of purpose as audience members, when we could cheer for the gradual uprising in the districts mirrored by Katniss' success in The Games, both her physical defeats of Capital sympathizing stand-ins from the first districts, and her emotional grapplings with killing and its repercussions. Once we are introduced to District 13 and the underground rebellious movement, headed by Alma Coin, it seems to lose its luster. This is no longer Poncho Villa versus the oligarchical dictatorship, it's the Allies versus the Axis, a feeling of an even playing field. Gone is that feeling of an underdog that's building up to something special, led by an unexpected hero. Instead we jump-cut to the point where the Districts have an established military system and a next-in-line dictator who doesn't seem to care much about her people. It's a fight without a face and heel, just machine against machine.<br/><br/>There is something that feels artificial about Katniss and her Mockingjay persona in this film. The film itself is almost a meta-critique of this. The Mockingjay is quite literally an artificial construct used by District 13 to inspire the rebellion. Katniss, however, wants to be genuine and passionate in the propaganda videos and has the opportunity to make grand speeches in the face of real crisis. However, even these moments of supposed truthfulness feel like a reenactment. This whole idea of having film cameras follow around Katniss, and especially the propaganda films they make, feel like something from a cheesy satirical comedy. It recalls images of ""I'm doing my part!"" from Starship Troopers (1997). Starships Troopers has the benefit of not taking itself too seriously, being purposefully lighthearted in contrast to the dark reality. Mockingjay Part 1, on the other hand, attempts to be only darkness, a bleak reality of war. Scenes with that comedic spin feels forced and out of place rather than tension breaking.<br/><br/>In the end, what we all wanted this movie to be, and what the studio needed it to be, was a setup to the inevitable conflict and resolution in the final movie that we all already knew was coming. The audience should be on the edge of their seat in anticipation for the finale after watching this film. However, that feeling is not something I expect many people would be left with. Having split the final book into two parts, the film is left with many voids of space compared to the first two films which were so jam packed with action and plot progression it almost felt rushed. It is a slog to get through this, and the final film can only hope to compensate in some ways.<br/><br/>Writing this review a few years after the movie was released, and looking back on it in retrospect, it seems unfortunate that the series has exited public consciousness for the most part. You never see Hunger Games themed toys at the store, and people don't usually bring it up in conversation. This pales in comparison to the extreme hype when the first film was released. Perhaps this is the natural progression of things, that a series should run its course and have its day in the sun. Not everything can last like certain stories. It is just disappointing to know that something that started with so much promise will end with a whimper and not a bang."

"TheLittleSongbird","4","2","2","5 February 2017"," Two hours of bland and over-stretched set-up
","As said with the first two 'Hunger Games' films (which had its plus points but didn't do much for me), the books are fun, scary, thrilling and moving though because being so rich in detail and characterisation they are difficult to adapt.<br/><br/>Generally the films, while all with their good points, don't do them justice, following the basic details but with the spirit watered down to blandness and the characters nowhere near as fascinating. Judging the films on their own terms is to me a fairer way to judge though, and will be done here because they are problematic on their own. Of the four films (which all have good points but just as enough problems that stop me from caring for them much), 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part I' is the weakest, it feels too much like set-up and set-up that's very tame and really struggles to justify its length.<br/><br/>There are certainly good things. The production values, some dodgy special effects aside, are very well done with the nightmarishly dystopian production design faring best, it's lit with atmosphere and luckily the cinematography and editing is not the sloppy and frenetic kind seen in the first film. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there are some good performances here. This is particularly true of a terrific Jennifer Lawrence, dastardly Donald Sutherland, moving Philip Seymour Hoffman, smarmy Stanley Tucci and classy Julianne Moore.<br/><br/>Not all the cast work. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are still lacking charisma and expression, while Elizabeth Banks (a high point of the first film) and Woody Harrelson have nothing to do.<br/><br/>Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction, Katniss excepted. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.<br/><br/>'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part I' could have easily been shorter, because the story feels far too thin and over-stretched which makes some scenes interminably dull and dreary. The film is basically set-up and after finishing on a note every bit as abrupt as the ending for 'Catching Fire' it feels like set-up that doesn't lead or go anywhere. Atmosphere-wise, it just feels rather tame in alternative to tense and leaden rather than edgy. The direction is pretty pedestrian here.<br/><br/>In summary, bland and over-stretched despite some good performances, production values and music. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"judywalker2","6","14","27","26 November 2014"," too long and boring
","Went to see this latest chapter of the Hunger Games because I hate to leave things unfinished. I saw the last film and was disappointed with the story and I felt the same about this tale. I do believe that the producers pulled together a stellar cast who definitely make the material seem better than it probably is. Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Elizabeth Banks are all great, elevating every scene that they're in. I still don't care for the character of Katniss always having to be prompted to do the right thing. Well I guess I'll see the next part since I have to know how the story ends cause I just don't think I want to read the books."
"rawadk","7","18","37","20 November 2014"," Not up to standards
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-part 1 is a GOOD movie. Not great. I waited all movie for a big event to happen, but it didn't come. The whole movie was build up for Part 2. It seemed that the plot is incomplete but it was still a good plot. It is a must-see for Hunger Games fans but don't expect to be thrilled as much as the first 2 movies. However, you will walk out of the movie eagerly awaiting the fourth installment.<br/><br/>Most of the actors that made the first two movies great made it in this installment. They continued their high acting standards, especially Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) and Liam Hemsworth (Gale).<br/><br/>It's an average movie but a great introduction to what might be the best Hunger Games movie yet."
"chaunceydog1","10","39","91","25 November 2014"," Perfect buildup for Mockingjay Part 2
","I'm surprised to be seeing so many reviews bashing this film because it's ""boring"" or ""it's a copy of Battle Royale 2"" , but I'm not here to talk about that. <br/><br/>I've read The Hunger Games series multiple times, and reading Mockingjay, I knew it would be the hardest book in the trilogy to adapt into a film. But I am not disappointed. In fact, I want to congratulate Francis Lawrence for being able to create this masterpiece. <br/><br/>Watching the movie for the first time, I got immense chills. Especially in the part where Katniss sings ""The Hanging Tree"". I think it would be an extremely difficult task to split the final part of a movie into two parts and still make part 1 be interesting, but somehow, that feat was accomplished in this film. <br/><br/>The acting in this film was phenomenal, especially in Jennifer Lawrence's part. The way Katniss reacted to seeing her home burned and destroyed, was beautiful and gut wrenching. And don't even get me started on Peeta's transformations, it made me so sad, it definitely painted a better picture than the books did! And even Finnick, who we barely got to see, represented the melancholy effect of The Games on people. <br/><br/>Mockingjay is the most political, intense, and emotional book in The Hunger Games trilogy, and the way that the essence of the book got transferred into the film was brilliant in my opinion. It was also very intense, but not too much. This movie perfectly guided the way for the final movie. To me, Mockingjay part 1 gave us viewers a pleasing tease of the type of dynamics we can expect in the next film, and the ending surely gripped me to come view part 2 on opening day."
"katarinamandic3","8","32","73","26 November 2014"," ""Are you are you coming to the tree...""
","Despite negative reviews from some fans and critics, I found this movie one of the best movies I've watched this year, and so far the best part of this trilogy. It is the part with most action and it made me even emotional (which didn't happen with ""Hunger games"" or ""Catching fire"") because it reminded me on current situation in the world and how it could end. I liked the fact that Katniss and members of other districts stood up against Snow and his Peacekeepers, although some people died for it which shows that they've had enough of Capitol's torture. I must admit I haven't read the book so I'm not sure if dividing movie in two parts was good idea, but it seems that if they made Mockingjay like one movie, it would be all messed up, so I think this was maybe even good idea.<br/><br/>I don't know why are everyone being so critical about J.Law, but I think her performance was stunning. She's the same age as I am and it's hard to believe that at the age of 24 she can be that great actress and that she can merge with her character so deep. I truly admire her. Part where she sang ""The Hanging tree"" song was amazing, and when rebels started also singing it before they attacked dam gave me chills. I can't wait for the 2nd part next year!"
"jaywensley2004","9","41","97","23 November 2014"," Character driven to an extreme
","Mockingjay is a study in charisma and political leadership, and a text-film on acting.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland, Julliane Moore and Jennifer Lawrence present three clear variations on the theme of ""How Leaders Lead."" This, along with a somewhat heavy handed study on propaganda are the movies primary attractions. <br/><br/>This is not the kind of action film audiences of the first two ""Hunger Games"" movies enjoyed. There is a fair amount of fighting, but this movie is about charisma: Who has it, how its used and what it means. At this, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is brilliant, primarily because Jennifer Lawrence HAS charisma. At several points in the movie, watching Lawrence draw me into her Katniss Everdean, I thought of politicians who were able to evoke passion in the populace. Lawrence has that ability in large quantities. <br/><br/>I also found the direction of the film to be outstanding. A particularly well-crafted scene occurs early when the Rebel's leadership are asked to suggest moments when Katniss was most effective at touching the spirits of the populace. This scene not only approaches a breach of the fourth wall, it could have caused viewers to suspend their ""suspension of disbelief."" But through precise timing and a brilliant performance by Woody Harrelson this scene succeeds in getting the audience involved interactively as we are invited to think of those moments from previous movies and nod our heads as we sub-vocalize our ""Uh-Huh's.""<br/><br/>This movie is about the why and the how of making of ""The Mockingjay-the symbol of the revolution."" Why Katniss? How Katniss?<br/><br/>WOW! Katniss!"

"ryndanr","6","13","26","22 November 2014"," Half of a very good blockbuster.
","This movie is basically what you expect before you see it. Without getting too technical, and strange plot devices aside, the directing is good with just a few miscues, much like catching fire. The acting is incredible, though some of the dialogue is cheesy. They didn't take the Harry Potter road of making part one more art driven, nor did they use the extra time to more fully explain the world outside of district 13, which would have been a better choice. Instead they chose to focus more on katniss' inner turmoil. That proved to be a bad choice as the peaks of this movie were actually all events that took place away from her (there is a particularly effective dam scene dealing with members of outside districts). Basically my recommendation would be to wait until part two comes out and watch this right before so you can pretend it was one big movie because this film constantly reminds you that it is only half a story (especially the huge let down at the end of the climax.)"
"ersinkdotcom","7","15","31","25 November 2014"," Isn't as fulfilling or exciting as the first or second entries
","Although it's been done before several times now, I can only imagine how hard it must be to decide exactly where to split a book in half to make it two or more movies. Most novels have a beginning, middle, climax, and an end. What can a filmmaker do to leave audiences feeling satisfied when there's no big payoff or conclusion to what they're taking in? Here is where the problem lies for ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.""<br/><br/>Katniss has brought down the Hunger Games. President Snow and his forces look to stomp out a revolution that could end his reign. Katniss reluctantly accepts her place as the symbol of freedom for the band of rebels quickly rising in each District. She must also find a way to save Peeta from certain doom as he's been captured and is being held in the Capital.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" feels exactly like what it is. It's half a book and movie that leaves you starved for more. Many will say that's exactly what it is and I understand that. However, I've seen several other franchises do the exact same thing and it felt way more satisfying. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" and ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn"" immediately come to mind. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is definitely one of the ""It"" actors of the moment. I must say I was surprised at her performance in many of the more emotionally charged scenes in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1."" It was as if she was having difficulties connecting with the character of Katniss Everdeen when it came to her crying or showing anxiety over the events she's dealt with. It was as if she couldn't find that place within her that helps to muster the tears or empathy it takes to appear convincingly tormented. <br/><br/>As the series moves forward towards its epic finale, I'm impressed with how they expand on social issues we're dealing with in real life. The one that stood out to me in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" was Finnick's revelation that the President uses the attractive tributes as sex slaves to serve his political purposes. Sex trafficking and slavery is something that's happening today in our own backyards and not many people know how serious or prevalent it is.<br/><br/>With the continuing success of each film before it, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" ups the ante when it comes to special effects and visual splendor. The CGI and what appear to be location shots are fabulous and lend an air of authenticity to the movie. Whether filmmakers shot more in actual settings or just utilized improved computer animation, the outcome is a grander piece of art.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some disturbing images, and thematic material. It's no more graphic than either of the previous films when it comes to battles. There are scenes of charred and burned bodies twisted in the ruins of District 12 which many might find uncomfortable. The only other warning I would give concerns Finnick exposing the President for using him as a sex slave. <br/><br/>If you go into ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" knowing it isn't as fulfilling or exciting as the first or second entries in the franchise you'll be alright. Entering the theater with the expectation that you're watching the first half of a movie which will provide no sort of closure or satisfaction is your best bet. Maybe it does exactly what Lionsgate and Director Frances Lawrence wants it to do. It leaves you frustrated and wanting the rest of the meal immediately."
"chloejane37","10","37","89","24 November 2014"," Excellent film, cannot wait for part 2!
","I have loved these films since the first one was released and have been waiting for this film all year. It was definitely worth the wait! Despite a few changes from the book, the adaptation of the film was great and i think it was a good idea to have split the film into two parts as there was so much detail included. If you haven't read the book then i imagine the film would be slow but for readers all around i cant imagine the experience being anything less than enjoyable.<br/><br/>Less action than the first two films without the actual Hunger Games involved however its still just as entertaining and enjoyable. After always thinking Josh Hutcherson was one of the weaker members of the cast he came through in this film giving what was probably one of his best performances yet.<br/><br/>After becoming quite possibly one of my favourite films ever i would definitely recommend for everyone to watch it!"

","Mockingjay pt. 1 was simply amazing. I really don't go know how to describe it. The acting was perfect. You can feel the emotions in every scene. I'm not saying all this because I'm a fangirl, I'm saying this because it's the truth. Ignore all the bad reviews, those people obviously haven't read the books. I would greatly suggest that you do read the books before seeing the movie. Or at least watch The Hunger Games and Catching Fire before you see it. Every scene was exactly how I pictured it when I read the book! If you thought Catching Fire was violent wait until you see Peeta try and kill Katniss. I'd also like to point out, through the movie Peeta has interviews with Ceased Flickerman as they go on he gradually gets worse. He becomes skinny and paranoid and Josh Hutcherson's acting was gold. Also one of Jennifer Lawrence's best performances. This movie just brings so much emotion. Its intense, riveting, and heartbreaking. It's amazing.

"wormow","10","36","87","17 November 2014"," Most Daring, Rawest, Thought-Provoking and Darkest Installment of 'The Hunger Games' Yet
","When Lionsgate announced back in 2012 that they were splitting the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy into two parts, people were skeptical at how they were going to make them a cohesive and alluring final two films. Considering the lukewarm reaction to the final novel 'Mockingjay' by Suzanne Collins and the less than encouraging history of film adaptions being split into more than one film (Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hobbit), the odds weren't exactly in this penultimate chapter's favour. However, two years on, it looks like director Francis Lawrence defied the odds and Lionsgate has another winner. 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1′ is the most daring, thought-provoking, rawest, darkest yet humorous film in the Hunger Games franchise filled with powerful performances from its new and returning cast members as well as an intelligently and beautifully written screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong.<br/><br/>The film immediately opens to a powerful and haunting scene, mainly due to Jennifer Lawrence's stunning portrayal of our heroine Katniss Everdeen, that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Katniss is no longer forcing smiles in flaming dresses or dropped into a televised reality game show wearing latex wet suits all designed to appeal and appease the Capitol audiences, she's now hidden underground in the bleak and gray District 13, a district that months prior, none of the characters even knew had still existed since its 'alleged' obliteration during 'The Dark Days'.<br/><br/>One of the biggest surprises is that 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ doesn't feel like a 'Hunger Games' film that we've come to know in the previous two installments, more so than how many felt about the third book to the previous two books before it. It almost feels like a complete reboot of the entire franchise. The film is almost entirely set in District 13; besides the short but poignant visits to District 12, 8 and little cutaways to scenes outside of Katniss's perspective in the Capitol, 5, 7 and 11. There are no more ""games"" – which means no more reapings, no more chariots, or any of that lead up. Mockingjay has well and truly reinvented the franchise to reveal what 'The Hunger Games' series at its core is really all about and gives us a shocking and horrifying portrayal of war in Panem and how media manipulation is used through the use of propaganda videos (""propos"") in battle to control the populous.<br/><br/>The film's split was not a problem at all. Out of the three novels in the Hunger Games series, 'Mockingjay' was easily the novel that required a split to fully flesh out the characters and to give justice to their arcs. There is a clear objective at the beginning of the film, laid out by our heroine and by the end, that objective is solved but also sets up another plot line that will most definitely be followed up on in next year's final chapter 'Mockingjay – Part 2′. The way the creative team are handling the split feels slightly like a television show – you get 24 episodes in a season, and that is usually split into two with a mid season break in between. Part 1 ends with a bang, it has a conclusion and resolution, but you know the story isn't over just yet.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ manage to overcomes its obstacles to become another dark, epic and very chapter in the unstoppable 'Hunger Games' franchise. The film will surely make back its entire budget for both films alone within the first week of release alone. If 'Mockingjay – Part 1′ is anything to go by, than next year's 'Mockingjay – Part 2′ will be an absolute treat as we follow Katniss and her squad in their final journey to stop the Capitol. And I can't freaking wait."

","This new Hunger Games movie is different in that it doesn't actually revolve around the Hunger Games anymore (because after all Katniss destroyed the arena).

The revolution takes a nasty turn.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books. I am barely able to hang on. I know enough about this universe to vaguely follow what's happening but I have a hard time caring about it. It feels contrived. This is not my cup of tea.

We are just supposed to be satisfied with part of the Mockingjay story. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3.5 stars Family value: 2.5 stars*<br/><br/>For those who have not been keeping up with the district drama of The Hunger Games narrative. Katniss and the rebellion destroyed the Hunger Games and the nation of Panem is set on is on a disastrous course towards civil war. The districts have begun to rebel against the Capital and all they need is a catalyst to begin an attack. The rescued tributes, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Finnick and Beetee, have been taken to District 13. The district that was rumoured to be destroyed, but has flourished undetected and underground by the watchful eye of the Capital's peacekeepers. Katniss is asked to push past her personal horrors of the Hunger Games, the assumed loss of Peeta and take on the role of the people's symbol for the rebellion, the ""Mockingjay"". President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) devise a plan that will weigh against the propaganda of the President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capital. Katniss must weigh out how she will be utilised for the role and the eventual knowledge of Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) survival and his perceived betrayal within the capital. Peeta seems to have become the puppet of the capital and she must find a way to save him and still fight the power of Snow's army. After visiting the destruction of District 12 and seeing the devastation throughout the other districts, Katniss is motivated to become the central figure in the fight. She must wrestle with the responsibilities of being the face of the rebellion and determining what do with her potential love for Peeta and Gale. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games series has become another teen dystopian drama phenomenon. The book series and the movie series have set new records and developed stars of its characters. Regardless of opinions of the series, it's theme or the genre, this film is destined to be a hit and affably serves as the bridge to the conclusion of the story. The challenge for director, Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend), is to make us willing to wait another year for the final instalment. Lawrence took over the film series for the second instalment, which is arguably the best of the series. With Mockingjay: Part 1 Lawrence does a masterful job of keeping the keeping the story on the front burner at a low boil and draws us slowly into the drama. The story moves seamlessly from the last film and manages to keep the audiences attention. The performances by Jennifer Lawrence, Hoffman and Sutherland felt comfortable and familiar, keeping the relational tension intact for the final instalment. It is difficult to watch Philip Seymour Hoffman in his final performance. An unfortunate loss to the industry, but a welcome addition to this film. Julianne Moore and Liam Hemsworth perform well, but seem like bit players in this portion of the tale. All the other characters are merely window dressing for the set up for the final battle. This leaves them one-dimensional and lacking depth, but serviceable as building blocks for the building storyline. Thankfully, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) are allowed to flourish and add the needed humour to a relatively somber tale. There is action in this film, but it seems minimal in comparison to previous two chapters of The Hunger Games. This all adds to the needed tension to serve up Part 2. Interestingly, the direction does not play up the love triangle portion between the three lead characters. The story weighs in on psychological tension of the battle between good and evil. <br/><br/>For the fans of the book series, the filmmakers have honoured the characters and storyline. For the fans of the movie series, this portion of the story successfully sets up the final chapter. As a film it is good, but merely gets the story to the boiling point . Mockingjay: Part 1 succeeds in moving the storyline along, but is not satisfying on its own. We will sit at the table waiting for the main course... next year. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... This film was a test of patience. It was not a bad film and did the work that it was supposed to do, set up the last film and make millions of dollars in the process.

","Boring, slow, nothing happen much most of the time. It was a pain to watch in movie for i struggle to stay awake. If you saw slower than Harry Potter and Deadly hallow Part1, you understand it going slow when them hiding in wilderness and listening to name reciting through radio. But this one take the cake, Katniss travel around with TV crew filming her and she pretty silent till the action scene happen or she get interviewed. Then there that another boring scene about everyone hiding in the bunker.<br/><br/>Only Cool and engaging parts were when Katinss sang ""The hanging Tree"" while unknowingly rebellions uprising and Peeta scene (i don't want to spoil it)near the end."

","This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, the second movie that I have ever rated 10/10! It feels like the story was taken right from the pages and onto the screen, characters were portrayed perfectly and the on screen chemistry was top notch. With a stunning soundtrack that gives the movie the feeling of the elegance of battle with the bitter hardships of a rebellion. Some movies merely take phrases from the source material but this film lifted entire paragraphs perfectly and dramatized them with utter brilliance. Some have called this movie filler but considering the significance of some of the events in this movie it can hardly be described as anything less than one of the best installments in a saga that could be described as a modern marvel of cinematic brilliance. It makes you truly believe that you are truly in the districts surrounded by the tension and unrest from a rebellion. The camera angles make for a truly immersive movie experience that you want to never end. <br/><br/>True to the source material and a perfect display of how movies should be made, this movie is by far one of the best movies this year."

","I've read all 3 Hunger Games books and this book was by far my least favorite. It's a much different type of book so naturally, this is a much different type of movie compared to the first two. It's much more political and not the action packed film that the first 2 were.<br/><br/>It was a bit slow in the beginning while introducing new characters and such like most movies do. But this is a sequel, and you see at least 3 or 4 more new characters that are heavily involved in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is still the most interesting on film but even she couldn't save it.<br/><br/>I just feel that it cuts you off right when it starts to get a little more interesting. What I did like was that it was only 2 hours and I know the new trend in Hollywood is to make the final book into two movies so they can fit in much more. (Also to make way more money) See it if you must but I wouldn't be concerned if you waited til it came out on blu ray and then watch Part 2 right after."
"estebangonzalez10","6","15","32","21 November 2014"," Propaganda and more propaganda
","""I have a message for President Snow: If we burn, you burn with us!""<br/><br/>When Francis Lawrence took over director duty for the second film in the Hunger Games franchise we got a much more serious YA adaptation from Collins's novel. The film had a great sense of pacing and storytelling while introducing us to the Capitol and the other districts and not just focusing on the actual Hunger Games. I thought it was a much better film than the first, but I still loved them both. They ended up in my list of the best films for the year in which they were released, so my expectations for this third film were huge considering Lawrence was back in the director's chair. I still had some concerns about adapting the final book in two parts because the first parts didn't work too well with the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises. My concerns turned out to be true because I did have a similar issue with Mockingjay Part 1. The entire film felt stretched, focusing on small details that didn't do much to build the tension of the story. It actually hurt the pacing of the film that the director had worked so well with in the previous installment. This first part felt like a slow build-up and a giant filler to what will come next in the grand finale, so I couldn't help but feel let down by what Francis Lawrence had to offer. I still enjoyed Mockingjay, but it doesn't live up to its predecessors. <br/><br/>Mockingjay is a huge departure from the previous films. There are no Hunger Games and very little action scenes here, while there is a lot of exposition and preparation for what is to come. The previous films worked as a social commentary on reality TV, while this one focuses more on advertising. Catching Fire allowed us into the Capitol where we got a glimpse of who the real enemy was, but in Mockingjay we don't see what is actually going on in the Capitol and everything takes place mostly in District 13 where a big revolution is uprising. What all three films do have in common is the strong lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence who holds everything in place and keeps us engaged with this dystopian world Collins has introduced us to. When certain scenes in Mockingjay began to feel tedious or drag out a bit too long, Lawrence's Katniss reminded us why we are tagging along with this franchise. She literally is the symbol of hope for the rebellion as much as she is for the franchise. This film is more political than the previous ones and we are introduced to a lot of propaganda (not just as a build-up for the next film, but actual propaganda as the Capital and District 13 try to smear each other's credibility). The political intrigue plays out as a sort of chess game where one side tries to outdo the other. This was done really well here, but the problem was that it became repetitive, and that is where I felt the story was incredibly stretched out.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes in this film, and others that felt a bit cheesy (the nightmares for example), but during a scene where she sends a message to President Snow she gave me goose- bumps. I also enjoyed the scene where she sings ""the hanging tree"" lullaby. Those were the moments that drew me back to the film and reminded me why I loved this franchise in the first place. I am sure the second part of this film will work better, but the slow build-up didn't do much for me here. I missed some of the characters that I had learned to love and that only got a few minutes of screen time here. Haymitch and Caesar provided some of the much needed comic relief in the previous films, but here everything becomes political and serious and there is little room for them. Effie is perhaps the character who comes out better this time around and Elizabeth Banks nails the role once again. The new characters didn't do much for me and despite the fact that Liam Hemsworth gets much more screen time as Gale he doesn't do much either. Claflin's role as Finnick is nowhere as nearly interesting as it was in Catching Fire. Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings class once again to his role and he also stood out for me, while Josh Hutcherson shows much more range as Peeta here despite the very little screen time he's given. So despite having a lot of interesting characters in the franchise, they really don't get to do anything interesting in Mockingjay. Of course, the film ends with a teaser and we will all return for the grand finale despite the slow build-up because enough time has been spent on these characters and we care for them."
"lucyreynolds","10","33","81","24 November 2014"," Mind blowing portrayal of the book!
","Having only got into the hunger games recently i very quickly caught up with the films and read the books prior to watching mocking jay part 1 as I wanted to be surprised I didn't read the whole of mocking jay until the day after watching the film once I had finished I knew immediately that the film perfectly portrayed everything the book had described and more.<br/><br/>I literally sat on the edge of my seat from the minute it started. It took a while to come to terms with the fact there's no games in this film but there's no shortage of action even though it's not a massive amount it's enough to keep the film Interesting in between very important pieces of information. Once the film catches up to Peeta in the Capitol and the state that he's getting into at the hands of president snow your hooked on seeing what the games and the Capitol has done to all the victors mental state of mind and the damage that the games has done to them. Josh Hutchersons and Jennifer Lawrence's performances are truly astounding and heart braking to watch as they fall apart whilst still needing to be together and the fact that deep down katniss does love peeta becomes more apparent as the movie goes on to the point that they rescue peeta to keep katniss from losing it all together only to be met with the complete opposite of love. I've read other reviews that say this film is boring etc and this is not the case it's the perfect platform to launch mocking jay part 2 as the audience is now prepared for what's to come. If the next movie is as detailed as this were in for the best movie of 2015 !"

","Most people have already said what is wrong with this movie. But I'll just add - NOTHING happens during the movie. Nothing. I was expecting SOMETHING, anything - all I got was hesitation and doubt from every single character.<br/><br/>That, and the fact that the main character (Katniss) looked scared 100% of the time. She had a single facial expression: OMG. No smiles, no strength, no nothing. For a movie that is supposed to set her up as a hero, this is a disaster. All I could think of what ""JEEZ, I get it!

"rjsf96","7","5","8","6 April 2015"," How Not To Split a Book into Two
","I am very disappointed in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1'. So angry, frustrated and furious that in fact I wanted to forget I had ever taken the time to see it. Which is why this review is four months late. I've always considered myself an avid fan of the series and I still do. When I saw the first film I felt the need to read all of the books. Then came the film adaptation of 'Catching Fire'. I loved it and will continue to watch it throughout the rest of my life. But I remained split in two about whether I would like 'Mockingjay' in the weeks leading up to its release. Francis Lawrence directed the previous instalment, but I do not consider myself to be a fan of the last book. Would splitting it in half detract its flaws or add to them. Unfortunately, it piles them on and there was me thinking the book had its fair share of problems, wait until you see the film.<br/><br/>This time around Katniss Everdeen having survived two rounds of the fatal Hunger Games is to lead a revolution. The Capitol and President Snow have Peeta and Johanna captive and are seemingly brainwashing Peeta for their cause. However, things are going to be anything but easy, except easy money for Hollywood that is. Katniss initially refuses to join the Rebel's cause and become the Mockingjay. A decision the President of District 13, Alma Coin takes with anger. Coin is portrayed by Julianne Moore who gives a worthwhile performance. She shares plenty of screen time with Plutarch Heavensbee played (in one of his last roles) by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The two provide perhaps the only bearable element of 'Mockingjay', believable and interesting performances from the both of them.<br/><br/>Eventually, Katniss leads a rescue mission to bring back the captives and take revenge on the Capitol; except the last part does not even happen. Instead Francis Lawrence gives us the cinematic equivalent to watching grass grow. For all of its 123 minutes, make no mistake, this Hunger Games is one dull, dreary dragged out affair. With no real beginning, middle and end. It feels like a botched job. We watch and wait restless in our seats with bated breath, waiting for something, anything in fact of consequence to happen. All this build up and nothing. No tension, no real drama and no emotional heft or pay off. I would rather fight to the death in the arena than watch Part 1 again.<br/><br/>The problem does not squarely rest on the Director's shoulders though. The writing, cinematography, music, most of the acting and the plot all contribute to give audiences one of the worst major releases from Hollywood in 2014. Save for 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'.<br/><br/>'Mockingjay' is written in such a way that it drags out scenes for far too long just to pass the two hour mark. There is a scene, I am not kidding that lasts for a good minute or more, where Katniss inexplicably shines a torch at a cat and watches as it tries to attack it. She laughs. We don't. Hollywood does. This is clearly for the cutting room floor and any great Director would know this. Lawrence does not have a clue. Even the cinematography is as bland as they come. The whole film is bathed in shades of grey and any colour is washed out in favour of murky blues and dull blacks. It is a very depressing experience to watch 'Mockingjay'. Especially when you realise that Katniss only fires one arrow, which is the films only legitimate action.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard phones it in using his music cues from the previous instalments, he should think of himself as a disgrace. Sadly, Jennifer Lawrence is no good moping, crying and whinging; wherever the old Lawrence is I want her back now! To cap it all off, the film could have been finished in twenty minutes. I am worn out now and I know you don't need me to tell you to avoid this film and to not be fooled by cynical marketing strategies from Hollywood and its hack Directors.<br/><br/>In 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' Francis Lawrence provides the fans with everything that they do not want; a disengaging story, mainly awful performances, dreary cinematography, repetitive music and plodding directing. It is in my eyes time for a revolution against bad film making and bloated runtimes. I have a message for Francis Lawrence if you direct another film we will boycott it."
"billygoat1071","8","30","73","19 November 2014"," Warming Up
","The funny fact about Mockingjay - Part 1 is it's a setup for a bigger installment, even though the franchise has already done that with Catching Fire. Predictably, the studio wants to make the same strategy of any successful YA finale have done recently. But after this film, I feel like there should be a rule that not every successful franchise must have a ""split"" conclusion, but this is the part that will definitely be ignored. But seriously, the movie is already good as itself; the storyline is nicely constructed, there's tension even without the noise. This isn't probably the most showy blockbuster you'll see, but there is a terrific quality to be found in any of its scenes, even if the movie itself isn't so satisfying.<br/><br/>There are movies exist that has an opened ending and yet satisfies as an experience as a whole. We can point out a number of titles, but one of them is Catching Fire. Although there was a cliffhanger, there is a meaty story embedded within the piece. This one is nothing more than a half part, preparing the audience for the real revolution. To those who haven't read the book and expecting for tons of action, regarding this as a blockbuster hit, would definitely be disappointed. However there is still a fight going on, this is basically a battle where both sides are using the power of media, convincing people to stand along with them. This is an intriguing portrayal of how modern society reach out through politics and other concerns, the movie excitingly rises up tension of bringing unpredictable consequences at every campaign they release.<br/><br/>The film put these scenes together with an excellent pace. It just simply gives necessary details at their campaigning precision and concerns what affects would appear outside their district. Overall, even at the scenes of talking in rooms, the movie is totally gripping. The action of the franchise was never about the spectacles, and once again, it's the quiet and grim suspense that make the set piece work. It just keeps showing the unpleasant results of their supposedly glorious revolution. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is engaging, as usual, backed up with also great Julianne Moore and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Donald Sutherland also gives some compelling threat even when his villain character is at the distance. The rest just did what they usual do.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 feels rewarding until it literally stops. This is the major complain one would clamor. What's wrong with an extra hour or more of runtime? But again, we are wasting our breath, the answer is at the corner of obviousness. The movie, again, does a good job at telling its own story, it would have been a way better movie if it just continues without waiting for another year. If we are going to take the series's revolutionary metaphor in our own terms, then: if the first movie is the spark, and the second is (duh) the ""catching fire"", then this one is basically the slow burn. It's not a bad thing, neither is a great one. I mean it's fun leaving the theater with questions scattered around your head and those thrills still looping on your memories, but they could have been wiser by just finishing it. There is hardly any reason for us to wait, in fact, leaving the storyline intact might possibly make it a classic."

I loved Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin - she did a great job representing this cold and manipulative character. I think the first part was a great built-up. There was tension and some action enough to prepare you for the 2nd part. I think people are expecting Hunger Games 1 and 2 and this is why they get disappointed. This part was more about building up the tension and the frustration. I have read the books and they are really good.

"terrildavis-44052","Null","3","4","14 February 2016"," Another Clumsy Ripoff From Lion$gate
","Not surprisingly, Francis Lawrence makes yet another rip-off (the Japanese movie 'Battle Royale II') and, of course, with the added recycled Twilight material (romantic triangle -as evident in 'Divergent' and 'the Huntsman'), clumsy sex scenes and the Hollywood ingredients (PG-13 violence and family friendly, offscreen gore, including the required item number). It may not be among the most expensive films but it's quite apparent that a lot of money has been spent. However, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' still looks and feels like a B-movie. Camera-work is overdone. Editing is shoddy. Too many subplots that aren't fleshed out, lots of plot holes. The use of light is ineffective especially in the nocturnal sequences. Most of the performances are average at best. Donald Pleasance does go overboard in several scenes. Jennifer Lawrence seems to only have been required as the directors daughter. Philip Kaufman does a confident job and... if there is one reason to watch 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' at all then that's Josh Huckman who easily steals the show as the male love interest. One good that came from the box office success of this forgettable, rather lacklustre thriller is the appreciation of this actor, most of whose memorable works received little recognition."

","This is not the mediocre first two movies that were a fun-filled joy ride in the spirit of Running Man, Battle Royale or Blood of Heroes. This is a realistic version instead, with a character-motive driven plot. Unlike the first two films this one actually matters. I hope the creators of this film are proud of their accomplishment. Instead of a cheesy thrill ride we have been introduced to the realities of war and rebellion and we were given good acting, good screen writing and characters we can identify with and care about. After watching hundreds of movies in the post apocalyptic genre this one stands out as significantly better than the others, especially the first two films. Thank you for making the Hunger Games series into something meaningful."

","Suzanne Collins, the author of The Hunger Games series, did an incredible job creating the story of Katniss Everdeen. Lionsgate brought the books to life, and the first two films were a success – until Hollywood became greedy.<br/><br/>The final book of the series, Mockingjay, was announced to be split into two films. This turned out to be a poor decision.<br/><br/>When I was sitting in the cinema, I had thoughts about leaving the cinema which is new for me. Of course, as I've read the books, I felt like I couldn't – I had to know whether it would improve in the last hour. To me, the whole movie appeared as a preview of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. There was hardly any action at all, and Katniss (portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence) just seemed to be crying for half of the movie. We all know Jennifer Lawrence is better than that, and the script given to her didn't show all of her talents. The ending was dull, and I'm unsure whether it was predictable as I read the book before going to see the movie.<br/><br/>All I can say is hopefully the final film will make up for this one with tons of action scenes and shocking twists, possibly even a twist for those who read the book first."

The story has zero interest, zero thrill and zero that special something that made Hunger games such a hit. There is the dilemma with the human lives and the Capitol increasing it's ruthless policy, but the movie is just a propaganda war between the president and the revolution.

Moving on, they make Prim seem like she doesn't have a care in the world for anything. She goes back for ButterCup, and seems to neglect anything that doesn't involve her cat. She has no sense of urgency in that scene. And finally (for now) Peeta should be nicknamed Pemis. He has no balls at all. He fights for literally anyone at all, the only time he seems to have some is when he tries to kill Katpiss, and we all wish that would happen.<br/><br/>That is why I hated this movie."
"leonblackwood","5","3","4","22 March 2015"," Expected much more! 5/10
","Review: Man, it's amazing how much trouble this one girl causes these poor people in this movie. Loads of people are getting killed and there homes are completely destroyed just because of this one girl who is wondering around doing publicity for the rebellion. On top of that, she keeps on going on about saving Peter when she doesn't have a clue about his state of mind or why he is going on TV saying that she should stop fighting against President Snow. The storyline seemed a bit to far fetched to me and Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) should have used her powers to kill President Snow except for causing an unnecessary political war. I also thought it was a bit stupid that she was visiting all of these places whilst being filmed, knowing that there was an army looking for her, but thats just me being picky. Anyway, the movie lacked action and it took some time to get going. The performances aren't that bad but I wasn't that impressed with the storyline. I'm not a big fan of the earlier movies so my expectations weren't that high but after hearing all the hype surrounding the movie and seeing the huge box office takings, I was expecting a bit more. On the plus side, it does have me wanting to see the 2nd part of Mockingjay because it was left wide open and it does seem like the true war hasn't begun. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: The director didn't use Woody Harrelson or Stanley Tucci as much as he did in the previous movies and I did miss Lenny Kravitz who seemed like her only true friend. With one week of filming left, Phillip Seymour Hoffman sadly passed away but the director pieced his footage together well. Anyway, the movie seemed more like a political statement then a epic adventure which was a bad choice from the director. The cinematography was done well and you really can see were the $125 million budget went but as I haven't read any of the books, I really don't know how close this movie is to Suzanne Collins original story. At the end of the day, I can't really comment on this franchise until the final movie has been produced but for entertainment, it does drag in places and I'm glad that I didn't have to sit through this 2 hour political drama in the cinema.<br/><br/>Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $752million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their epic Sci-fi/adventures about a girl who tries to save her colony which is under attack. 5/10"

","There are some exciting scenes in this installment but it is not enough to save it. As usual, following the latest Hollywood standards the movies in the series are following a downward spiral. Every new movie is weaker than its predecessor. There are some pretty cringe-worthy dialogs in this one, for example (it's not an exact quote) when Katniss wonders that Gale remembers their kiss, he said something like I will not forget it until I die, perhaps not even then"". KMN. I mean, is there a single human being in the world who would say something like that? It is sooo cliché, farrago for teenagers, which in my opinion are today a little bit smarter than that.

Because of that there's also not so much tension. During some phases the film is a bit boring.<br/><br/>The actors did a good job. Jennifer Lawrence is not as good as usual, but Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson are great. Liam Hemsworth was a positive surprise. His appearance in Expendables 2 was horrible, but this time he was quite good. Maybe he's not so much less talented than his brother Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth. Natalie Dormer from Game of Thrones was nice. It was good to see Philip Seymour Hoffman. After he died I thought somebody else would play Plutarch, but obviously they finished the films before Seymour Hoffman died.<br/><br/>The visual effects of the first 2 films were much better, but this one has also some nice scenes. Like the liberation of Peeta which looks a bit like Operation Neptune's Spear.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of the film is the topic of the medial war and psy ops. The rebels and the government are fighting much more in the media than on the battlefield. I liked the way how the film treats this topic."

","November 2014 *** This review may contain spoilers *** Let me say it right now; I hated this movie. It was bad. Look, the concept of a being movie cut into two parts just does not work. The whole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and move uncomfortably in my seat. There really wasn't anything special going on as it progresses, too. There was a war going on, but they did not really show it and it didn't suck you in. It was very slow paced with lots of teenage drama and not a lot of ""games"" or ""hunger"" as in the previous films (which I liked, by the way). And now there was Jennifer Lawrence's acting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; this made the first half boring, wasn't a very good one. And in this particular movie ""not very good"" is a compliment. 3/10"

I appreciate how this one is basically gearing up for some big drama, conflict and action but it made for a film that feels like an extended first act of a bigger film. Add in that Katniss is not fully badass yet and spends most of her time blubbering and the fact the film is actively NOT showing action scenes and the final result is just a boring film that is sluggishly drawing itself out in order to potentially maximize Box Office Revenue. It's functional and serves a purpose but to be an entire film, it just felt like a boring waste of time."

","I was excited to watch this after Catching Fire but 30 to 45 minutes into it, I thought it was me that the movie was moving so slow. The worst part of this movie is Katniss' character role. It's depressing and she has no real script. All she had to do for her part was practice her facial expressions and emotions because there was nothing else coming from her. When I realized the movie was over 2 hours long, I groaned. On one hand I'm waiting for the action to begin and on another, when it does, the reigns are pulled in and it continues it's slow crawl. It's a sleeper. I can honestly tell you that a part of me wanted to see Katniss killed off just to end my pain. I might take the critics advice and shut this off before it's over and just wait for Part 2."
"andrew-kasten","3","4","6","20 March 2015"," Prepare to yawn -- Painfully anemic and watery
","Surprisingly watery and actionless, this film was a complete bore. The pacing was painfully anemic. The script is so mired and bogged down with cheesy, weepy, whiny dialogue, that only the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman can transcend the mediocre script and deliver an interesting performance. Hollywood's darling in Jennifer Lawrence brings another predictable ho hum performance - - a much overrated actor, in my 'unpopular' opinion. I had absolutely no problem with the splitting of the Hobbit film into three parts as many filmgoers decried and whined. There was a boat load of action and thrills in each of those three films. Here, there is none; therefore, the producers are knowingly and wilfully prolonging the agony filmgoers will surely endure. Prepare to yawn... a lot. This two hours of drivel and melodrama will annoy and depress you."

","'THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 1': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The third installment in the blockbuster film series, based on the bestselling young adult book trilogy by Suzanne Collins. This chapter is based on the first half of the final book (titled 'Mockingjay') and deals with Katniss Everdeen (once again played by Jennifer Lawrence) having to become a symbol for the rebellion, in their war against the ruthless Capitol. It was directed by Francis Lawrence (who also directed 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE') and written by Peter Craig and Danny Strong. Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright, Stanley Tucci, Willow Shields, Jena Malone and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman all reprise their roles from the other films and Julianne Moore joins the cast. I loved every minute of it and in many ways think it's an improvement over the previous two films!<br/><br/>The story picks up right where the last film left off; Katniss (Lawrence) has suffered a mental breakdown and is having a horrendous time adapting to life at District 13, with the other rebels. She also can't get over the fact that Peeta (Hutcherson) was taken by the Capitol and she'll do almost anything to get him back. Plutarch (Hoffman) introduces Katniss to the leader of the rebellion, President Coin (Moore), and they ask her to be their movement's symbol, in propaganda adds, to incite a rebellion. She reluctantly agrees under the condition that they rescue Peeta, and the other captives at the Capitol. The rest of the film deals with Katniss struggling to adapt to her new role, as the face of the revolution; 'The Mockingjay'.<br/><br/>There's been some criticism over the fact that the final book was split into two films and that there's not enough action in this installment to make it as worthwhile a filmgoing experience, as the other movies. I strongly disagree. I think this chapter is much better because of it. There's so much character development and believable human drama that any true fan of film should be thoroughly satisfied. We also get some great acting; Lawrence gives the best performance of the series here and it's arguably one of the best of her career. She also has a lot of help from multiple veteran actors, like Hoffman and Moore. Peeta doesn't have nearly as much screen time, as he did in the other movies, but he's always a strong and pivotal part of the plot. Gale (Hemsworth) is in a lot more scenes, this time around, but he's still just as underdeveloped (he has one powerful dialogue moment though; where he's at least given a chance to show some acting ability). The love triangle definitely doesn't feel necessary anymore, it's obvious that Katniss loves Peeta but the certainty of how Peeta's character will end up is certainly still up in the air. I also enjoyed how much more epic this film feels, over the last two, it really feels like the first half to the conclusion of a classic sci-fi trilogy. The directing, cinematography and music are all breathtaking to watch, as well, and we get to hear Jennifer Lawrence sing! Fans that only look forward to action are sure to be disappointed but everyone else should be more than pleased!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/RGEBSjKSuEk"
"Franco_Strydom","6","9","18","10 December 2014"," Good but inconsequential.
","I need to start by stating that I am not a great fan of the Hunger Games Franchise. I have not read the books and so the films have been my only exposure to the series. That obviously coloring my opinion of the films; I quite enjoyed Mockingjay Part I albeit for a relatively singular reason. The story and content of the plot is rich, engaging and enticing. <br/><br/>Mockingjay Part I feels like the (partial) culmination of the first two films that come before it. This should be an obvious statement but important as each following film seems to be less independent from the greater whole. The previous films build into the effectiveness of this offering and with your audience primed for hating 'The Man' and baring witness to the difficulties of an essential uprising in the name of freedom which starts Mockingjay on a high and thankfully, it stays there. There are impeccable story moments that Director Francis Lawrence use incredibly well, as well as a few of the expected but emotion provoking 'moments of grandeur' and even the predictable moments similar story arches tend to enjoy. My criticism on this film is that it is too connected and depended on what came before and what will come after. The film is powerful but much of the content is assumed straight from Catching Fire which left me trying to remember exactly where certain characters fit in and which also left me with ample anticipation for Part II of the series resolution, but what does that say of this film? The greater story feels lost while we wait for the conclusion though soaking up such effective story telling while you wait definitely scores some points.<br/><br/>I find it a little hard to pin down an opinion on much of the performance of the film. The acting is definitely effective and there is a moment where Jennifer Lawrence really impressed me (I won't spoil beyond mentioning that having an actor in character act badly and keep character is not always that easy and is something I hold commendable). Beyond that the characters do what you expect them to. They react to what you expect in the way you expect, which is a little disappointing. The plot throws a lot of curve balls (in various degrees) at the characters and diversifying their responses would have enriched the whole film to me, but I'm not complaining on what is presented on screen. The style of filming drew my attention a bit, which I always consider a bad thing – unless it is very deliberate. It bothered me the most in the exposition of the film where the change from hand held to stabilized shots felt messy. Some of the editing cuts also felt abrupt (early in the film) which made me aware of 'the line', continuity and other film making concepts I expect film makers to know but which I would like to forget when enjoying a film. The plot didn't really allow for too much use of music to enhance the visuals though I expect we'll be seeing more of that when (if?) the war finally breaks out in the final part of the series.<br/><br/>In closing, I enjoyed sitting in the cinema and watching this film. I took some food for thought from it (the main and overly perpetuated theme of the series) and I'm looking forward to the next one. Beyond that, I fear Mockingjay Part I will fade into insignificance."

"TesseractsUnleashed","10","27","69","28 November 2014"," Even A Non Reader Can Love This One
","I am an avid fan of the book trilogy, so I was not expecting too many surprises with this movie. Especially considering that I hate the last book in the trilogy. Even so, the way Francis, the cast and the gifted production crew managed to astound and emote me throughout.<br/><br/>However, what I found most surprising was how the movie affected my husband. He is not a reader, whatsoever, and indulges my obsession with this franchise because it makes me happy. So, I tend to consider his opinion pretty unbiased. He loved Mockingjay Part 1. He found the plot and character development from the last movie fascinating. He even developed a grudging respect and the pity for Peeta (a character he has only shown disdain for over the last 2 movies because his characterization has been so poorly established). Just about the only thing he didn't like was that the movie cut off--ended. He was so unsatisfied. I asked him if he understood why the movie had to be split, if he believed what he had seen could've been accomplished in that kind of detail if everything that was left to be resolved had been crammed into another 30 to 45 minutes of film. He answered that there was no way to do that and get it right. It would feel like whatever the ending would be would be rushed, unpolished. He then said he still did not have to like it. He does not want to wait a year to find out what happens and, believe me, he does not want any hints. He found the movie compelling.<br/><br/>If Mockingjay Part 1 can do this for someone complete uninitiated into the world Collins created... and am going to go ahead and call it a triumph."
"jwiener92","10","27","69","21 November 2014"," Poor acting? Slow and boring? Did we watch the same movie?!?
","I don't believe all of you commenting! When I watched this movie the other day I was blown away! I don't understand what your issues are. Allow me to retort on some of them.<br/><br/>Long anticipated set up: well, yes, and I think it was necessary to cut the film into two parts. If it wasn't split like this there would be so many complaints on how so much from the book was cut from the movie, due to time constraints. Two parts works for this one as well, not just harry potter.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing, on nearly all accounts. Jennifer Lawrence may have been slightly over the top, but in her defense, if I walked through my demolished hometown with hundreds of my dead neighbors' skeletons, you bet I'd be freaking the heck out. If my sister went back during an evacuation to save a cat and almost killed herself, I'd be freaking out.<br/><br/>My point is her character went through a lot of troubles and everything is going horribly around her, her character is believable. Josh Hutcherson, fantastic! Liam Hemsworth, fantastic! I didn't see anything else that was wrong with the acting. (granted, i'm not a film critic and this is my first review).<br/><br/>I didn't think the movie was slow-paced. It may have started slow and jumpy, but the rest of the movie had action, horror, propaganda, and then more action. Obviously, it's for set up to the big event, and I'm not faulting it for that. Technically, the behind the scenes aspects were well performed, and the original song was heartfelt and capturing.<br/><br/>This is not just your common set up for the end, this movie stands out in a way that was similar to catching fire if not better!

"Anurag-Shetty","8","21","52","1 December 2014"," Can't believe I have to wait a whole year for Mockingjay - Part 2.
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 continues with the story of Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence). After Katniss destroys the games forever in the previous film, she is now in District 13. President Alma Coin(Julianne Moore) tells Katniss that she should lead the rebellion against the Capitol. Katniss also finds out that Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol. So, Katniss reluctantly becomes the face of the rebellion to overthrow the Capitol & wants to save Peeta at the earliest. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great film. However, it's not as action packed as the previous two movies in the series. Unlike in The Hunger Games(2012) & The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) there are no actual Hunger Games in this movie. There are just three or four action set pieces in the movie. There is a lot of character development in this movie. Despite the limited action in the movie, it managed to hold my interest throughout. Should they have split the movie into two parts? I don't know. The ending of the film, though an amazing cliffhanger, leaves the viewer wanting more. I know for sure that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2(2015) is going to be epic! Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence portrays the varying emotions of Katniss with ease. Josh Hutcherson is outstanding as Peeta Mellark. Hutcherson portrays Peeta's vulnerability & fear, effortlessly. Liam Hemsworth is awesome as Gale Hawthorne. I liked the fact that Hemsworth is given more screen time, this time around. Woody Harrelson is amazing as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as Plutarch Heavensbee. Julianne Moore is mind blowing as President Alma Coin. Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks, Mahershala Ali, Jeffrey Wright, Paul Malcomson, Stanley Tucci & Natalie Dormer are spectacular as Primrose Everdeen, Finnick Odair, Effie Trinket, Boggs, Beetee, Katniss' Mother, Caesar Flickerman & Cressida respectively. Though I really liked this film I prefer the previous two movies. Still, kudos to director Francis Lawrence for making this film an amazingly tense, emotional & thrilling preview for next year's final film. A must watch!"
"rannynm","10","26","67","24 November 2014"," Simply Fantastic! Everything I Wanted!!
","This much anticipated film is absolutely fantastic with some action and a stellar cast that will blow your mind! This epic story continues with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peetar Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who both play a big part in the lives of District 13'ers, each in their own way. They want to unite and save an entire nation. In order to do this, they need the help of their friends and new alliances. <br/><br/>I completely love this film and the overall production. It's intense and has such a grand feel to it. With scene after scene, it gets bigger and bigger and you see just how powerful one voice can be. The aerial shots, emotions, excitement and the anticipation of what's happening next basically keeps your eyes glued to the screen. I've read all the books and this adaption is very true to the original stories. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is incredible. She becomes her character completely with a range of emotions - anger, doubt, disbelief and feeling sorry. She is so convincing. My favorite character is Peetar. Although he is not on-screen time as much as the other characters, he plays a big part in the film. Peeta is what drives Katniss throughout the film as she struggles to get to him. Almost everything she does is a result of her wanting to save Peeta. I also like Peeta because, every time he is on screen, he seems to change and intensify the situation. My favorite scene is when Katniss sees Peeta for the very first time. She is shocked and, at the same time, grateful that he is alive. It is nice to see all of the questions that go though her mind through her own eyes. Katniss' eyes reveal how she feels about Peeta. <br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 and I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is a little slow in the beginning, but I understand why. They have to bring you up to speed with what happened in the previous film. I cannot wait to see Part 2!<br/><br/>Satisfy your excitement and see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1. It is playing in theaters now, so please check it out.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Brianna B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

It's just the beginning of The End, which was an epic introduction that how great the last part will be. And I mean what else did you expect? For me it was a very good movie. It was really touching and I really enjoyed it and yeah it also gave me goosebumps at some points. Jennifer Lawrence once again has proved that she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. She really acted great. The rest of the cast did great too. People who are giving negative reviews, actually they are used to enjoy death-games of hunger games only. It's not only thrill and action that always matters.This movie is different from the first two movies because there were games in the first two movies, but now it's about the relationship between the Panem and The Capitol. But still there are a number of great thrilling scenes, which I really enjoyed, however, the sad thing is that I'll have to wait one year for the next part for which I am anxiously waiting. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, if you are a true movie fan you will really enjoy it. Thanks, have a good day."

"denis_barbov","10","26","67","21 November 2014"," Mockingjay Part 1is a beautifully tragic and a visually stunning work of art.
","The highly anticipated sequel to ' The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ' is a beautifully tragic and a visually stunning work of art. <br/><br/>The story picks up right where we left off with the previous movie with Katniss being full of regret because she was saved instead of Peeta and the other tributes. It quickly evolves in this movie about a war and what it means with the underlying theme of the consequences of the games over Katniss and what PTSD can do to you.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence brings a marvelous performance and successfully portrays this complex character.  One of the most memorable scenes was when she got back to District 12. We also see Josh Hutcherson a.k.a. Peeta go through many transitions and his acting has only improved since the first film. The newcomers,  Julianne Moore and Nataly Dormer are scene-stealers.<br/><br/>Many people,  including myself,  we're afraid that 'Part 1' is going to be dull and boring. It was nothing whatsoever. The pacing was on point and the same goes for storytelling. <br/><br/>The director,  Francis Lawrence,  has delivered the best experience you could possibly expect from the first half of the book. There is,  in fact,  humor added which was missing in the previous installments. He had also done this remarkable job at expanding the universe with showing us more from the different districts. The CGI work is better than ever before and so are the cinematography and editing.<br/><br/>The score is also very fitting and has borrowed a few things from previous installments. The longly awaited 'Hanging Tree' song is very unique and got stuck into my head. <br/><br/>In short,  I can easily say this is the best book-to-movie adaptation and even surpassed the book in a few ways.  The acting and storytelling are phenomenal and the ending is sensational.  The film ends on such a high note and cliffhanger which leaves the fans yearning for the fourth and final installment of the series."

","I'm going to keep this review short and simple. A lot of the other reviews I've been reading says that this film was disappointing and not really all that good. I thought is was pretty good for what it was meant to do. It didn't have all of the edge of your seat thrills and action I like in a movie, but to me it really didn't need it. I think this movie was just preparing fans for the ""Mockingjay - Part 2"". Now, I've never read any of the books, I'm just going off of what I have seen in theaters and so far I'm impressed. I can say I like this film because I have seen the first two and I know what is going on so I wasn't at all disappointed.<br/><br/>One thing I don't like what people are doing with the ""Hunger Games"" films is comparing it with ""Divergent"". I've never seen ""Divergent"", but I know ""The Hunger Games"" isn't like ""Divergent"". I know both of them take place in a post apocalyptic era, but I don't think they are the same. For one, Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) didn't need some played out clichéd macho man helping and guiding her through out the film. Katniss was always able to hold her own. That's one of the things I like about Jennifer Lawrence's character.<br/><br/>Now, I know a lot of people saw the first two ""Hunger Games"" films and didn't like this third one, but if you haven't seen the first two films do so before you watch this one and judge it for yourself."

","I don't think people really understand the point of having the book split into two parts. If you have read the book, then you would know that it was WAY too long and action-packed to be put into one movie. Yes, Mockingjay: Part 1 was not very action-packed, but that was the point! There were so many details in the book that you need to understand what is going on before you jump right into the action. I have read so many complaints that the movie was ""just a two hour preview"", but are you going to just jump into a war without knowing the details first? <br/><br/>I, personally, am a huge fan of The Hunger Games books and movies. I think all of the movies have followed the books very well and they did a great job picking the actors. Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job portraying the emotions that she needs and she plays Katniss, the character, very well. She especially did a great job portraying the many emotions of a distressed Katniss after two games. It's also nice to have two extremely attractive prominent characters :). They, too, do a great job of portraying the characters from the book. <br/><br/>The plot was not super action-packed, but that's how the book was. The first half started out in more details of District 13 and the rebellion that is starting. <br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was really good! I would recommend to anyone that it is a great movie, and you don't want to miss out!"

","26 November November 2014 Fiona's Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1. I cannot believe I have to wait another year for Part 2. This is another splendid instalment of the Hunger Games Series. It lacked the glamour of Catching Fire but that's because the story has taken us on, taken us underground, and taken us to a much darker place. After the destruction of District 12 Katniss Everdeen is living in District 13 and she is convinced by President Coin to become The Mockingjay, the symbol of the Rebellion. I very much felt that this film was mostly setting us up for the grand finale of the final film. It felt as if all the pieces were being pushed into place and although this was a great film in it's own right, I rather suspect that the fourth film in this series is the one we are all waiting for.

I wasn't expecting any action, because of my reasons explained above, but it was beautiful, its about getting ready to battle, about she inspiring people to go out and fight.<br/><br/>Maybe its because I live in a country that I wish people go out to fight the government, or maybe its because I wish I could inspire someday people like that, but I thought this movie was beautiful and I love all three of them.<br/><br/>And I hate the books, I hated Katniss in the books, believe me when I say Jennifer makes her Way more likable.<br/><br/>Done.<br/><br/>Cheers."

I sat in the theatre watching the whole thing and I didn't lose interest. Personally, I think this movie is pretty good. Now I wanna say something about the characters. First, I wanna say I'm really glad that Effie is in this. Without her and if it has Fulvia in it (like the book), it doesn't seem the same and no one can replace Effie. Another thing is that I was curious about the prep team (Octavia, Flavius and Venia). I was wondering where they were, why they were not in this movie. Also, Delly! Isn't she a supporting character and the one that tries to talk to Peeta about Katniss? But then I remembered that Delly doesn't show up until AFTER Katniss was strangled, so I was hoping she might show up in the second part since the first part ended after the scene when Peeta tried to attack her.

The special effects and action sequences were top notch and the continually increased budget is evident here especially. The acting was fantastic and the setting was detailed and felt incredibly real. Even all of the little emotional elements delivered perfectly. The real problem is that, as I previously mentioned, it's only half of a story. The movie builds to something that never really occurs and the void in action will be even more obvious when the extreme action in the next film comes to fruition. Yes, I understand that the Lord of the Rings films do something similar. The difference is that those films manage to build towards their individual climax without actually failing to develop the overall story arc. I think Francis Lawrence tried to accomplish that with this film but the source material wasn't made for that to be done, where as the Lord of the Rings movies were. Mockingjay Part 1 is still a good film and ultimately will be incredibly important in setting the stage for what should be the best film of the franchise but it is still incomplete."

","I saw ""The Hunger Games:Mockingjay-Part1"", starring Jennifer Lawrence-X- Men:Days of Future Past, The Bill Engvall Show_tv; Josh Hutcherson-Red Dawn_2012, RV; Liam Hemsworth-Empire State, The Expendables 2; Julianne Moore-Carrie_2013, The Big Lebowski and Donald Sutherland-Horrible Bosses, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of franchise movies are dividing their last installments up into two movies to stretch out their box office bucks, and this one does it, too. This is basically a set up for the next movie. It's not bad but you can tell that it is padded to fill time. Anyway, if you recall in the last episode, Jennifer destroyed the Hunger Games tournament with her trusty bow & arrows and was rendered unconscious. When she wakes up, she is in District 13 which is run by Julianne as the district President. Julianne is trying to lead a rebellion against the Capitol and the evil Donald and thinks Jennifer would be perfect as a figure head to rally the troops. Jennifer does not know what happened to Josh but soon learns that Donald is using him to make propaganda videos to crush the rebellion. Liam, the spurned boyfriend of Jennifer, is still hanging around hoping Jennifer will choose him over Josh; but she just thinks of him as a friend. There is not a lot of Jennifer in action here; I can only remember her getting into a fight with her bow & arrows on one occasion, and she only fired one arrow-Of course, she took out two targets but that is what you can do, if you are a hero. Pretty soon, Jennifer is making her own propaganda videos and trying to rally her followers. FYI:Philip Seymour Hoffman died during filming, with most of his scenes completed-they filmed Part 2 at the same time, which is due next year. It ends in a cliffhanger that sets up Part 2 and there is a brief scene after the credits but it's not really a scene but more of a cryptic hint at the next installment, using the Mockingjay symbol. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. It's not action packed but I would probably buy it on DVD."
"nerdingsince1996","10","25","66","20 November 2014"," a touching movie, must watch
","guys, I am a fan of the hunger games trilogy, I love catching fire and Jennifer Lawrence. I am so sad that this movie is not critically accepted as much as catching fire and even hunger games (at least this is from what I had observe. I don't understand it though, because this one is at least on the same level as catching fire for me. well, maybe it doesn't have as many actions scenes as its predecessors (although hunger games action scenes are doubtful really) but it is more emotionally touching and the action scenes, brief as they are, are very well handled. the dramatic scenes are also great, especially the few scenes where people of the district start to fight against the peacekeepers while sacrificing their own lives. it is so touching. God, it feels like I can't say enough 'touching' in here. and my favorite scene is one of them, the dam scene! :-) maybe the pacing is a little on the slow side but it's the consequence of making a film from a considerably weak and quiet short source material intro two separate movies so that the producers can gain more profit. I didn't complaint though, I can live with watching Jlaw's brooding face for a few minutes. Honestly, from one movie to the next Katniss's face is getting more and more easy to look at, probably the lack of make up.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, as always, succeeds to deliver a powerful yet touching performance. good job, Jlaw. and that last scene she has with peeta is very heartbreaking. I mean, just see her eyes! Peeta's transformation is very sad too. their reunion is handled very well. Julian Moore's character, president coin is too likable to me. she's not in the book and remembering her fate, that is a downside for me.<br/><br/>overall it's a touching movie, must watch"
"Nebzyl","8","23","60","28 November 2014"," No matter how lengthy the movie becomes, they should not have split it in two.
","The quality was good, the performance, the visual effects, the background music, everything. But it was just like a trailer of the whole Mockingjay movie. (No matter how good the trailer is, movie determines everything)<br/><br/>It was actually a bad decision to split the movie in two parts and now, we have the result. I know it's all for earning more, but take examples of ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Hobbit"", ""GodFather"", they're all lengthy movies but successful ones. Mockingjay had that potential but, the splitting not only shortened the movie length but also decreased its appreciation.<br/><br/>However, I personally liked the movie. I didn't find any useless moments here. It always goes unsaid that book is better, but this movie does justice to the book more than the previous ones. <br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie just now. Wait until the Part 2 gets released. Then watch both the movies together. Only then you'll truly enjoy ""The Hunger Games : Mockingjay""."
"movieboy13","8","23","60","23 November 2014"," From someone who finds the books overrated and hates the tween fandom, this movie is an astonishing surprise
","I have a love hate relationship with the Hunger Games series. I thought the first book was overrated and the first movie was a piece of garbage. I thought the second book was surprisingly well written and the movie was excellent. I thought the last book was fine and the ending was just awful. Although I like things about the Hunger Games, I was also very reluctant (and still kind of am in a way) to buy into the whole series. Although I liked the second movie, I was really reluctant to see the new Hunger Games movie. For some reason I just do not like the legions of fans and the hype it generates. I kind of feel like a hypocrite here, but I really cannot deny the excellence of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One. <br/><br/>There is all this dreck geared towards teens likes Divergent and Vampire Academy, etc. If you are one of those people (you know who you are) who always says all of these movies are terrible (as they are) and wish that teens and audiences alike were treated with more respect by Hollywood, here is your movie. <br/><br/>This movie depends on not much action action and virtually no dumb relationships but on human interaction, startlingly mature and graphic content, and the surprisingly realistic depiction of revolution through quiet and subtle direction from Francis Lawrence. Whereas the Hunger Games themselves were the driving force of the other movies, this movie takes a lot time and has a more adult approach to material and it is hardly boring, in fact it is engrossing. I was hooked from beginning to end. Talk about a chilling ending brrrrr.<br/><br/>It delivers on every level. Media goddess Jennifer Lawerence does not ham it up with a freakout scene and does a great job. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (sadly in his last role) gives a really solid performance along as does the usually annoying Julianne Moore. In fact, everyone in the film is in top form. Also, how could you not love how intensely over-the-top evil Donald Sutherland is? <br/><br/>Screenplay is great, directing is great, special effects is great, cinematography is great, shall I go on? This movie is just a great surprise. <br/><br/>This movie is thought provoking, disturbing, and not completely crowd pleasing and that is part of why it is really great. Regardless of my liking of the second movie, the first and second Hunger Game movies were still seen by tweens saying, ""Is it Peeta or Gale? Who does she love. oooooooo!!!!!"", yet this is just a great film on it's own. I cannot say it enough times. I applaud this movie for blowing my expectations out of the water and delivering what may be one of this year's best film's. <br/><br/>Movies like this and Dawn of The Planet of The Apes are proof that Hollywood is able to produce well-made and intelligent films. Please explain Transformers 4 then?<br/><br/>Sadly, this film is like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows and Part Two is just a bloodbath. Will not be as well made and emotional (maybe I am getting to pretentious here), but whatever, but I am glad I saw this and I absolutely recommend it."
"jrodibaugh-322-644341","8","23","60","21 November 2014"," Mockingjay Split Makes Sense To Me
","*tons of spoilers in this review*<br/><br/>I liked the film. I liked it a lot. I thought the bad reviews were wrong and the good reviews didn't quite understand the film. I'll get to that in a bit. <br/><br/>One of the problems of writing professional film reviews for mass consumption is that they are intended for everybody, including people who are not particularly invested in going to see the movie. As such, there are certain points that every author must hit in his or her review. For example: This is Philip Seymour Hoffman's last film; Effie is funny; Alma Coin is awesome; the film is 2 hours and 3 minutes long; it is based on a book. Then, after most of the reviews from the top critics are out, the review author can't deviate too much from the opinion of that crowd or the review will sound . . . well . . . stupid.<br/><br/>I love to be spoiled. I read every review that came out, and I kept reading the same things over and over again. One set loved the film. The other set kind of sort of didn't like it, but the strange thing was that most of those reviewers were angry because the film ended. Also, some of the reviews contradicted each other:<br/><br/>1) The film was too long v. the film was too short 2) The film had no action v. the film had the most action ever! 3) The film had no violence v. the film was too violent 4) Katniss clearly loved Peeta v. Katniss clearly loved Gale 5) District 13 was too dreary v. District 13 was too posh <br/><br/>Ooookaaay . . . <br/><br/>But what I want to address is the idea repeated most often: that Mockingjay Part 1 was only half a film divided solely for profit. Yes, profit was a factor, but I disagree with the notion that the film cannot stand on its own. The film, in my opinion, was entirely self-contained. The theme of the film was sacrifice, specifically how much sacrifice Snow and Coin are willing to make in order to achieve their agendas. The answer is: each leader is willing to let innocents die. Snow is more traditionally Stalin- esque. Coin is downright Machiavellian. <br/><br/>The film opens on Katniss who has been completely destroyed by the hunger games. It ends with a shot on Peeta, once the bright light of reason and humanity in Katniss's life, now completely destroyed by Snow and Coin's maneuvering. The middle part involved Katniss's struggle to save Peeta and to ignite rebellion. She does this in part because she is trying to save Peeta, whom she is afraid will be harmed by District 13 when they take the Capitol, and later because she is genuinely infuriated by the atrocities unleashed at District 8. But what the film does nicely is to subtly hint that this rebellion is actually not costing District 13 at all. Instead, the districts and Peeta take the full force of the Capitol's wrath while Coin sits complacently on her arsenal, directing traffic from the sidelines.<br/><br/>Mockingjay - Part I, to me, is not really about sparking the rebellion, or at least not in the same sense as in Return of the King where the first half involved the gathering of armies and the action-packed siege of Minas Tirith. The rebellion is certainly a large part of Mockingay, but that does not mean the uprisings should merely be seen as the build-up to the climatic, righteous revolution. If instead you view the film as a political film, you will be able to see how the movie stands on its own. The real structure revolves around Katniss's slow realization of who Coin is. <br/><br/>The professional reviewers all rave about Julianne Moore. They are right. She's great in the role. From the very first moment, she emanates calm and sharp intelligence. More than that, she seems genuine and almost maternal. At times she warmly tells Katniss exactly what she needs to hear, and even provides her comfort. She is clearly a great leader of District 13. But is she the right woman to govern all of Panem? Probably not. Her interests are entirely fused with District 13. She is not willing to sacrifice her own professional soldiers to further the rebellion. She prefers to let the districts do the dirty work. She and Plutarch film propos to inspire unarmed citizens to launch frontal assaults on peacekeepers armed with automatic weapons. Does she even provide air cover? Nope. It is revealed later that she wants to keep her weapons hidden in order to retain the element of surprise. <br/><br/>Coin's victory speech at the end is not played for heroics. Instead, it becomes an ominous harbinger of what's to come: more death, more destruction, but only for the people Katniss loves, not for District 13."
"moviexclusive","8","23","60","18 November 2014"," More deliberately-paced than its predecessors, this penultimate chapter is still tense and gripping as an intimate character study and a smart political allegory on revolution
","With the shot of an arrow, Katniss Everdeen demolished the annual Hunger Games and set in motion a rebellion that may very well overthrow the totalitarian rule of the Capitol which has held sway over the people in twelve Districts for the past 75 years. But to get to that point of the struggle, Katniss needs to be transformed from a survivor into an icon, a symbol that would come to represent what the revolution stands for in order to rally the people from the Districts to come forth from fear and join in the armed struggle.<br/><br/>Opinion will certainly be divided whether the concluding book in Suzanne Collins' 'Hunger Games' trilogy should have been split into two movies, but unlike other similarly cleaved YA-franchises, the verdict is very much clearer in this case whether 'Mockingjay' merits that split. By leaving the inevitable showdown between the rebels and the Capitol for another film, this prelude instead leaves enough breathing room for itself to be an intimately sombre character study of Katniss, the reluctant heroine from District 12 who over the course of two years of her life and two iterations of the to-the-death bloodsport found herself in a position to become a leader of a cause, but at a tremendous price not just personally but also collaterally.<br/><br/>Even though the Games are done, Katniss remains the traumatised centre of this penultimate chapter. Her rescuer, Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman), and the leader of the rebel cause, District 13's President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), want Katniss to be the star of a series of propaganda videos (or ""propos""), but as her former mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) shrewdly observes, Katniss has never done well following orders. Instead, her transformation would have to come from within, and this is in fact her two-hour coming-of-age story.<br/><br/>Wisely choosing not to antagonise rabid fans of Collins' books, screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong (both newcomers to the franchise) remain thoroughly faithful to the book. From a solo visit to District 12 to see firsthand what is left of it to another tour of the equally ravaged District 8 where the dead, the dying and the starving are crammed in the same makeshift hospital, Katniss' witness of the extent of Snow's brutality and her empathy for its victims will eventually fuel her fire to rage defiance against the Capitol's President Snow (Donald Sutherland). But Snow has his own spokesman – Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), her fellow tribute from District 12 and no less than her lover; Peeta is Snow's weapon against Katniss, 'hijacked' by Snow and put on Capitol TV to plead with Katniss to back down.<br/><br/>Not like in the Games, Katniss' trials here are more psychological than physical, so those expecting the same straightforward page- turning thrills of 'Catching Fire' will probably be quite disappointed. Gone is the colourful world of the Games, and in its place an austere subterranean environment where everyone dresses in boiler suits and even the formerly flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) has to forgo her wigs and make-up. That change of pace and place isn't however a bad thing at all, for it does allow us the space and time to fully appreciate the emotional depth of Jennifer Lawrence's acting.<br/><br/>More than in the other two films, Lawrence is simply tremendous here, conveying so many different shades within the same character – vulnerability as evidenced by how quickly she is seized by helplessness when she sees Peeta on TV, doubt in the her wariness towards President Coin and her spin doctor Plutarch, but most importantly her fierce determination when she turns towards the camera and delivers a personal message to Snow: ""if we burn, you burn with us"". Lawrence has always been the beating heart of this dystopian saga, and by letting Katniss' bow and arrow take a backseat to her emotional struggles, this chapter sees Lawrence deliver her most soulful, stirring and storm-raging performance yet.<br/><br/>She finds plenty of support in similar acting heavyweights Moore, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Sutherland. Such an ensemble may seem out of place in a YA- franchise, but their participation also indicates their confidence in the material. There is rich political subtext here about waging a revolution, not simply in military strategy but also in a more significant battle of the minds, wills and hearts. It was an inspired choice for Strong to be chosen as screenwriter – his previous work on HBO's 'Recount and 'Game Change' as well as last year's 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' certainly reveals his proclivities – and thankfully, returning director Francis Lawrence grasps the nuances in Strong's adaptation acutely and assuredly.<br/><br/>He may not be the Lawrence in front of the camera, but this Lawrence behind it guides the proceedings with poise and élan, confidently balancing the action and politics while finding just the right tone that never comes across too heavy-handed on either tragedy or melodrama, managing to even insert some moments of levity (courtesy of Effie and Haymitch). The opening half hour could be tighter, but once the film gets into its stride, you'll find it just as gripping as the earlier films, in particular a daring raid under the cover of darkness into the heart of the Capitol's Tribute Centre to rescue the victors of the Games – most prominently Peeta.<br/><br/>It does necessarily end on a cliffhanger, but this mid-sentence pause feels much more organic than say that of the 'Harry Potter' or 'Twilight' series. If you've just wanted a wham-bang thriller, then we say go re-watch 'Catching Fire'; indeed, Collins' trilogy was never meant to be just that. Without resorting to any voiceovers, this deliberately-paced but no less engrossing chapter retains the book's first-person, present-tense perspective of Katniss while losing none of the political allegory that Collins had intended from the very start. It may not catch fire, but it is a slow-burner that nonetheless captivates, enthralls and thrills."
"thirdfloorman","4","10","22","30 December 2014"," Jennifer Lawrence
","When I watched Jennifer Lawrence in CF it was the first time I witnessed a women playing a believable action hero. JL was just amazing. However, in MJ-1 she has turned into a bit of a wuss. I do not think it was JL but rather the writers/directors padding the film out that has made the character less believable. Creating two films out of one book which I might add I have not read, also created a plodding by the numbers predictable film, which leaves you empty and a bit cheated at the end. Also I cared less about the characters and I am not sure I will bother watching part 2. As with a lot of this type of film we the audience are treated like idiots and I found my self routing for the bad guy, which brings me to Donald Sutherland who is again brilliant playing the pantomime villain, which he plays so well that any film that he is now in he is type cast."

","10/10 STARS! Francis saved this series. The Hunger Games's shaky camera bugged me. But now, Francis came to the rescue. I'm not a great fan of the splitting, but I still loved it. I got the chills every time a scene is done powerfully. It does feel like a set-up for the next part but that doesn't really bother me. Some complain of the lack of action and unnecessary dialogue. But I never got bored and the action felt necessarily distributed. The dialogue was interesting and didn't feel unnecessary. The ending (though I expected it) broke my heart and was just so well done! The way this series is going, Mockingjay Part 2 will be epic. If you complained of the lack of action and haven't read the books, don't worry, cause Part 2 is packed with action. The only thing that bothers me is that we have to wait a whole other year. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out in July 2011, with Part 1 coming out in November 2010. They don't need to make us wait a whole year! Well, the only thing we can do is wait."
"kjwes3","8","22","58","22 November 2014"," Good not great
","The biggest reason this movie and the next won't be as good as the first 2 is because of the books. The first 2 books had the games to make it action packed. The last book (and the last 2 movies) are just not as spine tingling as before. So, I give Mockingjay an 8/10 just because it was a good movie- just not the 9/10 I would give to the first 2 HG movies. The cast do their usual great work, in a situation much different than the previous films. Direction was good, and I thought angles of camera shots were well placed. I pity the movie goer who walked into the theater not realizing this was a book 3 movie. I would have been so lost without having seen the first 2, and it really helped that I read the books."

They actually made the first half of the book action packed and an emotional roller-coaster that will give you the information needed to understand the situation! But at the same time keep simple minded people entertained while doing it! Honestly they followed the book while adding events that simulated the plot in ways that I bet the author Suzanne Collins wished she would have thought of it. Maybe she did b/c she was a part of the screen writing! I truly loved how Jennifer was able to express Katniss' thoughts and feelings without uttering a word. She is the perfect Katniss!

The story although slower than the previous movies is engaging and exciting, at no moment I felt boredom. As the movie progresses, you get in depth view of all the characters and get some back stories which is great news for a hunger games fan. Near the end the excitement rises, I left the theater trembling. I would watch it again for sure, and I can't wait for part 2!! If you are going in expecting an ending, you are going to be disappointing since the ending is in part 2. Other than that, everything was good. Can't believe I have to wait a full year..."

I loved it! <br/><br/>People say there is not enough action...um the books have a lot of CEREBRAL story so yeah not a lot of action but for me there was enough..right in the spots it should be. <br/><br/>I was wondering where they were going to ""cut"" it and end it and thought where they did was a good place. I was shocked at the difference in 'Peetas' look from the beginning to the end...wow a lot of weight lost in his face..good acting by the way too. Woody Harrelson was great, Jennifer Lawrence singing the 'Hanging Tree' was good, the whole scene gave me chills...they should have put that song on the soundtrack!! The scenery is perfect, everything they did pretty much fit the books true. There were a few things different but not so much that it changed anything to where you would go ""but..blech"" lol.<br/><br/>All in all if you loved the first 2 you will love this movie...<br/><br/>I think a true fan of the books will love this movie too. <br/><br/>Can NOT wait for next year!"
"summeriris","9","22","60","20 November 2014"," Politics, politics.
","War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.<br/><br/>The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.<br/><br/>And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR 'fans' look more pathetic than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering what film they saw."

"thedriver829","9","21","57","22 November 2014"," A Franchise That Continues To Get Better And Better
","The first Hunger Games completely surprised me. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. And then Catching Fire really surprised me with where it took the series, ending with perhaps one of the best twists from last year. And the cycle continues to repeat itself, in the very best of ways, with Mockingjay - Part 1.<br/><br/>What I love about this entry to The Hunger Games franchise, and what might turn some people off about this movie, is that it takes us out of the games and into the resistance. And I thought it was really cool what they gave us, and how they explored the build-up of this rebellion against the Capitol. I also enjoyed seeing what they've done with Katniss' character, showing how she is losing grip of her mental state and could lose it at any moment. It was nice to see her vulnerability in those moments, but it was also sweet to see her become a member a symbol of the resistance and take on that responsibility. She has her motivational moments and they are really effective, even to the point where you would want to fight with her. And I felt that Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible performance (as per usual).<br/><br/>One thing I noticed also is that this movie wasn't the most action- packed of the franchise, but it never bothered me because the intensity was so high. This had me on the edge my seat from beginning to end, and really took the franchise to what I think is at its best so far. Of course don't take that as there is no action in here. There's plenty to keep you going and there are some pretty sweet moments found here.<br/><br/>There are also some noteworthy performances from Julianna Moore, Elizabeth Banks, and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman (they put a tribute to him at the end credits of the movie, which was nice to see). It was also nice to see where they took the character of Peeta, which I won't spoil here but let's just say it will definitely be a shock. And I was surprised at the fact that the ending felt like it had some sort of resolution while still pumping you up for the next installment, which I'm sure is going to be one heck of a finale.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part I continues to lead The Hunger Games down the path that has made it so successful so far. It's intense, engaging, has some really great performances that I wasn't expecting, and I liked how it was able to keep us invested without having to rely on the anxiety of the games. It sucks that we have to wait another year to see the next one, but for now The Hunger Games continues to get better and better, and it shows no signs of stopping."

I don't really like the fact that she - Katniss - is not decided whom she loves or not, or at least if she would be capable of making a difference as in love and caring about one of the boys. But she is a great actress and she was well chosen on representing the movie and even the mocking jay. Can't wait to see the final!"

","I really liked it, i haven't been able to stop thinking about it ever since i left the theater. There were some parts that weren't great, but the other parts totally made up for that. Usually i'd rate this movie as a 8/9 but after reading some of the other reviews, i decided to give it a 10, because I really thinks it deserves better. It has a interesting plot and even though there is not a lot of action, it doesn't get boring at all. Most of the characters were very well substantiated, which made it easy to sympathize with them. I heard people saying the acting wasn't good, i totally disagree, Jennifer Lawrence was great, Josh Hutcherson was amazing, I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman a lot as well. I even liked Liam Hemsworth, he's getting better, I didn't like him that much in the first movies. And i'm actually quite happy that they made the book into two movies, it would've just been to much to put in one movie, people who have read the books will know. Overall it was a very nice movie, if you liked the first two movies you'll certainly like this one as well."

When I first herd this movie was going to be split into 2 separate movies, I was honestly concerned. But I feel like the Directors and Producers did a fantastic job of splitting the current story line in half, making the audience on edge to watch the next movie (sadly a year away). <br/><br/>I found this movie made me feel various different emotions.

","I had very little hope for this film, I assumed it would be the worst in the series as possibly the weakest book, therefore I set my expectations very low and was very surprised. Mockingjay part 1 kept me hooked into it from start to finish and I was very entertained. With great acting (especially from Jennifer Lawrence) and a very interesting plot. I might have enjoyed it because I was expecting a dull start to the end of the series, as nothing really seemed to kick off until the second half of the book. <br/><br/>The film just seemed to flow by and made good use of the 2 hour runtime and I never found myself sitting there in boredom hoping for things to pick up a bit more. The tension was kept well throughout and finished well; it didn't finish on an appalling cliffhanger such as catching fire where you are left questioning the film but it also didn't drag on and bored everyone. Some scenes in the film were very tense and entertaining and had a few minor twists which kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Overall, If you like me are a big fan of the series but not as excited for this installment, I highly recommend you lower your expectations and go and see it.

","All I see are people complaining that this movie is 'too slow' or its 'boring' or 'bleak.' Does anyone even pay attention to what it's about? This series is about OPPRESSION. It doesn't take the smartest person in the world to realize this series, books and movies, is about oppression, rebellion, and the consequence of both. It's not supposed to be upbeat. Like do you really need big noises and explosions constantly to keep your attention? It's supposed to make you think. This movie has been advertised as a cute little romance action movie from the start, but that's not even close to what it's about. The movie is a good adaption of the book, its taking the exact route it should. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job portraying the mental instability of Katniss who is so clearly suffering from PTSD. How dumb can you be not to realize what this movie is? I can't believe people walked in expecting constant explosions and constant excitement. This series is dark. Pay attention."
"aceofspades96","6","20","55","21 November 2014"," Satisfyingly Surprising!
","First off I'd like to say that I have long been a fan of the hunger games books. I have read all three of them, and after reading this book, I despised it! The book just didn't have a satisfying plot for me and no real suspense. But enough about book reviews, this is a movie review. I mention my disgust for the book because I went into the theater ready to hate the movie. I thought it was going to be the same plot with the same old characters, and I was going to be disappointed plus out 18 dollars for paying for my other critiquing buddy.<br/><br/>I am glad to say that I was wrong! Wow! I'm not going to lie, but this movie blew me away! Usually books based off of the movie have a lot of details left out of the final product. I guess you can say that the book is always better than the movie. This movie disproves that rule! There is actually more detail and more feelings in this movie than what was in the book.<br/><br/>Now obviously they can't keep every detail the same as the book, but they did a great job compensating for what they couldn't do, for they could do. In the book you are just thrown into district 12 ruins and you don't have a clue why Katniss is even there in the first place. In this movie, she wakes up in the hospital and is suffering from her recurrent nightmares again. She hasn't seen the ruins of district 12 or doesn't have any idea how many people died. This gives her the fuel to become the mocking jay for the rebellion. In the book she just does because she wants to get peeta back. Jennifer Lawrence does a stupendous job of giving the feeling of being petrified when she sees the ruins in district 12. You feel the exact way Katniss would if you saw what she saw!<br/><br/>For the first time ever, the writers are giving the people who actually read the books a treat when they watch this movie. The first being something small, but still satisfying. The cat! You never really get the vibe of how much she hates that Cat in the previous two movies. In the book she hates the cat to death and she wanted it to die. Half of the audience laughed when they saw the cat, and half didn't. The second treat you get from the producers is the hanging tree song. In the movie it is just a song that she sang from the top of her head and all the districts sang it but not the capital. In the book, it goes so much further than that. People who don't read the book don't know that her father was a great singer and that her dad would sing that song to her. The song gave you chills when you heard it and it made you honk so harshly about her dad.<br/><br/>The movie does a great job with staying true to the book while adding adjustments to make the story better. The book is from Katniss' perspective making what happens in the other districts unknown unless she is told. There is a lot of boring talking that happens in the book before any real action goes on because of this. This goes for the rebellion at the dam, the forest, or even the tribute rescue mission. Katniss simply doesn't know what goes on. The producers got to cheat with this and show you what really happens alleviating a lot of the boring filler pain from the book. There was true suspense and even boom readers didn't know what was going to happen at times!<br/><br/>This isn't something that I can really use to promote seeing this movie, but I will say that my perception and image in my mind was damn near identical to what the film crew put together. I was amazed on how the hospital looked! I figured it was like they were taking my mind and putting it on screen!<br/><br/>I will say that they fell short on making peeta look different after every time you see him on TV. Katniss kept saying his voice sounded different and that he looked different, and she was worried what they were doing to him. He didn't look any different. And I didn't see why she was flipping out.<br/><br/>This is either Juliane Moore's fault or the directors fault, but the character of Coin was not the same as it was supposed to be. Coin is more sinister, and not fully understood in the book, while in the movie, she is very well respected and she's kind of a badass! You can't help but like her. I don't want to like her because of what she does to.... I guess I'll save that :)<br/><br/>The movie does a great job of creating this feeling of helplessness and suspense. The best example is when the capital bombs district 13. You panic just as much as the citizens do when you see the citizens, and when the shot changes to Coin, you are pretty much begging them to do something about it. You feel so helpless when they realize that all they can do is wait it out.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 9/10 for how good a movie this is! The acting was great, the cgi was great, the the music was great, and it's loyalty to the boom was great! I take one star off to the mess up with the makeup on peeta, and the wrong portrayal of Coin. Other than that this is by far the best hunger games movie to date, and I would recommend this movie to anyone!"
"agblum","9","20","55","21 November 2014"," For the Most Part - MockingJay Soars!
","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1"" is third installment in the Hunger Games Movie Series, based on the popular young adult trilogy of novels. As per the title, the 3rd novel is being split into 2 movies, ala recent other young adult novel series last installment being split in two movies. As someone who has read the books, I felt there was more than enough material to justify two movies. The movie picks up where the last one – ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" left off, with protagonist Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, living in District 13, after being liberated from the Arena by the Rebellion. District 13 President Alma Coin, played by Julianne Moore & former Game Head, revealed as a Rebel at the end of Catching Fire, Plutarch Heavensbee, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, want Katniss to literally be the MockingJay, the face of the revolution. Katniss is still mad over the failure to rescue Peeta, by Josh Hutcherson, from the Arena, but as one would expect, she eventually acquiesces with a couple of conditions. Jennifer Lawrence is once again outstanding as ever playing Katniss. In the last movie, Jena Malone was the scene stealer as Tribute Johann Mason. This movie it would be Natlie Dormer, as Cressida, the Director of filmed propaganda pieces, that Katniss has agreed films to help spur on the rebellion. In her fairly brief scenes, she portrays a power and confidence in her character. Elizabeth Banks, returning as Effie Trinkett is also a stand out, and Woody Harrelson, also returning as Haymitch Abernathy continue his great performance in the series. For the most part I liked it, particularly the mending of scenes in the book in one of the final sequences in the movie, which effectively build tension, and other variations of things in the book. My rating may go up on second viewing, for now - 3 ¼ stars out of 4."

","As a stand alone movie, Part 1 is a good movie made great by Jennifer Lawrence. HOWEVER, as part of an epic that began when Katniss volunteers to be a tribute, to her ultimate destiny, this is a GREAT MOVIE. If you are a Hunger Games fan, disregard any criticism or shortcomings written by movie critics. Mockingjay 1 is a delicious appetizer that is the bridge to what will be, undoubtedly, the culmination of the greatest, most prescient movie(and books)of the dystopian genre. Kudos and praise to Suzanne Collins. But it is Jennifer Lawrence who transforms Suzanne Collin's Katniss Everdeen into the greatest female leading role in the history of movies. (And, to add, which male leading role surpasses Jennifer Lawrence's stellar performance in what will be 4 movies)<br/><br/>""My,oh my"", to use a phrase that Caesar Flickerman once said to Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence may become, blossom into, the greatest American actress in the history of cinema. I've seen the greatest of the greats during my 60+ years: Meryl Strep, Katharine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Betty Davis, Audrey Hepburn, etc. <br/><br/>In life, we often look back and only then realize that we witnessed greatness. Be grateful and appreciate the fact that right now, at this time in your life, you are witnessing greatness in the performance of Jennifer Lawrence."
"batool_alkhawaja","7","11","27","20 November 2014"," As expected
","Considering the fact that this movie is obviously a stepping stone bridging the gap between the first two movies and the last, I find it hard to understand why some are so disappointed that it's a bit of a cliffhanger. Then again, maybe I don't mind because I've already read the books and know how the story will end. For the record: I have yet to watch a movie based on a book I've read and found it better. None have even come close to being almost as good, except for The Hunger Games trilogy. And since Suzanne Collins' writing is simply amazing, a film adaptation that's almost as good is definitely a great achievement. (Note: I have to exclude the first movie from this praise because I found it a bit disappointing.) For fear of turning this into a book review, I'll be brief. the author of this trilogy is no doubt talented. she covered the subject matter beautifully and managed to make it exciting and appealing to both teens and adults. The character development in her books makes them believable, and makes you feel like you personally know them. I'd definitely advise everyone to read the books, and to watch the movies by extension. It'll be time well spent."
"smorse2434","8","18","50","21 November 2014"," A great slow burn that sets up a fantastic finale
","The Hunger Games books are surprisingly great reads, but fans would mostly agree that the third book just isn't as consistently engaging as the first two. It's not dreadful by any means, but it does not make good use of the extra room it has with the lack of the hunger games themselves. I will say that I like the games as entertainment but the most thought provoking parts come outside of the games, so it was disappointing that Suzanne Collins just could not come up with enough interesting interactions and moments to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>The fact that the first two books really focused on Katniss worked very well. Sadly, the third book continues focusing solely on her point of few when it should have opened up more. As a reader, you miss out on the big picture because the only picture we're getting is Katniss. This expanded focus makes The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 one of the few films that is better than the source material.<br/><br/>Mockingjay starts almost exactly after the conclusion of Catching Fire. Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence, arrives in District 13 where she discovers that Plutarch Heavensbee, Phillips Seymour Hoffman, and District 13's president Alma Coin, Julianne Moore, want her made into the revolution's face/symbol. Next you learn that Peeta, Josh Hutcherson, has been taken captive by the Capitol and is forced into doing propaganda for President Snow, Donald Sutherland. Katniss agrees to be the face of the revolution, which entails filming propaganda, but only if District 13 agrees to rescue Peeta and so the revolution begins.<br/><br/>This movie has far less the action than the previous two movies and instead can be seen more as a character study of how previous events affected the characters. The film touches on issues of PTSD, War, Remorse, death, and is pretty depressing at times but emotionally stunning at others. The films themes about control and perception are expertly injected, and never take a back seat to action sequences. Director, Francis Lawrence, wisely focuses on the story and all the characters instead of the world. This might be the most subdued film in terms of action in the series despite being the biggest in terms of budget, and yet that is a positive not a negative.<br/><br/>In the third book, the reader is forced to get all its information through Katniss, and it just does not work. The film's take shifts the focus to a wider view of the characters and this makes even small events that occur have more meaning. For instance, The rescue of Peeta really is not explained well in the book, but in the film it is constructed way more effectively, and revs up the tension dramatically.<br/><br/>The films drastic change in focus creates some changes in plot that some purists might get upset about, but in the end the story is better off. Katniss feels less powerless in the film and it makes her character more interesting. With the first two movies under her belt, Jennifer Lawrence is really bringing the character to life, and man does she know how to deliver a powerful speech. She is surrounded by a cast that should get its due as well. Moore is solid as Alma Coin and Hoffman's subdued but great performance shows what a shame it was to see him go too soon. Woody Harrelson Haymitch is still fantastic, but his character gets moved a bit to the side thanks to a complex plot and the love competition between Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) that is actually handled well. Most of the rest of the cast really do a great job as well.<br/><br/>Book adaptations are more often than not tricky business, especially when a single book is split into two movies. The main problem is trying to find a spot to stop the movie about halfway through where nothing was supposed to conclude. Mockingjay mostly avoids this, even if there are some small parts that make this feel like part one of a single story. Mockingjay part 1 builds differently from the previous two films. The difference being that the film is actually building toward something, but instead of just the plot advancing you get character advancement as well and that makes this a very different but improved experience.

","No doubt wars and revolutions, like any other human activity, can be derailed by the emotions of those involved at its higher levels: jealousy, fear, revenge - even love triangles. It could be a compelling premise, to see how far someone can be distracted by his personal feelings and forget the big picture while Rome burns, but this doesn't feel like what Mockingjay is doing - at all. The movie just assumes you are very, very interested in Katniss' (Jennifer Lawrence) angst over choosing between gloomy Gale (Liam Hemsworth), the stoic alpha male, and milquetoast Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), the endangered, sensitive one, now prisoner of the government led by white-bearded boogeyman Snow (Donald Sutherland).<br/><br/>The idea of a protagonist who is supposed to lead a revolt but lacks natural charm and charisma is interesting, but too much time is devoted to a weepy Katniss brooding in an underground base as she is torn between Gale and Peeta. We get it - will you please go back to your revolution, lady? Never thought I'd miss murderous monkeys and poisonous fog, but there you are. <br/><br/>A fine cast is wasted, with Woody Harrelson, Julianne Moore, Jeffrey Wright and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman having little to do, and the electric Jena Malone - the stand-out of Catching Fire - getting a few seconds of screen-time.<br/><br/>For all their flaws, I rather enjoyed the two previous movies; Katniss spent an inordinate amount of time worrying about Peeta in them as well, but the context was more cinematic. They had cliffhanger endings, but at least felt like complete entities in terms of structure. This is just truncated, a ""to be continued"" bridge to the next chapter.<br/><br/>5,5/10"

So it moves from a kind of game show/reality show theme into a metaphor on how two different political struggles use the media to campaign their agenda to the people.<br/><br/>But I make it seem like I went to see the movie because of it's complex reflection on contemporary mass media. No, it was action packed with JLaw looking crazy hot as the mocking jay, battling the capital. I thought this was suppose to be a chick flick? My mistake. <br/><br/>In the mist of spinning ideas that make it seem like movies similar to the recent release, Kill the Messenger, between are action sequence that make it seem like Black Hawk Down. It's almost a fantasy version of Zero Dark Thirty, which at times seem like quiet overkill<br/><br/>But it did get my heart pumping with suspense, and I loved every minute of it."

It made me understand everything i wasn't able to understand in the book! i think it's the first movie i like more than its book. in the book it was just words who didn't make sense. in the movie everything was clear and exciting it's really wow how the actress can act that she can't act or that she act that she's not acting. it's really wonderful to watch it and it deserve the time and money to watch it. I LIKE IT A LOT."
"dearbornvendetta","9","17","48","24 November 2014"," Moving, dark, morose and fantastic story telling
","I have been truly taken by surprise with The Hunger Games movie series. When the first one came out I knew nothing about it except that the books were quite popular. Needless to say my first viewing of the first one I enjoyed it a lot but also was disturbed that it was considered a story for young adults. Now skip ahead and I loved Catching Fire and for me Mockingjay part 1 is every bit as good as Catching Fire in its own ways. It may not have the action that made the first 2 such good movies but where it lacks in action it makes up for with excellent acting and a compelling story. The war is beginning and the finale looks to be glorious. This is a dark and morose movie. You wont find hardly any smiles and very few laughs but thats not a bad thing. <br/><br/>We are being thrust into a world where the Government is corrupt and a civil war is brewing, it would seem odd if it wasn't occasionally if not mostly depressing. But its not the kind of depressing that is going to make you leave the theater sad, no its going to make you leave the theater hungry for more. I care so much for these characters that I am finding myself heavily invested in their struggle. Katniss is in a dark place in this movie as she finds herself the reluctant symbol of the rebellion against the Capital. Its odd that after all she's done she doesn't realize her importance or at least doesn't seem to want the importance. She's the reluctant hero and Im starting to get a martyr vibe. It was a treat once again to see Phillip Seymore Hoffman grace the screen in what is his last fully completed movie. He filmed all but one scene for the second part. Julianne Moore joins the cast as the leader of the rebellion, President Coin and she is a welcome treat. It's nice this franchise was able to lock in such powerhouse actors, just shows that they believe in the material.<br/><br/>This movie isn't going to satisfy action junkies and some may feel that overall not much happens to move the story forward but I believe there is enough going on here to keep you entertained from start to finish. I didn't want it to end and am not looking forward to the long months of counting the days until I get to see the finale to this brilliant series."

","I'm a big hunger games fan,Mockingjay however was my least favourite book of the series. I'm not going to get into why as this is a movie review. I am going to try and review the movie based on the movie.<br/><br/>I was skeptical when I heard they were splitting this there is not a lot to work with here,I think splitting Catching Fire would have made more sense. The only movie I agreed with splitting was Harry Potter. It made sense. I was pleasantry surprised and quite enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing. Jennifer Lawrence was great as always. She really brings warmth to Katniss that I think many others would have a hard time with. Josh Hutcherson is great in the little time he gets. Philip Seymour Hoffman really shows how great of an actor he was,and what a loss he is to the acting world. Julianne Moore did a wonderful job,her performance as Coin gives you the unsettling feeling about Coin. Sam Claflin was good in the limited role but he did shine when he was on. Elizabeth Banks though blew me away. She really showed a whole new side to Effie. It was very layered and you can feel that she is putting up this act to hide how scared she is.<br/><br/>The shaky cam is back and I was not happy about that. It drives me up the wall. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence also sang ""The Hanging Tree"" it was a beautiful version and well done. The ending is one you will either love or hate.<br/><br/>I think if you have read the book,you'll enjoy it as you know what is to come but if you have not you might have some issues with it. Although I think in a year when you see the second part you might like it more. That being said you should be able to watch a movie without reading the books."

","The Hunger Games: Mocking jay-Part 1! The long awaited squeal to the best selling dystopian book series, The Hunger Games. After the success of Harry Potter and Twilight, it seemed like a nice idea to break the final movie of the hunger game series into 2 parts too. But the book isn't that long. Because of that the movie started to drag at moments and the pace of it was slow. But with the amazing cast and widely loved Jennifer Lawrence in it, it's hard not to like. The movie addresses the problem of a stronger government torturing their subjects. Many countries could relate to this today. Overall a good movie. Brilliant acting, well written and really good Cinematography. I personally liked Catching Fire a lot more. The movie primarily set the stage for the final part set to release 20th November next year, kinda like a 2 hour long trailer.The soundtrack by lorde was stunning and perfectly suited the movie."
"jkdigitaldesigns","9","21","62","14 November 2014"," MOCKINGJAY PART 1 is the second-act, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK of the series that could rival HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS as the best ending to a movie series.
","This is THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK of the franchise, so far it is the best paced and darkest, it is the moment before the grandiose epic conclusion and it fits the bill nicely. It is superior to the previous two films on every level, this is no longer a kid's series, this is a world class franchise. <br/><br/>THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE from 2013 ended with Katniss exploding the games arena forcefield/ holographic wall. She was delirious and in and out of consciousness, as it happened the good guys from the secret, and long believed dead, District 13 came to the rescue and got Katniss and Finnick safely out of there before the Capitol could get their hands on them. The problem is that Peeta and two other tributes were left behind. Pushed beyond imaginable pain and emotional destruction Katniss is now struggling to cope with life. She never wanted a part of The Hunger Games and stood up solely to protect her sister. She also fell in love with Peeta and would do anything to protect him. The districts, seeing Katniss becoming their symbol and hope for freedom of the Capitol commence rebellion against the ""leaders"" of Panem and this leads to thousands of people being slaughtered in the name of order by the Capitol and dastardly evil President Snow.<br/><br/>All these deaths Katniss feels responsible for but nothing she can do can stop the building tsunami of rebellion she started and the people longed for. President Snow will not stop, he wants to completely destroy her in every way possible and hates anyone not of the Capitol, he sees them as mere slaves to continue his privileged life. The people are willing to die for the fight and so begins the most political and intelligent film in the franchise. This is the commencement of war, covert battle movements, propaganda and mind games. President Snow is much better at destroying the people from within and he has the master weapon against Katniss, the rebellion and Panem.Peeta Mellark.<br/><br/>JLaw again goes above and beyond in what appears to be the hardest role of the series for her, she is just sensational. It must have been a heavy shoot for her to take home at nights. She borders on psychotically destroyed in the movie and the pain Snow rains on her never relents. Katniss is best under pressure and in anger – she is, after all, the girl on fire. You know this movie is her second act, where she is put in the worst of everything and there appears to be no hope, but push Katniss too far President Snow, and I cannot wait to see the clouds clear for Katniss in Part 2. If it is as good as part one I can see a part two to rival and/ or better HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland is also superb, he must have so much fun being so evil. Woody Harrelson owns every scene he is in, he has so much character in front of a camera, as does Elizabeth Banks as a much more toned down but as eccentric, Effie Trinket. Julianne Moore is a brilliant addition as President Alma Coin, the leader of the rebellion, she is the other side of the coin, she is the leader of politics, she is incredibly serious and her role is very under-toned, she has a sombre position as the president of the rebellion going up against the almighty Capitol, if she fails she will see millions killed.<br/><br/>It was incredibly refreshing but sad to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman on screen, the film is his last and it is filmed and completed in his honor, his role is flawless. I suppose I better mention the love triangled duo. Liam Hemsworth's role I found quite flat, he is great as a combat warrior and shoulder for Katniss but sometimes his heart hardly seems in it. It should be noted he did fracture his ankle on the set so this may have limited some movement and made him appear a little wooden? Then there is Hutcherson, his performance in this film is sensational and for the first time it matches JLaw's. He filmed the entire movie without his lead partners as he was in the Capitol as a hostage, his role was also much smaller than the previous outings. That being said, his performance in the last 10-15mins of this movie is his best in the entire series, the entire cinema's jaw hit the floor.<br/><br/>There are a lot of new characters in the movie and a bunch of them are Katniss' unit when she's out in the world battling bad dudes and shooting planes down with a bow and arrow, they are also her documentary propaganda filmmakers who try and film her to play throughout the districts. Natalie Dormer, Elden Henson and Mahershala Ali being most notable but their parts in this first half of the finale are quite small, Sam (my guest for the evening) was even quite surprised that they were in it and found them quite boring. But they are all warriors and this was the quieter half, each these characters will come into their own in next year's outing.<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence has given us the best movie in the franchise, a movie that has lifted the production values of everything to next level, this is possibly one of the greatest young adult movies of all time. You can also see that everyone involved got on board, everything just looks, feels and is huge, no shortcuts, epic in visuals, effects, scripts, acting and then the music, sombre dystopian brilliance including peeps like Lorde, Major Lazer with Ariana Grande, The Chemical Brothers and Tinashé. <br/><br/>This film will destroy the box office for 2014 and make everything else grovel for scraps.<br/><br/>Be sure to head to www.SaltyPopcorn.com to see more of our reviews."

","I believe this one was actually a lot better than Catching Fire. It was a definitely one that keep you on the edge of your seat, constantly begging to know what is going to happen next. When watching this one, I felt myself a little more filled with emotion than I had been in Catching Fire. It gave the viewers a better chance at connecting with the main characters such as Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and even from Prim. They did an excellent job with graphics and south effects as well. The only thing that sort of upset me is how it ended, and the way it left us hanging. And also, the fact that we have to wait a whole year for the next part to come out. It was definitely worth the money spent, all in all a pretty good piece of work."
"dreamtrove-176-145986","6","8","19","3 December 2014"," Read the book
","Six, an appropriate score for a B action movie with no significance, plot or character development. I'm sorry if you liked Finnick Odair, because don't expect to see much of him, or Peeta Mellark, but the major problem with this movie is that it's telling the opposite story of the one the book told. All the foreshadowing is removed and there are newly invented scenes that directly contradict the subtext of the book and lead me to suspect that a radical change of ending at the end of movie two.<br/><br/>It's not Mockingjay, the book, made into a movie. It's like Coin made a propo of Mockingjay from her point of view and released it as a campaign ad for her upcoming presidential run.<br/><br/>Mockingjay wasn't a completely original story, it was Watership Down, but it was a wonderful end to the series, and just the sort of triple play that was needed. Now they've taken that away from me and handed me a star wars in its place. That's like taking away my swordfish steak and giving me a McFillet.<br/><br/>It's a chopped assortment of action scenes, with all of the darkness removed, and absurd scenes added that generated actual mocking laughter from the theater audience when I saw it on the second night. That's never a good sign.<br/><br/>Still, if you're just seeing it as a movie, it's not terrible, it's not like inception or some of the garbage they have at top of IMDb's list; meaning, it's not blatantly bad, it's just blatantly not mockingjay. Maybe if they called it mockingmockingjay, or maybe if it was a youtube fan video attempt it wouldn't have annoyed me so much.<br/><br/>There are a couple of well done scenes taken from the book that actually appear in the movie. I think there are actually five scenes in this movie that are actually in the book, and maybe two of them are the same as the book. What's more difficult to forgive is the creation of scenes that aren't in the book to add in when there is clearly so much that was hacked out.<br/><br/>So, if you didn't read the book, you'll be mildly annoyed, if you did read the book, just brace yourself with really low expectations and then you can still enjoy it."

In fact, I was pretty much amazed by how they made it entertaining compared to the book. <br/><br/>The writing is great, the acting is perfect and it is even better than the book. <br/><br/>The problem is that the people who didn't read the book won't really like this movie because of what they were expecting after seeing the second movie."

","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is one of those rare movies you want to forget you saw. A mixed up thriller about a freedom fighter teen romance (who happens to be female)and her deadly exploits. Jennifer Lawrence, one of the beautiful assassins in the movie Naked Killer is wasted here in this wretched exploitation movie which tries too hard to emulate BATLLE ROYALE II. It fails to work on several levels. As a political thriller, the movie is laughably inept..the plot is so convoluted and implausible that you can only shake your head in disgust.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are so two dimensional you can see right through them. As an exploitation flick this movie doesn't even titillate much less stimulate. Not at all in the same league as other Hollywood ripoffs of old mangas and animes of similar theme such as Inception and The Avatar. JLaw fans should stick with X-Men, a much better crafted story. Avoid this 'movie' with like the plague."

","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1' will not be remembered as the peak of this particular franchise. It's not bad, it just drags a bit...though considerably less than the first half of the final novel in Suzanne Collins' trilogy. If anything it takes the necessary time to deal with the protagonists qualms at becoming the figurehead for revolution, which is so rushed in the prose version. A few good stunts and effects sequences, and some nicely tuned supporting performances from the great Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and Woody Harrelson, but, as ever, it's all held together by Ms Lawrence. I have yet to see that lass give a bad performance, even in dross like 'The Last House on the Left' remake. The film just about succeeds in remedying the dramatic deficiencies of Collins' storytelling, and making sure all the key pieces are placed appropriately for the endgame is vital...but having to wait for Katniss to cut-loose an' whup Donald Sutherland's wrinkly ol' posterior until November 2015 is annoying."

Going into this movie you must know, There are no games, There isn't a lot of action but there is killer suspense, and great acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. <br/><br/>The film begins where Catching fire left off, in the opening scenes I thought I was watching a Horror movie, It WAS that dark. In District 13, Katniss Everdeen is very emotionally unstable as she learns that her hometown District 12 is destroyed and no longer exists. <br/><br/>District 13 Leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Try to convince Katniss to become the symbol for the long brewing revolution, but Katniss Isn't down with that, not until Coin agrees to rescue Peeta and the other tributes.<br/><br/>This film is very dark and emotional, scene after scene there are people being executed, shot to death or blown up. But there's also a great action sequence in the movie that features ""The Hanging Tree"" sung by Jennifer Lawrence, Which she did a great job of.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great political thriller, it is mostly a media war consisting of Propaganda video vs Capitol Propaganda video. Towards the end of the film it gets very intense and suspenseful, the ending scenes reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty, so if you enjoy extremely emotional films and War. This is one you want to watch.<br/><br/>But if you're expecting tons of action sequences, maybe waiting for Part 2 is something you should consider. I think people have confused themselves into thinking Part 1 will be full of action, it isn't, but It's very good and stays true to the book, in fact the most faithful book to movie adaptation I've ever seen.<br/><br/>That's why I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 | 8/10 Stars, Roll on Part 2."
"Rick-34","8","17","49","20 November 2014"," Jennifer Lawrence makes this work
","When the producers decided to break Mockingjay into two films, we were pretty much fixed on a course where Part One was going to be anti-climactic compared to the rest of the series. So, no, it's not quite as good as Catching Fire (and thus, nowhere near the level of The Hunger Games). But still, this edition does a good job expanding the Penam universe, and developing the story of our heroine Katniss.<br/><br/>Katniss works so well because she's authentic, free of the practiced cynicism that permeates President Snow and even the leaders of the rebellion. A key moment is when Haymitch Abernathy explains this fact to them. And it's really hard to imagine any young actress pulling this off as well as Jennifer Lawrence, who exudes authenticity herself. <br/><br/>So Mockingjay has the emotional pull, it has a solid story line, it has a well-constructed dystopian world, and it has a solid cast with an exceptionally talented lead. It lacks only a satisfying conclusion, but as Part One, that can hardly be a surprise."

","As a big fan of the Hunger Games Trilogy, I was super eager to see Mockingjay Part 1 at the cinema on opening day. While overall, the movie is good and largely true to the book there were elements of it that just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence delivers another stellar performance as Katniss Everdeen, but somehow, she looks ""too old"" for the role of the 17 year old tribute. While there is no doubting her acting ability, there were times when I found myself thinking that it just wasn't working. The same applies to Willow Shields (Prim) who no longer appeared to be the ""little sister""<br/><br/>Other returning actors, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta), Phillip Seymour Hoffman (PLutarch), Donald Sutherland (Snow) and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch) all put up great performances worthy of mention. By far and away, the stars of this movie were Sam Claflin (Finnick) and the amazing Elizabeth Banks (Effie). <br/><br/>For me, Julianne Moore just didn't work as Coin. I couldn't work out if it was a casting error, an acting issue or a screen writing problem but it just wasn't right. <br/><br/>It was evident that there was a bigger budget on this movie than the previous 2 and I do think there were things that could have been done better, but overall, I thought the movie was good. The decision to include Effie Trinkett in this move was absolutely right and it's definitely worth a watch."
"aarontrancnhkeyclub","10","19","56","17 November 2014"," This movie is dark and amazing. It has very political aspect to it.
","Just recently viewed this film and honestly I am amazed. I read the books, so I knew what was coming, but little did I know the director added some new things. In the beginning of the film it shows Katniss being completely broken and suffering from PTSD. Jennifer Lawrence did a wonderful job with her acting and really pulled it off. Given that many of the scenes she was sobbing. I really liked the use of propaganda in this film. How it was made and how it was used. It tells a lot of how our politics work. And getting all that really opens up to the whole point of Mockingjay. Seeing the reviews of many who did not like the film mad me a little nervous. I had high expectations of this film and I definitely do not want to see it go down the gutter. But man, were many wrong. I love this film. Francis Lawrence did a great job portraying all of Panem and bring out in a larger scope than in the book. It is a very depressing movie but in a weird way it's really good. There are sides to it where you just have to connect it to the ""real world"". Especially as we are seeing what is going on in Mexico and Syria. Francis somehow pulls those situations and issues into this movie that really is an eye-opener. It is all out war and not only that it debunks how all of this political motion works. Bottom line, watch this film. It really is amazing. It outdid my expectations. Tips when watching the film: Be open minded about the film, it's not boring like many say it is. There is a lot of action going on. I was so psyched up after watching this film and left the theater just wanting more."

","I've never been the wildest fan of the Hunger Games franchise. Even before seeing the first movie I always thought the premise had amazing potential (never read the books, just based on the premise), that was confirmed when I saw the first movie. The potential was huge and was there, but unfortunately it wasn't used. I thought the first one was a plain bad movie: it had huge storytelling problems and repeatedly failed to live up to its own intentions. The second one was definitely an improvement. I still didn't see the franchise living up to its potential, but it certainly had some very good moments. Yet, the huge storytelling issues remained. That's where my problems have always laid with the franchise up until now: it has never really given me a coherent world building. Well I can say that now, with the third installment, the franchise has finally given me the satisfaction I wanted from the very start, it has finally realized its potential, used it properly and, call me surprised, it has given us an f**cking good movie.<br/><br/>Some minor storytelling issues remain, but finally the major shortcuts and grand visual incoherences from the first couple of movies have gone away and gave me the possibility of looking at the movie without having to be taken out of it every other moment. Visually the franchise has never looked better, the camera work is very smooth and polished and gave an enormous contribution to tension in multiple scenes, yet most importantly there are great set pieces and moments that, thanks to some good CGI, contributed to fantastic imagery. But, where the movie really succeeds is in characters and commentary. Everybody has their moment, everyone gets a full rounded job. You will feel depth and various levels on every character both in good and dark. Doing this at the very best and definitely the highlight of the cast is Hoffman. He was magnetic every time on screen and I didn't even really like him in the previous movie. But here he is astoundingly great and adds to every single moment he has on screen something more to his character, he gives him true depth. Aside him Moore and Sutherland are excellent, Hutcherson is amazing in what he is given, a lesser actor could have really butchered the part, and obviously Lawrence is as stunningly spectacular as always. I was on the edge of my seat many and many times and that final act was absolutely nail biting, this is definitely helped by the strong imagery used by the movie that is exactly what I wanted from it (that last shot was amazing), something that the previous entries din't succeed in. Good job Francis Lawrence, you brought me from nearly hating this franchise in the start to ""can't wait for the next movie"" status.<br/><br/>Allbeit the movie has missteps. It falls into useless sentimentality more than a couple of times and it did this totally gratuitously in one sequence (involving saving a cat) and brought down the movie a lot instead of elevating it. I cringed more than once and that is never a good thing. The first half of the movie could have been slightly cut, it gave weight to way too many things that didn't have it and dragged out story lines that could have been solved in a much more easier way, even worst is the fact that some of these were basic clichéd moments to get an initial drama going. Moreover, most unfortunately, some story issues remain, they are very smaller than previously, but still they were made the more annoying by the fact that the previous entries had a very bad track record in the matter for me.<br/><br/>I've seen lots of underwhlment in regards to this movie by fans and by people who were excited for it. I think that there is one main reason for which I liked this movie so much and so much more than everybody else. I wasn't excited for it. I had never really liked any of the movies before, only like the second one, so I didn't really care a lot for this one and moreover I had no absolute idea where it was going, I really don't know anything about this franchise other than what the movies show me so that's why I was so surprised by this entry.<br/><br/>The movie is the best of the franchise so far for me, it was a truly thrilling experience and more than that, it was a really good film that ranks definitely in the best dozen or so of the year so far."

Yes there isn't nearly as much in fight scenes but who needs it. Mockingjay was far better than the Hunger Games & Catching Fire. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is an acting genius she makes you feel the emotions with her, and I love the signing scene the song is so catching and she has such a bluesy voice.<br/><br/>They still lighten the mood a little bit with plenty of funny one liners that make you laugh."

I didn't get bored at all. It has some very funny moments too! Also the tone is much more optimistic than Catching Fire.<br/><br/>-The acting is better too! I loved Jennifer Lawrence in it. She's totally hot. There, I said it. Philip Seymour Hoffman is in a lot of the film and I loved him in it! Yeah everybody was really good.<br/><br/>-The characters themselves are pretty solid. It's nice seeing Katniss make up her mind. And this film offers more room for lovable characters like Haymitch and Effie to grow! -The effects were very good.<br/><br/>-The music is even better than the other two! -So some negatives. It does feel like it is split up into two films. It introduces new characters and we don't see a lot from everybody. That's about all.<br/><br/>-Content: This one is tricky. There is no language and no suggestive content or nudity. There are some violent images that are tough even for PG-13. It's not Schindler's List, but not for young kids.<br/><br/>-So overall I will say that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is great all around. If you liked the first two, see this one! It is TOTALLY worth seeing in theaters! I'm probably going to see it again! I would give Mockingjay a strong 8.5/10! If you haven't seen Catching Fire, it's on Netflix.

","If you have read the books, you may agree with me that Mockingjay was by far the weakest of the trilogy. The first half (or maybe even more) was painfully dull for me to read.. it wasn't until it got to the finale at the end the book picked up. This being said, I think they did a good job with the movie considering this. Yes, the movie lacks the excitement of the games that the other two had. If you had read the books you would know to expect a more political film than action-packed. I felt they played up the events in the first part of the book enough to keep the movie from being boring but it didn't feel over the top all the same. The cast delivered great performances. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing and Hemsworth proved himself with the larger role he played in this movie. Julianne Moore was a great addition as Coin (and my god she's beautiful!). Philip was incredible and it warmed my heart to see his smile on the theatre screen. The dedication at the end of the film to Philip made me very happy and sad all at the same time. I say go see Mockingjay. It may not be on par with Catching Fire but it sets the tone for a very promising part 2. The end with the return of Peeta was exciting and although it was the predictable place to end the film, it helped to preview just some of the intensity the 2nd part of the movie will have."
"anda-alexandra-86","9","14","40","30 November 2014"," Book VS. Movie: Mockingjay Part 1
","I shall tell you, point by point, what I missed and what I liked:<br/><br/>Cue to District 13 as soon as the movie starts - the book starts with Katniss visiting District 12, seeing the horrors that President Snow inflicted on her people. In the movie, Katniss takes her time in District 13 and we do not see 12 for quite a long while. Somehow I feel the movie Katniss is more weak and frail than the book version.<br/><br/>Effie Trinket is in District 13 - as opposed to the book where she is in the Capitol and Katniss ""prep team"" (Venia, Flavius and Octavius) are forced away from the Capitol at the same time with The Hunger Games being hijacked by awesome Plutarch. Now that is one of the biggest deviations of the movie, but somehow it feels comforting and reassuring to have Effie there. In the movie she is quite a huge character and you grow to love her with each movie. And who could wear Grey colors like her, making them look fashionable?! :) Plus she has a lot of humor in Mockingjay and occasionally flirts with Haymitch - makes me believe that maybe in part 2 they will end up together?! :) Not that I would not agree...<br/><br/>Katniss demands from District 13 and President Alma Coin - they seem to go from big to small in the movie as opposed from small to big in the books. In the movie she first demands the victors (Peeta included) and Annie (Finnick's love) to be rescued and pardoned and then demands on her sister right to keep the cat. In the book she first starts small... with the kitten request... and then grows into asking for Peeta and the killing of President Snow by her own hands (and by the way, this demand does NOT get into the movie lines... I wonder why!). At first, in the book, she focuses so much on her anger that she forgets about Finnick & Annie, but comes back eventually and demands freedom for her as well.<br/><br/>Katniss does not request for President Snow to be killed, in the movie. In the book she wants him dead so somehow, again, I feel that the movie tries to make Katniss weak. I makes me think/feel that she is still afraid of the President hurting her and the ones she loves.<br/><br/>Finnick gets less action on the big screen than in the book - and I think I get that, as in the book he is a huge character, well developed and very well connected with the story. When he dies in the storming of the Capitol I could not stop myself from crying. For me Finnick was on the same step as Katniss and Peeta and to tell you the truth I always placed Gale lower. Finnick is a strong character, he was made wise by playing inside the Capitol and having access to their secrets and lies. There are two options here: either the director wants us not to get attached to him and suffer when he dies, or they will not follow the course and he will not die... I wonder how they will play this!<br/><br/>The Tech-Bow all the book readers were waiting for is not featured in the film! :O Katniss receives as prop, in District 13, a bow created by Beetee. True, we see that in the movie that he gives Katnip the bow with 3 different sets of arrows and it looks pretty and shiny but hey! where is the feature of the bow that we were all waiting for? The bow is supposed to open up only to her very own voice! Where did that go?<br/><br/>Katniss soldier training is non-existent in the movie - yet another point in making Katniss Everdeen look weak and frail and senseless on the big screen. Somehow I felt the movie was focusing too much on Gale and Katniss than the relationship in the book between Katniss and Peeta/Finnick/her adorable little duckling-turning-into-a-swan sister. In the end, in Mockingjay the book, we can see Katniss severing all relationship with Gale; so where did that kiss came from? The need for some romantic action must-have in nowadays movies?! Cah! :/<br/><br/>Either way I am glad I saw the movie and it was a night well spent, but hey! I am critical when it comes to the books I love, and The Hunger Games series is one of them. It could have been better done but as it is I must admit that for me it was the movie I have waited for more than a year! and either way I would put it in the top 3 best movies of the year. And last but not least, long live Donald Sutherland as President Snow :) Now that is one character you love to hate! I recommend you go see it for yourself, especially if you already read the books ;)"

","If you dislike this movie, it's because:<br/><br/>A) You haven't read the books B) You don't like the books and/or the Mockingjay book in particular C) You have been conditioned to CGI explosions every 5 mins in Blockbuster films and cannot handle a character-driven movie<br/><br/>The Hunger Games films (excluding the first one) have been the most faithful book-to-screen adaptation I've ever seen. This movie follows EXACTLY the book. It IS the book. <br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was so excited throughout it, and went through all the emotions, even tearing up!<br/><br/>So if you don't like it, your beef is with Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay book, not the film. Which is understandable, because many consider Mockingjay the weakest in the trilogy.<br/><br/>That said, I LOVED THIS MOVIE. It blew my mind. It brought clarity to the book, it made it clear. I actually liked this movie BETTER THAN THE BOOK. There IS action, but it's a different kind of action.<br/><br/>I couldn't take my eyes off of Jen, and Josh (Peeta) really pulled it off. I didn't think he could do it. Liam (Gale) stepped up too, because for the first time in the series I actually felt sorry/understood his character. Willow (Prim) also feels more dimensional. The only thing I feel leery about is Moore's Pres. Coin---she's likable, perhaps too likable, and I might feel sorry for her in P2 because of how likable she is."
"sarahrich2995","8","16","48","11 November 2014"," Well paced and thought out, beautifully tragic
","I was invited to the London premiere for Mockingjay, and as a reader of all of the Hunger Games books I was surprised that for me, Mockingjay is perhaps one of the most well made. <br/><br/>It might be perceived as 'boring' because of less death and focus on the games, and more on the political strategies of a nation in uprising, but its beautifully done. I was also very glad to see that they did not leave Finnick's prostitution by the Capitol out of the film, which I had been concerned about due to the rating. The politics is very heavy, but as this is something that personally interests me I was only more intrigued. You see a breakdown of the nation and the characters themselves- a completely different side to the facade some of them held in previous films.<br/><br/>The themes of this film are very dark, which may turn some people off of it, but I think were portrayed well. Staying true to the book, with some added extras like actually getting to see the extraction team get the Victors out of the Capitol, the film felt longer than it was but covered a lot of well thought out ground during that time. The acting from all was superb, which I had been concerned about as they added new people to the ensemble, but they worked together and created believable characters in believable situations. <br/><br/>I left frustrated about the ending, which I suppose was their main aim, and ready to see more. I would however say that they learnt their lessons from the first two films with this one, and not leaving out plot points that were quite important in the books was clearly one of them."
"chantal-ashford","8","16","48","21 November 2014"," Mockingjay Pt. 1 has a slow start, but delivers.
","For someone, who has read the series and just reread this novel, I have fell in love with this film. Yes, I was having my WTF moments throughout the film, but this is what happens when you're a fan of the books and deal with what is given to you on screen. <br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT, if you haven't read.*<br/><br/>We're being brought to Katniss and being in District 13 ( the district that was ""destroyed). She's dealing with PTSD, not having Peeta at her side, District 12 being destroyed while dealing with President Coin of 13 with wanting her to be their Mockingjay to bring the districts into this rebellion against the Capitol. <br/><br/>With the film running 123 minutes ( and being the shortest than the first two), Francis Lawrence does what he can to give the viewers what they want until the very end, and when you get to the end, someone in the audience will have an ""Oh Sh*t"" moment. Someone will, I bet you. <br/><br/>The film did move a little slow, but when it starts to get good, it's where it all ends. This is how they hook us in and have us coming back to waiting more. In my eyes, it shouldn't have been done in two films, but with Hollywood: it's all about money. <br/><br/>Lawrence is amazing as always as Katniss Everdeen. She makes you feel what she is going through and what her district went through because of her actions. The scene was brutal and emotional, but it's what's needed. <br/><br/>The one, who definitely stood out in this film was Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark. Even though, he was throughout the film here and there, it was at the very end is where nothing is expecting, but it is. He shows a different side in Peeta, and it's not pretty. Yes, there was a little bit of help with CGI and all (they did the same thing to him as they did to Kristen Stewart in Breaking Dawn Pt. 1). He was amazing, and you wanted to cry whenever he would come up on screen. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of the series & the movies, Mockingjay Pt. 1 does not let you down. It will leave you wanting more and not waiting a year for it."

The war has begun, the rebellion has started, the fire is ignited, the Mockingjay lives. Katniss Everdeen, the girl from District 12 survives the arena, unbeknowest to the Capitol and President Snow. Now she must fight and fight she must. But all is still not right. She now has to rescue the one she loves and he is being held captive and tortured by Snow and used as a weapon to get the rebels to cease fire and relinquish their rights as rightful citizens of Panem, according to President Snow. This movie defied all odds. Since 2012, our eyes were opened to the girl from District 12, and then she caught fire and now she is the rebel leader who will bring down the Capitol and their wicked ways. I was one of the select few who saw this movie as part of a marathon leading up to this movie. I was stunned and floored. Nothing will ever compare to this movie. The song that leads this movie is a perfect match to spark that yellow flicker beat. The cast and the crew – you were heartbreakingly incredible – Jennifer Lawrence, you stun us every time you grace the screen; Josh Hutcherson, you gave the best performance to date – Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore – you are my favorite, but the prize would have to go to the game-maker on this one, Phillip Seymour Hoffman – you are the definition of the cinema, you have given your best performances from Capote to The Talented Mr. Ripley to Doubt to Catching through Mockingjay, Part 2 – this is one is for you. Thank you Suzanne Collins for allowing us to dive in to your world of this Utopian universe. You have given us something to believe in and this ourselves and to spark that flame in our hearts.

","Now the first hunger games was good and looked promising and I would give at least a 7.5/10 but then catching fire came out which was good but clearly not as good as the first one which shows the hunger games has been declining in decency since the first film. Anyway this film! Is dull the action is unsubstantial and lacks real fast paced stuff it feels as if they gave up halfway through making this film as it had the opportunity to be great but was instead wasted. I also feel the imagination of the directors and like have not been good also I felt there was some very bad acting going on and the film felt cheesy. I feel there is no coming back from this and that part 2 will be same lump of dullness with a side order of cheese. I'll be sticking with the divergent series thank you."
"anthonydcase","8","15","45","23 November 2014"," Great Movie, For What It Is
","OK, let me start by saying that if you go into this movie thinking ""Ugh, this is stupid. Why are they splitting it into two movies?"" You aren't going to enjoy this movie no matter how good it is. That being said, I was disappointed that they split the movie. I knew it was a ploy to get money, but I figured that I might as well try and enjoy it. After all, Deathly Hollow was pretty good, so why shouldn't this one be? When I got to the theater, I was shocked at how good the movie was. The camera-work was brilliant. Every frame was beautiful. The acting was absolutely superb. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) proved her acting chops in the first five minutes. Francis Lawrence obviously wanted to make up for the studios decision and had everyone step up their game. Even Josh Hucherson (who, let's be honest, is the weakest actor in the bunch) nailed it. That being said, not much happens in this movie. There are a few scenes (the propo scenes, the water dam scene, the last 15 minutes) where action takes place and it is brilliantly done. But most of the movie is politics and character development. If you are in the theater for an action movie, you're gonna be disappointed. I don't think this movie deserves the backlash it is getting. Get angry at the studio, if you must, but don't take it out on the movie itself."

","I just came back from the theater and my mind is blown. I am a fan of the HG books. I have always loved the political side of HG, the revolution, how an entire nation finally says NO and stands up for itself, like V in V for Vendetta says: ""People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people."" That is the entire message of the HG trilogy for me. And this movie nailed it. I dare to say they give a more powerful message than the one given in the book. It is more clear, more intense, and I loved it. The movie was excellent.The performances were incredible. I always loved The Hanging Tree and the way Jennifer sang it was beautiful. There are a lot of powerful moments that are well balanced with comic reliefs. There isn't much more to say except either if you have read the book, or haven't, go see it, you won't be disappointed."
"farfarskalsonger","8","13","38","29 November 2014"," Those who say it's ""too slow"" are way below this film
","Reading the generally bad reviews here makes me so frustrated. People complain about a lack of action; really? I think it's sad that a movie has to consist solely of explosions and gun fire in order to work for a wide audience.<br/><br/>The first two movies of the hunger games series were okay, but this one takes the tale to a whole new level. It has a depth to it its predecessors lacked entirely. It's about the construction of a rebellion. Most positive reviews describe this film as a ""warm up for part 2, the real deal"". No, no, no. Part 2 will have all the action, yes, but this one has the >thought<. It deals with thoughts few films targeting young people ever do, and it does so reasonably well. I'm not saying this is a perfect film - not by far. There are tons of things to complain about, for starters the enforced teen romance bullshit. But gash, please don't complain about it being slow. If so, i guess it's just a bit too intelligent and deep for you.<br/><br/>And finally, i really have to take a stand for Lawrence. I think she does a beautiful portrayal of the deeply psychologically wounded Katniss."
"Jolien_Goedleven","8","13","38","26 November 2014"," Best out of 3 so far.
","The Hunger Games felt like a warm-up run towards this one. The concept of the Games is epic, yes quite. Killing until one remains the stage. I loved watching it. Struggling to survive. Struggling to live, to love, to become and to be. If you're watching for the end battle, you're still a movie too soon. Like Harry Potter: Deadly Hollows pt. 1, they're preparing for battle. For the ultimate fight against the bad guy. They don't rush into it. Little side stories develop and get their own time.<br/><br/>Mockingjay is the best one made so far. Here's why: I believe I needed more. I needed a story behind it all. I needed a reason for Katniss to come back. And they gave me that. They gave me a Mockingjay. It doesn't bore. In the beginning of Catching Fire, it took quite some time until something truly interesting happened. Something relevant to the story. In Mockingjay, from moment one, Katniss' in the picture after doing the impossible: surviving two Hunger Games. She struggles with e-v-e-r-y s- i-n-g-l-e following moment. She can't be the Mockingjay, she falls on her knees when she sees her home District destroyed, she feels like she can't help anyone, like she can't even get herself back together. And still. She becomes the messiah. Following behind the scenes of some propaganda clips. Quite interesting.<br/><br/>The ending I felt to be a bit weird though. Why would Peeta be struggling on the bed when he's conditioned to hate and want to kill Katniss? They could have stopped after Beetee's explanation of Peeta's condition. They should have. It was clear enough. But I get somehow, you want the Mockingjay herself as final shot. I get that.<br/><br/>I missed Haymitch in this one. They focus all the scenes on Katniss. About her trauma, struggle and trying to fight back.<br/><br/>Catching Fire was, besides a run-up for the rebellion, a good action movie. Don't expect that from Mockingjay. I get that if you like the Hunger Games on a surface level, you can better wait for Mockingjay Pt. 2 to come out. But please people. Don't give me that nothing happens in this one. You just need to see behind the overall picture. You need to see Katniss' struggle. Her fight. You need to see President Coin's hope when she finally sees what Katniss's capable of. Her envy for Katniss and her sorrow. You need to see what they're all going through and went through. Please, look behind all the action and specific events going on. Mockingjay is so much more than blowing up a bridge or rescuing Peeta."
"quethuduong","9","16","49","22 November 2014"," Very good
","I don't understand why this movie received so many negative reviews. I have read the book and although I agree that Mockingjay shouldn't have been split into 2 movies, this part 1 is still very good. The story line is quite close to the book, plus good visual effects and great acting (Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson definitely nailed it in my opinion). There were some scenes that were very bitter and made me feel like breaking down. After watching the movie I just kept thinking about how dark it is and couldn't get the the image of Peeta out of my head. A lot of emotions indeed, and of course, can't wait until part 2 is released!"
"szelenas","9","15","46","24 November 2014"," I get people why don't like this movie
","I've read the book, i know what is going happen and it was perfectly adapted into this film. People expected to see some good civil war action but that is not the story. It's about the back story of a civil war. Katniss isn't a front-line soldier to fight with her bow's blazing. She is a girl, she got pushed around by politicians, she doesn't want to a part of any of this. The acting is very good, specially Lawrence, Sutherland and Harrelson. Peeta is still annoying, just like in the other movies. The book was written by a women where a girl is main character and written in first person. Of course there is a love triangle. It was bad in the novel, bad in the movie. But it is good political thriller, very different from the previous film, excited to see the next."
"terrellrobinson71","8","15","46","21 November 2014"," The Mockingjay Lives
","In the very beginning of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1"", 17-year-old Katniss Everdeen has been through a hell of a lot. She went through two Hunger Games, her love Peeta has been taken by the Capitol and as witnessed later, she sees that her home District 12 has been destroyed by no other than the sinisterly wicked President Coriolanus Snow who has kidnapped and brainwashed poor Peeta in order to call off the radical rebellion that's happening against the dystopian world of Panem and to get rid of the cause known as the Mockingjay. So far, it totally seems that we're closer to the end of an amazing series. The tone gets very dark, the political ideas and serious themes are more thought-provoking and it's surprisingly different from the previous two. Gone are the stunning arenas and colorfully bold costumes and it adds in a more darker (or gray-ish) palette and a few key elements that makes the first part of the third and final book of Suzanne Collins' marvelous trilogy a gripping and strong, if not better, addition in the series. The always wonderful Oscar-winning Jennifer Lawrence takes Katniss to new heights. She's broken, haunted, tormented by nightmares and still suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. She's confined in an underground bunker known as District 13, run by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore in a solid performance). Coin is unsure about Katniss, seeing that she is still suffering after the events in the Third Quarter Quell in ""Catching Fire"". Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles) insists that she still has to be the Mockingjay. It's a simple logic: Show the rebellion that she is still standing and fighting until the end by filming propaganda (or ""propos"") videos. Take the scene in District 8, after a airstrike sent by Snow (Donald Sutherland), she speaks from the heart knowing that the rebels won't surrender that easy after that event. Still, Katniss is ripped apart by many things. She still cares for Gale (the incredible Liam Hemsworth) who's ready for the revolution to happen, but her heart belongs to Peeta (a heart wrenching and soulful Josh Hutcherson), as mentioned that he is the Capitol's puppet or just saving Katniss from devastation. But she is saved by her mom (Paula Malcomson) and her sister, Prim (the adorable Willow Shields). Also joining in the ranks are another broken victor Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Katniss' mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) who is now sober and still very helpful, Cressida (a wickedly cool Natalie Dormer from ""The Tudors"" and ""Game of Thrones""), a filmmaker trying to capture as much as she can with Katniss in the middle of all this along with her camera crew, a wheelchair-bound Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) who communicates with transporting video signals and crashing it through the Capitol and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a smart deviation from the book, who does not like being in a world full of gray jumpsuits but comes around eventually. Taking apart the final book in a series and turning it into two movies doesn't really seem necessary (it worked out before with ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight""), but returning director Francis Lawrence of ""Catching Fire"" and screenwriters Danny Strong (""The Butler"", ""Game Change"") and Peter Craig (""The Town"") with adaptation by Suzanne Collins herself manages to keep the film moving at a slow but breakneck pace to give us some deep insights in the world of Panem, expands its scope a bit more, and getting us really connected and involved with the world while staying true to Collins's book and changing and fixing some of the weaknesses of the book. There's not much action this time around (there's only two big set pieces), but it's deeply rooted in the story and characters and the human drama behind it works its way though our minds. And again, the movie and this franchise wouldn't work if it weren't for Jennifer Lawrence. She makes Katniss a wounded, vulnerable, but strong and charismatic heroine that's joining in the ranks of strong females such as Lisbeth Salander and Hermione Granger. In a surprisingly sweet moment, she belts out a signature moment from the book, ""The Hanging Tree"", a bluegrass-type of song. When she sings, we immediately feel it and we see that she becomes a beacon of hope for the rebellion. I know it's only one half of a movie but it's only half good when it ends with a thrilling climax involving a rescue mission and a striking cliffhanger that leads our way into the finale. What will the final film bring to the table? I don't know. But if you're thinking with a groan or a relieved sigh for next year, make sure your homework is prepared and you got enough information so that you won't be lost in the system. Since it's the calm before the storm, ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" may not have a whole lot to take it all in, but it refuses to back down and stands up for the revolution and the power of changing the world one day at a time."

What a day it was to see this film!! <br/><br/>I've been a fan of these movies because they embody for me the same cause and ideas that revolutions in my country have stood for. I bet the many fans of this film (who are just obsessed with the love triangle) are not aware of how realistic and relevant it is to events happening in Egypt, and in other corrupted political systems around the world.<br/><br/>I will NOT try to refute all the reviews that deemed this film as 'BORING'. I understand their argument, but this film is an indispensable emotional transition between a story about a brutal reality show, to a story about a freaking revolution!! And if you see it that way, it won't be boring!! <br/><br/>The military corruption and spirit of rebellion captured in the film, is something all Egyptians like me have lived through. The whole cast rendered this spirit beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence, I was so happy that she pulled off that rage that makes the audience hate brutal regimes (The Capital) as much as Katniss does. Josh Hutcherson gave a powerful heart-breaking performance that reminds me of all the brainwashed people we have in Egyptian media. And last but not least, Mr. Sutherland successfully portrayed our previous AND CURRENT presidents who just enslave their people. Thank you Donald!! <br/><br/>I know I'm hailing the film as great because I can relate to its political context. But even if the film is not actually great, it has redefined the YA genre with the importance of its message, which redeems ALL its flaws for me. Knowing that there are people out there, especially teenagers, who will connect with this film and understand how tyrannical systems work, makes me hopeful about the future leaders of this world.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the FIGHT to start in Part 2as well as the THIRD revolution in my country!!!"

This movie does it's job well as a teaser, it creates great hype for 4th movie and that's it. It has no rewatchability value, watching it second time would be torture since you know that nothing happens. Basicly, this is a threatical release of 2h teaser.

I did like seeing some of the propaganda that comes along with the war not just all of the bullets and bombs. But overall I was pretty bored with the whole movie and didn't find myself caring but these characters anymore."
"Troy_Campbell","6","8","21","22 November 2014"," Not as good as the first two, but still decent.
","As has become normal with Hollywood franchises adapted from a book series, the final Hunger Games novel has been split into two movies, thus the first half of Mockingjay has to deal with the usual pitfalls of part-one-itis. Considering their YA roots, the previous cinematic incarnations had wowed due to their success in delivering exhilarating action alongside, rather than in place of, narrative smarts and maturity. Unfortunately, with the bulk of the action seemingly saved for the second entry (out next November), Mockingjay Part 1 is all work and no play, making it slightly dull compared to the excellent pair of films it has followed. It's also tonally darker and dramatically heavier, with the story venturing into super- serious territory and focussing on themes of death, loss and guilt. Returning director Francis Lawrence has a firm grip on this world though and, together with cinematographer Jo Willems, continues to craft an interesting look and feel to PanAm – both the gloriously pompous Capitol and the grubby, downtrodden districts aligning for an uprising. The whole cast is exceptional yet again: Jennifer Lawrence is a force to be reckoned with as the fiery Katniss, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore bring their usual gravitas as high- ranking members of the rebellion, Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson draw out some humour among the grimness, and Josh Hutcherson makes the most of his relatively limited screen time as Capitol puppet Peeta. There's just not enough pulse-rising adventure to elevate this to the high standards already established in the series, an especially disappointing flaw when taking into account some of the awesome set pieces concocted in the preceding instalments. It's a shame it can't truly excel as its own movie, however Mockingjay Part 1 is still a solid flick that succeeds in tiding over fans until the big finale next year."
"briancham1994","Null","1","1","3 June 2020"," Stretched out
","The Mockingjay book did not need to be split into two parts. It was already quite dull and empty, to be honest. This film suffers from the consequences of this decision because it is so stretched out and feels so empty. The tone of the story is a departure from the rest of the series as it focuses more on the political intrigue than the actual games, which helps to keep things fresh but it can also feel a bit dry."

","A week ago I loaded up the the first movie not expecting much, but was yanked into an interesting world. I am disappointed whenever I enjoy a movie and then I see it crapped on in the reviews of the users of this sight. Part of that may be the unfair vendetta against adaptations of popular books to film. In this case I have no basis to compare it to so my analysis is of the film alone.
Overall I think this is a good movie. I do not think I held up to the first two movies in the series that I have only recently watched. An I coming from the perspective of not watching the final installment.
I would like to start with the bad:
The main problem of the film is the ending, mainly stemming from the fact that it is an incomplete story split into two parts. Which is a common scheme of studios to maximize profits, but the studio can not take away all the good the talented people who work on films do that make many great elements.
The main problems with the end is the trap set by President Snow. From the time the rebel forces entered the building it was obviously a trap, and I think that it is a weak story mode from the President to let the team return with the victors, just for the chance of Peeta under the influence of some science fiction thing to kill Kantniss. (Though I think there may be room to redeem this element in the final installment).
Though the good thing is these are the only large issues with movie, but an ending to a movie is one of most important elements and can bring the movie down quite a bit.
Though it did do the same things the previous movie did well. Well acted. Great design. Good story. Well paced.
The main thing of all three movies as been the realism of a totalitarian government that is oppressive and suppressive of information.
Specifically this movie displays the start of a civil war and the unavoidable reality of destruction on both sides. It also displays propaganda on both sides.
I think that it has been a solid display of a love triangle, but I think I will wait until the next movie to make a final verdict.
Overall good movie, and I will watch the next one, which is a positive, the movie left me still wanting more."

","Katniss is now in District 13 where she is finding life increasingly difficult. The Rebel leaders want her to step up as the 'face' of the Rebellion - the 'Mockingjay' that the people of Panem have seen arena, but she is not in any mental condition to agree to this wish. In addition, the Capitol have now used Peeta in Propaganda media to tell the Rebels to lay down their arms. Katniss is suffering from PTSD and is confused. She refuses to play the 'Mockingjay' but Plutarch suggests that she be shown the ruins of her old District - 12 - during which Gale recounts what happened after the events in the arena - and the thousands that died in the firebombing. She reluctantly changes her mind and has a 'Propo' Team assigned to capture media shots for propaganda use. As the Districts flare up in open rebellion, Katniss goes to District 8, where she witnesses the effect she has on the people fighting - also the ruthlessness of Snow. Katniss also worries that, if Peeta does not succeed in bringing the rebels to the table, he will be executed, so forces the Rebel President - Alma Coin - to attempt a rescue of Peeta and the other remaining Victors held in the Capitol...
Of all the Films in this series, 'Mockingjay - Part 1' is consistently the one least liked - some people were critical of a 'Cash Grab' by the studio and of splitting the final Book into two Films. Having watched these many times, I have been a little perplexed as to how some people view them. Too many got caught up in the 'Games Arena' aspect of the first two and really just wanted a nice little simple jog to the finish with lots of explosions and action. But the author deliberately moved away from the 'Games' for the finale of the series.
I am very pleased that the filmmakers DIDN'T do this. Why? Firstly, 'Mockingjay' as a SINGLE Film would have been over 4 hours long - if cut, it would have lost all of the subtle character-driven scenes that make this story so gripping. But I believe that would have been a mistake. This entire story is about WAR - loss, sacrifice, trauma, death - the price of Rebellion. It is as well that 'Mockingjay - Part 1' IS a standalone film as it is the most gloomy, melancholy and devastating film of the series. It pulls no punches. It's 'Hero' - Katniss - begins the Film suffering a nervous breakdown (no 'superhero' nonsense here) and, subsequently, goes to see what has been done to District 12. She views the rubble and the blackened corpses in horror, collapsing to her knees as Gale tells her how he tried to save as many as he could from the capitol's firebombs. She returns to tell the Rebel Leader - Alma Coin - she will be the 'Mockingjay'. The scenes in District 8, where she visits the Field Hospital, are bloody and realistic. Bodies lying in corridors, badly wounded being treated on floors with rudimentary medical supplies and the stares of people suffering from the trauma of war. It is also where she is recognised. It is a lovely scene as slowly the whole room realise she is there....it is also where Katniss begins to recognise what she is to the Rebellion - Hope - a figure that took on the Capitol - and won. The stunned look on Lawrence's face is perfect - at last she is coming to terms with her role in all of this. She may never have wanted 'any of this' but she is now so deeply part of the Rebellion she cannot go back. Unfortunately, Snow knows she is there and despatches bombers - ordering them to target the Hospital. Katniss watches as the Hospital is utterly destroyed and, in rage, she and Gale, rush to a rooftop where the two Hovercraft are hit by them as they pass on a firing on - and crash in flames. Again, there are no punches pulled - Katniss - still enraged - shouts to Snow via her 'propo' Team ""If we burn, you burn with us"".
Later, while out with her 'Team', she stops in a quarry and is asked to sing. The melancholy song she chooses - 'The Hanging Tree' - sums up everything she feels. As she sings the scene cuts to a desperate 'human wave' attack by the people of District 7, trying to place explosives to destroy the Capitol's hydro-dams, source of power for the Capitol. Unarmed and simply absorbing bullets with flesh, the scene is simply stunning - no childish happy endings, no bullet-proof suits - just death for ordinary people. THIS is what it means to Rebel and fight oppression - and once again, 'Mockingjay' does this unflinchingly. It's depiction of a savage war, even though aimed at young adults, is extremely well done.
Meanwhile the Capitol continues to use Peeta to send messages to the Rebels - Katniss knows it is only a matter of time before Peeta is killed. Some have said that the 'romance' between the two is not realistic - but I differ from that. Katniss did NOT love Peeta immediately but gets to love him through the dreadful series of events they are forced to go through.
With the attacks on the Dams successful and with the power out, Coin sends a Team in by Hovercraft to retrieve Peeta and the others. Gale volunteers to go. It all seems far too easy as the Team penetrates the building and gets Peeta out. However, as they return the power comes back up - but they are not engaged and are allowed to return safely. Katniss is informed of the rescue but it is plain later as to why they were allowed to escape - Peeta has been completely 'brainwashed' by the Capitol - they have focussed all of his anger on Katniss and, when he sees her, he tries immediately to kill her. Katniss is only saved by the rifle butt of Boggs, the Rebel commander. The Film ends with Katniss, hardly able to speak and in a neck-brace looking with horror through a window at Peeta - who has had to be restrained as he is going berserk.
Firstly, the performance of Jennifer Lawrence is amazing - she carries this Film on her shoulders and does a fabulous job of portraying the tumult of emotions that the central character is going through. Likewise, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta has to step up in the acting stakes as his Character is also slowly being ripped apart and he does a great job of showing this disintegration.
At this point I should mention the superbly understated music by James Newton Howard. It is a very emotional score, the centrepiece of which is 'The Hanging Tree', which begins with just Lawrence's solo voice but slowly builds to a massive crescendo during the Dams attack.
Both Mockingjay - Part 1 and Part 2' - were shot at the same time. The second and concluding Part has a slightly different feel to it - Katniss is more mature, worldly-wise and even cynical.
Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be everyone's idea of a good time - it is an extremely dark Film in a series that needed to show the consequences of what happened in the first two Films. It is this Film which actually sets it apart from the other 'Young Adult' Film series that were released - none are as dark as this. Serious themes run all through the 'Hunger Games' series but never have these been more apparent than in this Film.
In a strange example of life imitating Art, some showings of 'Mockingjay - Part 1' were cancelled in Thailand when protestors began using the Rebels 'Three finger salute' when demonstrating against its Military Government!!
'Mockingjay - Part 2' will conclude the 'Hunger Games' story - in a melancholy and bittersweet way."

One of my main gripes is the character of Gale Hawthorne. The actor who plays him cannot act to save his life, his character is completely anachronistic and his character development is absolutely ludicrous, from poor, simple coalface miner to some kind of crack top elite forces leader of troops is so unreal and utterly unbelieveable. The character is so out of place it is as though someone else wrote his script and dropped his character in from afar.

-""The Hanging Tree"" Scene

-Katniss reuniting with Peeta
And yeah that's about it. You can sum up the whole plot of this movie in one sentence: Katniss lays low underground in District 13 while producing propaganda and fighting for Peeta's return. That's about it. There isn't really a plot. The cinematography is meh, just a lot of shots of underground bunkers. James Newton Howard's music is always nice. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson always kill it. However, splitting the last book into 2 movies was not a good move. First of all, the book wasn't even that good. I barely got through it, and I was a huge fan of the series. It's just boring. A political snooze fest. The whole film and most of the book is just sitting and talking.<br/><br/>I'm being honest. If you skipped this movie and went right to Part 2 you wouldn't be lost at all.

It's not a bad movie, it's just not a complete movie."
"zkonedog","4","1","1","4 March 2017"," Just Like The Book; The Weakest Of The Bunch
","Back a year or so ago when I was reading the Hunger Games books, I considered ""Mockingjay"" to be the weakest of the trilogy...and it wasn't even really close (IMHO). I was hoping that this film version (much like how I though the ""Catching Fire"" movie was actually better than its piece of literature) would ignite more of a spark with me. As evidenced by the three-star rating, it did not. ""Mockingjay Part One"" is not a bad movie, but it just happens to be based on the weakest book in the series.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) having been yanked from the Quarter Quell. She is now in the mysterious District Thirteen, where President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) is the leader of a rebellion aimed at overthrowing President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol by uniting all the districts. In order to do this, Coin needs Katniss to relent to be the Mockingjay, or a powerful symbol of the rebellion. The problem? Katniss is more interested in reuniting with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is now a pawn in Snow's counter-scheme (but is he WILLING pawn, that is the big question). After consulting with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Katniss decides to take up the mantle. Of course, she cannot possibly imagine the consequences this decision may have on her future.<br/><br/>Like I said, this isn't a terrible film. Director Francis Lawrence knows how to direct this series, and he understands how to get the most out of the material. The problem in this case IS the material. More specifically, the character of Katniss. In previous films/books, Katniss is the strong, central hero around which the entire plot revolves. In ""Mockingjay"", though, I felt like the source material takes great leaps/liberties with her character to suit the story. For example, in previous material she can't stand the ""pomp and circumstance"" surrounding her costumes and status. In this one, she immediately falls in love with her mockingjay costume and quickly steps forward as a figurehead. I know this is all supposed to be driven by her mad love for Peeta, but was that relationship really developed enough to truly make it seem believable?<br/><br/>Part of my ""problem"" with this film too, though, could be that I am a male adult. I am not the target (i.e. young adult) audience. The material of the Hunger Games is meant to suck in teen and young adult readers, first and foremost, with the ""big ideas"" appealing more broadly. By the time ""Mockingjay"" came around, however, the big ideas are running out, which means the love- triangle focus must narrow. So, a lot of it depends on how much you can ""buy in"" to the teen romance.<br/><br/>Overall, this is more of an ""incomplete"" grade than anything. I fully expect the second part to be much, much better once the action can really progress to its conclusion. But I can't give the studios a pass on their money-grab either. This movie did not NEED to be split into two parts, but was only done so to extend the hype surrounding the franchise."
"garcalej","6","7","18","30 November 2014"," A good set-up to the impending action.
","I will admit, I was one among the many of the skeptics who, upon hearing that the third installment of the trilogy had been split into two multiplex sized chunks, heard the tell-tale ka-ching of the cash register going off in my head. It is not an unwarranted fear; there have been prior offenders, Peter Jackson and David Yates coming directly to mind. The same charge could have been leveled at Francis Lawrence had he wasted all the extra sand in his hourglass on maudlin handholding scenes shamelessly geared toward the film's core young female demographic. <br/><br/>As it happens, there is indeed plenty of maudlin to go around in Mockinjay, Part 1, though nothing that left as bad a taste as those five surreal minutes Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson spent alone in that tent dancing awkwardly to music six decades their senior. That said, there are also just enough scenes to redeem the movie and perhaps even justify the extra hour and half of story, which veers uninhibitedly towards its dystopian roots. We find Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, who has expanded her repertoire from glowering teenager to shivering, emotional wreck) recently rescued from the wreckage of the Quarter Quell to serve Panem's revolution, which in spite of whatever Gill Scott-Heron once said will almost certainly be televised, and with Katniss front and center. Propaganda and its malfeasant uses, after all, are sort of the main underlying themes of Suzanne Collin's books. In the first two installments, we followed in the footsteps of Katniss and fellow tribute Peeta Malark (Josh Hutcherson), as they were trotted out as show ponies in the Capitol's increasingly desperate attempts to control the masses under their boot heel. Mockingjay finds Katniss handed off to the other team like a football and treated with much the same callow disregard for her underlying humanity. One can forgive Lawrence's character for not noticing; she spends much of the film in what appears to be a permanent state of shell-shock, albeit mostly over the fate of Peeta rather than the horrific genocide of most of her friends and neighbors, which lets face it, starts to get grating rather quickly, especially as the bodies begin to pile up around her fashionably sensible boots.<br/><br/>The emotional claustrophobia is enhanced by the fact that much of the film takes place underground and centers around the propaganda war that has taken nearly as much importance as the actual fighting. Such a story you'd think would set the stage for some spectacular outbursts and tension between Katniss and her new handlers, but instead Lawrence seems content to sleepwalk through the usual motions and pine after her former teammate. <br/><br/>Thankfully, there are points in the film when she and her camera crew are forced to go outside and witness the horrors full hand, and it is in these moments that the story goes from being typical opera to becoming dangerously relevant. In Collin's dyspeptic worldview, the sickening realities of the modern battlefield become yet another theatre production, though whereas the Capitol used our instinct for bloody voyeurism to keep us entertained and compliant, District 13 uses it much the same way Syrian insurgents use YouTube to whip up their supporters and with much the same outcome. The rebels, far from following the heroic cliché of the peasant soldier throwing off an oppressor, quickly become objects of pity in their all-too-willingness to throw themselves lemming-like at forces far better armed simply after watching one of Katniss' videotaped tirades. <br/><br/>The film is good in that sense, but there are still plenty of things that keep it from being really good or great. Despite two installments in which to grow his character, Gale (played by Liam Hemsworth) has not yet progressed beyond having the personality of an AXE commercial, and Josh Hutchison does little better as Peeta, though his character's woodiness can be subscribed too having been held at gunpoint for most of the film. Many of the series' veterans, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Jeffrey Wright, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, retain a respectable but subdued screen presence. They are joined by Julianne Moore playing President Coin, who doesn't quite ooze the same villainy as Donald Sutherland's President Snow (or much of anything else for that matter), though this could simply be because she has yet to take off her mask. For now, she's resigned to holding daily pep rallies and uttering such messianic phrases as ""democracy"" and ""sharing the fruits of our labor"" in front of a giant screen, all the while sitting atop a stockpile of missiles, bullets, and thousands of fighting age youths who all dress in the same olive-gray jumpsuits.<br/><br/>Should get interesting, but for now, the film leaves us waiting patiently in the bunker for the real showdown to begin."

","Big fan of the franchise, but this movie is a classic example of when splitting a movie into two parts does not add anything to the story, and just is an attempt to make more money. The lack of action in the movie was very saddening and it felt like a very long preview for Part 2. I am sure Part 2 will be awesome now, since all the action will happen, but I think this movie could have easily been 30 minutes long. The acting also just felt awkward for the first half of the movie, and it often felt like more should be happening. The reactions of the characters just felt bland and unrealistic. <br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoy the movie. You could really connect with a lot of what was going on and when there actually was action scenes, they were awesome."

","Coming off one of the greatest sequels ever made it was going to be hard to wow us as much as Catching Fire did. With that being said Mockingjay Part 1 succeeds in a lot of areas. Sure many people will get bored or try and compare it to the previous installments. But the key here is that this film is very different. Don't expect to see any Hunger Games, because it's all about the rebellion. And there is quite a build up involved with part 1. I thought even though it's not entirely necessary to split the movie in two parts, I can see where it may pay off once we see the final film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is golden once again as Panem's symbol of hope and rebellion. She always brings her A game but she is given even more to do in this film. Her ability to showcase every type of emotion and make it feel real to us is incredible. I will say I could have cared less for either Peeta or Gale in the first two films, but Lawrence finally sold me on the relationship between those characters. Several times throughout the film I found my heart pounding and on the edge of my seat. Much credit goes to Francis Lawrence for solidifying this franchise as one of the most intense in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Much of what makes this franchise so great is the cast. And everyone gives a great performance. Donald Sutherland gives another chilling performance. While Harrelson, Tucci, Hoffman, Banks, and even newcomers Moore and Ali are great. All of them have their fair share of memorable scenes and that will only get better in the next film.<br/><br/>I didn't find some of the propaganda bits to work as well as they should have. With that being said, when they nail it they nail it. Back at district 8 was one of the most emotional scenes of the film, and every aspect of scene was perfect. Even Liam Hemsworth was great. I found it hard to pick apart things about the film I didn't like. It's a slow burn for sure, but like I said there are some incredible scenes in Mockingjay. I really do think when we see the final product it will all go better as one.<br/><br/>The ending was meticulously directed. Peeta's rescue scene was among some of the most intense filmmaking I have seen all year. It even reminded me a little bit of dare I say Zero Dark Thirty in that I honestly felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and hitting the person in front of me. It's hard to do that in a film. I actually had goosebumps 3 different times. I'm not even a die hard Hunger Games fan either. I can just appreciate great filmmaking. Again, I understand people's complaints right now, I just think it will pay off next November. I will say I hope to see much more of Natalie Dormer and Jena Malone in part 2. We didn't get to see much of Malone and Dormer was one of the best parts of part 1.

","Having been shockingly rescued from the Hunger Games at the end of film 2, Katniss finds herself pressed into service as the Mockingjay, the figurehead of the growing rebellion against President Snow's repressive dictatorship. But Snow still holds Peeta prisoner, and Peeta is doing the same PR job for Snow as Katniss is for the Rebellion. Meanwhile, Snow continues to order genocidal military strikes as he deems necessary.<br/><br/>The final book in the trilogy is divided in two, as seems to be the current fashion, and this is the first part. Despite only having a 12A certificate in the UK, it is much stronger in content than the previous two films, and it ends with a truly shocking and disturbing image (not that the scenes of the war crimes sites aren't fairly disturbing). There is relatively little action, but what there is is very well staged.<br/><br/>This film is much, much darker than the first two episodes, which leaned quite strongly towards adventure. Part 3 is grittier and more political, and shows how lucky the producers were to get Jennifer Lawrence before other roles catapulted her up the ladder: she, like Katniss, is a Girl On Fire in this. Donald Sutherland is - if it were possible - even more reptilian than he was in part 2. And Philip Seymour Hoffman's small amount of time in this, his last film, shows how good he was.<br/><br/>A good part 3, and I am now looking forward to the final part."
"YJLcool","7","8","22","25 November 2014"," Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel like a complete movie and fails to reach the heights of its predecessors
","After the huge success of two Hunger Games movies, it was announced that Mockingjay would be split in two parts. The film picks up after the events of Catching Fire, where the story continued with Katniss, our reluctant heroine from District 12 finally becomes the titular head of a growing rebellion against the Capitol through a series of propaganda videos. This time, the film is lesser on the action, explosions or heavy violence and chooses to focus on being a political drama that takes the themes of war and revolution to the next level instead.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games has always been a character-driven story filled with meaningful themes by exploring real-world issues about rebellion, politics, conflicts, war, survival that ultimately stands out among the other Young Adult franchises. Katniss' several acts of defiance against the fascist Capitol government during the Hunger Games in the first two films have finally fan the flames of rebellion among the districts of Panem to take back their nation. While the country is on the verge of war, Katniss must also try to find a way to rescue Peeta and the rest of the tributes, who have been taken hostages, tortured and imprisoned by the Capitol.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, the franchise has done a great job in showing us that Katniss is truly the Mockingjay - the symbol of hope and rebellion in Panem. The books are written in Katniss' point of view, but the movies have made the effort of showing us other events largely unseen by her to allow us to gain a better understanding of the events that are happening in the film, such as the political meetings or discussions of President Snow or the control room of the games in past films. Mockingjay Part 1 takes time to give us a closer look at the beginnings of war by showing us some details about the uprisings that are taking place in other districts. From the brutal public executions, aerial bombing of cities and threatening speeches by President Snow himself, people are suffering and dying. The film also shows how easily people can be manipulated by media, by showing us that the people of Panem (Capitol and all the other districts) are easily influenced by what they see and hear, especially on TV. However, the ways the Capitol uses media to control all of Panem, it also shows that the rebels can use the same strategy to fight back as well. Both sides is using propaganda as a form of psychological warfare.<br/><br/>The film essentially tries to tell the audience that there are no perfect governments or political systems. Political ideologies always fail in reality because of the greed of men who only seek wealth or power. In Mockingjay Part 1, we see how Katniss is being used by the rebel leaders to fight the war. There's even one particular scene where Peeta asks Katniss whether she truly knows the people she's working for, letting us in doubt whether the rebels of District 13 are fighting for the right cause or it's just another Capitol in the making. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence pulls another strong performance as Katniss as she's the one who gets the most character development in this film. With Peeta captured by the Capitol for the entire film, Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time for his character, Gale after being left out of the story in the first two films. The film also introduces new characters, especially District 13's rebel leader, President Coin who will soon becomes one of the antagonist that Katniss need to face in Part 2. Elizabeth Banks' character, Effie serves as comic relief this time around, but her character also shows that not all people in the Capitol are vain and oppressive as we think they are.<br/><br/>However, Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel like a complete movie and fails to reach the heights of its predecessors. It's the first half of the final book adapted to film, which doesn't really provide any conclusions, it doesn't feel like it has a self-contained plot as none of the character arcs are fully resolved. The film keeps on setting the necessary pieces for the final epic showdown between the districts and Capitol but there's nothing significant happening throughout the film as all the relevant plot twists, the actual fight is in part 2. The film spends most of its time to show us the beginnings of war but couldn't provide further details on why the rebels in District 13 have so many resources and doesn't look malnourished compared with people from other districts. In my opinion, it felt unnecessary to split the final chapter into two parts as many of the scenes actually hurts the pace of the movie. It could be a far better film with a run time of probably 3 hours or so. We are all excited for the story's conclusion and yet we were asked to be patient and wait for next year's Part 2 instead. As the credits roll, I find myself leaving the cinema asking, that's it?<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-hunger-games- mockingjay.html"

She's not even sure if she can be, but when Peeta(Hutcherson, clearly abused, broken) appears on TV, calling for a ceasefire, she realizes if they win, he will likely be executed as a traitor. In exchange for his safety and rescue, she does agree – and has to convince the thousands of civilians in Panem to rise and fight the hundreds of Peacekeepers(with a very relevant image of a now-militarized country) and the evil, selfish and dictatorial Capitol, led by the vicious President Snow(Sutherland, sinister and terrifying).<br/><br/>Where the first two are satire on Reality TV and gladiatorial combat, this completely abandons the Games, instead exploring modern media and how it reflects and affects the culture, with both the State and the guerrilla fighting in part via propaganda, with this 2010 book predicting that aspect of IS. Going into this expecting it to be the same thing as the first two will lead to disappointment. Unfortunately, clever as this is, there are other issues. I'm not only referring to the love triangle, present but only annoying when it rarely flares up into passive-aggressive insults. This should not be merely a part of a story. There is some focus, but mostly, the structure(unlike the others, where the competition accomplished that) here does not work well for a movie. Not a lot really happens, and it certainly isn't as fast as we've gotten used to from these. They felt the need to add a few action scenes, and while they work and increase the scope, they are clearly ""put in"", and change little, if anything. The characters don't have enough to do, and we can tell there is something missing to their arc.<br/><br/>I recommend this to any fan of Young Adult fiction. There is a lot of mild violence and some disturbing content in this. 8/10"

","It's always a worry when producing movies from a book series, but the Hunger Games Mockingjay does a great job. In fact, after reading the books first, I have actually enjoyed the movies more. If you haven't read the books, don't expect another battle in the usual Games arena, as this is a different battle again, and what the fight is really all about. Love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss in this role, but found she lacked a little of her character's strength as shown in the first two movies. I also feel we don't get a true sense of the annihilation that the Capitol or nasty President Snow deliver as portrayed in the book, nonetheless, I still feel the movie does what it needs to. The love triangle between Gale, Katniss and Peeta is covered and is an important aspect of the story. Overall, it's a solid movie although fractionally long, which leaves you looking forward to the final and hopefully thrilling final Part two."

"burakberkesu","7","11","34","22 November 2014"," The Hunger Games: Effie!
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a fine film. That's pretty much it. It's fine.<br/><br/>I have probably adored the film more than most, yet I can clearly see what they are struggling with. Although the movie does not progress as boringly as some mention, I agree that it is unnecessarily slow-pacing. The book itself is not ""full of events"" enough like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to be made into two films, which makes this decision look like nothing more than a greed for money.<br/><br/>I don't think unneeded scenes were added to make the plot look longer, but the events going on - e.g. the first, second and the thousandth propaganda shots - were less essential, worth being sacrificed for the greater good, as done in the previous instalments.<br/><br/>What is appealing to me is once again the scenes added, which are pretty impossible to be in a book from a first person perspective but look great in an action movie. The Gamemaking technology and the conversations between the Head Gamemakers and President Snow were now replaced by ""countermoves"" from various districts and these scenes not witnessed by Katniss in the book - also the rescue mission in the Capitol - kept the movie alive as far as it goes.<br/><br/>Despite District 13 being nothing close to the underground city I had imagined, it is probably the fault of my imagination inaccurately picturing somewhere more disciplined and somehow flawless, closer to the Capitol.<br/><br/>The acting was nothing special, as more touching scenes still look a bit fake on both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. I cannot say the same for Liam Hemsworth, as the director is a huge Peenis fangirl and there has occurred nothing worth mentioning about Gale in the entire film series.<br/><br/>Apart from the main characters, I found Alma Coin quite accurate; although it was not the Coin I imagined, it felt right. Haymitch did not have enough screen time and Plutarch was seldom active. The movie being depicted to the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman literally gave me the goosebumps. May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, the movie does not promise anything not awaited, yet it is far away from ""bad"". It has got 4 extra points from me just by bringing lovely Effie back in spite of that evil Collins woman. Long live Effie!"
"jmowreader1","8","12","38","23 November 2014"," Not bad; better than the four-hour alternative
","This is a movie based on a very popular book, so we all should know by now what's supposed to be in it. (If you don't, either google ""Hunger Games Wikia"" or read the trilogy.) <br/><br/>It's also no secret they're pulling four movies out of three books. The problem with ""Mockingjay"" is there's just so much in it, there are three not-altogether-satisfying ways to deal with the problem: make a really superficial two-hour movie no one would really like, go into the level of detail needed in one film and wind up with a four-hour show that would have taken two years to finish, or split it in half.<br/><br/>If they would have done the whole book as one two-hour movie, what would you get? Oh...maybe a few propos, Katniss killing Snow, not really much at all.<br/><br/>I don't think the theaters would buy a four-hour Mockingjay: it would cut the number of screenings per auditorium in half. Let me see...charge the normal admission price and lose your shirt because a four-hour flick at the two-hour price means your box office is cut in half...or charge the proper price and lose your shirt because no one's gonna pay $30 to see one movie? Decisions, decisions... Also, just how many people want to spend half the day watching one film? Or wait two years for the end of a YA franchise to come out? By then the second installment in the Divergent series would have dropped and the third would be drawing near - also, The Outliers series is already in the planning stages - and we'd have forgotten all about Katniss.<br/><br/>So they split it in half at a fairly logical point in the movie: just before all the serious violence takes place. You wind up with a nice cerebral movie that's got a little taste of action. And more importantly from the studio's point of view, you've got a respectable movie (which all of us will be binge-watching along with Part 2 as soon as that 2015 movie is out on Blu-Ray) that doesn't tax the patience of the exhibitors or the audience. <br/><br/>I liked this film. I thought it was better than ""Catching Fire."" There's a lot of talk about how Mockingjay Part 1 is a ""setup"" movie - which it is, no denial - but Catching Fire seemed more of a setup movie than this did. I caught myself thinking during CF, ""if Snow wanted rid of Katniss so badly, why not just slip some nightlock into her flour bin and make a few fake propos?"""

","If you were a Hunger Games fan already, then you will continue to be one after watching 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1'. Jennifer Lawrence is yet again a fantastic Katniss Everdeen, supported by a great cast which includes the late Philip Seymour Hoffman - who adds humour to an otherwise dark outing.<br/><br/>The story continues the build up/formation of a rebellion against the Capital and President Snow, who captured Peta and the other surviving tribunes and destroyed District 12 at the end of 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'. <br/><br/>Katniss is reluctant at first to be the face of the rebellion but quickly changes tune when she sees what remains of District 12. Mt favourite part of the film is the message Katniss sends to Snow: ""If we burn, you burn with us"". However becoming the Mockingjay does not come without it's back-lash, as the Capital resort to drugging and using Peta as a weapon against Katniss - which also produces another great quote, this time from Snow: ""it's the things we love the most that destroy us"". My favourite scenes in each film comes in the form of the back and forth between Katniss Everdeen and President Snow. <br/><br/>Just like 'Catching Fire', the film is left on a cliff-hanger with the captured tribunes free and with Peta restrained in what appears to be a psych ward. I for one can't wait to see how this whole thing ends! (I've avoided reading the books to keep myself in the dark)."
"dfranzen70","8","13","42","23 November 2014"," Less action, more maneuvering, still quite good
","The third Hunger Games movie isn't quite like the first two. There are no Games, for one thing. For another, there's nowhere near the amount of action, as the tale focuses much more on the political machinations between the Capitol and the fabled District 13. And yet director Francis Lawrence does a fine job of presenting a gripping story that, like its predecessors, brings the heart-wrenching pain dappled with grand fire and brimstone. It's a rare 'tweener movie that can stand on its own, too.<br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), you've just blown a hole through the Hunger Games. Whaddya gonna do now? Hop on over to District 13, apparently, which is the home of those who are darn well fed up with the crazy shenanigans of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol. Katniss quickly learns that her fellow Games winner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive and well, sort of, doing propaganda interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) in an attempt to get the rebel scum to lay down their weapons. Katniss, appalled at Snow's use of Peeta and at the destruction that the Capitol's military military has wrought, decides to become the Mockingjay, a true symbol around which the downtrodden, beaten-down residents of the not-well-off districts can rally.<br/><br/>District 13 is run by President Coin (Julianne Moore), who's every bit as intelligent, strong, creative, and resourceful as you'd suspect Julianne Moore to be in real life. She's convinced by former gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) that Katniss should be welcomed into the district and become the new face of the rebellion. This, naturally, leads to Snow's use of Peeta as more of a personal propaganda weapon aimed at Katniss herself. But who's zoomin' whom? Peeta seems awfully convincing when he tells everyone to lay down their weapons and surrender. It's no wonder that the rebels see him as a tool of The Man and are out for his blood, right? With no games to carry the bulk of the movie, the run time is a little shorter (by about 20 minutes), but that doesn't mean there's no fighting going on. Katniss and her former boyfriend – or is it also future? – Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) are armed with a bow and a Big Gun, respectively, in defense of District 13. We may not get to see hand-to-hand combat, but at least we're not seeing children kill each other. In fact, this entry in the series features far fewer on-screen deaths. But rest easy, there are plenty of harrowing moments, because when one side has a metric ton of big weapons and you do not, you're likely to get stomped on a little bit.<br/><br/>The decrease in violence allows the viewer an even better look at some truly terrific acting. The performances by Lawrence, Hoffman, Moore are all award caliber, and I don't mean ""for an action movie based on a young-adult movie,"" either. They're really great, which isn't a big surprise considering the pedigree each possesses. Still, it's nice to see layered character development in a blockbuster, and if this were a more-typical drama, even more praise would be justly heaped upon the cast.<br/><br/>Also along for the ride are Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) as the scraggly former Victor with more sense than he lets on; Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) as Katniss' fashion consultant, even in hiding; and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), the former Tribute who's the tech wizard for District 13. They all have jobs to do in this new world order, and each job centers around making Katniss not into just a one-dimensional heroine for the world but to bring that heroine out of Katniss. You know, organically.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the first twenty minutes or so felt a little slow. Not forced, just a stark contrast to the pulse-pounding action of the earlier movies. But then things kick into a whole 'nother gear once Katniss see what's become of her beloved District 12, reduced to rubble in the aftermath of the last Hunger Games. It's compelling, wrenching stuff, particularly when you realize that's not just rubble laying before Katniss.<br/><br/>In all, I think Lawrence and company did an exemplary job. You know, it doesn't seem terribly difficult to stage manage action scenes – you let the tech guys do their thing and listen to your DP. But when you have to get your audience to identify with characters and relate to their plight, that takes a softer touch. And it's all well and good to just let Hoffman and Moore and Lawrence do their thing, but Lawrence also elicits fine, underplayed performances from Hutcherson, Hemsworth, Harrelson, and even Sutherland."

","This episode serves to move the story along - and does it well. It is served by a great cast : we're happy to see the now familiar faces and some new characters are introduced with good casting. The high point of the movie is the usage of propaganda from both sides of the conflict - this will what one will remember from this installment of the series While it is a good episode for the Hunger Games saga, it is not as exciting as the first two - the action that gripped us is simply not there. Also, definitely do not start Hunger Games with this movie; I imagine it would be virtually impossible to enjoy if you don't know the characters and context. Not a disappointment but definitely can't wait to have a stronger episode next!"
"leannematrix","8","3","6","8 October 2015"," On first watch slow, but repeated viewing is highly rewarding
","** Contains spoilers **<br/><br/>First of all, I have to say I am a fan of the first ""Hunger Games"" movie and felt it was well done if not a little wrong in places (e.g. the mutts at the end of the movie were not as horrific as I think they should have been). And I absolutely loved ""Catching Fire"". For me, this was the best movie of 2013 and was the finest adaptation of a book (YA or otherwise) that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" things go a little awry. I'm not a fan of splitting a final book into two parts to begin with, and because of ""Mockingjay""'s sometimes meandering plot in the book, I was always sceptical about this third movie.<br/><br/>When I first watched this in the cinema in 2014, I felt like mostly everyone else - it was boring, dull, nothing happened etc. However, I recently bought the blu-ray, and after almost a year between viewings, I felt like I was watching ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" with new eyes.<br/><br/>This time I saw the fine attention to detail by the writers and director. Unlike other recent YA adaptions (i.e. ""The Scorch Trials"" and ""Insurgent"") the screenwriters on ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" seemed to truly know their source material inside and out.<br/><br/>There are also certain scenes in the movie which are exceptional. Such as Katniss discovering the mass of skeletons in District 12, Katniss filming the propo with Plutarch (the comic timing of Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly judged here) and most famously, the ""Hanging Tree"" scene.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic throughout (as it should be with all those Academy Award nominees and winners) and is all underpinned by James Newton Howard's finest Hunger Games score to date. Elegant and haunting, the music is truly magnificent.<br/><br/>Not as good as ""Catching Fire"" yet better judged than ""The Hunger Games"", ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" deserves a better reputation than it has. It may not be as action packed as the first two movies - and inevitably the final instalment - yet it is filled with subtleties and horrifically, beautiful shots. <br/><br/>The movie is quiet and slow, yet its core message (our obsession with reality TV, growing desensitisation and the futility of war) has never been shouted louder. And for that alone, ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" should be applauded and given a second chance."
"nlytnd_1","6","3","6","4 July 2015"," Not a Set Movie - The 3rd Book is Just Extremely Boring, the 2nd Part Will Be Equally Dull
","The movie does as good of a job as it possibly could have, given the material it had to work with from the 3rd book. To break it down to the non book readers, the 2nd part of the 3rd book is even more dull, so get ready. It's just really bad material and it was a painful book to get through. Most people didn't like the 3rd book and those that did are kidding themselves. Prior to the 2nd movie being released, I knew it was going to be a really good movie because the 2nd book had a really entertaining story line. This movie on the other hand had a 0% chance of being good and to score a 6 is actually an awesome achievement...awesome job with the movie! The production crew had a really tough decision. Do you break from the 3rd book since it is soo bad or do you keep the book Nazis happy? They let everyone know after Catching Fire that they would stay true to the book (based on their demeanor and response I say they weren't thrilled about it). The only way this 3rd move stood a chance is if they spent at least 1/3 of the movie going into the back story of Haymitch. It was understandably something that had to be cut out of the 2nd movie, due to both budget and time. Basically, as Katniss and Petah are preparing for the 75th Hunger Games they watch/study several of the previous Hunger Games, including Haymitch's. They watch his interviews and how he won etc. This would require a new Hunger Game Arena etc., but the 3rd book doesn't have a whole lot of entertaining material and they split it into two parts, so the Haymitch idea would have filled half of this first part perfectly. That would still leave 3 hours to cover the 3rd book which is more then enough. I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to fill the time for the 2nd part. I mean there is very little tangible material that I can even think of except for the end."

Julianne Moore is a fine addition to the cast this time. There was a great sequence of Katniss trying to get her sister and her cat back in the building before the doors closed for good. And what happens at the end, wow! Let me also say that what I've seen of Philip Seymour Hoffman is fine. I hope his death didn't affect his scenes too much in both this and the second part due next year. It should be a very interesting ride, that's for sure!

"zt12345","8","12","40","23 November 2014"," The Civil War- behind the scenes
","(No major plot spoilers, but if cautious, skip it)<br/><br/>For Katniss Everdeen Dog days are over. The Games seem like a distant past, an easy aspect, now the hard part- leading a revolution and winning it. <br/><br/>The uprisings in Ukraine, Ferguson and other Eastern countries- it seems quite coincidental such movie came out when many countries are in similar state of insurgency. There's death, there's blood, there's chaos, there's hope. <br/><br/>New scriptwriter changes formula of previous two completely, it's not YA dystopia Romance, it is a political thriller. <br/><br/>Districts cluster together to overthrow the ruling power, and previously-believed-dead 13 is head of it all. Battle of propaganda begins- when Capitol threatens death when ceasefire is disturbed, Katniss overtakes the screen adding fire to the conflict. Like a tennis game, each side tries to overthrow other one using means of media and persuasion. <br/><br/>There was yo-yo effect when I was wondering whenever to go this one, or not. All points balanced negatively: Catching Fire was a tedious watch, the book was awful, it is a stretched continuity (due to it being split in half); but, after seeing it on big screen- I have to say money was not wasted, as presumably, this is the best installment yet. <br/><br/>The movie is like the book, but it managed to repair all faults the novel had. In meaning- clumsy dialog was replaced with much stronger, consistent. It was hard to imagine characters talk in the novel, their voices barely differed and sounded odd to be said out loud. The actors and new scriptwriter manages to change given material into powerful, at times humors pieces of text. J. Law. was at her greatest (is it just me or the new A-listers get better with age- like wine!). Whilst the book couldn't balance thoughts of Katniss (which ran for good half of the book, mourning on how poor she is, how stupid everyone is, and her pointless dilemma of Peeta and Gale), here the given time is spend on speeches, behind-the-scenes working of the ruling powers and action sequences from other districts (which in books were casual remarks). <br/><br/>I even jumped back to my original review of Mockingjay, to see what I found wrong with the source two years ago (and upon re-reading still seeing them)<br/><br/>""(Katniss)starts to act like Bella, oh no!"" She's strong and independent, because we leave her head her inner romantic struggle is just a low key note in the movie. <br/><br/>""District 13 is boring, vicious and Grey, like everything in world of Panem, but reading about Seam or Capitol seemed interesting, while 13, not."" The improved graphics add sleek touch to the grim surrounding, although I have to agree- there's four similar scenes, which become less effective with usage, Katniss climbs the rubble to find destruction. Also, we barley leave few locations, which may annoy some. ( I am mildly insulted for not including the hummingbird room, it would splash a color for a contrast) <br/><br/>"" Katniss is mortal, we know it, but why does Collin make her suffer so much? She had survived fire, water, knives and guns; in Mockingjay she gets injured and faints a lot, I really mean it, good 70% of book is about Katniss sitting in hospital and recovering from attack. So, book is: 2 pages of mare action, 10 pages of pointless talking, page for character development and 20 pages for sitting in hospital (divide it by five to get entire book)."" There are 3 brief hospital scenes, and Katniss is more readily jumping into action without anyone shielding her. Also, many scenes which were just referenced or skimmed over without explanation are developed here- we see action, how it influences the politics and human nature aspect of it. Making it a deep, meaningful series of scenes.<br/><br/>""Collins ends them, concludes new stuff, but what about old stuff, Districts and Capitol, Gale and Peeta, the answers for events we were waiting for since first book! Well, Collins seemed to forgot about them, and started to conclude (the new) boring stuff."" Unlike original books movies from start to end have a running continuity, such as Snow drinking from cup and spilling blood, this is mainly gained by leaving single POV, and returning to old characters (Effie was a highlight, I am glad she didn't disappear like she did in the book!). The film producers have better insight of reality and know what will happen from start to finish, something Collins didn't do.<br/><br/>""Did she have forgotten that this book is about Hunger Games, and we want to see how actual games end? But here we have, nothing about districts, about life after games. Also Finnick, Collins treats him as a background character, while new character like Boggs gets more attention."" No, all characters have fair proportion of time, there's no casual mention, there's screen time and carefully balanced. <br/><br/>(Possible spoiler alert)<br/><br/>Only negativity is the aftertaste, as closing 20 minutes are a drag (while rest of the movie is not). There's a series of speeches repeating the same notion and over-the-top reunion with Peeta is the thing that makes you leave cinema with snoopy face. They could've cut it quicker. <br/><br/>(Fin)<br/><br/>While I gave the book 35/100, the movie gets 80/100 For strong acing, visuals, direction, depth, emotional drama, realism and message. <br/><br/>I cannot believe I say it- the movie is better than the book! <br/><br/>Fun notes:<br/><br/><ul><li>the hanging tree song and scene is a highlight -Haymitch/Effie are still my favorites, I did like Cressida too. -Soundtrack from first movies makes a wonderful comeback -P.S.Hoffmans swan song</li></ul>"

","The Hunger Games has now entered into its penultimate instalment with Mockingjay Part 1, splitting the final novel into two films and shaking up the formula of the series. It has been met with some negative reception, but hell, I liked it and see it on par with the first Hunger Games film, continuing the story while keeping it themes about the media. Mockingjay changes up The Hunger Games into a sci-fi war film as Katniss has to be for the face of the revolution against the Capital and President Snow. The themes of media image, personality and manipulation are still present and this time worked in the context of war propaganda and media warfare, playing a big part in the fight for hearts and minds. The cast is for the most part is excellent, particularly Jennifer Lawrence as the traumatised victim forced to become the face of the rebellion, as her actions in the previous films have had unintended consequences. But Liam Hemsworth as Gale was very stiff compared to the rest of the cast, not being able to match their standards.<br/><br/>There are changes from the novel, some are simply cutting out the fat like the hunting and the daily regimen of living and showing some scenes that we did not get to see in the novel. There are a few moments added to intense tension to scenes and a few characters replace other ones: but on the whole Part 1 is mostly faithful adaptation of the first half of the novel.<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence continue to be a solid director with the exploring of the ruins of District 12 being very haunting and the big action sequence, showing the war. But the portrayal of President Coin (Julianne Moore) was not shown to be as a cold or hostile to Katniss as she was in the novel, saving it for the fourth film. This is a minor issue but I pictured Coin wearing her hair in the bun. James Newton Howard raises his game and gives us the best music score in the series so far.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Part 1 is a solid film that fans of the series will be pleased with."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","11","36","28 November 2014"," Emotionally and Socially Powerful...The Best One Yet
","Since taking on Hunger Games, Lawrence has arguably become Hollywood's most successful and revered performer, blowing up box-offices and frequenting award stages. As MjP1's Katniss, a character burdened with being the hope AND the cause of Panem's war, she carries the responsibility placed on her with complexity, strength, fear and heartbreak. Add in the film's exploration of faith and fear, and its criticizing political spins of all kinds, and it becomes clear: the Hunger Games franchise is a cinematic force to be reckoned with. To shove this aside with the other YA films is grossly inaccurate; MjP1 proves that this is among the premiere SciFi franchises of this era. We catch up with Katniss in underground District 13, reluctantly leading the rebellion against President Snow and the Capitol. The story is skillfully told, with the power of fear palpable in the oppressed 99%, and the fear of power creeping up in the 1%. It's a solemn affair, to be sure, but not without its moments of levity, solidly exhibited in the high-caliber actors that are the strength of the series. Lawrence, Banks, Sutherland, and Hoffman are all standouts, with the nice addition of Moore as a political player with dubious motives. Like Harry Potter's second-to-last film, MjP1 is essentially a glorified first act to a two-part story. This will leave some wanting, especially in the areas of action and closure. However, with the amount of passion, scenery-chewing, and complex commentary within, it left me more than satisfied, while excited about the next one. Emotionally powerful and socially conscious, MjP1 is a massive step up in the zeitgeist-y franchise."

I personally only had one issue with the film that isn't a huge deal. I thought the film should have been two hours and an extra forty-five minutes. It just seemed like one of those films. As the franchise gets closer to the end I would think that each film would get longer to make sure everything that needs to be in the film is in it. But that didn't affect the rating that I gave it. Solid, good film. It went places that it didn't go in the first two a little which is always nice and fresh for franchises like this. Let's be honest here though. Critics and Metascore can give this whatever color grade or number they want, the film is still gonna bring in big revenue."

It's slow but Jennifer Lawrence conveyed Katniss' growing confidence with a touching sensitivity. She brought a real nuance and depth. Jennifer could play the role in her sleep, and sometime it felt like she was, the performance was not flawless but it was very good. President Alma Coin and Katniss' relationship is interesting, and in each scene they have together you easily read what's going on. Julianne Moore brought to the silver screen the strength, in Alma Coin, that transpired from the books and gave a memorable performance. Finally Katniss and Gale's relationship is developed in this one. They've drawn on the rich history between the two and explored how it evolved. They understood each other but now Katniss went through two games and things have changed. The change in their relationship started in the second movie but now it's full on. Katniss and Gale are both adjusting to district 13 but also to each other. It is different from the books though, because I did not have the impression that Gale stood a chance of being with Katniss in that film but it is just the first part of the movie so maybe it will be more obvious later. In my opinion they shouldn't, they were right to down play it, the movie is a lot better that way.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth did an amazing job with Gale, maybe a better job than what we've seen in the other movies. You can see how he evolved, how Gale is ready to fight and is completely invested in the rebellion with any means necessary. We see more of him, him without Katniss, the wedge between them is subtle but there. We also get to see more of Primrose (Willow Shields) and like Katniss she's coming into her inner ""warrior. There's very little room for her to grow in this movie, which is sad because giving what's to happen we should have seen more of her, so we get to really connect with her as a character and not connect with her through Katniss. Turns out Peeta (Josh hutcherson) is more present in this movie that I would have imagined and even when he's not on screen there are reminders of him. For once I am completely sold with Josh Hutcherson's performance he really went for it in this movie. I can't wait to see what's to come. Adding Effie (Elizabeth Banks) in district thirteen was an interested bit of the movie. She's out of her element but she kept her individuality. It's obvious in her clothes. Effie added a little bit of sass, shallowness, and obviously fashion to district 13. I just loved how she looked at Coin, when they first meet, it's a priceless moment. Effie added the sass, Haymitch came with the comedy, the film was starting to get heavy before he came in. Woody Harrelson brought a lightness and grounded the movie. The writers have even thrown in a spark between him and someone else. Among the new addition in this movie, the capitol rebels bring an interesting point of view of the Capitol. They're showing another side of the capitol residents because they are not, in their behavior, like what we've seen before. They might be a little eccentric but they're much more down to earth. District 13 is a character of its own it was much more about the entity than the people in it. The cafeteria looks like a prison, well the whole place looks like a prison, which is maybe one of the boring elements of the movie. The district 13 inhabitants are one of the oddest additions in the movie, so far they're extras, really angry extras, for the story purposes it was smart but for people who have always lived underground I did not expect any of them to be so angry. I mean they had to live through some pretty hard stuff, epidemics and living underground for 75 years old. But they did not have to send their kids sent to the reaping and the the Hunger Games, they were not particularly starving so those angry extras kind threw me off a bit. Why are they angry? because they were prison clothes and basically live in a dictatorship? They are very much on the opposite end compared to what we've seen of the Capitol but the people already feel like they're the same. They are ordered but also warriors. There's a ruthlessness about them that makes them as dangerous as the Capitol people are, maybe even more so. Unlike the Capitol residents, people in district 13 know what they're doing but they feel righteous about it whereas in the capitol it was entertainment. I am really excited to see more of that in Part 2. The Katniss-Snow relationship is interesting. The story created this relationship between them that oozes respect. Sutherland clearly infused a form of admiration for Katniss in his portrayal of President Snow. They're playing, mind games, a game of chess, where the more experience player may have found a worthy adversary. The little details added the final touch to the movie, like Snow's granddaughter undoing her Katniss-like braid, it helped set the tone Sutherland's on screen presence brought. Effie's chipped nail polish showing how D13 was different from the Capitol and countless other small details that brought this movie together. The film is really about a fracture, how the games and the blooming rebellion impacted the different relationships and how it's affecting the new ones. Francis Lawrence showed once again that he can direct a smart action-pack movie. It took the story to new heights, the stakes are high and Lawrence put the bar a little higher with this movie. He grounded the movie, broadened the scope and made this crazy world resonate with people. tweet @wornoutspines"

","This is one of this year's exciting new titles that are definitely worth seeing on the big screen. It is a logical continuation of the events and shows us the dark side of the Capitol hauntingly and without reserve. Passing proper judgment on aspects such as character development is not easy without having read the books, but I did find Katniss' concern and affection for Peeta slightly exaggerated, even when still considering everything they went through together. What I liked the most was the series of ""moves and counter-moves"" on the part of the rebels and the Capitol in an attempt to outplay each other, and I thought that was rather aptly portrayed. Despite the fact that it is just the tiniest bit slower-moving than the previous two films, there is enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as this franchise's standard share of sacrifice and moving moments. Perhaps the twists and turns had more impact on me as I haven't read the books, but I'd still rate this as an overall enjoyable film, with a cool score and good performances."
"stephendaxter","7","9","28","19 November 2014"," A strong but slightly disappointing lead up to the finale
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay suffered heavily from being Part 1 in a two part film. It was given the task of setting up all of the action to come and that hurt the film both in terms of runtime and overall content. The movie is littered with lots of dialogue between the characters that although is somewhat interesting, but does get a little tiring by the end. On the plus side Jennifer Lawrence's character does get a lot of development throughout the film, but that did create a negative by taking away many chances to have other character develop. In the end the film was very well acted by all involved, but let itself down by having to setup all of the events in Part 2 of the final film."

","The film was good. Nothing actively bad about it, but at the end of it all, it does seem like while things happened, nothing much of importance really happened. Saying that, it's still well-made and pretty entertaining<br/><br/>What I did have a problem with was Katniss' characterization. I don't think the first two films and this one really connect in terms of her characterization. I get that she's traumatized, but putting only one person ahead of the whole nation? That selfish? She just never showed this side in the first two films. I'm not okay with her being in love with Peeta, I thought it would've been so much better if it had just remained a strong friendship. But alas, the problem really lies with just how annoying she was. I get that people behave differently in different circumstances, but it just felt like such a wildly different character several times.<br/><br/>But really, it's a good film, aside from Katniss' problems. Although gurl, if you don't want Liam Hemsworth, I'll take him. Considering how hot he is and how completely selfless he is, how anyone could NOT want him over any other guy is itself a flaw (kidding)"

","This is a waste of time if you are looking into watching this film. It is basically 2 hours of boring exposition that does not satisfy or pay off in the end of the movie. The shallow acting from almost all characters certainly does not help its case, when its elapsed time of action is less than the time of JLaw making weird faces on screen. This movie was an obvious cash-grab that had no purpose other than to make money and set up a finale to the Hunger Games movies. In the end(don't worry I'm not giving out spoilers), the movie does not pay off what it was trying to build up for the whole movie. The whole plot kind of repeated and then becomes redundant towards the middle. The climax is not exciting, because we are too busy seeing Katniss crying, while the real action going on is not being showed on screen. I rated this movie so high, because I am excited for Part 2, and hopefully it will not be filled with the boring garbage that made this film inferior."

The actors performed their characters perfectly with the exception of Moore. There was no chemistry with her leadership speeches, unless Moore's speech style is tactical done to create a certain image. The problems with Mockingjay - Part 1 is the movie slowly builds up. The entire Part 1 is build up with no release. Leaves the viewer frustrated. The viewer ends up experiencing only half the story. The reasons for the above mentioned problems is the final book was incredible long and would translate into two films. Still enjoyable, but frustrating. I give Mockingjay/Part 1 seven stars out of ten."

I don't want to spoil though most have read the books, MOST of the haters on here are book purists (good) but they seemingly lack the insight of the apples and oranges difference between books and films. did the choices suit the making of a heavy kick butt epic sci fi film, I believe so. it's heavy AND it made me think, and I want to see it again. seeing it with fans at a sold out showing was perfect, the crowd cheered all the RAD cameo's and made mockingjay signs with the rebels. lots of politics guerilla warefare n tears in this film. it doesn't let up that the fascists are very powerful it will not be an easy win.

This Whole story is actually very true of what could happen in the world today and it has such a truth of a how young women like Katniss can be leaders and how strong they are. It shows that just one voice can make a huge impact in the world. This World needs more voices to stand out from the darkness and how your voice can be so powerful.

"remny","9","10","34","29 November 2014"," Almost Perfect
","The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay, was very close to a perfect movie. Jennifer Lawrence delivers an emotionally intense, but believable Katniss Everdeen. The Characters portrayed were intelligent and believable. At no point did they make choices that would seem illogical or out of place, simply to drive the plot forward... (with one small exception) like in so many movies these days.<br/><br/>The movie was genuinely inspiring, and generally unpredictable. Leaving the audience squirming in their seats as they try to anticipate the coming scenes. Certainly I am glad to have never read the books, because knowing how things would have played out would have ruined so much of the suspense and intensity. At no point was I bored, choosing to hold my bladder for the final half our, so as not to miss a moment.<br/><br/>EXTREME SPOILERS AHEAD, only for those that have already seen the movie: My only small gripe, the only thing that makes this movie not completely perfect, (and this is certainly a subjective opinion) is President snow's choice to allow the rescue-team to recover the tributes from the capitol. Sure, one of them had a small chance to kill Katnis, sure she would feel emotional trauma at the pain inflicted on Peta, but I imagine it would have been a lot more effective to execute them, than to give them such a moral boosting victory and allowing them to save more important figure-heads of the rebellion. This decision did not seem as smart, nor as sociopathic as I imagine President Snow to be. I can live with writing this off as President snow being rather demented and therefor somewhat unpredictable, but not without a little reservation."
"jacobclark512","5","10","34","28 November 2014"," A Good Setup for the Finale
","My first reaction to Mockingjay Part 1: wow, this is going to be long.<br/><br/>My second: wow, this is good.<br/><br/>Those two thoughts pretty much sum up my experience viewing Mockingjay Part 1. I really didn't care for Mockingjay the book as much as the first two parts of The Hunger Games trilogy, so when I heard it was being split into two parts, I knew this was a good possibility. Taking the same cast and crew as Catching Fire plus a few additions was a good idea, but making Mockingjay into two movies made me think of other young adult series that have suffered the same fate and not turned out as well as they could have if it was one film.<br/><br/>That being said, Mockingjay Part 1 gets off to a good start for this two-part epic, mostly because of the script. The pace is a little deliberate, and there's not much action; however, the film turns into a war film shortly after it opens and begins poking fun (in a completely legitimate satire kind of way) at propaganda films. This makes it the darkest of The Hunger Games movies yet, which suited me quite nicely. This being the first of the series without the actual Hunger Games, it felt like a natural step forward for the franchise, and I quite enjoyed its highly political themes. Many times, Mockingjay Part 1 feels more like a political exploration of war and its logistics rather than a battlefield epic, making it quite interesting and thought-provoking. I am fairly confident in saying that Part 2 will have far more of the battlefield epic fans expect and less of this ""boring logistical stuff""; however, Part 1 works very well as a setup for an action- packed conclusion.<br/><br/>Speaking of being dark, Mockingjay Part 1's aesthetic is very dim. Most of the film is set in the tunnels and underground chambers of District 13 or takes place at night. I personally felt that District 13 was a more than adequate adaptation of Collins's world from the book that also blended in with Panem as we are familiar with it in the films. The outlandish costuming and extravagant makeup is gone; however, this is the way it is supposed to be, so I didn't mind it one bit.<br/><br/>The acting in Mockingjay Part 1 is solid to say the least. Jennifer Lawrence once again commands the film in her role of Katniss; however, she and Donald Sutherland as President Snow are the only characters who actually remain static from Catching Fire to this film. Josh Hutcherson's Peeta is very different (sorry, no spoilers), Woody Harrelson's Haymitch is sober for the first time since his youth, Elizabeth Banks's Effie Trinket is deprived of her Capitol fashion, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch is less double-crossing and more commanding. Liam Hemsworth also gives one of the better performances of his career as Gale due to his increased role. The various newcomers from District 13 perform admirably as well, especially Julianne Moore as President Coin. However, I sometimes feel that Haymitch and Katniss are not given enough moments to shine in Mockingjay Part 1, making this film not quite as enjoyable as it could have been.<br/><br/>The direction of Mockingjay Part 1 is very similar to Catching Fire, mostly due to the retention of the latter's director, Francis Lawrence. The cinematography brings a little of the first film's shaky camera-work, but it's just the right amount, making the film feel a little more raw and personal. While I didn't think I would like this, it was done in a very tasteful manner. The pace feels a little off sometimes, especially in the beginning; however, as a rule, this is a well-directed film that sets up its sequel well.<br/><br/>Overall, Mockingjay Part 1 is a good film. It's not a drastic improvement on its source material (and definitely not its predecessor Catching Fire), but it does what any first-half movie is supposed to do in setting up the ending. Fans of the Hunger Games franchise should like it; however, those unfamiliar should at least view the previous two films before seeing this one. It does feel a little long at times; however, Mockingjay Part 1 is a delightful political war film that beautifully sets up the finale to the Hunger Games saga."

","""Nothing happens!!!""<br/><br/>""2-Hour Exposition!!!"" <br/><br/>""SET-UP!!!""<br/><br/>If you're hesitant to see Mockingjay because of these claims, understand that they're both reasonable and misleading. Misleading because, if you're not expecting an action-fest, the plot is actually full. There's nothing wrong with the story itself, and the ""poor pacing"" claim is false. Although there are fewer developments here than there are in Catching Fire, they all definitely require the length of time it took them to develop. There are many scenes in this film that are similar to scenes in other good films of the same genre, and most of them elapse the same amount of time.<br/><br/>But the claims of uneventfulness are reasonable because its execution is lacking. The movie is actually composed of equal parts subtext, exposition, and action. Meaning that the screenplay routinely cycles a scene that portrays a strong conflict, followed by characters verbally exploring that conflict, and concluding that conflict by taking an action. If the movie was perfect, these parts would have equal weight, because, since the story is less action- oriented than the previous films, the subtext and exposition are more important to creating the story. Unfortunately, the action is shot much better than the exposition is, and the exposition is shot so similarly to the subtext that they swallow one another up.<br/><br/>As a small example, in one scene, Katniss attempts to engage in conversation with a character only to learn that he is a mute. You understand why he is a mute immediately, and its significant, and the story immediately becomes weightier and more intense because of this revelation, but the film treats the revelation as though nothing happened. Where other films would have a change in music or lighting or tone or direction to highlight significance, Mockingjay simply continues. Then, a little while later, dialogue is spoken that elaborates on this revelation. The line is delivered well, but because the audience has already picked up on the meaning, the mood that should have been created by this line is dulled. <br/><br/>There are a disappointingly large number of sequences like this: a small, signicant development happens, in plot, or character, or overall implication, and it should change the audience's understanding and appreciation for the story - but the film treats it as though everything is progressing, as though it's just another step toward something big happening in an action sequence. The best way to fix this would have been to adapt a more Gary Ross- esque direction style to the non-action scenes - give them a different look, give them their own mood, and leave them room to breathe. Overall, Mockingjay is still a good film, and a very good story. But unfortunately, many of the things that make the story good are buried."

","I'm a big fan of the books and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The casts acting was superb especially Jennifer Lawrence's and Josh Hutchersons. Although it was a little slow paced at the beginning I'm glad the movie is being split into two as it gives more time to explore the book in depth. The movie lived up to my expectations although I was sad they cut out a few scenes from the book. Elizabeth banks was also hilarious in her role as Effie Trinket and I loved that she was included in this movie unlike in the books. The singing scene where katniss sings the hanging tree was one of my favourite scenes and in my pinion one of the most powerful scenes. I really like the way the director portrayed that. I'm not really sure why there are so many negative reviews as we all knew there wouldn't be as much action in the first half because this movie is supposed to be about how Katniss deals with everything that has happened. The second part of the movie will have all the action. Overall the movie was an excellent film."

But escaping is just the start, as Katniss finds herself having to embrace the symbol she has become to the people of Panem - a symbol of rebellion against President Snow and the autocratic Capitol. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to Mockingjay, because I thought the squeal (Catching Fire) was a big improvement and just overall a better movie then the first one. The trailer to Mockingjay won me over by it's excellent tone and it's brilliant shots, and I was actually counting down the days for the movie release, but now after seeing the film I got to say.... I'm a bit disappointing. Now let me get something out there, I don't hate this movie, I just think it's really disappointing for and please don't hate me for this.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the good things in this movie: Jennifer Lawrence was just flawless in this movie and now every time I see her in interviews or new movies I straight away like her as a person and as a actress.

In the book, Peta never left the Capitol. The rescue team also included Katness. A lot of what life is like in the Capitol is revealed - and not just the party life, but the darker under-side of the place. Pita was rescued, and a lot of what was done to him was exposed. But he parted company with the rescue team (and Katness!) before they left the Capitol in order to save the team. But in the movie, the team brings Peta back to District 13 - alive - if not exactly well. The part-two movie will be - different. There is no way of knowing how the movie will end.

","In all honesty, this was my least favourite out of the 3 films so far. I think mainly because it was slow and not as action packed. The film mainly seems to be Katniss doing propaganda. I just didn't feel as engaged with the first 2. I also would have liked to see more of the actual rescue of the victors. And I think they should have separated the rescue from Finnick's speech. It's a really important speech (as it talks about things like the secret behind Snow's roses) and I felt like it got overshadowed by the rescue mission. I mean, how many people were really paying a lot of attention to what Finnick was saying. I could see a lot of non-book fans (who wouldn't know what to look for) possibly missing it.<br/><br/>I also thought the CGI done to Josh could have been a bit better. One scene in particular he looked to bobblehead-y to me. Like, it just looked a little fake to me.<br/><br/>The scene where Katniss kisses Gale came off really cheesy to me. Especially the line that Gale said about how Katniss only notices him when he's in pain. Liam's delivery of it wasn't the greatest either.<br/><br/>But overall I still liked it. I thought the scene where *Spoiler* Peeta chokes Katniss was pretty damn intense. Maybe not as intense as that one Gone Girl scene (*spoilers for that movie* the one where Amy slits Desi's throat) but wowpretty messed up. Had me on the edge of my seat. I also thought Jennifer was again really good in this. My favourite scene/line from her was definitely the ""If We burn, You burn with us!"" .<br/><br/>The film definitely built the framework for the next movie.

","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 (2014) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The third film in the popular series appears to be getting some heat from fans and critics and for some pretty good reasons but at the end of the day there's no question that the film contains the great acting and compelling characters from the previous two. This time out, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is recruited by President Coin (Julianne Moore) to lead the rebellion against the Capitol but her heart remains with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and makes her question what she should do.<br/><br/>I guess I'll start with the controversy. People have complained that not much really happens in this film and I would certain agree with that. It's clear that the studio wanted to make as much money as possible so they broke this final film into two so that people would have to fork over double the money. By doing that they've made part 1 someone laid back, character driven and without too much action. I understand the studio wanting to make money but at the same time I can't help but think that everything covered in this here's two-hour running time could have been done in forty-five minutes and then we could have gotten to the events that are going to be in part 2.<br/><br/>WIth that said, it's somewhat hard to really be too critical of the actual part 1 because once the second film is released we can just view them as one and when that happens, I think fans and critics will be a little kinder to this here.<br/><br/>I thought for the most part the story was good and I didn't mind too much that they tried to deliver more of a character and emotional drama than just pure action. I thought there was one reason this work and that's because we're given such a terrific cast who are strong enough of actors that they can keep us drawn in. Lawrence, who has obviously became one of the best actresses out there today, has no problem in her role, although I must admit that I wondered if the screenwriter was just wanting to see how many different ways she could cry. Either way, Lawrence was terrific as is Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Moore and of course the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth are good as well.<br/><br/>I will say that visual the film was pretty impressive and I thought the CGI here was much better than in the previous two movies. The music score is top-notch as you'd expect and there's no doubt that the cinematography perfectly captures everything. Again, I understand why people feel ripped off but in the end, the entertainment value is what counts and while this is the weakest of the three films, there's no question that it does its job in making you want to see the next installment.<br/><br/>F.T.B."

","You got to be mocking me! Splitting, author Suzanne Collins's 'Hunger Games: Mockingjay' into two movie parts was not a good idea from the movie studio. It was supposed to be the grand finale; instead, it felt like a grand disappointment, because how much Part 1 is lacking. They cut the material, a little too thin, here. Directed by Francis Lawrence, the movie is slow talk with little action. Pretty mediocre, in my opinion. The movie tells the story of first 12 chapters of the Mockingjay novel, in which, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawerence) is in District 13 after escaping the Hunger Games of the previous film, 2013's Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss must become the figure-head of the rebellion movement; the Mockingjay. So that, the movement can take down the Capitol leader, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and save her friend, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie bears little resemblance to its predecessors, as it replace most of the cartoony futuristic gladiator action, with a more serious tone, of realistic warfare. While there's much less bloody hand-to-hand fighting -- and no kids killing kids -- the violence can still be intense and upsetting. Lots of shots of skeletal remains, dead and severely wounded citizens, the execution of traitors to the Capitol. It's scary, how much, it mirrors that of real life conflicts. You really get the sense of how large and awful the war got, when you see the after effects; it had on the environments of District 12 or the large number of death in the hospital at District 8. You really get into the heart of the series and what it's exploring. Many thought-provoking messages/themes about war, media, rebellion, politics, greed, the dangerous edge of idealism and nationalism, and, ultimately, human nature. The movie doesn't shy away from going deep into the tactics of image manipulation, video virality and propaganda, which can be considered ironic since as a Hollywood movie, it employs these very tactics itself, and the audience is being made aware of how they are manipulated. There's also some level of funny reality subtext that Katniss is acting like a horrible actress than herself. The adaptation was mostly faithful to the novel, with few changes. Most of the changes were made, to make it, a little more entertaining. Such as the case, of adding back recurring colorful supporting characters like Effie (Elizabeth Banks) & Haymitch (Woody Harrison) to bring more, of a familiar feel. In the novel, most of the supporting characters from the Games were pretty absent, but Harrison and Banks did pretty well in their limiting roles. The movie also felt the need to add more action sequences, unseen from the book as the book was lacking in it. In my opinion, the action in the film wasn't the best, I have saw, because you barely witness the event, just see the after-effects of those actions. I was really disappointment, by the absence of detail. A good example of this was the increase interest in the book, Mockingjay had for Gale (Liam Hemsworth). It really felt like it was his time to shine. Instead, the huge ending action scene that the movie set up for Gale, was anticlimactic, rather than suspenseful or interesting. They really don't give much for Liam Hemsworth to work it, so I don't blame him, for how bland, his performance was. Another thing, the movie tries to do is cut down on Katniss's over sensitive irrationally mood swings and PTSD. Thank god, for that. I don't blame Lawrence for this. She's such a gifted actress, but her character is getting annoying and repetitive. Watching a post-traumatic 18-year-old girl that care more about the one person than the whole world is a bit much to take. Thank goodness, it was less romance than in previous installments. The love triangle is getting pretty old, by now. Watching the movie, I was really getting kinda upset on Katniss's dumb tantrums about Peeta. Josh Hutcherson isn't on screen all that much compared to the first two films, but when he is, as Peeta, you really see his dark transformation from well-known celebrity, to starved, wild-eyed hostage being forced to read propaganda. Donald Sutherland is pretty sinister as President Snow, but he also get a cut-back as the movie barely focus on him. There's a dark, melancholy tone to Mockingjay, but most of this movie felt like set up. There are parts I love, like when Katniss sings ""The Hanging Tree,"" and the bombing of District 13 that remind me of London Blitz of WW2, but I'd probably have a much harder time remember anything besides that. I felt that Part 1 is a lesser movie; as it just set up material. It felt like it was clearly just made into a movie as a teaser and a money grabbing ploy to get as much money from the book's large fan base. Overall: This isn't the sequel that a lot of people will re-watch again, unless you're a super fan. Then again, it does set things up for the final film. Still, it's worth, at least, one watch. Recommended. Just note, that it's just not the best movie in the series."

","Bravo! This is the best film in the series so far! Everyone gives an amazing performance and there's not a single actor or actress in this film I felt should have been recast. The only problem I had in this film was the CGI. It didn't look realistic. It looked like the cutscene to a Playstation 1 game. The great thing about this film is it doesn't feel rushed. It takes it's sweet time in getting to the story, and that is cruical when the story is so big and needs a lot of character development. Why must I wait a year for part 2?! Why can't they just release it a month after the Blu-ray comes out? The Hunger Games movies just keep getting better and better. I'm excited to see how they handle part 2, and I'm highly confident it will be handled with care.

","I only watched this movie because I started watching The Hunger Games and I like to go to the end of what I started. The first two hunger games were good to watch but with The Mockingjay you just don't get the same satisfaction. Like most movies that goes on forever the further you get the worse it gets. And this one is not an exception. It's just an okay movie to watch once and then forget about it. It's much too long with not enough action. A lot of talking and preparing for the final episode of this saga. I will watch the next one because I need to know the end but I don't have high expectations that it will get better.

"simontaylor-44498","6","2","4","3 April 2016"," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1
","The first of a two-part adaption of Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay, the concluding entry in The Hunger Games sequence, this movie follows the recent trend of splitting the last of trilogies into two. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem justified in this case. The movies are divided prior to the Mockingjay/District 13 assault on Panem – or, in other words, the good bit. Which makes much of this movie essentially a build-up to its sequel. Lawrence is her usual brilliant self as a conflicted Katniss, who is called upon to portray a full rainbow of emotions and does so effortlessly. Her relationship (broadest sense) with Gale (Hutcherson) is played down, and in his few appearances Peeta (Hemsworth) steals the scene. Haymitch (Harrelson) is criminally underused but magnificent when he is given some screen time. Two major casting decisions affect this film greatly. The first is the inclusion of Effie Trinkett (Banks) who doesn't appear in the first half of the book. She takes the place of Cinna's erstwhile prep team; her stage presence and characterisation is much stronger in the previous movies, and it was a very good move to give the lines to her. By contrast, Julianne Moore is miscast in the role of President Coin. She lacks the commanding gravitas to play the fearsome leader; the ilk of Judi Dench would have been much better suited to the part. Her dialogue with the likes of Katniss and Plutarch (Seymour Hoffman) falls flat. James Newton Howard's score is marvellous, with the haunting mockingjay rift and The Hanging Tree adding an eerie sound. The interspersion of the song with Peeta's address to Panem is one of the few rousing moments. There's every chance Part 2 will be a terrific film as it has brilliant source material and an excellent cast to perform it, but Part 1 is a real disappointment. The action-free instalment did not require the time it was given, and there was no climax or payoff. Collins' novel has not been done justice, so let's hope the odds are very much in Part 2's favour."
"Karin_Reimertz","6","2","4","1 February 2016"," Where did Katniss go? And why I bother...
","First, let me start with saying that I do like a lot of books that has been made into movies. I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter movies/books and loved ""The Golden Compass"" and was so sad that the sequels of ""His dark materials"" where cancelled. So I do understand and generally don't mind that a movie can never capture a book completely, and that sometimes it's necessary to change or remove some scenes. My problem with The Hunger Games movies – and this one especially – is that it's not the scenes that's been altered but the personalities of the characters. When doing so, it becomes a completely different movie. Think of it, what if you put Winne the Pooh and his gang into the Avengers movies or vice versa? Yes, maybe it would have been really interesting movies, but you would never dare to claim that it is a remake of the book. <br/><br/>Katniss, but also Johanna, Haymitch, Gale, and several more characters have become something a lot more mainstream. And I'm usually not a feminist, but I can't help but getting really annoyed that Katniss is so weak, bleak and boring in the movie. In the books she has all of these strengths and weaknesses and not to mention free thinking of her own – while in the movie(s) she's just showed around like a pawn and not bothered about it at all. Given that this is a movie with a younger audience I think it's so sad to withhold them a picture of a strong female role model, a young woman who both bleeds and fights. In the books people are afraid of her, admire her, trusts her, loves her. But in this movie she just becomes this boring girl who rarely speaks up and even more rarely are being listened to. Why are we still so afraid to make a movie with a strong, female role model? If you are watching this with your teen daughter, or if you are reading this knowing that she has or will see this movie, give her the books. Show her who Katniss really are.<br/><br/>If I try to put this aside, as hard as it is, you end up with a good movie. It's not amazing, but it is your time worth. You have some really strong actors who are really giving their everything to the script. Kudos to both Harrelson (Haymitch) and Hutcherson (Peeta) for trustworthy playing their roles as two of the most important characters next to Katniss. The scenes are most of the times breathtakingly beautiful and Suzanne Collins world of tomorrow has really come alive. One thing I can't help thinking though is; if you haven't read the book to you really get what the fight is about? I'm afraid without more of the questions raised in the background, this just becomes another ""fight the bad guy just because we said he was a bad guy"" movie. And what message does that send to the audience? And as a viewer, if this movie just blends into any other teen action movie, then what's it really worth?<br/><br/>Teachers – read the books with your students and especially teachers in higher grades working with media related subjects, bring these thoughts into your classroom. And if you aren't a teacher or a concerned parent, watch this and sit through two hours of good enough action."
"jakubiaknicolas","5","2","4","20 November 2015"," It's not always a good decision to split books in parts.
","I'm not a big fan of Hunger Games, I love it but not going mad for it. But after watching Catching Fire (which in my opinion was a great movie and best in the series) I waited so hard for MJ Part 1. I knew it was going to be bad because the first part of the book was boring as hell and I couldn't finish reading it. Therefore I went to the theater with low hype. And when the movie was over, I was just like ""that was it? really?"" these will be your only opinions when the end credits roll. I think splitting books in parts only worked for 'Deathly Hallows' because both of them could stand as single movies , I mean there is more story than setting up the final battle in 'Deathly Hallows Part 1'. I wish there was a 3 hour single Mockingjay film than 2 films. I give 5 for MJ Part 1 because it could be wrapped up in half an hour than forcibly stretched 2 hours."
"BryGuySaysHi","7","2","4","4 November 2015"," Watchable
","The film is more like a 6.5 but I decided to round up. Hollywood could have combined this film and the next Mockingjay (when it comes out) by adding maybe an extra 15-20 minutes in the beginning. There was so much filler in this movie, it was ridiculous. I was however, somewhat entertained throughout the movie even though there wasn't much action. It was probably the fact that the acting was decent. The one thing that will annoy you is Jennifer's whining in this movie.<br/><br/>If you can watch it for free, you may as well (currently on Amazon Prime Video) otherwise I would not pay money to see it. You won't walk away amazed. You pretty much have to watch this in order to see the last one anyways, which is supposedly going to have lots of action (according to those who read the book). I refused to pay money so I waited so long to see this one because of the fact they split it up to make more money."

"bryank-04844","4","2","4","12 August 2015"," I'm sure this film will go well with 'Part 2', but as of now, it's just a sedated piece of filler that will prep us for the next big film
","Things are not looking up for Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in this third installment of Suzanne Collins' young adult book series 'The Hunger Games'. In an effort to squeeze as much money as they can, the movie studio decided to split the third and final book into two parts, much like the last two 'Harry Potter' films and the recent trilogy of the single book of 'The Hobbit'. On one hand, the fans will get two movies. On the other hand, there will be a lot of filler between these two films to stretch them out to their two-hour run time.<br/><br/>Rest assured, 'Mockingjay Part 1' is a dark movie. War has begun between the Capital, led by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the new resistance, led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore). Since the studio executives decided to split this third story into two films, this first part serves as a promo for all the action and excitement for the next film, which is unfortunate, because the last two films were quite good. 'Mockingjay Part 1' is basically just a bunch of filler and setup for something bigger and greater. The pacing is much slower than the last two films and might have you yawning or checking your watch a few times throughout.<br/><br/>That being said, it's still a decent enough movie with good performances, excellent visual effects, and good camera work. And it's a must-see if you want to stay in the story line of this book series, but as a stand alone film, it doesn't amount to much at all. It's just a bummer, we all have to sit through this first part to get to the meat and potatoes of Part 2. I'm going to assume that you all have seen the first two films, but if not, I suggest you watch those and read our review HERE, before you proceed. 'Mockingjay Part 1' starts off right where 'Catching Fire' left off, with Katniss rescued from the last game, while Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) was kidnapped and taken to the Capital.<br/><br/>Katniss was rescued by the resistance with President Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) running the show. Their goal is to take down the evil Capital, by uniting all the people who are now basically slaves to the Capital and evil President Snow to rebel and regain their freedom. Their strategy is to use Katniss as a symbol of the Mockingjay to make a series of commercials to amp up the spirit of the people to rebel. So Katniss travels from section to section, where the Capital is bombed and killed thousands of people for treason. Katniss sees this destruction and either sings or cries into a speech. Her camera crew films, and the people back at the resistance broadcast it all over the world. This leads to a bunch of people standing up to the Capital.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peeta is sending video messages out to the people, telling the resistance and Katniss to stop this war and lay down their guns, but Peeta seems to be getting physically and mentally worse with each video. So what did we find out in 'Part 1'? That a big war is coming to a head and that Peeta and Katniss have some issues to work out. That's about it. While this is definitely the most sinister and darker of the 'Hunger Games' films so far, it is by far the slowest. At least the visual effects are all top notch and the one big action scene was quite good, but it was over before you could blink.<br/><br/>I'm sure this film will go well with 'Part 2', but as of now, it's just a sedated piece of filler that will prep us for the next big film. And if the filmmakers chose to end this installment five minutes earlier, with a big cliff hanger, instead of a fizzled out ending, the movie would have left a better taste in my mouth."
"MattBirk","4","2","4","2 August 2015"," A Completely Unnecessary Film
","Mockingjay Part 1 feels like nothing more than a cash grab on behalf of the studios behind the film. The movie moves at a snails pace (which would have been okay if it had strong writing to back it up), but nothing original seems to surface. The movie focuses on turning Katniss into the face of the revolution, but what was she before this then? Did we really need a whole movie showing us what we already knew was going to happen, whether or not she was going to accept such a role? The movie moved away from originality, which is what made The Hunger Games so fascinating and into a territory we have seen done before.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Part 1 adds nothing to the story which we didn't already know, we knew Katniss would be the symbol of the people (wasn't she already?), we know President Snow is a ruthless dictator, and we know revolution is happening, everything that happens in the movie we already know. I guess the one thing we didn't fully know was the fate of those left behind, but that surely does not justify this two hour movie. On the other hand, the movie does pack a solid amount of emotion into the two hours, we saw the extent of the evil the capital is willing to take just to stay in power.<br/><br/>But besides that, the story is not nearly strong enough to justify splitting the final book into two separate movies. Mockingjay Part 1 is all about propaganda, but that is exactly what the movie itself is, propaganda, trying to persuade us to see Part 2."
"dfa120374","6","2","4","30 July 2015"," Not As Exciting As The 2nd Installment, But Still Decent
","So, here we have the 3rd installment in the film series of The Hunger Games and unfortunately it's not as good as the 2nd film, Catching Fire. For me, Mockingjay - Part 1 takes a step backwards as it's not as exciting, fast-paced, or absorbing as the previous film. It is, however, still better than the 1st movie.<br/><br/>Before I started watching The Hunger Games film series, I was of the opinion that they were just another bunch of massively over-hyped SciFi/Action films aimed at the teeny crowd. I only ended up watching the 1st film because it was on TV. I still stand by my original thoughts about that 1st installment because it really wasn't anything that great and was a very average outing. Where it changed for me was the 2nd movie. That one was MUCH better than it's predecessor, and I actually enjoyed it, even with the 1st 40 minutes or so being slower than a snail in treacle. Mockingjay - Part 1, though, while still decent and better than the 1st movie, was still a bit of a disappointment.<br/><br/>This time around, the story is more focused on the emotion and getting Katniss Everdeen to become a sort of rebel leader/saviour for the people of each District and to start a rebellion against President Snow. I'm not complaining about where the story's focus is as I know the series can't be JUST the games all the time. It's the execution of the story that lets me down a bit as it was just a bit too bland and slow. Even Jennifer Lawrence's performance was pretty bland also. She didn't seem to have the same conviction with her character as she did in the previous films.<br/><br/>That aside, there were still some good moments of tension and the action that is in the film is good. In fact, it's this tension and action that keeps the film going for me. Another thing I liked? No Alice in Wonderland style costumes!! That was one thing I hated about the previous films, and thankfully none of that is here.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto Mockingjay - Part 2 and hopefully that won't fail to deliver."

The second movie took me by surprise how good it was, and going into this I tried to think of it as a political war drama but... my lord. This movie is just bland. They gloss over so many things in this film. Like the camera placement being all over the place. Also, you know-how in the last film Katniss was all about defying the Capitol and saying what she means? Yeah in this film she starts out by refusing to be the one thing to take down the Capitol, all because they like... didn't save Peeta?<br/><br/>This film also has so many unnecessary scenes. The two main ones being the hunting scene and the stairwell cat scene. They serve little to no purpose and don't invoke any real emotions at all. The action scenes at the end are done pretty well and it's very tense then but that pales in comparison to anything in the last 2 movies. Not to mention it's like watching paint dry for 45 minutes and then going on a roller coaster for 15. Not really worth it.<br/><br/>I feel like the main appeal of the Hunger Games is two things. The actual games and lots of bloody combat, and Katniss as a character. Katniss doesn't do any growing in this movie and the little action there is doesn't feel like it was earned from the previous 45 minutes of the movie. Finally, my main problem with this movie is I feel like it wasn't needed. While the second movie is long I feel like it could have been worked into the second movie.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you're doing a hunger games rewatch like I am skip this one."

Sensing her growing influence among the people and refusing to give justification to their actions, President Snow responds by declaring it a treasonous activity for anyone to embrace the mockingjay.

Both sides use clever propaganda to gain more followers or make the enemy loose hope and loose followers. Katniss has emerged as a symbol of hope and resistance against the Capitol. The movie shows us well how in war every decision made, might it be to save your friends or to create hope by broadcasting powerful speeches, will have a response from the enemy that could result in a loss of more supporters and casualties. It brings to the viewer a much a darker and realistic view on civil war, its terror and suppression as some other movies featuring the same thematic.

Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.<br/><br/>The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended.

And this movie played to eager fans... swarms of them... there must have been disappointment caused by the slow progress. You lose fans that way. They walk out of theaters disillusioned, and spread the word of their disappointment, or switch off television sets. Get the picture? <br/><br/>Like I said, it does get better. But first impressions count, and the movie starts off dismal and continues that way for far too long. Of course the fans expected outdoor competition, and got claustrophobic bunkers.<br/><br/>Willow Shields, the young actress playing Prim, seemed to hold so much promise in the original. But, no, big letdown performance from her. It's like that stuck-with-the-cast curse of TV, the first time round they might fit in perfectly, next season they're just blah!<br/><br/>Treading on many toes now, but Philip Seymour Hoffman, I fail to see anything standout in his final role. Including CATCHING FIRE.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth has considerable leading man charm, that other guy, Josh whatever, can go home! The Mockingjay logo is the real star of the entire movie, especially after sitting through ten minutes (or more?) of end credits.<br/><br/>The uglification of the characters (and their hick names, yee-ikes, the ugliest names, Haymitch Abernathy sounds like a hillbilly goat farmer and Plutarch Heavensbee... oh good grief...) Okay, what I was going to say, on the DVD, the cast appears, and everybody looks a hundred times better than they do in the movie. Basically, this is a movie with loads of unattractive, weird and dorky characters. Except J-Law and Liam, of course.<br/><br/>All in all, there's another reviewer here who's tag-line reads ""two hour movie could have been edited into 20 minutes"" or something like that. I agree. There is a pervasive tedious feeling to this movie.<br/><br/>Must have cost the franchise a lot of fans. Burst bubbles...<br/><br/>*something in this review is just a lie, but I'm keeping my trap shut. You figure out what it is."

","So The Hunger Games follows the lead of Harry Potter and â€“ its own spiritual nemesis â€“ Twilght, and splits its final chapter in half. The resultÂ… is not surprising.<br/><br/>After the events of the trilogy's second act, Catching Fire, Katniss wakes up surrounded by new allies with dubious motives. She desperately wants to rescue Peeta, who has been taken by the tyrannical Capitol, but her allies want her to become a symbol of strength and hope for the downtrodden Districts.<br/><br/>Compared to the first two films, this one feels like the most grim, realistic interpretation of the themes involved. Mockingjay Part 1 is a bleak, visually monotone and narratively reserved; there are lots and lots of visuals depicting death and destruction, we see heroine Katniss standing in a field of burnt bodies and skulls, we have executions and brainwashing to drill into our heads that The Capitol are vicious. Wow. I never would have thought I would say that, the incompetent villains are actually evil here, we actually get a real sense of uncompromising tyranny that could rule over millions of lives. The threat is finally real, and there's a sense that Katniss really must choose, that her fate is now entwined with the fate of all the Districts.<br/><br/>But this whole cutting the chapter in half nonsense continues to not work. My prevailing memory of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 are those of stale, dull, elongated moments (mostly camping in the forest), and Mockingjay Part 1 is no different. Scenes are stretched, padded and unnecessarily quiet and dull. When watched in a vacuum this only makes the persistent thought of ""this isn't going to conclude"" all the more apparent. Most of the film is about Katniss trying to get over tension and shock to become the poster girl for a rebellion. There little to no combat or action, because this is only the first and partly second act of a complete film.<br/><br/>I boycotted this film's release on principle: the first two films had uneventful segments, and if they boost that uneventfulness into one entire movie, I will be both bored and unsatisfied. While the film didn't quite bore me as much as I thought it might, it was as unsatisfying as I expected.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of this film is the twisted dynamic between Katniss and Peeta. While it does not have the same power as Catching Fire's celebrity gossip themes, it is this film's greatest asset. Although I do have a soft spot for stories that literally corrupt heroes.<br/><br/>The Capitol finally have fangs, and the film benefits tremendously from the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and newcomer Juiliane Moore, Jennfier Lawrence too maintains her multi-layered Katniss very well and there's a good sense of continuity with Catching Fire. But I refuse, I refuse to believe this is better as two parts. A screenwriter worth his or her salt could compress this into a single film, perhaps the longest film in the series but at least that's not the ridiculous cash grab that is two incomplete films.<br/><br/>Each Lord of the Rings book was a single film!<br/><br/>I went into Mockingjay Part 1 with cynicism, and unfortunately it didn't change my overall opinion enough. Sure, I fully admit I am too old for this series (if I were thirteen I'd be all over it, and completely smitten by Ms Lawrence) and if I were a fan I'd be chewing my own arm off to see the conclusion. But in terms of singular films, which this must be rated as, it is nothing spectacular."
"onaizakhan","6","0","0","9 September 2016"," Not up to the mark
","The Hunger Games movies have been amazing till now. The characters, the action and the sets breathtaking. But the only problem is that they don't match the level of the books. The book explains everything in details. I believe one can never actually understand and feel the story from the movie like from the book. The book is pooling with action all over and yet quick and interesting. There are movie franchises like Twilight that do better than books but The Hunger games movies are not that. There is a lot of scope of improvement ant entertainment. This movie seems like a sluggish attempt at picturing half the book. I wouldn't even give it 6 stars if I had watched the movie without reading the book. It wouldn't engage and hook me. All the while I was comparing the movie with the books. And I realized the book was so much better. So if anyone finds the plot of Hunger Games interesting, he'she should give the books a shot. But if you can't read the books, the movies aren't that bad either."

","While I appreciate that the movie was split in two parts (honestly there was too much information that had to included to satisfyingly put everything in one single movie) I think the movie and the acting was not done well enough. Jennifer Lawerence is a fantastic individual and honestly can't have enough praise for her; she herself is awkward, much like her character, but there is a huge difference between her awkward and that of Katniss's. And that was made painfully obvious to me. While Katniss is awkward in a social aspect, Jennifer is awkward personality wise. I don't think Jennifer did her best in this part of Mockingjay, thought that the seriousness of the situation was deducted due to Jennifer's acting."

","Its like a communist commune, living underground, regimented life, no style or fashion. The first film really contrasted the poverty of the Districts with the opulence and decadence of the Capitol. It was visually enriching, the drab vs the exaggerated styles. IN this installment, the locations are mainly rubble and industrial, drab only, the odd Capitol cut-scene. The script sober with propaganda. Where is the verve and deadly style of the Capitol? I think given the choice, most of Panem should fight for the Capitol. Why become a collectivized worker. We want the glitz without the cruelty, not replace it with conformity."

She comes to be the MockingJay, which we already knew like 2 movies ago.<br/><br/>There was zero drama, zero action, and it looked like poor Katniss was sedated for 90 % of the film.<br/><br/>No, don't waste your time.

"Spring15","6","7","24","21 November 2014"," Just an OK movie, with some very good things
","Being a big fan of the books may have colored my opinion of this movie, but here it is.<br/><br/>I thought it was an OK movie. I am not sure I would watch it a second time, but eventually I will, because I want to own the full set of the HG movies on DVD. This was only a set up for part 2, and that's how the book is written. The movie did a good job of consolidating several scenes from the book, and adding some details that Katniss doesn't know in the book (action scenes- blowing up the peacekeepers, etc. were good). The best consolidation brought Effie in the movie much earlier than I expected. She simply replaced Katniss's prep team, and that was a masterful job of writing.<br/><br/>Some (including me) had felt that it was unnecessary to make Mockingjay into two movies, but making just one movie would have sacrificed a lot of useful information. So I don't have a problem with it now. Part 1 is just a set up to part 2, which I expect to be much better, just as the book is. The visuals were great. It ended at the most obvious point, but I would have liked them to carry the movie way past it. It would have allowed them to put more detail into part 2. Now they have to cover too much in part 2, so I don't know what will be sacrificed in it. I didn't have a major problem with where it ended because it was well done. I would say the beginning and the end were both well done. The middle part was not always good.<br/><br/>Couple of scenes bothered me a lot because those were big deviations from the book, and completely unnecessary, and IMO bordering on silly. They could have dropped those and instead spent more time on a couple of other scenes to make them more meaningful. The conversation between Katniss and Finick was kind of cut short in the movie. These two have formed a special bond since the quarter quell and the film makers could have used it better. Instead they wasted film on those added scenes.<br/><br/>The deviations were both introduced to show how 'great' Katniss is, while in the book she has a more objective opinion of herself, and I prefer that approach to what the movies show- making her superhuman.<br/><br/>The first scene that I disliked is when Katniss goes looking for her sister, while bombing is taking place. In the book her sister is late, but Katniss stays inside and asks the guards to keep the door open. It was ridiculous to show them outside during the bombing.<br/><br/>The second one is much worse. While a team is out to rescue the victors from the capital, Katniss asks to be put in contact with President Snow on the screen, and they have a conversation. She offers to trade places with Peeta. There is no such a thing in the book, and that added scene was totally unnecessary. The rescue operation was shown well, but it could have been shorter.<br/><br/>About acting - Jennifer Lawrence was very good, and she was the only one that had some good material to work with. Others didn't have much to work with. Julianne Moore's President Coin came across as too nice- could be a flaw in the screenplay. Philip Seymour Hoffman is/was such a great actor! His Plutarch Heavensby shows his true colors in this. He is a slime ball who doesn't care about people, but wants to use them in his propos. He does it with a smile on this face. I don't think many actors could have dug that deep into this character.<br/><br/>In the pictures published earlier, I had seen President Snow flanked by Peeta and Johanna, all wearing white. That scene never takes place in the movie. Apparently it was edited out. In any case there was no such scene in the book, but I would have been OK if they had shown what was being done to Johanna and Peeta. The movie doesn't even show Johanna till almost the end (that is actually consistent with the book, which is written from Katniss's perspective).<br/><br/>On the positive side, the movie keeps moving fast, despite the boring material and it is well edited, with a few exceptions. Visuals are excellent. I liked it that they brought the 'hanging tree' song in it- I didn't expect them to. Now I expect to see it in part 2.<br/><br/>Overall I would give it a 'B' grade. Here I gave it 7/10 because some things were handled very well (consolidating some scenes, and using Effie in place of Katniss's prep team). It is worth seeing once, but not more."

","When Katniss destroys the games, she goes to district 13 after District 12 is destroyed. She meets President Coin who convinces her to be the symbol of rebellion, while trying to save Peeta from the Capitol.<br/><br/>Producers are making money with the saga so why not split one book into two movies? Twilight did it, Harry Potter did it and The Hunger Games is doing it as well. I am not a huge fan of the first Hunger Games movie, but I loved Catching Fire. It was a very smooth and well directed movie by Francis Lawrence; who is taking over once again for MockingJay. At the end of Catching Fire you were literally burning to see Katniss and everyone go against the Capitol and kill them all. Actually I was pumped to see what will happen. Unfortunately, MockingJay Part 1 is just an extended trailer for Part 2, nothing interesting and relevant happen until the last 20 minutes of the movie. They are trying to stretch the events of one book into several movies but the thing is that even the tiny details are not that interesting and exciting to watch. This film deals with how you run a rebellion against an evil empire, giving endless political and motivational speeches, this on purpose to be filmed for propaganda. It's not enough to keep the viewers check in through the whole run time of the film. However, I liked the fact that this film takes The Hunger Games to another level as you have to think things through all this propaganda and point of views, the political intrigue is good. It approaches the story and The Hunger Games world from another angle, different from the first two movies. Nonetheless, the shaky cam is back from the first movie and there is not much action aside this trailer scene where Katniss is shooting an arrow to a jet. Jennifer Lawrence is obviously a fantastic actress and gives a great performance once again but coming back to the first movie I don't see how Katniss' character grows, matures and learns anything. She is the exact same character she was in the last one and the one before. Consequently you don't get to catch the interest of the viewers with a main character, this added to a movie where nothing really happen, the viewers are checked out pretty quickly. In fact, all the performances are very good, the drama is very well done but the characters who are actually interesting don't get to do anything beside sitting around, talking and give speeches. For instance there is a really tense scene in which Gale, starring Liam Hemsworth, explains how District 12 has been destroyed and how he could have done something more to help people to survive. This scene is also dealing with his relationship with Katniss, and you get to see that Gale's character is really deep and interesting but in reality you don't care about him that much. Finally, in the last 20 minutes of the film I was relieved to watch the proper movie beginning and building tension for the big finale, but then, it ends.<br/><br/>Overall, MockingJay Part 1 is a well directed and good looking movie filled with potentially awesome things that never really reach the proper core of the film, nothing really mesmerising happen throughout the run time."

","(WARNING: THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS!) (Please do not go further if you don't want to be spoiled!) So the movie starts off slow. But it shows District 13 and who's here and what happened there. It was very intense because i thought the movie will be boring but it wasn't. I wished they change the parts of the book so more people can be in it. I was happy Effie was in there but like Peeta and Johanna were that not much in it. Later on in the movie it was pretty cool because when they went to go rescue peeta and the other tributes the rebels went in like the black ops. I rated this movie a 7 because there wasn't that much action like catching fire it was boring the first 30 minutes. I wish the director could've just added more parts of the book like the districts fighting back or more peacekeepers. In the end it left of with a cliffhanger so I can't wait for next year."
"shawneofthedead","8","8","30","1 December 2014"," An excellent adaptation of a difficult book, Mockingjay explores the political in a different but very welcome way from its predecessors.
","Type three words into Google - 'Why is Mockingjay...' - and the search engine helpfully fills in the blanks: '...so bad?'. It's a common complaint about the final book in Suzanne Collins' best- selling trilogy of young-adult dystopian fiction. There's too little going on in the first half of the book and too much in the second. Characters become overblown and unsympathetic, particularly our heroine Katniss Everdeen, whose angst-ridden narration of the story grows increasingly annoying as she dithers between two boys when she should really be focusing on the war raging around her. It seems like a particularly perverse decision, then, to split this book into two films. And yet, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is something of a triumph. It's a smart, powerful adaptation that mines the great ideas and strengths of Collins' third book while excising its more frustrating elements.<br/><br/>Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is no longer trapped in the live-or-die arena of the Hunger Games. Instead, she's been transported to the gloomy secret hideout of District 13, which almost all of Panem thought had been destroyed by the Capitol years ago. In reality, the soldiers and warriors of this District had quite literally gone underground. The subterranean District 13 is now the base of operations for a simmering rebellion against Coriolanus Snow (Sutherland), the imperious leader of the Capitol. Alma Coin (Moore), with arena designer and fellow rebel Plutarch Heavensbee (Hoffman) by her side, wants Katniss to serve as the Mockingjay, the face of a campaign to rally and unite all the Districts against the Capitol. But all Katniss wants is to save Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), the sweet, steadfast boy from District 12 who entered the Hunger Games - twice - to keep her alive, and is now the prisoner of President Snow.<br/><br/>Shorn of Katniss' morose ruminations in the novel, Francis Lawrence's Mockingjay is far more effective than Collins' at morphing into a dark, bitter political thriller. Indeed, it becomes a war movie quite unlike any you've seen before. Typically, audiences are plunged into the heat of battle, or accompany survivors as they struggle free of the carnage of war. Here, we watch with bated breath as the Capitol and District 13 edge slowly towards war. Snow and Coin are playing a ruthless game of chess - political brinkmanship with life and death for stakes - with Katniss morphing from pawn to queen and back again. In one moment, she is at the cruel mercy of Snow, who taunts her with footage of Peeta begging her to stop fighting; in the next, her eyes blaze with righteous rage as she swears to make the Capitol pay for its crimes.<br/><br/>No wars can be waged without propaganda - stories and ideas and battle cries that are amplified, twisted or manipulated to either galvanise or terrify the populace. Mockingjay gets this very right indeed, folding some genuinely astute political commentary into its narrative. Katniss may not be required to kill others to survive, as she was in the arena, but she's asked to do things that are arguably even more difficult for her: acting the part of the perfect rebel, speaking lines she doesn't believe against a backdrop that isn't real. The true villain here, Mockingjay suggests, is the media, which splices footage in a way that alters perceptions and truths. There's something both heartbreaking and almost farcical about Katniss' new role in the fight against the Capitol - she's forced to enter situations that will bring out the Mockingjay in her, as she's trailed by a camera crew into the field, with the calm, cool Cressida (Dormer) finding the best angle to shoot this almost-broken rebel hero at her most inspiring.<br/><br/>It's true that Mockingjay is considerably less action-packed than its predecessors. The tale proceeds at the leisurely rate of a slow burn rather than a frantic tumble, and might strike many viewers as a story treading water before a tumultous climax. But this is a problem derived from the source material, one which Francis Lawrence mostly turns into a strength. Without the need to constantly serve Katniss' inner monologue, the film slips from war games into actual war with remarkable intelligence and wit, finding something to say even in the expansion of Elizabeth Banks' role as Effie Trinket - first, into a reluctant refugee from the Capitol, and then, Katniss' fashion consultant. There's more room to breathe in between scenes, as Katniss adjusts to her new life in District 13 - a life lived in an underground bunker, but a life preserved nonetheless. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence remains the franchise's trump card. She has been miscast in many of her recent films of late, called upon to play characters far older than her years. Strictly speaking, she's not even a physical match for Katniss. But she's riveting here, playing both Katniss' desperation and determination with a burning fire that feels right. It helps, of course, that the character on screen rarely slips into the mawkish anguish that dogged her throughout Collins' last book, but it's the actress who ensures Katniss shines as brightly as she does. The cast that surrounds her is just as good - Moore brilliantly underplays a very different sort of political leader, forming a final bittersweet tag-team with her frequent co- star, the late, reliably great Hoffman.<br/><br/>Anyone primed by the gore-free violence of the first two Hunger Games movies might find Mockingjay a bit of a letdown. Even fans of the series will know that it is simply marking time before the politics of this war spins out of control in the final film. And yet, Francis Lawrence's film doesn't feel dispensable. On the contrary, it takes what meanders in the book and transforms it into something rich and characterful for the screen. It may be treading water within the overarching narrative of the franchise, but these are shark-infested waters, and the film draws that out in plenty of clever, rich detail."
"tiffanyyongwt","8","8","30","30 November 2014"," there's no Hunger Games in this Hunger Games movie...
","To all non-readers of the Hunger Games trilogy, warning, there's no Hunger Games in this Hunger Games movie (neither will there be any in Part 2)<br/><br/>You know how movies rarely supersede the original books? The Hunger Games trilogy was one of the few which managed to do so. I caught the first Hunger Games movie without reading the book and after watching, I read all the 3 books within the next 5 days. I was surprised (or should I say disappointed) that the movie was way better than the book. I disliked the Katniss in the novel, she's weak, indecisive and cold and I was dreading to watch the next 2 (now 3 films). But Jennifer Lawrence had given the Katniss a better character and in this movie, a bit more emotional depth, albeit a little less action.<br/><br/>Whilst I dislike the third book, because my favourite Peeta went bonkers (due to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), I loved Josh Hutcherson's role in the movie. He did not have much screen time as compared to the string of District 13 characters, it made his every single appearance more precious, just like how Katniss treasured that one-way connection every single time, noticing the changes in his appearances. I'm so glad the directors made the characters more likable.<br/><br/>Some might dislike this film for the lack of action, but I love it for the more in-depth emotional development. This is how it's like when preparing for rebellion, preparation is always drier than the flesh-against-flesh punches. That's why when tiny mutinies start in every district, the civilians copying whatever Katniss say, do or sing, and taking down the ""peace-keepers"", you can't help but want to punch in the air and hiss a silent yes!<br/><br/>t is amazing how Jennifer Lawrence can act as if she's acting (confused much?), when she try to be the Mockingjay icon of District 13. Her satire of a commercialized heroine (Think Captain America before he got to do some kick-ass action) was hilarious, yet she could make the audience feel the jabs of anger and pain when she flared up at the Capitol's bombing of the hospital, and when she saw what Peeta had went through despite everyone else's anger at Peeta's betrayal...<br/><br/>Read on: http://goo.gl/vYfG83"

Don't get me wrong I think this was a really well done cash grab up but I feel as though the last book Mockingjay part one and two could have been combined into one single movie.<br/><br/>With that out of the way I think this was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a really good job being Katiness Everdeen as the lead in this movie. The acting in this movie was very good all around and I really can't point to an actor and and say they had a bad performance. Some of the people cast in this movie made there roles in this movie more memorable then if it was a different actor. For example Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Julianne Moore as President Coin really add something to there roles which might not be present otherwise. The special effects were really good in this movie. I felt like I was really a part of this futuristic world. This was aided by excellent editing by Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa. I think the way they cut some of the more dramatic scenes in this movie really increased the suspense.<br/><br/>I think this was a great movie and is worth seeing but I think that the reason to make a Mockingjay 1 and 2 instead of just one movie is to make money. Granted 300 million dollars is a lot of money but I think artistically speaking this movie would have been better not split up between part one and two."
"mochamac","7","6","21","24 November 2014"," There is just enough quality and tension to keep this 'Part 1' afloat.
","Having obliterated the farcical games in a crescendo of glorious action, and being plucked to safety by rebels at the conclusion of Catching Fire, reluctant heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) now finds herself in District 13, a district previously thought destroyed. Determined to maintain the momentum of the rebel uprising, District 13 President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) & former game-maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) seek to make Katniss the symbol of the revolution or risk letting the unrest fizzle out completely. It is only when Katniss witnesses the Capitol's brutal destruction of her own District 12, that she realises where her anger should rightly be directed, and agrees to become the Mockingjay that Panem so deserves.<br/><br/>President Snow (Donald Sutherland), desperate to regain control, will go to any lengths to unhinge the Mockingjay's following and reestablish his supremacy. Snow continues his psychological games with Katniss, using Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) as his pawn to condemn the violence of the uprisings and plead for a ceasefire, making him increasingly unpopular among the districts. Snow then sentences anyone associated with the Mockingjay to death, putting Katniss in a cruel predicament.<br/><br/>Stellar performances by a heftily talented supporting cast certainly add needed value. It is intriguing to see how each character deals with their new circumstances from Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) reveling in his tech, to Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) suffering through prohibition and Effie (Elizabeth Banks) drowning in the life sucking grey of District 13, longing only for her vibrant wigs. Once again though, it is Lawrence's performance that warrants the most praise. Particularly powerful are the moments of sheer terror where the young lead pulls you so far in to Katniss' heart-wrenching emotion, that the pulsating dread within her becomes almost tangible.<br/><br/>The visuals are impressive, with the harsh, cold, military environment of District 13 juxtaposed well against the natural green splendor, which we catch mere glimpses of in this installment. Although seeing more of the outside world would likely lift the plot considerably, the feeling of entrapment that is brought about by the walls of District 13, and the rubble of obliterated districts 8 and 12, draw you further in to Katniss' desperate plight.<br/><br/>Suspenseful, intelligent, and with a lot to say politically, the series delves into a new genre with this instalment; the covert wars aspect allowing the audience to witness the mechanics of a revolution. The vital role propaganda plays in any conflict is explored when Katniss joins a group of defectors turned film crew, assigned the duty of capturing her most inspiring moments for broadcast across the districts. One noteworthy highlight is an incredibly moving speech from Finnick (Sam Claflin), which gives some gruesome insight into President Snow's vile secrets and what makes him tick.<br/><br/>There is just enough quality and tension in the nuanced, character driven plot to keep this film afloat, however, where devoted Hunger Games fans will likely be thoroughly satisfied, others may be left feeling somewhat underwhelmed. The film unfortunately falls into the seemingly unavoidable 'Part 1' trap; over promising but under delivering, in a routine attempt to beef up the final instalment with an abundance of juicy action. It is inevitable that the rebels will step out of the shadows in Part 2, and Katniss may once again be afforded the opportunity to display a level of self-sacrifice we all wish ourselves capable of replicating."

","This is my 100th Review on IMDb and I am glad I made it this far. But anyways, for this special review, I'm Doing Mockingjay Part 1 or as I like to call it: The Exposition Games.<br/><br/>So this time around, Katniss Everdeen is in this underground base where she is working with ex-members of the Capitol to start a Rebellion with all the districts against President Snow after the events of the last film. But OH NO! Peeta is Missing and He is Taken by the Capitol and is being brainwashed! What will they ever do?<br/><br/>So Basically the movie is a slow paced film that gives us LOTS of Exposition with not many thrills. The problem is that there is not much action. There is... maybe one or two action scenes in the whole entire movie and just a bunch of dialog that sets up the next movie. This makes you feel more like you are in a meeting that is going on for hours. But, the whole setting that takes place in this underground base of District 13 is great to be in. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence unfortunately for me, feels very floaty for me this time around. For most of the time in the movie, I feel she is blankly staring into space and doesn't want to be there. She gave more effort I felt in the last two movies but here, It feels like she is bored and just floats around. But that is just me.<br/><br/>The film has some good moments like the rebellion taking out the power supply of the Capitol. But the best and most powerful moment is when Katniss goes to the ruins of District 12 and finds a skull in the debris. That won me over. <br/><br/>All the actors did good for the most part including Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his last film role. I think that is all I have to say.<br/><br/>This really is what I think is a better installment than Catching Fire. Mostly because it got me to pay more attention. I have seen mixed reviews of the film and not everyone is going to like it even if they liked the first two. But see it for yourself to decide.<br/><br/>77/100 B"
"Eidet","7","7","26","21 November 2014"," A good third instalment, albeit a slow burner
","This last outing by Francis Lawrence, the third instalment in a film series of four, is set in the war-torn districts of Panem left shattered by the Capitol's armed forces in an attempt to strangle the rebellion caused by Katniss' latest Games. The film takes off where the last one ended and works as a build-up for what is to come in Part 2. Though the film works as a ""bridge"" it is quite engaging with its 2- hour runtime and does enough to keep the audience entertained.<br/><br/>The film works great as an adaptation because I felt the imagery of the film was almost identical to those I had made myself reading the book. This is something of a rarity, though I believe it is recurrent in the previous two instalments as well. As to potential errors with the transition from book to film, none were worth noting as far as I am concerned. The avid book fans will not be disappointed in other words.<br/><br/>Probably the single strongest selling point in ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is Jennifer Lawrence. She gives an overall good performance and though it is worth noting that this is not her best role till date, there are moments wherein she shines. Had Ms Lawrence been given more material with which to work, I am sure she would have taken opportune advantage of it. Additionally Liam Hemsworth in the role as Gale Hawthorne struck me as heartfelt and believable. The only casting choice I draw in question is Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin. I thought she gave a bland performance and I think the film would have benefited from another actress in her stead.<br/><br/>Although I liked the film, and thought Francis Lawrence did a decent job, I definitely believe that this is the weakest link in the series. The film does suffer from a lack of content that could have been averted by merging parts 1 & 2 in a longer cut. Some of the ""propos""- scenes were quite awkward at times although I grant they felt awkward reading too. Also, to my annoyance Ms Lawrence had a scene or two where her acting felt very forced and where I thought low credibility was being conveyed. This left me slightly less impressed by her acting in this particular film, but I thought she did a great job overall notwithstanding the flaws as aforementioned.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" is an entertaining teen film that will provide readers of the books with an accurate and satisfying rendering, and others that have not with a slight sense of disappointment perhaps. I enjoyed ""Mockingjay"" quite a lot, and although I acknowledge that it has its flaws, I would still recommend it. To call it one of the years best would be an overstatement, but it is however worth looking into."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","7","7","26","21 November 2014"," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 Review
","My Thoughts: First and foremost I am going to just try to focus on the movie and not how it relates to the book. Yes there are differences some major some minor, but we have been dealing with that since Hollywood took a book and converted it to the silver screen. There is no chance to ever get a book translated perfectly to the movies.<br/><br/>Okay that being said this movie falls into another category where Hollywood is so desperate to make money from their blockbuster movies that they needlessly take the last book in the series and split it in two. I think this started with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I could be mistaken. So what does that mean for these movies? It means that all we get in this movie is the work up to all the action that will happen in the second movie. Don't get me wrong this is a good movie but there is very little action taking place in this movie. And right when you know things are going to get good, fade to black and come back next year thank you for your $12.<br/><br/>This movie runs around two hours before you add in the previews and I wish I could say that they used all of those 120 minutes to good effect but they do not and so in a movie that is already slow we get these scenes that really do not help propel it further. I mean we as the audience already know that Katniss has love issues trying to choose between Gale or Peeta, but the simple fact that you are now the face of the Rebellion and they all believe you love Peeta you should probably tone down the way you behave around Gale. Though thank god the rebels have to much going on that they don't notice, except Gale who is finally coming to realize that Katniss will never be able to make that choice.<br/><br/>Look we know this movie isn't going to be the best of the four total movies when the last one comes out. This ones whole job is to transition us from how the last two films were set up to this civil war showdown in the final movie. Does it make it bad? No. You just have to set the expectations that this movie is more story driven vice action driven. And do not let me get you done there is some action taking place in this one, but just enough to keep you interested.<br/><br/>My Recommendation: <br/><br/>Really if you aren't that big a fan I would say wait until it comes out on DVD and watch it right before you go see the second part of Mockingjay."

","Hello everyone, I'm reviewing this movie as an assignment.<br/><br/>So first of all I don't like the Hunger Games series as a movie because it's a bit too much talking. Just like this movie. The first hour and 20 minutes it's just talking and lore but no action and then when the hunger games finally start it's only 20 minutes of action.<br/><br/>The thing I also don't like about this movie is just the weirdness to it like the fashion and the 'overexaggeration'.<br/><br/>So did I like the movie? Not really but it also isn't a bad movie... It's just not my type of movie but I understand people who read the book and found it amusing to watch."

","If you are expecting the same movie you've seen the past year, you are not gonna like this one. There are no Games this time.

You will see a good movie if you are a fan, and we wont be able to see much action scenes on this one, but that's not important because if you are a fan, the movie will keep you entertained in every moment.<br/><br/>Loved the CGI and acting.

"InMyHonestOpinion","6","4","13","26 December 2014"," A nice little build up before the ultimate end game
","Why at the moment and for the past few years have film studios, directors and marketing companies decided to turn the one film into the many? Why have they turned those great novels into a two or three part mini-series? You most likely have heard or even created your own theories as to why they keep doing this to us. For me it comes down to the cash income, the money they can not only make but save, it costs so many millions of dollars to make a movie so if you can make two films at once wouldn't it be rather absurd or perhaps even rude not to take that opportunity? I've heard a lot of people get quite aggressive when one film is split into two but just take a second and reflect as to why. Mockingjay Part One begins quite abruptly in fact I will say this, ensure you have seen the two earlier films ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" otherwise you will be left with a WTF is happening face for a good 30mins into this film. It almost feels it needed a ""Previously on the Hunger Games"" voice over just so we can recap what we may have forgotten, after all it's been a good twelve months since Catching Fire. It begins with Katniss Evergreen played by Jennifer Lawrence waking up after being rescued and in an underground bunker in District 13, there she meets President Alma Coin the Rebel leader played by Julianne Moore, she informs Katniss of the uprising against Central City and Panam's President Snow played by Donald Sutherland and how she want's Katniss to become the face behind the revolution. Katniss decides for her to become the face she needs to see for herself what has become of the districts while she has been away. She soon discovers that Peeta played by Josh Hutcherson her partner throughout the games so far is in Captiol City and has become the voice of President Snow and his mounting war against the rebels, in fact he has become the enemy Mockingjay is one of these films where they made two separate films at the one time, Mockingjay Part one and Mockingjay Part two. The tragic story behind this one though is the unexpected death of one very talented actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, I think one of the things a lot of people will go into the film is to see where or more to the point what scenes the late Mr. Hoffman wasn't around to finalise. Without giving anything away, you will not notice, for the simple reason he had one bit of dialogue left for Part One which they gave to another fine actor Elizabeth Banks who plays Effie Trinket one of my favourite characters throughout all the films so far and the very underutilised (in part one anyway) Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch Abernathy for his one left over scene in part two. Mockingjay part one is very much the buildup needed for the big and what will hopefully be massive conclusion that will come In part two, so in saying that the film itself lacks a lot of the action the previous two films had there is a lot of dialogue and build up in this movie, a little more character development for the main characters but not a lot else. There is a very heavy underlining good vs evil to the film for those who think way too much I'm sure you'll put the current world's crisis into the positions of the two parties rather than just enjoying what the film has to offer. It doesn't hold back though, the atrocities caused and the thousands murdered will only make you think about the ""what ifs."" I loved the way the director Francis Lawrence ( Constantine, I Am Legend, Catching Fire) created his two very separate worlds, when dealing with the citizens of Capitol City the colours where clean, bright, white, the lights the same, the surroundings rich and filled with stuff and things. Then when he is focusing on the districts the colour palate is dark, the people are brooding, they have flickering lights, gray walls, gray clothing, no makeup no hairstyling and nothing of any great importance but what keepsakes the individuals can carry. I thought that was a great way to tell the two different sides of the story. I enjoyed Mockingjay part one and if being completely honest I really wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did knowing there was Part two to come still and would no doubt be left with some silly cliffhanger for the next year. If you're a fan of the series so far I'd say be sure to see it, just watch the previous films sometime before hand. If you're not a fan get the first two films first and watch them before seeing this one, it is a pretty good series so far and you're only missing out."
"david-meldrum","7","5","19","1 December 2014"," A change of tone from the first two, but gripping and engaging nonetheless
","It's a tough gig adapting much-loved books for the screen, especially if the one you're dealing with is generally seen as the weakest in an overwhelmingly popular series. That's the ground we are on with this, the third of the Hunger Games movies. The third and final book in the trilogy seems to be the least regarded by fans (I haven't read them myself); and with the now almost inevitable decision having been taken to split the final story into two films, one could argue that the film-makers have made a rod for their own backs.<br/><br/>I really liked both of the first films. They were witty, exciting, disturbing and though treading similar ground managed to deal with sufficiently different narrative and thematic material to suggest to effect a meaningful progression between the two. This third film marks a narrative departure: there's no central motif of gladiator-style combat-as-entertainment to build central action sequences around. Instead, we're in the territory where a Katniss-fronted revolution is being plotted whilst Peeta remains behind in the Captiol, apparently manipulated into being a spokesperson for the Big Brother style-regime. Instead of intense action thriller we have what amounts to an intense and involving political thriller, this time taking the politicising of the media into its satirical and thematic spotlight. There's good action sequences as well, but this isn't an action movie in the sense of the other two.<br/><br/>That's where disappointment may kick in for some viewers. It's a big call for a major franchise like this one to change its tone so drastically mid-stream; I can't think of another major series of films that makes such an obvious leap. Without emotional investment in the source, I was utterly compelled by it – I remained swept up in the dystopian wold of the film; Jennifer Lawrence's central performance remains a strong, engaging and layered one; the supporting players are all decent, with a special poignant mention for the characteristically studied depth of Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>When the film does need to move into action sequences, it does so very well – the last major such passage being a standout, effectively inter-cut with dialogue and character. Therein lies these films' consistent strengths; these are blockbusters aimed at the vaunted young adult market which prove a timeless truth – that if a film (or book, or music, or) is constructed with enough intelligence and substance, there's no limiting the market. If this has lost the shock value of the first two films' central ideas, it's gained space to breathe and worm into the consciousness. We'll only be able to really judge if splitting the last instalment in two has worked this time next year; for now this may be the least immediately powerful of the three so far, but it's by no means a dip in the quality of the series."
"loisarcari","8","7","30","29 November 2014"," Somehow; it worked
","First; my experience of the movie while I was watching it; Lawrence acted well; if a little forced at times; the emotional acting rather than dialogue was generally well delivered. The scope and magnitude of the effects and cinematography was absolutely amazing; creating a very raw and believable world; and the other thing I adored was the action and empathy of this movie in stark contrast with one another; the action was very well done for a female led film; which, finally, with this franchise have decided not to skimp on that element. I agree not too much happened, but I was wrapped up the setting and the excellent portrayal of emotional fragility and mental illness to care; and while it may have been overlong in itself, I think each individual scene was as long as it needed to be. My only qualms are the overall pacing, at a push, the moments when Jennifer Lawrence did feel forced, and the under use of the brilliant supporting cast, and god did the romance underwhelm me. However; the depth of the visuals and emotional pull did win this over for me."

","I'm a fan of Asian extreme political commentary movies, but I was in no way a die hard The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 fan. I saw the original, was impressed, but that was about it. When I heard about this carbon copy I was immediately disgusted with the idea of why the people who make movies at the level of 'Sharknado' would try to remake such an iconic classic in the dytopian world. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it. I have never been more angry with a movie. Imagine Titanic being remade, but the ship doesn't sink and everyone lives happily ever after. That is what they did to this movie. I was blown away by how literally EVERY scene and plot point this movie is known for was neutered entirely. I know remakes tend to change some details for the audience of that country etc, but they basically wrote a whole new Twilight subplot 30 minutes in. This would have been far better off if they took their plot of 'BFF's live happily ever after' and just made an original movie. Worst excuse for a remake, I knew they wouldn't do BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM justice, but this was just pathetic."
"jboothmillard","8","2","5","4 December 2015"," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1
","This film series based on the popular three part book series has become a big hype, the first film was very good, and the second film was brilliant, the producers decided there like the last Harry Potter that the final instalment had enough material to split the final film into two parts, this is the first part, directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine, I Am Legend, Water for Elephants). Basically in the dystopian future world of Panem, following the events of the 75th Hunger Games, where the arena was destroyed, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and fellow victors Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) have been taken to supposedly non-existent independent District 13, isolated from the rest of Panem, that has been leading a rebellion, there Katniss is reunited with her Mother (Paula Malcomson) and sister Primrose ""Prim"" (Willow Shields). While recuperating Katniss is introduced to rebel leader President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), who tells her actions in the arena sparked riots and strikes against the Capitol, they ask her to become the ""Mockingjay"", the symbol of the rebellion, as part of their ""hearts and minds"" strategy. Katniss refuses because she is angry her portrayed lover and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) was left behind in the arena, she changes her mind after visiting the ruins of District 12, bombed by the Capitol, and seeing Peeta alive on television is being used by the Capitol to put an end to the rebellion, Katniss agrees to become the Mockingjay, on the condition that Peeta and the other victors are rescued and pardoned, and her sister can keep her cat. Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) knows that Katniss thrives on being spontaneous, she is dressed up in a specially-designed outfit and given redesigned bow and arrow weaponry, her stylist is Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), her bodyguard is close friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), and her film team is led by Capitol escapee Cressida (Natalie Dormer). Katniss cannot create a convincing promotion film in the studio, so she and the film crew go out to District 8, they conclude filming in a hospital, but it is bombed by a Capitol squadron, killing everyone inside, in rage Katniss delivers a rousing speech to camera, Beetee hijacks the Capitol's news feed to broadcast it to all districts, after the broadcast an entire team of Peacekeepers are killed with hidden land mines by District 7 strikers. The team see a weakened Peeta on a television, after this they go back to District 12, Gale tells the story of its destruction, Katniss is filmed singing ""The Hanging Tree"", soon after hundreds of protesters in District 5 are singing the same anthem, and launch a suicidal human wave attack. The attack is successful in destroying the hydroelectric dam, the Capitol's primary source of electricity, this causes the Capitol to have a power surge and revert to backup power, weakening their ability to broadcast propaganda. That night, Katniss watches for Games presenter Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) interviewing Peeta, former Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Coin hijack the signal to show a clip of Katniss, Peeta sees it and realises she is alive, he suddenly shouts a warning that the Capitol will attack District 13, Coin orders an evacuation into the underground shelters. Prim is nearly locked out going back for her cat, but everyone manages to get inside safely, the facility survives the attack unharmed, returning to the surface the area has been littered with white roses, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) has sent them to taunt Katniss, she presumes he will kill Peeta. Coin dispatches an elite special forces team, including Gale, to infiltrate the Capitol's Tribute centre and rescue Peeta, along with remaining victors Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Annie Cresta (Stef Dawson), from their prison. The rescue is successful, but when Katniss goes to reunite with Peeta he unexpectedly attacks her, she is strangled until unconscious, Boggs (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) knocks Peeta out, Katniss waking in the medical facility is informed that Peeta has suffered physical and mental torture, he has been ""hijacked"", brainwashed to want to kill her, using psychological terror created by tracker jacker venom. Peeta is strapped and held in solitary confinement, a serum is being developed to reverse the effects of the ""hijacking"", the film ends with Coin announcing the successful victors rescue, and that their next objective is in the ravines on District 2, the Capitol's principal military stronghold. Also starring Robert Knepper as Antonius, Evan Ross as Messalla, Elden Henson as Pollux and Patina Miller as Commander Paylor. Lawrence is a great actress and she becomes much more fascinating and determined to go against the threat to humanity, Hutcherson does well being both vulnerable and tortured, Sutherland is a much more dastardly bastard, Moore is a great new edition to the cast, and Hoffman, who sadly died during production, remains terrific in his final performance. The special effects are excellent, there are no Games and no love story this time, the exciting scenes are those on the battlefield with explosions all over the place, the war drama and character interactions are good narratives, the song by Lawrence is moving, and the song ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" by Lorde in the end credits is good as well, this high octane film will definitely urge you to see the conclusion, a fantastic futuristic action adventure thriller. Very good!"

I can't see how they god the idea of splitting it into two parts.<br/><br/>As I liked the first 2 movies I feel like this third one is a bit out of place. Maybe it shouldn't have been made.

"brando647","7","2","5","7 November 2015"," The First MOCKINGJAY Feels Like a Major Departure for the Franchise
","The saga of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the growing rebellion against the capitol of the fictional nation Panem continues in THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART I. A franchise aimed to teenaged girls and, here I am, three movies deep and undoubtedly going to watch the grand finale. Movies based on young adult novels generally send me running (I've never seen the Twilight movies or the Divergent movies, and I never intend to), but I can't deny that this series is actually done really, really well. I actually really enjoyed CATCHING FIRE (the second of the series) and it got me excited to see this one. The movie begins immediately after the previous events, where we saw Katniss being airlifted out of the Quarter Quell games after literally blowing the lid off the whole operation with an electrified arrow that shorted out the force field around the game field. We rejoin her in the mythical District 13; thought to be an unlivable wasteland following a previous rebellion, District 13 operates in tight military fashion from underground bunkers. Far from dead, the inhabitants are going strong and planning the next move against the Capitol. Support for the rebellion is growing in the other districts despite President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) declaration that any sign of dissent be eliminated with extreme prejudice. Now the rebellion wants to rally the people together under the symbol of the Mockingjay/Katniss. But Katniss is suffering a bit of post-traumatic stress from the games and she's worried about Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who we know had been left behind following Katniss's rescue. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the beginning of the end, where Katniss must rise up to meet her responsibility as a figurehead for rebellion even if it means earning President Snow's personal vengeance.<br/><br/>First impression of MOCKINGJAY 1, it's a major departure in style from the previous two movies. HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE were vibrant films, with bright colors all over the scenes in the Capitol and then the beautifully shot wilderness in the course of the games. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the depressing opposite. This is a movie about flickering remains of hope and it wants you to feel the same oppressive dread as the inhabitants of District 13. Gone is the bright wilderness in favor of underground concrete bunkers where the population all wears drab blue jumpsuits. Even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the series' resident peacock and Katniss's personal attendant from the Games, is neutered, relegated to patchwork jumpsuits and scarves. All of the beautiful imagery of the Capitol's effluence is gone so that the audience can be brought down the reality of their suffering. While the first two films would probably be considered action/adventure with science fiction elements, MOCKINGJAY 1 is a war film (with sci-fi elements). No joke, this is a war film closer in spirit to PLATOON or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (though, of course, toned way down as to be appropriate for a younger audience). We confront the realities of conflict such as refugees, collateral damage, and self-sacrifice for the common good. It's nuts and nothing like I expected. At one point, Snow callously orders the bombing of a refugee hospital in one of the districts and we're right there with Katniss as, after everything she's already been through, she watches the incineration of men, women, and children and can do nothing to stop it. Heavy stuff for a teen movie.<br/><br/>These movies have, no doubt, made Jennifer Lawrence's career. She is a talented woman and these movies brought her into the spotlight where she was able to latch on to bigger and better things; yet she still continues to return to the character that brought her to the top of her game and she still gives it her all. Katniss, in MOCKINGJAY 1, is at her worst. She's mentally-broken, she's terrified for Peeta, and she is constantly reminded of the pressure on her shoulders as the one person who can unite the districts against the Capitol. In the previous movies, she's shown the strength and conviction of her character but now she's getting angry. Lawrence handles it all effortlessly and brings the viewer along with her in what serves as her character's big transformation. On these same lines, it's worth mentioning the pedigree of acting talent these movies attract. In addition to the returning cast from previous movies (including Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Jeffrey Wright, and Philip Seymour Hoffman), MOCKINGJAY 1 adds Julianne Moore as President Coin, head of District 13 and the rebellion. She's the no-nonsense sort who oversees operations in 13 with military precision, but her intentions seem pure. She recognizes the importance of Katniss's involvement but she's rightfully hesitant at first to put all her faith into one girl and risk everything she's accomplished so far. Hoffman and Liam Hemsworth get upgraded to larger roles. Hoffman (as Plutarch Heavensbee) has betrayed the Capitol and operates as Coin's head of propaganda, and Hemsworth (as Gale, Katniss's former flame from her time in District 12) is now a militant rebel intent on doing his part in bringing down Snow. Having been out of the picture during Katniss's time in the Games, the two of them reconnect but he's no longer interested in pursuing their relationship as a) he's got more important things to worry about now and b) Katniss has obviously developed feelings for Peeta. This not-quite-love-triangle is mercifully given little screen time whereas other young adult movies would probably make it the focus.<br/><br/>MOCKINGJAY 1 is a drastic departure from the tone of the first two movies and I wouldn't be surprised to find out it may've turned off some of the younger viewers. It's a pretty good film but you can tell it's just killing time until MOCKINGJAY 2 for the big final battle. Despite some pacing flaws and the general aura of depression, it's a nice lead-in to the final act and an interesting progression for the franchise."
"sunshinebeachcinema","6","2","5","8 September 2015"," The revolution will be televised!
","With the presumably thrilling conclusion to The Hunger Games series just over the horizon, we return to last year's Mockingjay – Part 1 in an attempt for my reviews to maintain at least some contemporary relevance. There are two ways to look at a film which is part of a series. One is to view it as a chapter in the larger story, making this one little more than the calm before the storm. The other way is to see if the narrative works as a standalone film, and sadly here it does not.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games has followed the now 'traditional' trend of turning the last part of a young adult novel series into a two part picture (Harry Potter, Twilight, to an extent The Hobbit) so that Part 1 becomes so much preamble and set-up for a 'missing' final act. Is it a cynical cash-grab to stretch the franchise out for another year, or sincere attempt to do justice to the literature? Who can say?<br/><br/>With Mockingjay – Part 2, this effect is thoroughly in place, moving from one relatively unsatisfying cliff-hanger at the end of Catching Fire to another at the end of itself. It somehow manages to be another big ol' film of (just) over two hours, although it's almost half an hour shorter than Catching Fire, which took over half its running time to actually get to the bloomin' Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Though the full title retains the series banner, there are no games here, so the arena combat angle that provided a clear structure to the first two films is gone. Maybe that's for the best. The second film was in many ways a retread of the first, though the pre-game ruminations I've just lamented were really about the seeds of rebellion, and our heroine Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her Mockingjay becoming the symbols of the revolution (the Mockingjay starts life as a symbolic token Katniss is given by an elderly neighbour in the first film, which gradually takes on greater and greater significance).<br/><br/>So it's not a standalone story, but what's this film about, and where does it take the characters we met in the last two films? At first glance, not very far. Most of the movie takes place in an underground bunker where the rebellion is based, safe below District 13 (a mysterious place previously believed to have been long destroyed), while the two sides throw propaganda back and forth at each other. Katniss does get out into the field, but she only fires one arrow (although granted, it does quite some damage).<br/><br/>But at the film's core is this media warfare of hearts and minds, and Katniss' initial reluctance to play into it. Her struggle is to weigh the needs of the many, who see so much in her, against her own personal losses and dissatisfaction with how the revolution is being run. She is always asking who should have been saved, and at what cost?<br/><br/>The film inherits the great cast of the series, from Jennifer Lawrence herself, whose name is now synonymous with the franchise and characters, to the continued presence of Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks, who play off each other nicely after their frosty relationship of the last two films. What is good is that as we spend more time out of the area with the rebels, somehow-third-billed Gale (Liam Hemsworth) finally has a little more to do, getting out into the field with Katniss and even leading one of the film's few action sequences, a daring raid on the capital to liberate the captured victors of Catching Fire.<br/><br/>Similarly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who tragically died during filming, manages to maintain a complete and worthy presence as the games master turned rebel propagandist. He receives a dedication at the end of a film, and one wonders how his absence will affect Part 2. His more reasoned encouragement of Katniss brings a subtle reserve to offset the fiery determination of District 13 President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) who is all rousing speeches and lack of compromise, continually at loggerheads with our heroine. Much of the first third of the film is her coercive (and Hoffman's measured) attempts to make her agree to participate in the propaganda; though we ask ourselves how different this really is to the gaudy reality TV of the first film.<br/><br/>Everybody has their own two cents to say on how the revolution should be run, but on the other side of the coin (see what I did there?) President Snow (Donald Sutherland) abandons his affable façade in the face of all out war to snarl and gloat from the video screen.<br/><br/>I have said that true action sequences are few and far between; they are dispersed like raisins in a bowl of porridge through the film's inflated length, but they come as a re-engaging wake up call. I particularly enjoyed the scenes of open rebellion in other Districts, as it is always exciting to see such a well realised world explored in more depth, all the more so when a large chunk of the movie is set underground.<br/><br/>These scenes also show how returning Catching Fire director Francis Lawrence has finally shaken off the assumed atmosphere of his predecessor Gary Ross' first film to deliver the darker sequel suggested by his back catalogue (Constantine, I am Legend). Of note is the apocalyptic sequence in which Katniss breaks down while exploring the ruins of her former home, District 12. The Hunger Games universe has always come with a high human cost, but never has it been so graphic.<br/><br/>So while the film is well made and there are many standout scenes, the pacing still feels slow and the dramatic narrative is far from satisfying. After all, it's really only half a film and will only work when we're marathoning that stuff on box set next year."

","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a good movie! It is thought provoking and raw. I am a fan of the books, and this movie is about 80 percent book. In my opinion, it was a little more faithful than the other two due to the last book being split into two films. It is also better than the book.<br/><br/>Most people will say that this movie is pointless. That it was boring. That it should not have been split into two films. These people are wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is slow, but that is for the buildup leading into part 2. This is all about Katniss accepting the role as the Mockingjay. She has started the revolution. She knows now that she must lead the districts into rebellion against President Snow. In fact, the districts are rebelling now more than ever, and the war has started. She is in district 13, a district thought destroyed long ago. They have been underground this whole time though, and been planning for the war.<br/><br/>This movie is different than the other two. it is darker. It is now transitioning into a war movie. Part 2 will be an even bigger war movie.<br/><br/>As for Katniss' romantic involvement, we know now who she is mostly in love with. Will he ever be the same though now that he has been hijacked and wants to kill Katniss?<br/><br/>Let the takedown of President Snow continue! In Part 2 will be an all-out war and invading the capitol. Time for snow to go!"

","When Lionsgate told us that the Mocingjay book is going to be split into two films I was very curios about how the part one will look-like and when I saw it I was very satisfied!<br/><br/>The movie is not the best of the three i must say, but this movie gives the franchise a meaning and explains us the political side of war and how a leader or a symbol can unite us - and that is what the movie is mostly about! <br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of the movie lacks of action but i wasn't surprised or disappointed because also in the first two films we don't get to see a real action till the games start. The movie's plot surrounds especially about the propagandas that the rebels make with Katniss that shows a different aspect of Jennifer's acting which i was very impressed by the way!<br/><br/>In my opinion there are 2 reasons why this movie is good: First, the actors are acting great in this film especially Jennifer's. Second, the plot is not boring like a lot of people say! the few action scenes are powerful and thrilling - which I didn't really feel in the first two movies. And the political information that we get about the war is also very interesting ! For example, we can see that all the real attacks are sort of planed by district 13, we can see it when right after every scene with Katniss's propaganda we see the rebels attack by Katniss lines or even singing.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hunger Games Mocingjay P.1 succeed to reach the franchise's high level and in some scenes even to transcend it! if you liked the previous films most likely you will like it also!"
"jogre17","7","2","5","24 July 2015"," Not the best... But still worth the watch for those who like the books.
","One thing I believe people should always do before they go see a movie is to go in there with not much expectation of a movie. Many of the reviewers here went to see this movie expecting it to be awesome and were disappointed or didn't expect it to be that great and thus saw all the faults rather than the strengths that still brought the movie to light. I am a huge fan of both the books and the movies and am always going to see plenty of movies when I can. My review isn't just my thoughts and opinions, but more of an influence on why you should give the movie a chance.<br/><br/>First, we should focus on what a lot of movie goers want in a film and how you should approach this movie. If you haven't read the series, it may seem like Jennifer Lawrence is a terrible actor, when in reality that's just her role in the film. Pick up the book and read it and you will understand her part a lot better. The dialogue may come across as weak, but you need to understand what is going on a bit by reading the book. You won't get a full understanding until then, because the book is from Katniss' point of view and you are reading her thoughts and feelings the whole time. Also, a lot of you people may be all about the action, fighting, and explosions. If that's really all you look for in a movie, then you don't know what you're talking about this being a bad movie.<br/><br/>When you look at it from the book's perspective, you get your typical book to film movie. Hollywood almost never takes a book word for word and screws something up that people don't like. I'll admit there were definitely parts that they cut out of the book that I think they shouldn't have, but they did add things in for some of you just movie goers so you will understand what's going on a little better. The one thing I liked about the movie when comparing it to the book is that it still grabs the main and general concept of the first half of the book. The book is by far the weakest of the 3 in the trilogy in a sense that it is drawn out a bit and may come across a as boring sometimes, but when you look down deep enough it does have a strong story. The story is definitely still being told in the movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but like the book it had it moments when it was a little boring. All these other reviews are strongly exaggerated with how boring and how stupid and pointless the movie is, but they are all just opinions. Also, there are always trollers who just hate everything so you can't always trust what other people think. Watch the movie for yourself and develop your opinion on the movie.<br/><br/>I give this title 7 stars for a decent movie of a decent book."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","4","14","22 November 2014"," Good movie, not exactly a happy experience . . .
","It is amazing that by the time The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 end that its heroine, Katniss Everdeen, isn't locked in a padded cell. Here is a woman whose been through two kill-or-be-killed tournaments, who has watched her people die one by one, and then finds herself cast in the role of leading a revolution against the oppressive government. The weight of these events appear unmistakably in a face filled with tears and pain and doubt. That she doesn't crack under the pressure is to her credit. That I didn't crack under the movie's weight is to my credit.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is a gloomy and unremitting experience, a movie so sour that afterwards you want to go watch a dopey comedy just to get your mind right. This not a commentary on the quality of the film, but on the material itself. Suzanne Collins did not write a happy story and director Francis Lawrence is happy to comply. In this second sequel we are now past The Hunger Games and well into the revolution, the war is on, and many will fall. Brother will kill brother and blood will be spilled.<br/><br/>That's . . . entertainment?! The movie picks up almost immediately where Catching Fire left off with Katniss now being groomed to lead a revolution against the national government that is hell-bent on keeping the huddled masses in their place. The revolutionaries led Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philliip Seymour Hoffman) have moved underground and Katniss is still getting use to her place in the grand scheme of things. The story that is presented here is more or less a game of cat and mouse. The oppressed set off a series of moves and countermoves in order to knock a dent in the government's military power while Katniss deals with the possible fate of her on-screen lover Peeta who is being propped up as a tool of the government.<br/><br/>The story is more complicated than it needs to be. What makes the works is its scale. Much of this movie is shot in tight close-ups and cramped quarters. We don't see a lot of the government's military attaché, and that's a good thing – it gives us a sense that we're just as in the dark as the heroes.<br/><br/>Those scenes work. What doesn't work is the dialogue. It's hard to get close to any of the supporting players because the dialogue is flat and utilitarian and only exists to further the plot along. Its no fun to listen to these people talk. The only person who breaks the staleness is Elizabeth Banks as The Hunger Games former P.R. director Effie Trinket. She wasn't in this part of the book, but her role here is expanded to give the movie some much-needed levity. She's fun, but sadly her scenes are woefully short.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is Jennifer Lawrence. It is to her credit that she manages to spend the entire film looking as if she's just survived a plane crash, and she does it with a lot of conviction. That's just the right note. Katniss is an otherwise normal person who has been through more heartache and pain than should be asked of anyone; and yet has been pegged as being the salvation of all around her. That's a burden, and the terrified look on her face gives us doubt that she can pull it off. She isn't confident, she isn't bold, she isn't brave. She's been through the ringer and now she has a job to do that she clearly isn't ready for. It would have been wrong to give Katniss some kind of false heroic burst. The fact that she is unsure of her role here gives weight to Lawrence's performance.<br/><br/>I confess that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is not a bad movie, just a sad and joyless one. I liked some of it's elements, but it's so dark and unyielding I didn't feel good when it was over. This is not a happy experience and, in truth, this whole series has been like that. Again, it's the material, not the execution. Suzanne Collins did not write a story that offered a lot of levity. On the page, it worked, but in a movie it's such a downer that you walk out in a sour mood."
"Seraphion","7","5","21","24 November 2014"," A lot less action, still a nice continuance to the story
","Continuing right after the last scene of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), Katniss finds herself now among the rebels in District 13, or at least what's left of it on the surface. Plutarch and the rebels take her to meet The rebellion leader President Coin who asks her to be the rebellion's symbol, The Mockingjay, to incite the remaining districts to unite in rising up against the Capitol. Still in shock that nobody tells her or Peeta about the whole op and also remorseful from losing Peeta, Katniss eventually agrees after being shown the destruction of her home in District 12, but she demands the rescue of Peeta, Annie and Joanna. They then try to shoot propaganda videos to air to all of Panem, but to not wholeheartedly by from Katniss. Meanwhile, The Capitol already airs it's own propaganda with Peeta in it. After Haymitch's suggestion, the rebels send Katnis, Gale and a camera crew to the torn District 8. The crew get Katniss's emotion in the hospital and the rebel fighters' spirit for seeing her. But The Capitol gets word of Katnis being there and sends bombers on her and the hospital. Using her modified arrows from Beetee, Katniss shoots down the bombers, and is then overwhelmed by emotions when seeing the hospital's burning remnants. The footage, with Katniss' unscripted tag-line ""If we burn, you burn with us!"", translates into a great fire in the hearts of the Districts, inciting sabotages all around. <br/><br/>The Capitol reacted with another Peeta video, this time holding a white rose and addressing Katniss personally to stop the rebellion. As Katniss suggested, they revisit District 12 for another video to show to Peeta. This time, Katniss sing an unscripted song ""Necklace of Rope/Hope"" that becomes the anthem of the rebellion. Some rebels in District 5 blow off the power plant dam, disabling power to The Capitol. In response, Peeta is aired live for another propaganda. But Beetee manages to hack the system and mix the song footage in it. Peeta is caught on air as seeing it and soon shouts out a warning that Capitol bombers are heading to 13. After safely securing everybody in the bunker, President Coin decides to wait out the attacks since apparently The Capitol forces doesn't know about the upgraded situation of the underground District 13. After the attacks, the rebels ask Katniss to make a response video stating that she, District 13 and the rebellion is still alive. But she breaks down after seeing the heap of white roses, Snow's sign that he's going to kill Peeta soon. A rescue attempt is then set up, with Gale volunteering for it. The team's hovercraft flies past The Capitol's disabled guns while power there hasn't been restored. But suddenly power is restored, and the rebels lost radio communications to the rescue team. Katniss then quickly asks to air herself to speak to Snow, in order to buy time for the rescue team. But even after some talk, Snow reveals he knows about the rescue team and then cuts the connection. After some time, The team returns safely with Peeta, Annie and Joanna. But Gale says he couldn't get why the active guns didn't shoot at them. Katniss goes to see Peeta, but he suddenly tries to kill her. It turns out that Peeta is brainwashed by The Capitol to kill Katniss.<br/><br/>The story nicely captures and focuses more on the emotional and propagandistic side of the saga's chapter. I think it's proved that the decision to split the final book the saga into two movies is actually the smart move to do. Although I should say that the movie becomes really lacking in the action side, especially in comparison with it's predecessors, at least the movie kept itself as a significant part of the entire saga.<br/><br/>That said, I also want emphasize on the fact that this movie lacks very much on the action side. This becomes even more visible when we compare it to the previous two movies of the novel trilogy's adaptation. There's only practically the District 8 hospital bombing scene which has enough to taste as an adequate action sequence. Yet even that only consists of a short duration, and there's only one scene where Katniss really shoots with her bow. <br/><br/>However, the movie does realize this as a consequence of splitting the book into two movies. The producers really tries to capitalize on the other aspect of the book's 'calm before the storm' part. The emotional content, the psychological warfare and propaganda feels rightly as the movie's main and center ingredient. Although I must also note that in the span of two hours, the video and counter video storyline has the risk of becoming boring very soon. Yet again, the producers make the content of the Katniss videos very intriguing in this adaptation.Moreover, the the ending's twist proves to be a nice link to the second part as it ensures the curiosity of viewers, especially those like me who haven't read the books yet.<br/><br/>The acting side is quite a nice overall. It can live up to the acting quality of the precious films. Although I must admit that for me Jennifer Lawrence's performance isn't that much intriguing as what she did in the first movie. Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hofman and Woody Harrelson nicely give their performance a good notch to live up to the saga, connecting the story nicely amidst all those dying characters.<br/><br/>Overall for me The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) is a 7 out of 10 score movie. An entertainment it surely is, and a good adaptation of the continuance of the story. Yet I should also warn you that some people may feel this movie a bit different than the previous Hunger Games movies due to the lack of action in it."

","I loved this movie. The acting was wonderful and the story was great but then again I haven't read the books in about 3 years. I think that for the movie series it was really good. I would go back to the movies and see it again. If you go and see it and your on team Peeta (unlike me team gale) I would suggest taking a box of tissues with you. The song hanging tree is now one of my favorites and it's still stuck in my head even though I saw the movie the second day it came out.I wish that they hadn't split the book into 2 parts, although i'm glad they did. Without them splitting it into 2 parts it might not have been as good. They really should have added the lizard type things from the book. I really want to see what happens with the second part and am very excited. I think the actors did a pretty good job once again. 10/10."

","Having successfully completed the games, Katniss Everdeen is back and under the supervision of District 13's President Coin (Julianne Moore), Katniss becomes the Mockingjay and is intent on rescuing Peta (Josh Hutcherson) from the evil clutches of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and The Capitol. In the interim period, she rallies round the various districts to let them know that she is back and also to drum up as much support as possible in order to take on The Capitol.<br/><br/>If I'm totally honest I'm not a massive fan of The Hunger Games - I thought that the first film was OK and thought that the second film was a slight improvement over the first film. I went in with positive expectations hoping that this film would be a slight notch up on the second film (or equally as good at worst), but unfortunately it isn't and it's definitely the weakest offering so far.<br/><br/>There is a REALLY long and slow build up where we essentially see Katniss visiting the various districts making several propaganda type videos in order to try to unite the districts and get her help to take on The Capitol. It's an interesting change of direction from the first 2 films, but the problem is the propaganda aspect is all that there really is to the film. Considering Katniss & the districts are meant to be at war with The Capitol it might have been nice to have a bit more action, a few fights, more confrontation etc. It really did just feel like 2 hours of talking and not much else.<br/><br/>I was also a little disappointed with some of the characters in the third film; Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson were real standouts in the previous films whereas in this film there were merely shadows of themselves. Harrelson was an alcoholic in the previous films and his character being sober in this film made his character a lot less fun. I'm not criticising Banks & Harrelson's acting, but merely felt that their characters were a little more flat in this film.<br/><br/>The star of the show here is Lawrence and the more films that I see her in the more I like her as an actress. As this franchise has progressed, I think that her performance has got better with every passing film (she's been excellent elsewhere too). The likes of Snow and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman offer good support, but aren't really given much to do. This is Lawrence's show and she shined brightly amidst all the tedium.<br/><br/>Aside from the strong performances by the cast there's little else to recommend here. It was basically a long, repetitive and boring film with very little action, tension, conflict or excitement."

","There are some complains that they say this third film has less action scenes than the previous ones. Well, I guess the actual Hunger Games is missing. I feel the same way but drama overrides action here. Substance weighs heavier than style in this third entry in the series.<br/><br/>Katniss arrives in the catacombs of District 13, which people believe is destroyed by the Capitol. The rebellion is rising, and it asks for her volunteerism. Meanwhile, her loved ones are captured by President Snow.<br/><br/>I love how the actors are great. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson really shine in this movie. There are less action scenes, but there's more setting buildup, especially for District 13, a new location. I love how Lawrence tries her best to sing ""The Hanging Tree"", the rebellion song from the book. It's nice she did herself instead of passing it to other professional singers. I applaud her dedication. Give her a Grammy! Haha! <br/><br/>Splitting the book into two movies has allowed more room for the story. If you read the book, you'll appreciate it a lot."

","It's a lot different to the other Hunger Games in more ways than acceptable. One of the most notable is that they've really stripped down their signature High Fashion costume design and the film ends up looking like a World War Nazi film. It's not a train smash but I know lots of people who were turned off by it. Most agree, the first film was and is still the best. It seems the more they produce the more they lose that spark we all fell in love with. And sadly, the more people are starting to fall off the bus.<br/><br/>Strangely, the hype is still there but after every film, we still wonder why. The franchise is not catching fire - it's dying out slowly. But even so, they leave us hungry for more. Particularly in this effort: the first part of Mocking Jay. But sadly after two long hours, the only real memorable part, is the end. Or rather, the last 5min when Peeta's back. And not because he's back (you need to watch it to know why - can't spoil it for you). Jennifer Lawrence, not so exciting anymore; Suspense, lacking; action, it was there but it didn't quite hit the mark.<br/><br/>Hey, it's noticeably far better than ""Divergent"". But something's missing. Something's seriously missing! Can't quite put my finger on it. But I suppose everybody's tired and wants to bring it to an end. I guess it's about time. Do I recommend it? You can go without seeing it and still live."

","""I wish she was dead. I wish they were all dead and we were too. It would be best.""<br/><br/>Ushers in another crucial build to the story so gripping that it would leave you waiting for more. Francis Lawrence who brought us amazing movies like I Am Legend and Constantine, also the previous instalment, who is also going to do the next (Whoopie), is still magnificent underneath the direction cap. His frames are slow, the focusing and the feeling kind, and at the same time extremely powerful. The impact that he makes whilst an actor delivers his lines is a beauty to perceive.<br/><br/>Words fail to describe the acting prowess of Jennifer Lawrence. She has this grave demeanour that she carries which at once rivets you to the screen. She is still very dramatic and exhumes the right kind of emotional vibes. And boy! the song she sings is just beautiful! The Hanging Tree. Ah! So powerful and just so right! She carries it gorgeously without any music.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games might be over but the perversion of President Snow is still extant. He pervades like Poison and delivers the ultimate blow just like it. We see a lot of Gale here and some Finnick in agony. The screenplay puts all the right words in both their mouths. Even the score that goes in the background is captivating.<br/><br/>Mockingjay is a brilliant depiction of the amazing Suzanne Collins series and the finest kind of drama you would ever see, and Lawrence, both the actor and the director, do justice to it. Can't wait for the final chapter.<br/><br/>PS: Only for drama lovers and The Hunger Games followers. Nothing here for action buffs."
"jmcd2007","7","4","17","27 November 2014"," A Surprisingly Good Film!
","First things first, I would not label myself as a huge Hunger Games fan by any means, and I have also never read the book series, but I went to see this film with a friend, in which I also saw the first film with him as well. It should also be mentioned, though, that this film takes place directly after the events of the last film in the series, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" unto which I'll admit that I did not see, but was rather filled in by my friend as to what happened in between the first Hunger Games film and this one. While I initially expected to see the usual heavy battle sequences and so forth, I was pleasantly surprised to see something quite different from the previous films. Gone were the usual moderate action sequences of Katniss and her crew incessantly fighting and killing others from rival Districts in order to survive and advance. In my opinion, that got sorely repetitive in the first installment, which also seemed to go along slowly, but since this is the Hunger Games, they were probably just trying to stay true to the book. In any case, with this film, the Director somehow managed (and succeeded) in compensating less action for more intense dialogue and a gripping story plot that has Katniss deemed the ""Mockingjay"" of her District, while acting in defiance against the Capitol, led by a very ruthless President Snow who dares Katniss to try and stop him. At the same time, Katniss also attempts to rescue Peeta, who exhibits a different demeanor toward her, from the clutches of a rival District, only to find him strapped to a hospital gurney at the end of the film, thrashing about like a wild animal. My only compliant of this film, however, is that they shouldn't have broken it up into two parts. Granted, if they didn't, I'm sure the film would have had an impressively long running time. Moreover, I know some of these filmmakers love to string their audiences along with cliffhangers, but this film felt rather incomplete in that sense. Oh well, I guess that's what Part 2 is for. Hats off to the cast and crew on this one, though, for you now have my interest on the next and final film in this series."
"QuietConspiracy","7","4","17","23 November 2014"," The Good, Bad, and Ugly of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1
","After seeing the movie last night, I left with the following set of things on the Good, Bad, and Ugly lists:<br/><br/>The Good: -Excellent acting on Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, and Julianne Moore's parts (and everyone else, too; they're just the ones who stood out the most). -Great visuals (the lighting emphasizes the movie's overall darker tone, plus the exploding hovercraft was pretty awesome). -The additions of two scenes that weren't in the book that gave a deeper look into how the revolution was unfolding in the districts. -The expansion of the victors' rescue from the Capitol. -Accurate to the book, for the most part.<br/><br/>The Bad: -The plot COULD NOT gotten any slower. Seriously, a slightly longer one- movie finale could have been plausible albeit probably a little rushed plot-wise. -Slightly unhappy with how it ended, but I respect the screenwriters' choice. -The lighting, while helping the mood/tone, made parts of the movie harder to follow.<br/><br/>The Ugly: -The strangulation scene from the book goes in full-stop, and gets quite disturbing. If the majority of readers weren't still too young to watch R-rated movies, this scene (and one or two others) might have bumped the rating up. For any parents thinking of taking a tween (10-12 year old) to see this, just keep this in mind.<br/><br/>Overall, the Bad and Ugly didn't detract too much from the movie, and it would have received an 8/10 in my book had the ending been different."
"ClaytonDavis","7","7","37","19 November 2014"," The franchise continues to grow...
","Are you anxiously awaiting the coming of the ""Mockingjay?""<br/><br/>The YA (Young Adult) universe has been taking over cinema screens for years now. ""Twilight"" dominated the box office for its run while ""Harry Potter"" brought in more money than they knew what to do with. ""The Hunger Games"" took on a new phase of the genre, appealing to not only the young people it so desperately needed for box office results, but keeping the older viewers/parents of these movie-goers interested. The next installment of the franchise, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,"" is a purely entertaining set piece for what will likely be a most intriguing finale.<br/><br/>The obvious quarrel with the film is the splitting into two separate movies. ""Harry Potter"" coined this tactic with ""The Deathly Hallows,"" breaking them into two films to maximize box office potential. ""Twilight"" soon followed with ""Breaking Dawn."" This installment is probably the least bloated out of any of the franchises seen yet. It feels legitimately focused on the development of the characters and the surroundings they are now inhabiting.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss from a whole new perspective. The film takes place just a short time after the events of ""Catching Fire."" Katniss is living in District 13, angry and in despair after losing Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in Quarter Quell. To add, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has revealed that District 12 has been destroyed. Only 950 of 10,000 survived the raid and Katniss is asked to be the face of the revolution that is now rising against the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland). When Peeta is revealed to be alive and being held in the Capitol, Katniss must wage war against Snow, with the rebels, and try desperately to save Peeta.<br/><br/>Lawrence continues to develop Katniss and bring us on her journey with a believable and authentic nature. Katniss is very broken in this installment, weakened by the events that preceded her, and Lawrence executes it just about flawlessly. The real surprise, is how effective Hutcherson and Hemsworth are this time around. Their roles are expanded, and they are offered an opportunity to showcase some very real and heartbreaking moments. Especially Hutcherson, who sheds all the annoyance he embodied in the first film, and brings a new life and lust to his eyes. I was quite taken by what he was doing and where's going.<br/><br/>the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-sliceDonald Sutherland is a fantastic villain. The ying to Katniss' yang, the two are practically in an abusive love affair and it works tremendously. They're the two opposite spectrums of this new world where war rages on and the dead are not necessarily the unlikely ones. Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman are equally amazing in good measure of their respective roles. The pinnacle of the performers, and has been for this entire franchise is Elizabeth Banks. As Effie, she's embodied a soul plucked from her normal environment and thrust into the battle grounds of something she doesn't fully understand. Her appearances are both funny but impeccably warm. I hope people notice how vital and important she's been to the franchise, which should lead her to more vital and vivacious roles in the future.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence makes artistic choices that keep the audience at arm's length. Some of it is deliberate to hide things I'm sure we will know in the next installment. Some of it, is deathly obvious, bringing suspicion and tension to characters we know are going to be forces to be reckoned with. For the most part, everything is standard filmmaking. Something as massively popular as this needs to be to get the widest audience possible. I do wonder if that wasn't the focus on Lionsgate, and if they attempted to be more gritty with the material, show the destruction and blood of the people, and go up to an 'R' rating, if this isn't elevated significantly? Can only wonder.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is very satisfying. Setting the chess pieces of what is destined to be an epic finale, it's one of the best things you can bring your family these upcoming weeks leading to the holiday season.

","First off, this is part of a series. If you haven't seen the previous films (or read the books) you will be hopelessly lost. There is no flashback to bring you up to date.<br/><br/>This film picks up where the last one leaves off. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is recruited to be the face of the rebellion. She is reluctant until it becomes personal. Happy content people don't pick fights. The film consists of a propaganda war between Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and the government and Katniss and the rebels/terrorists/anarchists/freedom fighters. It finishes on an up note...sort of.<br/><br/>The film delves into the problems of a rebellion and the need for a war of words to convince hearts and minds. In many ways I like this film more than the previous ones, especially the second one which was just a filler film to get us to the rebellion. I think of the second film as ""Star Wars Episode 2"" but less annoying. My apologies to the president of the Jar Jar Binks fan club.<br/><br/>In this film, I now see why Jennifer Lawrence was needed for the series as she transforms from reality TV star to a person who runs a gauntlet of emotions: fear, despair, terror, panic, hopelessness, and pretending she can't act. Clearly she nailed it as only she can.<br/><br/>The film had a number of memorable lines:<br/><br/>""My sister gets to keep her cat."" was great. It demonstrates that the rebellion is about her personal life and that it takes priority over any cause...for better or worse.<br/><br/>""Best dressed rebel in history."" Shows some mindless priorities.<br/><br/>""Prepare to pay the ultimate price.""<br/><br/>And with sadly Philip Seymour Hoffman says, ""Anyone can be replaced.""<br/><br/>Katniss takes a crossbow to a gun fight. It makes for good fiction, but seriously?<br/><br/>If you have seen the other two, you are going to watch this one too.<br/><br/>Guide: No bad language, sex, or nudity."

","For my review of these two movies, I'm going to be treating them as one movie and copy/pasting this review onto both movies.

The first half is all filler while the second half is a series of semi-violent sequences of poorly choreographed action in between more boring filler. For the most part these movie are very predictable. Anything that is unpredictable is only made so due to the level of stupidity involved. I'm not sure if I can stress enough how much of this movie is boring filler. <br/><br/>Characters - None of the actors really care anymore. The guy who plays Haymitch is still enjoyable, but he's a minor character. The characters are all as boring and idiotic and simplistic as they always were.<br/><br/>Cinematography - The whole look of this movie is just as bad as the previous movies, but at some points its even worse. <br/><br/>There isn't really anything to say about this movie.

","It's finally here! The last chapter to the popular Hunger Games movie series that broke literary sales records, made Jennifer Lawrence's career and influenced young girls everywhere to take up archery is finally coming to a close... well sort of. This is only part 1 of the final chapter. In it's infinite wisdom, Lionsgate films has decided to take the Harry Potter route in finishing off the Hunger Games series. What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said about the second to last Harry Potter movie? Some may call this film a necessary bridge to the final chapter of the series, others may call it a gradual build to something far grander in scale than what we've seen before in other Hunger Games films. Some may say that but the fact of the matter is, this movie is just plain old fashioned filler. Trust me, I've read the books and the only thing you're seeing in this film is pure filler. I don't think I'm giving anything away by telling you that The third book of the Hunger Games saga depicts the events of a massive war between the capital and the other districts but it's not ALL just a battle, there are quite a few pieces of plot that need to occur leading up to the epic spectacle of war, things that the makers of the Hunger Games film series would rather just get out of the way than have them share the spotlight with what is sure to be the special effects event of fall 2015.<br/><br/>I could go on and tell you about everything else in the film as far as the cast and the story and the special effects but honestly, nothing has changed since the last film. Everyone does a good job and the film ends up where it needs to be but the overarching feeling behind it all is that it all of it adds up to being just a bunch of Hollywood BS stretching out projects for no reason. There's no real reason for this movie to exist, everything that happens here could have been explained in the first 20-30 minutes for the most part, Lionsgate just decided that they wanted to line their coffers with a little more coin before this franchise ends. Eh, who can blame them. Money is money after all. Unfortunately it doesn't add up to a very entertaining ride for everyone else in the theater.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're a fan of The Hunger Games films, you're seeing this for only one reason, to get to part 4 where the real action is. If you're just a casual fan, I'd say read the back of the DVD case or the wiki synopsis and hell, just watch the trailer and prepare yourself for part 4 because that's what you should be paying to see, not this. Perhaps I'll have a different opinion of the series once part 2 of Mocking Jay comes out, but as it stands right now on it's own, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 gets a 2.5...out of 5"

That was a decsion made in Hollywood by a studio looking to double and milk every last dime out of its blockbuster franchise. The suits probably thought ""Hey it worked out well for Twilight and Harry Potter, so why not us?"" You can't blame them for wanting to keep the good times rolling. But it's a pretty cynical business plan, and it's led to a film that feels needlessly padded. Mockingjay Part 1 is like someone in my school doing a paper and there is a limit you need to get too and they just want too jack it up. This is very disappointing because the previous chapter Catching fire, I thought exceeded the first film and helped the franchise, cause I did not like the first film it's a battle royal rip off. Catching Fire though gave the main character Katniss played excellently by Jennifer Lawerence into a brainy badass. Now she is become passive. The film picks up after the incendiary conclusion of catching Fire's Quarter Quell, when Katniss was rescued and brought to the rebels, underground fortress in District 13. Here, the anti-capital leaders plot their next strike against president Snow(Donald Sutherland), hatching a plan to turn Katniss into fiery symbol of the resistance in a propaganda war as their secret weapon known as the mockingjay. The film is interesting, the suffering this film has is that to me I felt bored while watching this latest entire in the hunger games series. The performances are ultimately what kept me me invested and interested in what was going on, but the script feels like such a jumbled mess that I didn't care what was going on. I suppose director Francis Lawerence and writers Peter Craig and Danny Strong deserve some credit for daring to sneak any political cheekiness into a movie that's as big and corporate as this. But overall their hands are tied too tightly. While the series' second film had better character development, Mockingjay is mostly bound to the bleak and claustrophobic bowels of a bunker. It suffocates the film. And when the story does get interesting and you know something important is about to happen the movie ends. That's not a cliff-hanger that's a tease. I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 a two and a half out of five."

","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 (2014): Dir: Francis Lawrence / Cast: Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman: Inferior yet tense sequel about counter moves. Katniss Everdeen is sought after to lead the revolution against the Capital. She is angry since Peeta Mellark was captured by the Capital at the conclusion of the previous film. She is shocked at the brainwashing used on Peeta in his media footage where he attempts to convince the remaining districts to end their revolution. While tension exist, the film lacks action to the point where there is only two or three such scenes including Katniss downing a fighter plane with her archery skills. Viewers are likely tiring of these books expanding into two or more movies that comes off as a cheap money grab than worthy entertainment. Francis Lawrence is back as director and is backed with tremendous production. Jennifer Lawrence remains a strong presence as determined Katiss whose focus is on the safety of Peeta. Josh Hutcherson goes through a brainwashing as Peeta that turns lethal by third act. Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne is always overwhelmed as being the third wheel of a love triangle. Thankfully here he is given more to work with as he takes a risk for Peeta despite what the results romantically will be. Unfortunately supporting roles seem placed in a spot just to have them employed. Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman play leaders in the revolution whose roles are cardboard. While lacking the energy and intensity of the first two films, it still bridges the gap to part 2 effectively. Score: 7 Â½ / 10"
"gretsch-89824","Null","1","2","20 April 2015"," The Albatross In The Room ...
","My summary above is what I feel should have been the proper title of the film. The Albatross being the character of Peeta, and the ridiculous focus on such a weakly written part which dragged this entire episode down, wasting a ton of surrounding talent in the process.<br/><br/>It's difficult to complain about the actor when the part of Peeta (and especially invoking that character for anything more than a fleeting love interest of a momentarily distracted teenage girl while being caught up in something of much larger concern), the most weakly scripted and seriously undercast element of the whole series to begin with, was actually made the focus of this film. I can't even tell if Peeta was supposed to be the ""focus"" of the film or not, but there's no question that anything to do with this character was a major distraction throughout. By any good sense of scripting, he was (or certainly should have been) conveniently gone before this latest episode. But, no ....<br/><br/>So we have at hand; Donald Sutherland, Jeffry Wright, Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, oh yeah, Jennifer Lawrence in there too. But this whole episode had to play like a broken record around; Peeta. The fact that the producer/writer/director ""club of cluelessness"" had to rub it in our noses in the final scene didn't help at all.<br/><br/>Is anybody else's forehead as sore as mine as result of banging into the table or desk at such a complete waste? If you're going to write such a weak part, then get try to get someone who has at least a slight chance of being a future Colin Farrel or Ewan McGregor or somebody like that to play the part, if you are involving all this other talent. It's not like any other characters or scenarios in this movie involved anything like 'great script writing.' It's just for entertainment, we know that to start with. But you just can't have a guy made for soap operas or teen movies trying to keep up with the others in this movie in this scenario, in this inappropriate role.<br/><br/>Aside from the mis-casting, I just don't understand the author or script writers imposing this ""teen love"" aspect into the series beyond the first two episodes at all. There was nothing in the Catching Fire episode that convinced any audience there was any genuine 'love' from Katniss towards Peeta that was anything other than showing appreciation and taking pity. But now she's ready to drag down the entire revolution and its cause for sake of ... I don't know, you tell me.<br/><br/>A guy who would do OK in soap operas and secondary roles in standard sitcoms.<br/><br/>This ""teen love"" thing is just hard to explain, innit?"
"homdeb1058","8","5","24","2 December 2014"," I Thought It Was Just Fine
","Not sure what all the complaining is about. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I put it on at least the same level as Catching Fire and maybe a little higher. It was somewhat of a relief not to have to go back to the arena (which I felt both times that Katniss got off easy not having to murder close friends and allies to survive). Having heard that it was short on action, I was satisfied that it had a decent balance between action, drama, and plot progression. I had a few bones to pick along the way, mainly about scenes that seemed overly dramatic and tried a little too hard to pull at the viewers heartstrings, but overall, came away satisfied. I give it an 8 of 10."

","I think that Hunger games has had some bias reviews on part I. I thought the movie was great overall. The beginning was slow but after awhile the acting caught up and it was great! The second half of the movie left me feeling like it was worth admission despite the slow beginning. I think that the second half of the movie left you wondering what was going to happen next as everything seemed to come to a head. The secrets and action from the second half of the movie made up for the slow beginning (why were the prisoners released?). I recommend this movie to someone but would like to remind them that the first 10 minutes maybe slow.<br/><br/>My vote of 8 is because of the slow beginning and I think it deserved higher then a 3 or 4 because the rest of the movie leaves much to be anticipated in a sequel."

","The Hunger Games, when it first arrived I bet everyone thought it would just another ""Twilight"" genre film. Oh how wrong they were, instead of sparkly vampires we are given necks being snapped and poisoned foliage. So I suppose the reel question is with this being Part 1 will it be a Desolation of Lawrence or a Battle of 13 Districts? Mockingjay has something so much deeper locked inside of it's run time than what is produced. Considering the film now after watching it and having time to think, it has so many ideas and themes. It articulates them so precisely and so subtly that it's only with distance can we truly understand how measured a movie this is. Here is a film that comments on every single major issue in our society simultaneously. The film talks about fashion and our own personal image, racism and decimation, oppression and slavery and so much more. For that alone, it deserves to be seen by all, for it's cultural significance in our world, but that's not it's only success.<br/><br/>The film also succeeds as a film. It's true that a film that's all comment and no action would be a documentary, and Monckingjay isn't that, Monckingjay is a film that feels like a grand sceptical, it knows how important it is to fan. It has clearly learnt from Harry Potter, which is the benchmark for adaption fandom, and it just about reaches it. This is from a director who hasn't really had a good success rate with adaptions from other mediums, his previous work includes Constantine and I Am Legend, however it looks as if Francis Lawrence has became stronger over time and I can honestly say that Mockingjay is one of the strongest films I have seen all year.<br/><br/>See the problem with Mockingjay (and in fact any 2 part film) is that you have to split the movie in two, and you have to give people a reason to come back for more. Mockingjay does this perfectly. Having read the books I would have split the film exactly where the film does, and the final movements are nothing short of spectacular. It leaves the stakes high and many questions hanging in the air, as soon as the credits roll you only want to know one thing, what happens next? (and let me reassure you the best is yet to come) I should say that Mockingjay is probably more of a drama in comparison to the other 2 films which were more action, but this is how the book is, and at no point feels forced, but more like a logical evolutionary step in what would happen after the events in Catching Fire.<br/><br/>I could list of all the cast and explain how they now inhabit those roles, but what would be the point? We all know it anyway, however it should be said that the stand out cast members are Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson, both of who's stark contrast in previous movies are what brings the reality of the message of the film home to us.<br/><br/>Mockingjay is violent, and savage, it is brutal and nasty. It is also gripping and beautiful and one of the best films I have seen this year. It is superior to other films in it's genre in just about every way that could matter."

","It is a common misconception among people who never read the series, that all the books are similar and simply about the games. They don't realize that the games are just a small part of what is happening in Suzanne Collins futuristic world of Panem. If you've only seen the first film, and you're thinking that the rest are just the same thing in another setting, you couldn't be more wrong. Normally I would give a synopsis of the story before I review the film, but it's difficult to do without spoilers, so I will say, that Mockingjay couldn't be more different than the other films/books. There are no games, but the story does follow some of the people you met in the games. Once again, this film is like a page for page telling of the book in such a way that I've never seen before or since. When you read a book, often times you get pictures in your head of people, places, and things. When those films are transferred to the screen, most of the time, what you pictured in your head is not what you're seeing on the screen. The Hunger Games is different, because it really is like Suzanne Collins was in my head when I was reading the book and transferred my thoughts to film. It's what I loved about the first two films, and that hasn't changed in the third movie, despite a new Director. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence stars and continues to be the perfect choice to play Katniss Everdeen. Years ago, when I first read the Hunger Games books, I thought to myself that if this ever became a movie Jennifer Lawrence would be the perfect choice to play Katniss and apparently Collins had the same thought. Lawrence is the focus of the film and with all of America and Panem watching her, the Mockingjay shines, as both the face of innocence and as a leader to her people. I've read a lot of books before I've seen their film adaptations, but never has a story jumped so vividly from the pages to the screen. This series continues to be exciting, inspiring, and just plain terrific. If you're the kind of person who is turned off by sequels, don't let that stop you from catching up with the Hunger Games, because every film is just as good, if not better than the film before it."
"ferguson-6","6","4","20","27 November 2014"," The Hanging Tree
","Greetings again from the darkness. I'm now even further removed from the target demographics than for the first two Hunger Games movies. Regardless, I have read Suzanne Collins' trilogy and have now seen the 3 movies based on her books. Oh, wait. There will be FOUR movies, not three, from her source material. By definition, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is a warm-up act ... it's setting the stage for the finale which will be released in one year.<br/><br/>So for this one we get a Hunger Games movie with no Hunger Games. In fact, there is very little combat action at all. Instead, we are witness to the strategic planning and ""selling"" of a war (think Wag the Dog), replete with short promo videos featuring Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) as the Mockingjay ... the rallying symbol of the rebels. There is a terrific scene featuring four great actors: Jennifer Lawrence, Julianne Moore (as President Coin), Jeffrey Wright (as Beetee) and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Plutarch). Four great actors in harmony elevating a movie based on YA novels. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>With no Hunger Games, the color palette of the film is almost entirely grays and browns. Even Julianne Moore's famous red tresses are toned down to a streaked gray. The bleak look reminds of the Metropolis set, and also makes President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) vivid white wardrobe and beard stand in contrast to rest. Mr. Sutherland has another juicy scene flashing his devilish grin and twinkle. He's another example of the perfect casting, which extends to Elizabeth Banks (Effie), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Stanley Tucci, and Mahershala Ali (as Boggs). You should expect much less Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) this time, but a little more Gale (Liam Hemsworth).<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence proves again that her recurring role as Katniss is underrated from an acting perspective. She is now best known as an Oscar winner, but that doesn't affect the sincerity, emotion and tenacity that she exhibits here.<br/><br/>This ending of Part 1 feels a bit awkward, but the break comes at the right time considering how the book is written. If you are a fan of the franchise, just accept that you will be buying a ticket for this move as well as next year's finale."
"ZChrisJ1995","7","4","20","27 November 2014"," The inevitable calm before the storm
","The Games may be over, but the revolution is just beginning. ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" repeats the same formula present in many of these current two-part adaptations of popular literary works: a slow-paced, exposition-laden first half that will be undoubtedly contrasted with its fiery, action-driven conclusion due to be released next year. Although the decision to do this makes ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" so far the weakest in the Hunger Games quadrilogy, solid performances and an overbearing sense of dread still make ""Part 1"" a worthy installment in the dystopian series. <br/><br/>As the twelve districts amass against the oppressive Capitol, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself being used as a propaganda tool to garner support for the revolutionaries. She also finds her loyalties divided between those she is being encouraged to inspire, and those who are held captive in the Capitol, including friend/love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson).<br/><br/>Like with the previous two productions, much of the film's success rests on Lawrence's more-than-capable shoulders. Her character shifts effortlessly back and forth from a reluctant victim of circumstance to a full-fledged freedom fighter. The actress can be just as dedicated in roles such as these as to those for which she has been Oscar-nominated (Winter's Bone, Silver Linings Playbook). Many of the other previously prominent characters, such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Peeta, are relegated largely to the sidelines in this installment, though they surely will receive their fair share of moments in the concluding entry. <br/><br/>By taking a much slower, introspective approach, the film is perhaps able to reach a much deeper form of social and political commentary, as well as further insight into Katniss' now even more flawed psyche. Clear comparisons can be drawn between the turbulent climate Katniss is thrust into and the current relationships between first and third-world civilizations. Though this setting already provides an unnerving cinematic experience, the similarities displayed in real life make it all the more closer to home. <br/><br/>The decision to split the final book adaptation into two films inevitably deprives ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" of a sufficient third act. We get a great build-up, but no pay-off, something which will unfortunately have to wait until next year. However, as far as build-ups go, ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" does the job well, refamiliarizing its audience with the chaotic world of Panem, its pivotal characters, as well as effectively raising the stakes for 2015's even-more-anticipated climax."

","Although this installment of the final chapter of the Hunger Games movie did not entirely pick up where it left off and just gave an idea of what happened instead, I think this is by far the best of all the previous installment of the film. There were some dead moments and although I still can't get over the Big Brother scenes where serious moments would have to be captured on tape for the Capitol and other districts to watch, I still think, Jennifer's reputation in Hollywood helped pull more audience than before. Julianne Moore as Madam president is so beautiful she is distracting in a good way. <br/><br/>The story on how a heroic heart of an ordinary girl with compassion to her fellowmen and how it inspires many to stand up against abuse of power and dictatorship is inspiring in itself. The effects were better than the previous ones, the characters are more engaged and the story just kept getting better.

It had emotion and humor mixed well. The story however is slow, probably too slow for some, but the great performances save the day. Jennifer Lawrence, Philip Seymour Hoffman are especially good. Not to forget other cast members.<br/><br/>The movie also gave some wonderful moments. Partly thanks to the great soundtrack by James Newton Howard. I noticed some parts of the soundtrack to be the same from the first film and it was great that they used some of the same music because the first Hunger Games film's soundtrack was amazing.<br/><br/>The movie will need the second part however and I am looking forward to it. The part 2 will surely make this one look better on some viewer's eyes as well.<br/><br/>Concerning the source material. To those who have read the books: I think this movie stays more true to the source material than the earlier ones. Even more than Catching Fire.

","It's so great that they've gotten beyond the arena and are now telling the story of a real war in progress! The best part of this film by far are the action sequences, such as the great lumberjack revolt and the assault on the Hoover Dam. And the ""Hanging Tree"" song and sequence was really moving and gave you a brief glimpse of what this series is always trying to pull off but never actually delivers. <br/><br/>The problem is, Katniss is still too passive to carry a story that involves nonstop action. In fact the name of this movie might as well be ""Hunger Games: Pining for Peeta"" because that's all she ever really does. And the love triangle remains really awkward and absent any real sexual tension, probably because the target audience is twelve years old. (""You kissed me because I'm in pain."" You're not the only one, pal. You're not the only one!) <br/><br/>At the heart of this series is a fundamental flaw. The film makers want to have it both ways, sending a vaguely populist message while sneering at the great unwashed. In the story, we're told that when Our Girl talks, the common people listen, and that once they get on their hind legs there's no stopping them. Yet we're also told, in a very smug, nudge-nudge, wink-wink sort of way, that the people will never really listen to Our Girl UNLESS she has the right gown, the right hair, the right makeup, etc. etc. It's patronizing and it really grates on you after the fifth or sixth time. The old Hollywood did this kind of thing with much more class, without the condescension. <br/><br/>Speaking of the old Hollywood, I must really be getting old, because all through this film I kept closing my eyes and pretending I was watching ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland (heroic outlaws in the woods bring down a tyrant) or else ""Casablanca"" with Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid.

The visuals got an upgrade, having the best CGI of the series. The action scenes were intense and exciting, which has become a staple for the series. It IS called ""The Hunger Games"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the compliments stop there. As much as I tried to take away the fact that it is only the first part, there were some aspects that just felt off. First, the rest of the characters. With Katniss, Plutarch and Coin being great in the film, everyone else felt expendable. Characters like Natalie Dormer's Cressida and even Finnick and Gale weren't relevant enough in the film to care about them. Also, there were a lot of slow moments in the film, especially near the beginning. You'll be on the edge of your seat...waiting for the movie to get rolling. Even when it does get going, it's rather unfulfilling. It is a big propaganda piece that I think that feminists might really enjoy, as it deals with Katniss fighting the government. That's not a bad thing, but it is something to note. The thing that really brings it down is the fact that it is split into to two parts. With the book being a little longer that ""Catching Fire"", it doesn't seem right to split it apart other than for the almighty dollar. It's just a cash grab, but a successful cash grab, with the movie grossing $245 million. <br/><br/>""Mockingjay"" isn't the best ""Hunger Games"" movie ever. It's not the best movie of the year (""Guardians"" holds that title). But it's not horrible. It has good things, but is completely overshadowed by it's flaws. I still recommend at least one watch, but just one. If you like it, then fine. I wasn't a fan of the first part."

","After reading the critics reception of this film I was really fearful that I would get robbed by another filler movie. I was, however, pleasantly surprised with how well the movie treated its source material, and in particular the complexities of the characters.<br/><br/>There are a few things people need to understand, in order to enjoy this movie. This trilogy (3rd and 4th films are technically one film) is not Battle Royale. That film was good, and there is a similar core concept. But the Hunger Games never was Battle Royale.<br/><br/>This is an important distinction because The hunger Games has always concentrated much more on subtle character developments, and this becomes the Mockingjay's primary focus.<br/><br/>The film has never been merely about survival in the arena, this was only ever part of a much wider picture. I you have not appreciated the politics and power play going on, I assume you are unlikely to appreciate this film.<br/><br/>Mockingjay focuses on the reality of what the characters go through in times of war and accurately brakes the characters down to their core. before rebuilding (some of) them.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have criticised Katniss, for he perpetual focus on Peeta. However Katniss is a very selfish character, she always has been. She is focused on the people that she loves as her primary motivation. <br/><br/>The other side of her personality is her natural reaction to things. This movie is as much about that (emotional) battle, as it is about the conflict with the Capital. If you don't like how this can pull one way or the other, then this will likely bug you.<br/><br/>Others suffer in their own unique ways. I feel if subtleties are lost on you, then you won't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I feel people might not warm to the movie as it is just a continuation. There is not traditional beginning, middle and end. Some people need this structure in the movie to feel like it is moving in a direction, and not just repeating itself. (note:this point was originally brought up by CBG19 on youtube)<br/><br/>I like this movie because I enjoy the politics, I enjoy the accurate representation of how war can breakdown people, I do not think this trilogy has been all about the arena, I enjoy the subtle character developments, and I don't need a traditional story structure.<br/><br/>I hope you see this movie and enjoy it as much as I did."
"juandangelo","6","3","15","26 November 2014"," It was OK
","The movie starts at a slow pace and that pace is kept. There are more actions scenes at a great scale... but the tempo of the movie is slow. There are some powerful scenes and Jennifer Lawrence shines through. Maybe she is not the Katniss Everdeen that you had in mind after you've read The Hunger Games Books. But she is good, she is good indeed. I was curious about Josh Hutcherson. In this third movie, his character is like a new territory, a wild one. I think, the actor was waiting for this new phase to start. This is his opportunity to shine. He has a very shocking scene and he delivers some very intense acting . But we have to wait to Mockingjay Part 2 to see more of Josh and if he can pull it off. There's a lot more of Liam Hemsworth. He is OK. He has the opportunity to show his acting skills. Julianne Moore is a very good Alma Coin, joyless, cunning and intimidating. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson are perfectly cast. The movie feels like a ""waiting room"" for the grand finale. It is a good movie though."
"ilikeimdb","9","4","23","5 December 2014"," Far better than the reviews let on
","First, I'm assuming that you've seen the other two Hunger Games movies...else there's not much point to sit through Mockingjay Part I (MJPT1). Second, I'm assuming that you're not a huge Transformers fan and/or didn't think that Pacific Rim nor Sharknado were the height of cinematic perfection. <br/><br/>After the first two movies, we already know a lot of back story and setup/conflict between Katniss and Pres Snow. Mockingjay PtI then introduces us to District 13 (her destination as mentioned at the end of Catching Fire) and the District 13 society (only lightly limned in MJPT1). We know there's a war coming and MJPT1 sticks to the story line as outlined in The HG book(s) to a great degree.<br/><br/>In terms of the movie and expectations, I never got the least bit bored nor did I feel I was just being dragged through Pt1 primarily to suck money out of me. There's a lot of there-there to be discussed, outlined, and philosophized about and, if you pay any attention, lots of action, too. Sure, this installment is a lot darker but that's how the story plays out. <br/><br/>If you compare the structure of THG to LOTR, you know what the protagonist has to do: The Capital is Mordor; Katniss is Frodo; she's the Mockingjay and he's the ring-barer. Neither has an enviable job -- just a sadly necessary, burdensome one. You know where Katniss eventually has to go and MJPT1 does an excellent job of setting this in motion."
"griffolyon12","10","5","32","21 November 2014"," Movie Review: ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1""
","Continuing the trend of Harry Potter and Twilight, the third and final Hunger Games book, Mockingjay, has been split into two movies because it's, ""So much story to be told in only one movie."" Yeah, I'll let the filmmakers live with that explanation as long as they make Mockingjay - Part 2 as good as they have Part 1.<br/><br/>Picking up literally right where Catching Fire left off, Mockingjay - Part 1 very quickly dispenses any pleasantries and jumps right back into Katniss's struggles and psyche, with Jennifer Lawrence once more proving that Katniss may just be her role of a lifetime. Katniss is now in the long thought destroyed, District 13, and is being used by their President as a figure to rally all of the other districts to rebellion against the Capitol. With war almost all but a certainty, Katniss still finds herself unwillingly thrust in this larger than life game for not only her life, but the lives of all those she cares for.<br/><br/>This is a film about war, not only the costs and horrors of war, but also the way that media and propaganda are used in war. Watching Katniss being directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee for a propaganda video they are making -- which is ridiculously stupid, yet authentic in the way our own media represents figureheads -- is one of the few genuinely funny scenes in what is a very tense two hour movie. As it is, what keeps you trucking through some of the horrors that these characters go through is the humanity of the characters and their little quirks that often lend themselves to a little laugh here or there to alleviate the tension happening all around them, because as I've already mentioned, this is a war film.<br/><br/>Mockingjay - Part 1 harbors shades of some of the great war films of the past few decades, with one scene in particular that reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty. These scenes, while being played out in a science fiction world, feel startlingly real because of the similarities that are easily seen between the world of Panem and our modern day world with all of our wars and injustices. However, this isn't an anti-war film, nor is it pro-war, it just shows the harsh realities of the world. <br/><br/>Sometimes we have to fight for the things that we cannot afford to lose. While peace is a great ideal, as long as there are those who are causing unrest and want to kill all who do not bow to their whims, wars will be fought. It was that idea that I thought was the most poignant thing about Suzanne Collins' book when I read it, and that is an idea that director Francis Lawrence and his screen writing team of Peter Craig and Danny Strong have managed to keep intact for the film. If The Hunger Games crew can continue to build off of the ideas presented here and deliver a moving finale next November, we may be looking at something genuinely special with Part 2. As for now, Part 1 is definitely worth the time of any fan of these books, films, or good science fiction stories in general."

It's a surprisingly well composed and well told story, and I was surprised to see that it is very effective in stirring up my emotions. Jennifer Lawrence is very good as the heroine, she has the amazing quality of being adorable and yet confident. She shows a wide and convincing range of emotions, and the way she speaks to the camera for the people is very passionate and stirs up the fire inside viewers.<br/><br/>It's a thrilling film they kept me on edge all the time.

I came out of the cinema completely amazed at how brilliant it was! Yes, its very different from the first two, however I think what makes this one stand out is the focus on character development.<br/><br/>There was never a point where I felt bored and I certainly couldn't say 'nothing happens'. I mean, did these people watch the same film??!! Despite not being the biggest Jennifer Lawrence fan I must admit her acting in this is outstanding.

"joncheskin","8","2","9","1 June 2015"," The Psychological Hunger Games
","The latest installment of the Hunger Games, Mockingjay, Part 1, is a movie that has caused a lot of controversy among its fans. Mockingjay, Part 1 picks up where Catching Fire left off, with the resistance having rescued Katniss but left Peeta to a potentially disturbing fate in the capitol. Katniss herself seems a bit disturbed--like it or not, her courage, compassion and honesty have left her as the face of the resistance--a role that she is clearly uncomfortable with. The movie is mostly a character study of her, as she balances her love for Peeta against her role as the Mockingjay, while also fighting the fact that she is still a very young woman. <br/><br/>I will first say, however, that I understand why people are upset about this movie. The spectacular action and cliff-hanging thrills of the first two movies are mostly gone. Those looking for the slick and admittedly thrilling tension of the teenage violence of the first two movies will miss it very much here.<br/><br/>That said, this movie is really interesting on its own merits, as it tries to do something both engaging and different. Mockingjay creates a sense of tension quite engaging for moviegoers who like character studies. Katniss has to decide, for example, does she really want to be the Mockingjay--ie, symbol of the resistance? The resistance is portrayed cleverly in the movie, as the good-guy, except that they too engage in a highly specious propaganda and behavior that seems more sketchy than meets the eye. <br/><br/>At the same time, Peeta is in the hands of the government, but he appears to have turned traitor to the resistance as the government uses him as a propaganda tool. Or has he turned traitor? The film is admirably not clear. What is clear, however, is that Katniss's actions, as the lightning rod of the resistance, could get him killed, so she has that weighing on her as well.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film's treatment of the notion of propaganda itself is ingenious--who would ever have conceived of a teenage movie on this topic? And yet, Mockingjay makes us understand how images can or cannot be manufactured for the purposes of swaying and deceiving a crowd. Much of the movie consists of the conflict of the resistance trying to produce effective propaganda--in other words, lies--from a character as relentlessly honest and principled as Katniss. This is again really interesting.<br/><br/>I realize that this movie is not for everyone, but I personally thought it might be the best of the three. Jennifer Lawrence plays it brilliantly, as a teenage girl constantly on the verge of coming unhinged (which is exactly what the movie is about), on the one hand overwhelmed by the awesome responsibilities that seemed to be thrust upon her, on the other hand a young woman in love trying to save her endangered beloved. Only Lawrence could do it, as she seems to possess some special quality of emotion or spirit that only 1 in 10000 people have. She walks through the movie actually torn apart by its conflicts (or at least she seems to!) and that in itself is really impressive."
"blakiepeterson","8","2","9","2 May 2015"," A Satisfying Addition To A Daring Blockbuster Franchise
","When the Lorde curated Mockingjay: Part 1 soundtrack came out a week prior to the film's premiere, it sent a wave of forewarning to the world. Listening to the album on Spotify with pulsating glee, I was surprised to find that amidst the various rappers, teen pop queens, and R&B crooners, the soundtrack exploded with the aura of rebellion and fire. So does the film.<br/><br/>There are no Hunger Games. There is no obvious cashgrabbing on display. Mockingjay has textures not seen in the previous films; it's more in sync with its political undertones and the thrills are no longer slightly fantastical. Like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Mockingjay Part 1 is a setup for what's to come. What's coming, it seems, is a finale more exciting and more finger-lickingly satisfying than one could ever believe. But Part 1 is hardly just a buffer.<br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) began simply as a sister to the rescue. But by this film, she's become a warrior, even if she isn't as can't-stop-won't-stop as Black Widow or Lara Croft. At the end of Catching Fire, we found that underneath all the sparkles of the most recent Hunger Games, the workings of a rebellion against the Capitol were coming to light; Katniss would become its symbol.<br/><br/>In Mockingjay, she's shaken, rattled and rolled. She's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and her beloved Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been claimed by the Capitol. Her home district, 12, was bombed, with only 45 survivors; both Katniss and the remaining fighters find themselves in District 13, which has been bound underground and is now being lead by the steely President Coin (Julianne Moore). Coin, along with enigmatic gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), are leading a massive uprising. Katniss will be the face, showing the other districts that turning the other cheek would be catastrophic.<br/><br/>Mockingjay doesn't need much of a setup — it moves along like a train off the rails. It doesn't have the slow development of its predecessors, having an everything-is-at-stake attitude that doesn't have time to take prisoners; it's more risky and painstaking than ever before. It's the best of the films, and certainly the smartest. It doesn't feel like a part of a billion-dollar franchise. It's a politically minded thriller that takes you by the throat and demands your attention.<br/><br/>Some have complained that there is a severe lack of action. Other have noticed that most of the characters are limited to the claustrophobic walls of District 13. But these are all things that make Mockingjay even better. Without so many brutal fights and faux exotic locales, we are giving a chance to dig deeper into Katniss' psyche, and Lawrence's stunning performance allows us to be compelled. District 13 serves as a reminder of how vulnerable the rest of the districts are to the powerful Capitol; even President Coin, with her monotone delivery and calm figure, seems unsure of what's to come.<br/><br/>Mockingjay: Part 1 is unpredictable, unshakeable, and teary. It's a work of fiction, but it somehow feels intimate, close to home. 1984 has always been scary, but there's an underlying understanding that our government would never become so totalitarian. But as we give up our privacy for protection these days, would the rosy evil of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) ever take over? Maybe not, but the film is confident enough to make us believe it. Part 2 may be a year away, but Part 1's heavy, dramatic attitude leaves an impression that has a rippling effect."
"brandtair","8","3","17","8 December 2014"," Its like you watch the real life world that good is the scenery
","In the beginning everything is kept small katniss has to adapt to the new situation and think about her role in this event. <br/><br/>Most science fiction films like this one have always made hospitals look sterile with totally white corridors and always feels unreal like 'maybe in the future but not possible in nearly 50 years'.<br/><br/>In the hunger games this is different the hospital and underground corridors are extremely realistic. It gives the feeling, if something like the the hunger games happened that the places you will get look exactly like this. <br/><br/>The first quarter of the movie some of the text comes directly out of the book and they left some background information out of the movie which makes it better to read the books before you watch the movie. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence,Liam Hemsworth and josh Hutcherson all played their role very well in this movie. Though Jennifer Lawrence was just awful playing like she had a nightmare she did everything else on a high level of acting. Josh Hutcherson didn't have so much acting to do most of the film. Though in the last twenty minutes of the film he proves to be a great actor.<br/><br/>The feelings the movie should give the audience is one of the only flaws in this movie. They didn't really get the cruelty enough in the picture and didn't made the audience really feel and thats why i didn't give this movie a 9."

","The Mockingjay is out of the Hunger Games arena but she is not done fighting. The third installment of the Hunger Games series diverges from the first two in that things have gotten a lot more serious. No longer is Katniss Everdeen simply trying to stay alive, she is now leading a cause, a revolution.<br/><br/>This is one of the main reasons I didn't like this movie as much. The root of it all is the book of course, which I read; so the book is a lot to blame. To be fair, I didn't really like book three as much as the first two, so it is quite possible that I was biased going into the movie. Be that as it is, Katniss was more likable as the girl on fire just trying to survive. Now she is the Mockingjay trying to incite and invigorate the people to action. Along with this character shift the movie was slow.<br/><br/>Mockingjay Part 1 was a build up movie in my opinion. The entire movie is setting the stage for the eventual battle between the rebels and the Capital. Not that they haven't been fighting already, but the stage is being set for an all out offensive. So, as a build up movie it was slow as to be expected. There were some exciting and active moments sprinkled in here and there, but the majority of the movie was very chess like. Like President Snow said, ""Moves and counter-moves."""

","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first https://www.fiverr.com/sumon1200 day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
"filipemanuelneto","8","1","3","3 May 2020"," It's worth it, but it's less interesting than the first films.
","This film is the third in the adaptation of the literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins, but, unlike the first two films, it brings only part of the last book to the cinema. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film.<br/><br/>In this film, we follow Katniss' first steps as a revolutionary. After being rescued from the arena and recovering from her injuries, she discovers that she is with a group of rebels, the same ones who allegedly lost the civil war seventy-five years earlier, the same ones who inhabit the supposedly extinct District 13. After all, everything was a lie. Everything was a manoeuvrer by Snow's regime to hide the existence of a strong movement of political contestation. Alma Coin, the head of the Resistance, asks for Katniss's support, wants her to become a symbol, a mascot. But she only thinks about the fate of her friends, especially Peeta, who is in Snow's power and seems to have been brainwashed.<br/><br/>Well, after the second film turned out to be excellent it was difficult to do better, but it was totally possible to match it. I don't think that happened, although it is very close. This continues to be an excellent film and to be within a standard that does not clash or belittle the other two. I just don't seem to have managed to be that good. To begin with, I hate when a film based on a book splits into two halves, it is almost always a sign that there is immense straw that could be perfectly removed in an editing room by a skilled editor. The film, in fact, drags a little more than those that preceded it, but if the audience gets involved in the story it ends up not even noticing much. It is also a film that has a lot of sci-fi, the most focused on that genre in all of tetralogy.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but it brings nothing that we have not seen. In addition, attempts to create a romantic plot around her character are weak and cold, whatever the target of Katniss's interest. Donald Sutherland continues to surprise and now gives us an almost perfect villain, in his megalomania, narcissism and thirst for control and power. He is truly an exceptional actor, at his best. Stanley Tucci was much more serious and restrained in the way he brought Cesar, a sensationalist TV host, to life, but it reveals how his character is just a puppet of the regime. Elizabeth Banks is an actress who reveals herself in this film, thanks to the profound mental and psychological transformation that her character will undergo here, and Woody Harrelson gains strength and seriousness, as she becomes one of the most fervent supporters of ""Mockingjay"". Julianne Moore alternates between contained sweetness and charismatic strength and presence; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are very good, but they don't do much more than they ask. Josh Hutcherson continues to sound weird, although in this film this is almost required by the character.<br/><br/>In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and costumes and great CGI and sound effects that make fights and combats seem like they want to get off the screen . The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.<br/><br/>Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent, although it is not as engaging and intense as the film that preceded it. It drags on more, some scenes seem to be expendable, but that's what happens when, for money, a book unfolds in two films."
"Phoenixphire81","9","1","3","16 July 2017"," Emotional and intense
","Fantastic film. Brilliant addition to the series even as part 1 of 2. Mockingjay has dispensed with the killing games of the 1st two instalments in favour of war, political power plays and the beginnings of a rebellion. There is also an underlying theme highlighting the power of the media and it's influence in such matters. This one is intense and really packs an emotional punch - aided by some excellent direction and some great acting from the lead players. It is sad to have the knowledge that we have now lost a talent like P.S. Hoffman - his Plutarch is a wonderful exercise in subtlety and intellectual prowess. An interesting match against the power of the capital, with it's abundant troop numbers and heavy firepower. He is a gifted strategist and the one who seems to really know what is going on. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent once again as Katniss. It is clearer now (than in the 1st two films) why she had been picked for this as she really makes you believe the up and downs of this difficult journey, and you are with her for every step. Some of the heart wrenching scenes/speeches (one early one in particular) may have fallen flat in the hands of another actress. I found myself completely engrossed for the entirety of this film, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen for any of it. As I said previously, this is heavy on the emotion and it rarely lets up. Even with little knowledge of the intricacies of the back story and history of Panem, you are wholeheartedly behind the rebellion and you so fervently despise the man behind the suffering. Sutherland hasn't had much screen time in any of these films but credit to him to still make you loathe the Snow character and his relaxed attitude to the genocide of entire cities of people. It's a pity that this film had to be split in 2. It's annoying to have to wait so long for a conclusion. I am deducting a star purely because it feels unfinished. However, considering this is based on fiction for young adults...it still hits hard and will stay with me for a while."

","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"", continues on the franchise from where ""Catching Fire"" left off. ""Mockingjay Part 1"" being Part 1 of a 2-part story it obviously not going to be the fastest paced film. This being said the story didn't feel like it dragged on and was still a fantastic entry to the franchise. Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived. She awakens from the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell deep inside the hunkered catacombs of District 13. Separated from some of her closest allies and fearing for their safety in the Capitol, Katniss finally agrees to be the Mockingjay, the symbolic leader of the rebellion. Still uncertain as to whom she can trust, Katniss must help 13 rise from the shadows, all the while knowing that President Snow has focused his hatred into a personal vendetta against her-and her loved ones. ""Francis Lawrence"", the director of this film, once again directs it very smoothly and differently in the fact that there are no games in this one. He takes advantage of the sets to make them as useful as possible and he takes a smart turn with this one. The acting from ""Jennifer Lawrence"" is once again amazing with a lot more emotional scenes put on her. Although ""Josh Hutchersons"" character doesn't have much screen time he defiantly redeemed himself from his previous attempt with Peeta Mellark in ""Catching Fire"". The last lead is ""Liam Hemsworth"" but his look on his character, Gale Hawthrone, makes him seem like a very boring and self centered character, although its not ""Liam Hemsworths"" fault that his character seem self centered he defiantly plays a role in it. ""Sam Claflin"" is back playing his character Finnick Odair but his character doesn't have much screen time, saying that ""Sam Claflin"" does make use of his time. Although the characters in this film are mostly the same as the last two films there are a couple more characters introduced. One of them include President Alma Coin who is the leader of District 13. They mostly leave her character in the dark to make her seem on Katniss' side. But Katniss doesn't really know who's side she's on. Another new stand out character of the film is Cressida, who is part of Katniss' camera team. The returning characters have massive character development through the film especially Katniss and Peeta. Another great part of this film is the score composed by James Newton Howard, although there aren't so many great songs in it the ones that are great, I mean are really really great. Obviously having less action in this film you would think it would need less special effects. Wrong. The film had a high budget of an estimated $125 Million. Most of this probably went into the set design of District 13, but if you think about it they can't build a whole civilization underground in three months. So what does this mean they have to use. Special Effects and my god you can't even tell if the characters are standing in front of a green screen. Another place they succeeded in in the special effects department are the action scenes. Including the District 8 bombing and the Hanging Tree Action sequence. The only issue I had with this film is a small pacing issue in the beginning. It didn't drag on but it did have a couple of filler scenes near the beginning, but if you took them out some of the movie wouldn't make sense so I guess they should've made those couple of scenes different from the book which it stayed true to. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" was a very good entry to the fantastic ""The Hunger Games"" Franchise with once again smooth directing and spectacular acting from most of the cast. It had great character's, a good score, amazing special effects but it did have small pacing issues near the beginning. I give 2014's ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" a 9.5/10."

"joshuadrake-91275","6","1","3","7 October 2015"," My least-favorite of the Hunger Games movie, but still enjoyable if only for the action and superb acting.
","Well, I have done the first two so I decided to go on and review the other two films in the Hunger Games franchise.<br/><br/>Here is my review of THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 1.<br/><br/>The story continues to follow Katniss Everdeen; having twice survived the Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself in District 13. Under the leadership of President Coin and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion against the Capitol and fights to save Peeta and a nation moved by her courage.<br/><br/>Now, what I think of this movie. The reason why I am so confused is because I don't hate this movie, but I will say that this might be my least-favorite of the HG movies.<br/><br/>This movie has gotten some unfair hate from critics and fans for "" lack of action and for splitting the novel into two separate adaptations."", but it has gotten some nice reviews for the acting.<br/><br/>The acting is strong here again. You have all of the cast members returning including Jennifer Lawrence, who is still attractive as Katniss Everdeen, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne. The rest of the cast includes Julianne Moore as President Coin, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Evan Ross, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin, Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow, Stanley Tucci, Jeffrey Wright, Sam Claflin and Natalie Dormer, who I think is beautiful and I have recently seen her in the movie ""Rush"".<br/><br/>The action is sort of lacking in this film because it's in two parts, but this is only the first part so what do you expect? I can't wait for Part 2, it's gonna be packed with action. The music is composed once again by James Newton Howard and the soundtrack is awesome with songs from Coldplay and Imagine Dragons.<br/><br/>The script is not that strong, but it's still okay for this film and I really do like that this film is setting up the epic finale, setting up the end, but I think this movie could have used a lot more action.<br/><br/>The costume and production design is really not horrible either and I give credit to the franchise for being awesome, but it's so messed up that this is the lowest-rated film in this series, as it has a rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes and the general consensus is: ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 sets up the franchise finale with a penultimate chapter loaded with solid performances and smart political subtext, though it comes up short on the action front."" and in it's own way, it is stupid but it's also really not that bad.<br/><br/>The visual effects and action sequences are good as well, so, overall, with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, I both love it and hate it. I like the acting, script, score, soundtrack, visuals, production techniques, but I hate some of the scenes and the lack of action.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I did see the previous movies and will be there to find out how it all plays out. Is it fair to criticize a film when one's memories of those first two films are a little fuzzy. I guess I am empathetic because the totalitarian government is so awful that I'm going to pull for these guys. Kateniss is the hero, but I'm not sure how she connects to the evils that are being perpetrated. Donald Sutherland's character is utterly rotten. But what is it he wants. I mean, is he getting any enjoyment out of his power other than to have it. I know history is dotted with megalomaniacs like this, but what will the world be. This part is filled with self- doubt and uncertainty. I fear that the power shift is like most (like the French Revolution) when evil trumps evil and we end up with evil. I've not read the books so I'm at a loss. There is so much unexplained stuff going on here that I hope gets explained in the future."
"kosmasp","6","2","10","31 May 2015"," Appetizer
","A pretty long appetizer that is. For its length it doesn't feel dragged or anything, but I still wonder if it was necessary. OK, so character motivation, other people can show off a bit of what they have going for them and the is no Hunger Games going on (it'd be really crazy to do the same movie for a third time, not that people wouldn't watch it though). I only read the first book and I thought that was made in a good fashion (especially considering the narration it had). Not sure how the other two books are built up, but this movie feels like a filler, something to keep you on ""hold"" until you get served the real deal/meal.<br/><br/>It'll be in a couple of months from now, so let's see how they bring it to an end and if P.S. Hofmann already had done his scene before his premature departure (may he rest in peace). The scenes here seemed to have been shot alright before that. Now: Let's conclude this already!"
"ppatranka","8","2","10","22 February 2015"," Not nearly as bad as everyone says
","I've read plenty of negative reviews before watching this movie. As a fan of books and previous movies i was a bit afraid 'Hunger games: Mockingjay - Part 1' will disappoint me. But it DIDN'T. <br/><br/>Of course this movie is different from first two, but so were the books. It's the first movie in Hunger games series without actual Hunger games. Action buffs may be disappointed, this movie is slower than previous two, but i didn't feel prolonged. Two hours which it lasted, passed very fast. <br/><br/>I even started to think that splitting the third book into two movies is a great idea. Stunning performance of Jennifer Lawrence reveals true Katniss Everdeen. This Katniss (at least for me) was closest to the one i read about in the books. <br/><br/>All in all, i enjoyed watching this movie. Maybe my expectations were too low and this is why i it surpassed them. Performance of Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket) must also be mentioned. It's a pity she played only a few scenes. Puff of energy in a grey strict world."
"lemuel1985","9","3","20","18 December 2014"," weakest film of the franchise but a good movie.
","I have to start by saying this one is the worst movie of the franchise. It is a good movie and Jennifer Lawrence gives another strong performance but they should have made only one last movie instead of two. That's the major problem with this movie, they tried to stretch the last book in two movies and it feels like that on the movie. The movie lacks the energy and life of the other two movies. All the situation with the resistance is good, it has son good drama, some good scenes and some emotion but it feels like a preview for the next one. The movie stays true to the book in almost every aspect and does a really good job on bringing the book to life but it fell short of my expectations. The good think about this movie is that they left most of the best scenes, action and drama for the next one."
"lorelei-the-temptress","10","3","20","13 December 2014"," Excellent
","The movie is very well done. What I find most annoying, is that people say that it was boring and there is minimal action. Uh hello? If you read the book, then you know that not much action happens. Mockingjay is more about political warfare and how the media is used in war. This is one of the problems in America, they place more importance on action rather than on these deep movies that show the corruption in governments. Unfortunately, part 1's are usually not the most entertaining, mostly because it is leading up to the grand finale. We've seen this with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and Twilight Breaking Dawn. <br/><br/>However, Mockingjay part 1 was very interesting, and we see many parts of Panem in the revolution that we don't see in the books. (SPOILER) When Finnick is telling Panem of the horrors that Snow put him through, we see Gale and Boggs and four other people rescue Peeta and Johanna and Enobaria. In my opinion, this is great because its almost setting us up for the horrific scenes with a hijacked Peeta. <br/><br/>You cannot just base a movie on its action. While reading many reviews, I've noticed one common critique... ...Its boring. While some parts may seriously lack action, comedy and interesting plot lines supplement. Yes, I will admit there are some parts of the movie I was not exactly thrilled with, I looked at the movie based on not only the book, its entirety as a movie. I urge people to disregard the absence of action in this movie, if you don't you'll only set yourself up for disappointment."
"da_zapata","8","3","20","4 December 2014"," Mockingjay Proves Fire is Catching as Fast as Ever
","It is always difficult to approach the first part of a two-part film, particularly when it is essentially a set-up for the climactic finale (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter, Twilight, and The Hobbit franchises). Yes, this is undoubtedly a Hollywood cash-grab scheme, but that is not to say these first-part films should be given any leeway in terms of mediocrity. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. I, along with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, have been solid proof that ""the end is near!"" films can be both highly entertaining and successful. I am pleased to announce that the same can be said about Mockingjay Pt. I.<br/><br/>Mockingjay is, without a doubt, my favorite film in The Hunger Games series so far. I suppose this came as no surprise to me, considering the final book is my favorite of the trilogy, and its bleak, despairing mood is captured impeccably in the film. The Hunger Games franchise is no longer about panicked children in an arena fighting to the death. The Games are over and the Rebellion against the Capitol has begun, with Katniss Everdeen (played with ravishing ferocity, once again, by the ever-lovable Jennifer Lawrence) as the Rebellion's poster girl—their ""Mockingjay."" The film makes profound statements about human injustices and the morality of governmental power rather than bloodshed and death, and therein lies the film's success. It has transcended from a violent tale of oppression to a deeply moving and masterful portrayal of fighting for what you believe in, despite the inevitably dire consequences.<br/><br/>Mockingjay is melancholic and nerve-wracking from its first shot to its final one, and is therefore an incredibly difficult watch for those expecting a happy or satisfying ending. It becomes clear in Mockingjay Pt. 1 that this is an unlikely outcome, and yet, this by no means makes the film and the statements it is making any less important. It is a tale of anarchism for the sake of rebuilding democracy, which is a fascinating juxtaposition with the utilitarianism of the Capitol. While Mockingjay may not be as action-packed as its predecessors, it makes a much more crucial and relevant assertion through its powerful dialog and somber depictions of the aftermath of a civil war. Fear not, Mockingjay has enough heart-pounding action segments to keep you at the edge of your seat, yet this is notably not the point of the film. From the beginning of the series, The Hunger Games has focused on the sorrow and desperation of government brutality in a dystopian future. As we near the conclusion, Mockingjay delivers the perfect set-up for a satisfying ending. In many ways, Mockingjay Pt. I is simply just that: a set-up for the grand finale. However, it does so without ever losing touch with its vitality as a part of the story and is equally as (if not more than) immersive as all the previous Hunger Games films.<br/><br/>You may have noticed I have keenly avoided discussing the plot of Mockingjay Pt. I. This is with good reason. The plot of this film is very keenly laid out and progresses with the perfect amount of subtlety and suspense. Every word spoken and every measure taken is of massive importance to the series as a whole, and giving anything away would feel like desecration. Yes, I have provided you with the basics: The Rebellion is in full swing, Katniss is as vivacious and unrelenting as ever, and the Capitol has initiated a murderous civil war. In all honesty, this is all one needs to know when entering Mockingjay Pt. I because there is truly nothing as satisfying as experiencing the film and contemplating its political and moral viewpoints afterwards. That goes without saying, many that have flooded (and will continue to flood) theaters to watch this film are avid fans of the previous films or the novels, and therefore know exactly what they are in for. I will admit that the film feels incomplete, but I believe that it should, because the best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) is yet to come. Mockingjay Pt. I is undoubtedly the most profound film of The Hunger Games films as of yet, and I have no doubt Pt. II will surpass it next November—even if it does shred my heart into thousands of pieces. Stock up on your Kleenex, folks.<br/><br/>This review is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was astounding in this film as he was in every role he ever played. May he rest in peace."
"tadpole-596-918256","8","3","20","3 December 2014"," I must be living in District 13 . . .
",". . . since all week there have been mystery workers pouring cement truck after cement truck worth of bunker material into a suspicious hole in the ground two blocks from my house. Anyone who has seen THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - - PART ONE knows that the story revolves around a man-made bunker about the size of Cleveland in District 13, America's apparent future. Every humongous bunker needs to start somewhere, and my theory is that the future District 13 is beginning a couple stones' throws from my house. Since I live between two spring-fed lakes, the water table is really high, and the workers needed to wait until the ground was cold enough that they could dig without the threat of earth-wall collapses. There has been a dummy ""sewer pumping"" station in place at this work site for a few years to ward off suspicion from the future District One dictators of Panem. After all, what's the point of building a ""secret"" bunker if it can be easily ""nipped in the bud""? But the security arrangements--complete with impenetrable orange barriers--is a dead giveaway that there's more than waste pumps going into the ground near my house. When you see MOCKINGJAY, you'll realize that it takes decades to construct giant bunkers hundreds of feet deep capable of concealing thousands of people, air bases, etc. What better place to disguise the main entrance than between two lakes? Plus, I think I sometimes hear the truckers humming that ""Hanging Tree"" song, while they're waiting to dump another load of cement. So if you all want to be hunkering in the bunker even BEFORE Kaniss arrives, C'Mon on down!"

","As a die hard fan of Suzanne Collins powerful trilogy I feel that Mockingjay Part 1 rose to the occasion. Although it's only the first half of book three which is a little slower than the rest, it was full of action and stayed true to the intense story line of the book and set it up perfectly for the epic conclusion of Mockingjay Part 2. As an active reader I'm extremely critical of movie adaption, but this was spot on. This is not just an action film, but the story of a young girl who is forced to face the odds to protect the ones she loves. It's about taking a stand for what's right in dark times, a lesson you're never too old for. This film features fantastic actors, amazing special effects, and an incredibly spine chilling score from James Newton Howard. A must see!"

","She has some of the best adaptation of books ever written. The movies add to the books, since those are only seen from Katniss' point of view.<br/><br/>Everything was impressive: the setting, the acting... and the soundtrack. The music gives great emotion to certain scenes. The ""hanging tree"" song scenes are thrilling.<br/><br/>I suppose enough has been written.<br/><br/>About the people who found this boring? They should have a look at ""Speed"" or ""Demolition man"", those are movies they will like better. This one had character development and acting.<br/><br/>I specially love how they showed Plutarch's influence on Alma Coin... they didn't tell, they showed it. <br/><br/>All in all, impressive. Even if not much happened, I had a wonderful time in the cinema, the two hours passed in a flash, I was thrilled and moved at certain points (the soundtrack is really powerful), and I went yearning for more. Luckily, I still have the books.<br/><br/>This series will be for its generation what Star Wars (first trilogy, back in the seventies and eighties) was for the previous one."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","7","1","4","29 April 2016"," The Set Up
","Fans of ""THE HUNGER GAMES"", the books, were delighted when the movies began being made. Fortunately for them they were successful enough that they didn't end with the first film. But that also leads to problems when it comes to the release of the rest of the movies and that's what made this one, the third in the series, so difficult.<br/><br/>A quick update for those who don't know: the Hunger Games were games between combatants, one male and one female, from twelve districts that took place at the Capitol in order to satiate the bloodlust of people and eliminate war. Only young people enter and this year things changed when Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) fall in love and promise to commit suicide together if they aren't both allowed to live. Thus was set in motion not only a love story but a battle of wills between Katniss and the President (Donald Sutherland) who rules with an iron fist.<br/><br/>As the third film opens you'll find yourself confused unless you've either just watched the second film or remember it vividly. For myself it took a while to get acclimated and put together the pieces of the second film which I hadn't watched in over 2 years. It would have been nice for an update but the choice was made not to. Oh well. As the film opens Katniss has been saved by the rebels and taken to refuge. There she meets President Coin (Julianne Moore) who informs her of what has been going on.<br/><br/>Katniss has taken on mythic proportions as the champion of the people, the Mockingjay (so named because of the bird mentioned in the first film and the medal she wears of one). Now Coin wants to use Katniss for propaganda purposes to stir up the rest of the country in support of the rebels. A team is put together, a mix of soldiers and press people, to film propos (propaganda films) of Katniss but none ring true. It isn't until she goes out in the field and witnesses the horrors of war and speaks her mind that the best footage is captured.<br/><br/>At the same time TV programming shows Peeta, now a ""guest"" of the Capitol, talking about how much Katniss should stop what she is doing and how wonderful the President really is. Katniss has none of it and realizes Peeta is only saying these things to stay alive. Her request of Coin is that Peeta be dismissed of all charges of treason when all is said and done and that they attempt to rescue him when possible.<br/><br/>The movie isn't a bad movie, really, but by making it a film to set up the last installment it leaves you feeling as if you walked into the middle of something and had to leave before it was over. Little changes from the start to the finish and what we get more than anything here is exposition, information about various characters that we will discover more about in that upcoming chapter but get acquainted with here.<br/><br/>The end result is a movie that has a few moments of action and forward motion but more often than not is a bit dull and tedious. Yes, it's great that we get to know these characters, it's great that we get to know what's coming up. But did they really have to split this into two movies? It would seem that it would have made a much better single film that crammed all of the information of both into a movie slightly over 2 hours long. But by splitting it into 2 they get to sell twice as many tickets and draw it out just a while longer. That seems to be the thing these days between the same format used in both the TWILIGHT and INSURGENT movies.<br/><br/>I doubt that fans will be disappointed here but perhaps the best thing to do when watching these movies now is to watch them all together at the same time. It will mean less confusion and a more straightforward viewing experience for those watching. While not a bad movie it leaves you wishing the next one were here and ready to be watched."
"Tweekums","9","1","4","28 April 2016"," Katniss becomes the poster girl for the rebellion against President Snow
","After the events of 'Catching Fire' protagonist Katniss Everdeen wakes up in District 13; the underground rebel district that leads the fight against President Snow and his forces. The rebels want Katniss to be the 'Mockingjay'; their poster girl to help unite the districts against the capital. She is unsure until she sees what the Capital is doing; her home district has been destroyed and a hospital she visits is bombed just because she went there. She has some conditions though; she wants Peeta to be rescued from the Capital and pardoned for the broadcasts he has made condemning the rebellion.<br/><br/>This instalment is quite different to the previous two; there are no games and more significantly the story has been divided into two this does mean the story doesn't have a natural ending in this film. That doesn't really matter as the story we get has plenty of exciting moments the best being when Katniss brings down an attacking plane with an exploding arrow a little far-fetched perhaps but certainly spectacular. The film nicely shows us how Snow's hatred of Katniss and what she represents is getting increasingly personal. The cast does an impressive job; Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss, she even demonstrates that she has a decent singing voice when she sings the haunting song 'The Hanging Tree', and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman impressed as Plutarch Heavensbee, it is tragic that this was one of his last films. Overall I really enjoyed this and look forward to seeing how the Hunger Games story finishes in 'Mockingjay Part 2'."
"kildelund","8","1","4","16 April 2016"," Good movie with a few elements that are rare in movies.
","What a movie, eh? This particular movie, in The Hunger Games series, has received criticism for being kind of a drag and not a lot of action shows in the movie. However, I LOVE this movie because it shows a different element in war... Propaganda. It's a topic that not many ""war movies"" show. It's true that there isn't a lot of action, but who needs action, when a movie is blessed with such wonderful actors as Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and many other talented actors and actresses. My only real criticism is the constant three way love story, which I'm getting tired of but, hey, that's one mans opinion."
"emhessinger","7","1","4","3 April 2016"," It's true, there isn't much action, but still a good movie
","If you have already read the books you will enjoy it much more. True, there isn't a lot of action, no final battle scene, that's because it's a part one, trust me there is much more to come. We see more into the character's emotions and backstory (mainly Finnick) ""It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.""said Finnick. There isn't a lot of action, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. My favorite is still Catching Fire (the second one) and I have seen Mockingjay part 2. I would not consider it a ""failure"" or a ""disappointment to its predecessors"" but if you haven't read the books and you love action, it won't be your favorite. I would like to say though that even if you don't like part one, you should stick with it until the end because TRUST ME there is much better stuff on the way"
"smijatov89","5","1","4","30 January 2016"," Dark and gloomy snooze-fest
","All through watching Mockingjay I thought somehow it feeling familiar... and I realised it reminded me a bit of the Harry Potter series and the point where Harry Potter got darker and more grown up. While the Potter franchise successfully transitioned from it's 12- year old demographic, The Hunger Games, did not quite manage so well.<br/><br/>Not all is bad. There is some interesting criticism here of media and propaganda, but those are all smack -in-the-face type of observations. The film makes no secret of it. The darkness comes from the topic itself: the film is set in the aftermath of a violent crackdown by the Capitol onto the rebelling districts. It is dystopic, but what is missing is the emotion behind it. Jennifer Lawrence is more Jennifer Lawrence than Katniss, and when she is Katniss...well, Katniss is annoying. The consistent need to push her into doing what she has to do is quite frustrating. Mind you, it is (probably?) a limitation imposed in the Hunger Games books, but that still does not make her any less annoying and infuriating when she'd rather choose Peeta over the future of the whole world.<br/><br/>Technically, the Hunger Games have polished up quite nicely. The CGI does not look as dated as it did in the first film, which is good. This film is very grim and dark - the colourful costumes of the Capitol have been replaced by the darkness of the underground shelter and the military uniform. Overall, though, the film sustains the continuation of a mediocre, yet entertaining, franchise. That being said, this one is the least entertaining film so far. The whole ""Part 1"" charade is a charade at its best. Not much really happens here, beyond some character ""development"" for Katniss (also known as everyone pushing her to get her act together).<br/><br/>The first film is still the most engaging and entertaining one - let us hope they will end the series on a better note than Mockingjay Part 1, because otherwise, it will be a snooze."
"Belle_Arielle","2","1","4","30 December 2015"," Get the books, skip the movies
","I planned on watching the final part of the series in the cinema and found out it is based on 3 books, so I got them ... and I must say I devoured them within a few days, back to back. Great story, deep political message, great female lead, interesting development of characters and relationships. Unfortunately, there is not much left of that in the movies.<br/><br/>OK, now on to the details.<br/><br/>The main message of the whole story is about a cruel dictatorship, about poverty and injustice. In the movies, the only way the creators hinted at these topics is by filling the scenes with Nazi style uniforms, Nazi style eagles, Riefenstahl style propaganda and more Nazi aesthetics. The way the people are dressed at the Reaping reminds of Germany 1930. Even the gate of the VICTORS' VILLAGE looks exactly like the one at Auschwitz. Oh, come on. It's supposed to be the future! We see nothing of the actual lives of people in the districts, and even though hunger"" is part of the title (!), it is never a topic throughout the plot, neither in the districts nor in the arena nor anywhere.<br/><br/>The books are R rated and emphasize the pointless, gruesome killings of children, their needless pain and pure desperation. They portray war and the rebellion as violent acts. The movies on the other hand look like they target 13 years old boys as their main audience (well, they are, PG13). The ""Games"" feel like an classroom outing to an adventure park, the revolution like a PC shooter game.<br/><br/>Also the main actress doesn't fit. I pictured Katniss as a tomboy, a cute but boyish girl, not the Lara Croft type of a sexy babe they made her in the movies. But I guess, it's for the 13 years old boys audience again <br/><br/>Then comes the romance part. In the books, Katniss is not really into romance at all and the delicate triangle between Peeta, Gale and her is a lot more about friendship than about romance. Besides that, in the book both guys are portrayed as equally attractive, whereas in the movies, they gave Katniss a 2 inches shorter than her, weak character as a love interest. What's the message? If the unattractive boy is heroic enough, he wins the girl?<br/><br/>Now I wonder if I should fork out money for the cinema to watch Part 2."

","Every story has some elements and they usually are in the same order. You have the hook, you have the set up, the character descriptions, some action, some life changing decisions, the twists and so on. Since part 1 of part 3 is just half a story, you only get the set up! The hook is presumably in the first two movies, but let's say we have a weak one at the beginning of the film, as well. And then it goes something like ""Tomorrow... Panem!"" and the movie ends.<br/><br/>One year later, you get the second movie, which starts where this one ended and it's overly long and obviously artificially so. However, Part 1 is not so bad. In fact, I would say it is definitely better than the second part. The characters are described, their motivations laid bare, we only need the action stuff, that doesn't really happen here. However this slowness of pace is also what forces the actors and movie makers to improve on the quality of the exposition.<br/><br/>That doesn't make it a great movie, but it is a decent one, and it certainly raises expectations."

The way that the Capitol used to stop Katniss's army ( or friends ), it's so cruel. The scenes seem so dilapidated. But the story was cut into many parts so it is too hard to watch all.

My favourite part is when she speaks her speech in front of the camera when they were filming to encourage all the rebels to fight.

What started out as a rather blatant teen version of Battle Royale has developed into a complex, gritty political drama wrought with emotion, its star Jennifer Lawrence now able to deliver a powerful performance worthy of her talent.<br/><br/>Having fanned life back into the once dying embers, I hope that Mockingjay part 2 will end the series with a bang, packing in some of the action that this one clearly held back from delivering."

At the same time, Katniss also learns about a secret rebellion spreading throughout all of Panem, a rebellion that will place her at the center of a plot to turn the tables on Snow.<br/><br/>So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far.

She wakes up within the underground complex comprising the supposedly destroyed District 13. She soon learns of a rebellion developing amongst the other 11 districts. District 12, Katniss and Peeta's (Hutcherson) home, was destroyed by President Snow (Sutherland) and the Capitol. This rebellion, led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), hopes to unite the people of the remaining districts against Snow and the Capitol. Seeing that Katniss has gained a following amongst the people of the Districts following her actions in the last few Hunger Games, Coin and Heavensbee aim to court her to be the face behind their rebellion. Initially skeptical of joining, she eventually decides to join. With interference from the Capitol and the brainwashed pleas to stop the war by Peeta who was kidnapped by the Capitol, Katniss must rally the people of Panem to their cause. So the film took a different direction from the previous two films in that it is less about the actual Hunger Games (which I've always found silly) and more about developing the backstory behind the world which I've enjoyed so far. I still don't know how their world came to be but seeing it as it is now was interesting enough. I just wish I had seen more since I didn't get a chance to see the results of their actions just yet which is why I hate it when they split stories into two films. Also because of that (I think), there wasn't as much action as I would have liked but I think they might (I hope) make up for that in the next part. The one thing that has been consistent with the series so far has been the quality of the acting and it is no different here. I found that Lawrence and Hutcherson did the best with what they had which was primarily set up for the next film. I think Hutcherson was good but I did not agree with the use of his character in this film as I found that it did not add much. I also thought the returning supporting characters, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) (just to name a few), were good as well. Some may not like the pace of the film since it is a little slower than previous films and the purpose of the film serves as buildup for the next film but I mildly disagree as I thought it could have been better but I wasn't completely disappointed. Overall, this is another decent entry in the series, albeit a buildup to the next film. I'll just say that the next film better be great.<br/><br/>Score: 6.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com"
"barbagvido","7","1","4","21 November 2015"," It's an okay movie, but the split was really unnecessary.
","When I heard they were going to split the last book in two movies, I was really disappointed. They said there is too much story to fit in one movie. Yeah, right, and I'm Lady GaGa. I still tried to look on the bright side and remembered how the book felt rushed at times and maybe the story will have more space to breathe. But here, it kinda seems like the story was forced to breathe very deep. Too deep. This isn't a bad movie at all. It's just too stretched for it's own good and turns out to be a total cashgrab. It's very well done and ""The Hanging Tree"" sequence with the dam scene was one of the best moments in the series. The plot doesn't really go anywhere for the most of the screen time. There's the District 8 part, some rebel scenes and the movie's third act. That's it. But the third act is awesome. That part wasn't really that intense in the book and that's when they showed the potential and some creativity. The book is in first person POV, but the movie isn't and that's the good thing because in the book we hear about some exciting stuff, but in the movie we actually get to see it and that's really good and the third act is mostly what made me like this movie. If you didn't read the book, the twist ending will definitely get you and you will want to watch the next movie immediately. One more problem I have with this film is that Katniss simply isn't an interesting character anymore. Tears, nightmares, traumas... I know she's been through a lot and I can understand that she's stressed and that they should show it in the movie, but they show it way too much. There was this scene when she's dreaming and I was like: ""And this was necessary because..."" In conclusion, this movie is still pretty much okay and will totally make you want to see the next one."

","Hunger Games Mockingjay part 1 is the third part of the Hunger Games series (well of the movie series anyway) and is again directed by Francis Lawrence. This time around, Katniss Everdeen has to lead the revolution against the evil President Snow. Actually, before she can do that, she has to make some propaganda films to evoke the citizens interest in fighting for the greater good.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm not a big Hunger Games fan. I never read the books, I never went to any fan conventions, if there were any, but I did watch the previous two movies and as most people already said, they are superior to Mockingjay in a lot of different ways. The problem this movie suffers from, is undoubtedly the ""part 1"" scheme that most studios tend to do nowadays. What this causes is a lack of plot and action. Normally, a good movie doesn't necessarily need a great plot to be great, it needs a great story and Mockingjay just doesn't have a great story because as it stands now, its incomplete. It's not the whole thing. And what pisses me off is when studios think movies are some kind of TV show, where every part of the franchise can be handled as some kind of TV episode. So basically, I don't have a lot to say but there are some good aspects in this entry.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting all around is strong. Nobody really sticks out, everyone does a good job with what they are given. However, there's one exception and that is, of course, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I don't think even the die hard fans of this series know what a loss he is and I truly hope he wont be remembered for the work he did in the Hunger Games but anyway, he is very good in the movie as is Woody Harrelson who shines with his character. These guys have a great screen presence and are just a league of their own. The rest, as I said, does a fine job.<br/><br/>Another strong aspect is Lawrences direction. While there are not a lot of exciting and well executed shots, there are some that stick out. The few action scenes are handled very well, as previously highlighted in Catching Fire, I just would like to see more energy with the camera. Its all very stale and cold, some movement would definitely help. I don't know where these 125 million dollars went because the movie doesn't look any better than the first one and that one had way more going on. So film-making wise, it could have been better. I hope Lawrence goes back to the way he did the 2nd one because that one had way better direction than this one. It felt a lot like a ""film that then that""vibe was going on. If you have this kind of budget, you better use it to your full expense. <br/><br/>All in all, it's a passable movie, it's definitely not bad, just very mediocre. It feels more like a product than a real film which is sad, because I had a totally different feeling from Catching Fire. That being said, I'm sure the final chapter of this franchise will deliver what was missing here. Just stop with the cash grabs Hollywood. Movies can be more than just a way to make money. Respect film as an art form."
"Robert_duder","8","2","13","4 January 2015"," A whole lot of politics to bring the series to a close
","So far I'm not a huge fan of the latest concept of splitting final instalments into two parts just to gain more money. I am certain they would have you believe that they need to tell more story but if you look at Harry Potter and now The Hunger Games, you'll plainly see there really isn't any reason to split the last two films. Now, I'm not saying Mockingjay: Part 1 isn't good...in fact it has a lot going for it and its such a great story and series that it would be awfully hard to really screw it up. Even still, there is a lot of dialogue and a ton of politics and this one is very light on the action. This film also is very bleak and jaded. One thing The Hunger Games series (both book and film) has always stood for is the hidden and not so hidden political and social commentary that is so relevant even now. Mockingjay has even more of that but its not the same message. You get to watch the manipulation of Katniss and others by the Capitol and the leaders of the rebellion and there is even a brief but very interesting scene where Plutarch is mouthing the words to the President's speech demonstrating even she is being manipulated. Who are the good guys? Mockingjay blurs the story just a little bit. Mockingjay wins you over with some really powerful imagery, terrific characters and the promise of what the final film will bring.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is probably one of Hollywood's biggest and youngest superstars and for good reason. As Katniss Everdeen she captured the down to earth heroine and makes you root for her at every turn. She is definitely in a dark place in this film and its hard to watch her being manipulated. Outside of the arena, Katniss is less in charge of herself but the film has a different tone. Lawrence is still great in the role. Josh Hutcherson also returns in a slightly smaller role as Peeta Mellark. However, this might be the strongest he has ever been in his role. Peeta has a very big part of the plot and Hutcherson is good. I've always thought Liam Hemsworth got the short end of the stick in this series. His Gale always seems to be a secondary character and gets very little respect and this film doesn't help that any. He is good in the part but the character seems wasted somehow and always gets shafted by Katniss. One of my favourite actors from the original two films takes a back seat and that's Woody Harrelson and its unfortunate. Haymitch has always been an amazing character and he's hardly in this film sadly. Donald Sutherland returns as President Snow and is amazing at it. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman also has a significant role as Plutarch and he has some very good lines and a good presence on the cast. Newcomers on the cast include Julianne Moore (she has been popping up everywhere lately) and while I always say she is one of my least favourite actresses, she seems to be growing on me ever so slightly and she is actually very effective as the leader of the rebellion. Mahershala Ali is very good in an unfortunately very small role and I hope he has a bigger part in the final film. Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields and Elizabeth Banks all return in small roles.<br/><br/>An IMDb reviewer described this as a great advertisement for what is left to come. That is truly a backhanded complimented but that is exactly what this is. There are so many characters and yet some of the best characters (Haymitch, Gale, Beetee, Finnick, Caesar, Effie and Johanna) just to name a few, are very underused and solely lacking. I am very impressed that director Francis Lawrence has an incredible eye for stunning sequences. Catching Fire had some great action scenes and Mockingjay has even more powerful and moving scenes that are very nearly awe inspiring. Lawrence comes almost exclusively from music videos which I find usually means their experience is lacking but Lawrence seems to have a firm handling of this science fiction epic and the characters and while I still don't think this instalment is necessary, it was enjoyable and a good holdover until the final film. Often powerful and moving and a lot of politics which makes for a fascinating story. It might not be at the level of the first two films but its still one of the best franchises in a very long time. 8/10"

There is also a good sprinkling melancholy as you see Katrina feeling the strain and hopelessness of the situation she now finds herself in. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first two movies, you will undoubtedly love this one, another well made movie and Francis Lawrence's direction is breathtaking at times.

","So, because of a marketing decision, the last book of the series has been divided into two movies, and the audience exploded. Why was it necessary to make it this way? After seeing the first movie, it's perfectly obvious that this is not an epic, but it is not a bad film either. People could argue that we needed to see the transition of our heroine from shell shocked to fully capable of leading the revolution. When you see the first installment, you'll be the judge.<br/><br/>Everything is literally a mess in her world. She has left her beloved behind and is now facing new responsibilities and a different world. She doesn't even know whether who is alive or dead. What becomes obvious is that everyone else seems to be adapting much faster. We go through a similar process than they she went through in the first two films. Learning how to use new weapons, strategies, and adapting to new situations, but this time it is more personal, and it is difficult to know what is really going on.<br/><br/>The pacing is slow, and there is plenty of time to reflect on the recent events; it is also noticeable that both Presidents are very sly political and wartime players. One will discover as the story progresses that not everything is what it seems. It is commendable that we don't need all of those physical training exercises we saw in ""Divergent"". They revealed nothing about the characters, which remained flat and boring. Here we care about the players involved, we sort of admire the bad guys, too because there is a game going on, and we know they're well matched. Yes, we need to see her catch fire, to explode, so she can reach her full potential, and we already know the ending, but what we don't know is how many twists and surprises there will be until its resolution.<br/><br/>Yes, it is pushing our patience to see what could have a been a much better three hour film unfold this slowly. It wasn't necessary unless we were watching a TV series. It is not a character study, but a young adult thriller, and maybe a year is just too long. What if we just wait a couple of months, or at the most six months, like do on TV. It is just unnecessary torture."
"thomas-w15","7","2","13","5 December 2014"," Fans of the book will still enjoy, but most should wait till Part 2
","Mockingjay: To say that I am a fan of the Hunger Games Franchise would be an understatement, I have been eagerly waiting for this film since last year after watching Catching Fire. I am a huge fan of the books, so I had a general idea of what was going to take place in this film and where they would end it. I was a little disappointed with the movie, I still liked it very much but was a little disappointed. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is well thought-out, very well acted, but lacks the action and intensity that made the first and second films so enjoyable. <br/><br/>Aside from adding in a few propo(propaganda pieces used in the film) scenes, the director did a pretty good job a keeping it true to the book. That is the problem though, it was one book and this is only half of it. The book was honestly a little boring for the first half compared to the other two, but was still a great book because it picked it up in the second half. The film obviously had scenes that were only there to lengthen the film and were very unnecessary and added little to nothing in terms of the plot. It would have been a much better film if it was closer to three hours and was just one film. That way they could have given the book adaption justice and would have been much better overall. Of course, they would make nearly double the money by splitting the book into two parts which is the only reason why they did it. The director did his best with what he was given and I give him much credit for making it a very enjoyable film. <br/><br/>What made this film still incredibly enjoyable to me was the acting ensemble they had. They have so much great actors and actresses across the board that they used tremendously well throughout the movie. Jennifer Lawrence(surprise, surprise) still gave the best performance. She continues to perfectly convey the personality and attitude that is Katniss Everdeen. Liam Hemsworth also did a outstanding job since this is the film that gives the most screen time. He is no Peeta Mellark to me, but he did a nice job at playing the tough, honest guy who you can tell really wants Katniss to love him the say way he loves her. Josh Hutcherson has far less screen time in this film, but was given a much more challenging role. I was curious to see how he would take to it since it is abnormal for a character to have to change his entire personality during a film. He was brilliant. He exceeded everyone's expectations and I have very high hopes for him in the final Hunger Games. The rest of the ensemble did very well. Woody Harrelson continually gave the audience nice laughs throughout the film. <br/><br/>It is up to you on this, I think you should see this film in theaters, but you will honestly have a better experience if you just wait to see this a little before you see the final Hunger Games. Still, I think you should see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 at some point, whether it is in theaters or on DVD.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"analovescoffee","10","3","25","7 December 2014"," If you are a hunger games lover, go for it!
","Compared to the previous movies, this one has less fighting and action. I am kinda disappointed that they decided to make two movies out of the last book... The end is very open and kinda disappointing. But i am a die hard fan of hunger games, so I still enjoyed it. I think that, even though is not as good as the other two, it is still worth the buck. As well, if you are one of those people who hate open endings, better wait till next year and go see both of the movies Mockingjay one and two. The movie does keep you on the edge of your seat a few times, but do not expect too much action. A lot of walking around, cheering, propaganda and chilling. Themost interesting scene in my opinion is at the end. So all in all, go for it if you love the hunger games movie and you do not hate an open ending movie!"
"tmaranhao","8","3","25","5 December 2014"," Mockingjay needed to be split into parts
","As someone who has read the books, watching it come to life in film has been nothing but exciting. For me, the first part of Mockingjay was the least exciting of all (I still really enjoyed it, I'm just saying compared to the others). You have to remember that this is not just the first half of a story, it is the last part of the series, so this part is not meant to be exciting and action packed, it is to bring you back to Katniss and prepare you for the end. I feel like they did not have much of a choice, if Mockingjay was one whole film there would have been too many crucial part cut out or it would be a very long film. I am sure people that did not read the books might be OK with that because Francis Lawrence can make anything work, but I am sure Suzanne knew that this was something that had to be taken apart to be right. I love this series, I love the cast, so I did love Mockingjay Part 1, it is not my absolute favourite (Catching Fire is) but, looking at it as a Part 1 movie, it was amazing. I was so impressed with how they changed some things to add excitement in the film, it was enjoyable as a viewer. I cannot wait to see the next part and watch everything fall in place."
"evanobrien100","7","2","14","4 December 2014"," A solid foundation for a great conclusion
","Though destined to be the runt of the litter there is plenty to enjoy in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1. It's a solid foundation to what has honestly been for me the best movie adaptation for a young adult book series.<br/><br/>There are moments of tension, menace, suspense and rousing inspiration. Propaganda, symbols, strategic discourse these are the elements that further flesh out the world of this series to make it feel grounded in spite of the survivalist set-pieces in the previous two. There was a moment towards the end where I was genuinely quite surprised with how nasty it got. This is what good YA fiction can do, incorporate some tough adult themes with strong characters to allow them to bridge the gap between adolescence and adulthood.<br/><br/>It would be hard for me to pick it apart because I would be afraid that the stuff I did like would have been destined to be cut out. Director Francis Lawrence continues to show the sharp and purposeful direction seen in Catching Fire. Jennifer Lawrence keeps pushing herself as Katniss in this third film, her performances grow increasingly informed with every portrayal, in spite of what must be a punishing shoot her register is never one of complacency. The film does seem unsure of where to go at times but the foundation has been more than solidly set, they have taken advantage of the suspect conditions under which the movie was made.<br/><br/>People often point to how The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy or some other Marvel pop fluff piece is the second coming of Star Wars, I must disagree. To me after Catching Fire it became clear if there was ever to be an adequate contemporary equivalent to Star Wars, it would be this. The characters, politics and social equivalences mirror that of Star Wars in tone and structure on more than a few occasions but with the Hunger Games we are firmly in another equally well realized world and Katniss is the perfect protagonist for this adventure."

Because of this, I'll try to be brief. I really liked the film. Well, perhaps I should say a bit more. For someone who has NOT read the books, it was a very enjoyable picture and kept my interest throughout. The acting, as usual, was really nice and once again Jennifer Lawrence did a great job in the lead.

And yes, there are some slow moments in the movie, but as a whole, the movie Rocked! I did not believe they would be able to make a good movie about the last book. And like others, I wondered why they would split it into two movies. They hit the mark with this pre-final movie. I actually got chills during some of the scenes like when Catniss goes to district 8 and is in the hospital and they throw up the mocking bird sign. There were so many great and intense scenes. I left the movie for once in a very long time, not regretting the money spent. I can't wait until part two. I hope hope that they don't mess it up. Can't wait to get this on DVD."

For those of you who expected an action thriller, you will be extremely disappointed. I do believe this is the worst film out of the series, and could only see me watching this with a couple of friends at a Hunger Games party. Also the action sequences aren't very well shot, as director Francis Lawrence returns, although not very often, to the dreaded and sickening shaky cam.

Even the acting is as good as ever, if not the best in the franchise. But it's down falls come in mellow conversations, and lame ""action"" sequences. But where Mockingjay goes on to disappoint the most is it's ending. I know they are trying to lead on to the next movies, but in the end you are left with a unfinished scene.

"emmasophia","10","2","19","13 December 2014"," Intense and Emotional
","To preface my review, yes, I'm a fan of the book. I've heard and read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. People who haven't read the book felt that it was boring and that Hollywood was just trying to drag it out to make two movies. So, I was a bit skeptical when I finally went to see it today.<br/><br/>Let me just say, I did NOT feel that it was ""long"" or ""slow"". I was waiting for that feeling to sink in since I heard so much about it, but it did NOT occur to me. I was captivated the whole time. I thought the movie was very intense and full of emotions. <br/><br/>Maybe it's meant to be slow, so that the viewers (including those who have not read the book) can glean more than just the surface of the story. We got to see Katniss being vulnerable and having genuine feelings to Peeta and treating her sister as an equal (rather than the scared little girl she was back in book 1). We got to see Gale and Katniss grow apart and why. We were immersed with the other districts as to why the Capitol is evil and not to be trusted. The producers were also able to let us know that President Coin is not the ""good guy"" necessarily just because she is the president of district 13. <br/><br/>I thought Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job with the singing scene. It was so emotional and the song was so fitting. I think this movie was spot on with translating the book to the big screen. Most of the 1/2 of the last book was to setup Katniss as the ""symbol"" of their fight and how District 13 carried out that goal. The propos and the film crew that followed Katniss around is a big part of book 3 and leads to a lot of the story that will be Mockingjay Part 2. We get to know Finnick for real, he's not the play boy we thought he was in book 2 and we learn why he became a play boy. We get to see Effie and Katniss really bond and Effie's affection to Katniss.<br/><br/>And helloooooo!! It also really setup Katniss showing that she truly loves and cares Peeta. Yes, she has some sort of lust thing for Gale, but her true love lies with Peeta."
"tyewsu-720-153378","9","2","19","12 December 2014"," Awesome!
","Great plot, counting down to the last movie! I really liked the characters. The characters all serve a purpose for different reasons in the movie. The Stunts were awesome! Georgia has been a good location to film this movie.This moment has an unmistakably kitschy ring to it, and it speaks to the quintessence of young-adult fiction and why no real adult should take it seriously (though more than ever, they do). Civilisation hangs in the balance, but what's really at stake is Katniss' feelings for Peeta – the dewiest of junior love stories. Of course you could argue that Casablanca, minus the puppy- love factor, works in pretty much the same way, with the outcome of World War II hinged on the issue of whether Humphrey Bogart's Rick will remain with Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa. But if Katniss is the forceful prime mover in Mockingjay – Part I, Peeta, let's be clear, is no Ilsa. As played by Josh Hutcherson, he has all the charisma of the least interesting member of the Yale crew team. Katniss, for most of Mockingjay – Part I, is more interested in saving this preppy hand- puppet than she is in bringing about the overthrow of tyranny. By now, even much of the audience may not share Katniss' Peeta fixation. Three movies into the Hunger Games series, their bond comes off as more desperately theoretical than ever.<br/><br/>Lawrence, who had the implacability of an Olympian in the first two Hunger Games films, now plunges Katniss into a mood of Hamlet-Esq doubt: having become the poster girl for revolution, she's not at all sure if she wants the role. She's wary and woeful, just like the Katniss who first volunteered for the Hunger Games to save her sister. Lawrence has a chance to show some more vulnerability, but Katniss' tearful ambivalence about whether she's committed to the cause, or merely to saving Peeta, plays out in a less than scintillating way. It's not the actor's fault. This is what happens when you split the third installment of a YA series into two blockbuster movies: Part I is basically all dragging exposition."

","... If you haven't read the book, but keep up with the series, Mockingjay part 1 - the first half of an adaptation of the third book in the Hunger Games series - it still works. Or it did for me. One of the main things is that it takes its story from the book, and it gives some time to breath for the characters. You get to see how this develops - how Katniss is poised to become this symbol/figure of the revolution for all the other districts, how she's molded (at first unsuccessfully, then majorly) as a figure for the people through what is another ""reality"" show, only this time more on the side of propaganda - and you don't have to rush through it, it's laid out piece by piece, you get a sense of this District 13, the other districts rebellions, and so on.<br/><br/>So, first things first, it's its own movie. It's not simply easily dismissible as a 'it's only HALF a movie' sort of thing. Also, the acting is still top-notch for what this material asks for. Lawrence is still incredible as Katniss, having to express more the PTSD that her character has by this point going through two hunger games; Hoffman, in one of his last performances (part 2 of Mockingjay will be the last) strikes a jolly-calm-stern balance throughout his work here as the progandist; newcomer Julianne Moore maybe has the toughest role to play - and she is a lot colder in the book for those who have read it and know - but carries herself strongly in her scenes, aided by gray hair; more surprising is Liam Hemsworth, who I thought was weaker in the previous films, kind of like window dressing. Here, he has to if not carry scenes be more of a firmer presence, like when they return to District 12, or scenes between him and Katniss. He's gotten better.<br/><br/>What I liked here is the mix of the 'Media Image', on both the sides of District 13 and the malevolent President Snow with his interviews staged with prisoner Peeta (some of the make-up as he gets weaker is a bit cheesy), and how this is set in the backdrop of this revolution. How much people want change? Well, enough to storm a dam or fight back by going high into trees for a couple of things (these are things we at best hear about in the book but don't see, one benefit of film vs the book in terms of point of view). But best of all I like how director Lawrence paints a relentlessly grim picture, and it's never entirely dour. Nor does it have to be super action-packed; this might deter some audiences who just want the blood and carnage of the Games of the previous films. And to be fair Catching Fire did improve upon it.<br/><br/>But unlike something, say, Harry Potter 7 part 1, there's not a lot of aimless wandering around or pondering. Things keep moving, the story keeps going, Katniss' progression as a kind of 'icon' that she naturally becomes through her anger and persistence (and of her handlers), not to mention the bit-by-bit rising of the other districts, it makes for a dynamic film that is really about politics as much as anything else. So that by the time Snow and Katniss have their brief face-off through a video screen, the intensity is white-hot. This is a smart, brawny blockbuster that is not exactly, you know, a ball of laughs, but for what it presents as another in a line of thrillers, it's different and has enough of a satiric edge amid its epic qualities to make it stand out from, say, the Divergent series."
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","7","16 December 2014"," Mockingjay Part 1 has plenty going for it, but just as just as much working against it.
","The reason why ""The Hunger Games"" series always stood above other young adult novel-to- movie adaptations was that did it not yield to the demands ordered by the money-hungry movie studios. Instead, the ambitions behind ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" were rooted in the quality of the film rather than the box office bottom line. The film adaptations of Suzanne Collins' novels had the advantage of critical support over franchises such as ""Twilight"" and ""Divergent"" because making the best movie possible was always the predominant thought on the filmmakers' minds. This holiday season welcomes ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,"" an entry that makes the franchise feel less special.<br/><br/>After she destroys the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescued by leaders of the rebellion and now resides in District 13, an underground society occupied by the members of the revolution. President Coin (veteran actress Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (acting mogul Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles) ask Katniss to be the political face of the rebellion by encouraging the remaining Districts of Panem to join the revolt against the Capitol. Katniss agrees with the condition that District 13 will rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and the other Hunger Games contestants being held captive by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol.<br/><br/>As suggested in the title, the final book in Collins' series ""Mockingjay"" has been severed into two separate films. Why? ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" doubled their profits by separating the series' final book into two movie adaptations. (Heck, ""The Hobbit"" tripled their earnings). Why not sink another acclaimed series with the post-""Star Wars"" financial battle for box office cash?<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" series has undergone many modifications since the last round of the fight-to-the-death, reality-TV critique in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" The pacing has decelerated considerably, ""the games"" have been eliminated from the plot and replaced with commentary on propaganda, the majority story takes place in underground, and more focus is placed upon Katniss's emotional reactions to the putrid atmosphere of Panem's community rather than on the fan-favorite love triangle between her, Peeta, and Gale.<br/><br/>The propaganda war between District 13 and the Capitol is the best component of the film. It is thoughtfully political and entertainingly clever. Also servicing the ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is Jennifer Lawrence, once again starring as Katniss. Lawrence's work is most notable for her natural ability in bringing an undeniable emotional intensity to this role with ease. Another success of this particular entry is the final shot of the movie. The first two films failed to impale the viewer with a meaningful and attractive closing frame, but ""Mockingjay: Part 1"" makes an arresting statement in the image with which it leaves you.<br/><br/>Director Francis Laurence gambles most of the story aiming for ""poignant"" moments, scenes that are meant to study and affect the destruction of different areas of Panem directly caused by the government. There are the occasional scenes that dramatically succeed, but more often than not, the ""poignant"" moments are ineffective and sit slayed by miscalculation from the Laurence. In addition, the visual style lacks splendor and the technical elements are not as smooth and agile as the previous installments.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" has plenty going for it, but it has just as much working against it. This installment will not move you as much as the original film, nor will it viscerally excite you like last year's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.""<br/><br/>* * 1/2 out of * * * *<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"VertigoOne","5","1","8","8 March 2015"," Pleasantly surprised, even moved.
","I really haven't expected much from The Hunger Games after seeing the first movie. I thought that the books were engaging and, at times, dramatic and felt that the first book was not adapted well to the screen. There was no real tension between Peeta and Katniss and some of the finest moments of the book were butchered in the film.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, Mockingjay, I felt, was the worst book of the series; but as far as I am concerned it might be the best film so far. The first film, in my opinion, was a train wreck; the second film was a brilliant recovery; and this third film is far above my expectations.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress, but this is not her best acting. I feel that the script is so poorly written that she is forced to do unthinkable things on screen - yet she manages to pull them off. For instance, how many times can an actor be expected to cry, gasp, or yell in a single film? Jennifer Lawrence does very well under the circumstances. I think that the surprise performance, however, was from Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I have never truly enjoyed her character until this film, and in this film she nearly steals every scene she's in.<br/><br/>I was not convinced that this story was worth filming until I saw this film, which is far better than it should have been. See it. It is dramatic and even touching - and very timely. You won't likely be disappointed."

","Well, it's not exactly riveting, but it conveys what it needs to convey. And just when you think it's about time for a bio break (unless you're a teen or twenty something) something happens to hold you to your seat. Ignore the review that's first presented when you come to IMDb: he hasn't seen the movie. There's never an opportunity for chemistry between Kat and Peeta (not Peta). If you've seen the movie, you'll understand, but I digress. It adheres to the genre, furthers the storyline, and throws in a little action and suspense to boot. Think ""Empire Strikes Back"", not Star Wars. As soon as it ended, I wanted to see Part 2. Now! And that's what a movie should do."

I truthfully enjoyed Mockingjay Part 1, but though as though they should have ended in a more suspenseful way instead of giving the audience more. It was full of information that is needed to move the story along and to prepare the audience for what is to come. I would give this one a thumbs up, and if you are a hunger games lover you wont be disappointed!"

While that is true it needed to be. <br/><br/>If any of you have read the book you would know that everything that happened in part one had to be there to understand part two. Part one is building up to all the action in Part two but, in order to get the full effect of part two we had to have the slow paced movie. So don't think because this movie wasn't as up to par as the other ones that part two wont be amazing because that's where all the action is suppose to be.<br/><br/>Me personally I loved the movie I thought It was just as good as the others."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","8","20 February 2015"," A Very Good Effort, Best of the Series Thus Far, But it Could've Been Great Without the Jolting One-Year Split
","Literally half of a movie in every sense of the word. Mockingjay has all the piece-placing, anticipation-building and scene-setting with none of the payoff, and that can make it feel terribly flat. President Snow is a ruthless dictator. The capital lives in the lap of luxury. The lower districts are ready to revolt. These plot points were already established in the first two films, and here they're only further reinforced and expanded. When its second half arrives, this will probably feel much stronger than it does today, which is an interesting proposition because despite its inherent flaws it's very well-made. The landscape (both physical and political) is startlingly realized, easily the most grimly authentic of the series, and the majority of its star-studded cast carries their roles above and beyond what I'd encountered in print. The exception, strangely, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who quite clearly doesn't seem himself. It's a very unusual performance, one that instantly reminded me of Orson Welles's presence in the 80s animation Transformers: The Movie. Of course, Welles also passed just before completing his work, and with the benefit of hindsight it's clear that both already had one foot out the door. The film works, often quite well, but it's just not a whole product and that's problematic. Still, it's appropriately weighty, dark and explosive, with more depth than I thought it was capable of: an ultra-rare case of the screen outdoing the book."
"rudolfravbar","7","1","8","6 February 2015"," Good, but not for everyone.
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 1. So, first i was thinking this movie is going to be something boring because there is no hunger games, but truly, it was pretty fun to watch. <br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is in District 13 after she shatters the games forever. Under the leadership of President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the advice of her trusted friends, Katniss spreads her wings as she fights to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and a nation moved by her courage.<br/><br/>Acting in this movie is good. Donald Sutherland as President Snow, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch did their best. A song from a movie that everyone remembers: Hanging tree gives me tingling. Also, this is a good prepare for a next Hunger Games movie, because it's going to get viciously (i read books). <br/><br/>What is bed about this movie is that some parts are boring and unnecessary.<br/><br/>So, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is not for everyone. I'll recommend it to the ones who watched previous Hunger Games."

","""I have a message for President Snow: You can torture or bombed us, blasted our district to the grounds. But do you see that ? Fire Is Catching... If we burn, you burn with us!"" After ending the games, Katniss (Lawrence) is trying to build a normal life again back home. The government does not want her to become just another citizen and wants to use her to lead a rebellion against President Snow. She is hesitant until she finds out what happened to Peeta (Hutcherson). She becomes an inspiration for the world but struggles with who she has become. This is a movie that doesn't need much of a review. This series has become a phenomenon and everyone knows if they like it or not by now. At least that was what I thought. I did watch the other two but was never really impressed all that much by them. This whole new genre (Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze Runner, Giver, Ender's Game) to me is starting to get to be too much and they are really all the same thing. I had that mind set in mind when I went to see this. I'm not too proud to admit when I'm wrong and I have to say that I was blown away by how much I liked this one. The movie is tense and full of action. Having not read the books may have added to the tension I felt, but by the time the movie ended I wanted to see the second part right away. Even if you haven't liked the previous movies I would watch this one, it changed my mind about the series. Overall, not only the best of this series, but the best movie of the new kids-saving-the-world genre. I highly recommend this. I easily give this an A."
"DJRMewzique","7","1","10","28 December 2014"," Mockingjay Reminder: The FIRST PART of the THIRD Book...
","After two utterly fantastic films, The Hunger Games returns with the third installment, which is the first part of the third book of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Got it? Good.<br/><br/>And the film delivers exactly what I expected. And because of this, it is, indeed, the weakest installment thus far.<br/><br/>Why? Well, reread my first sentence. It is the first part of the third book....which means that, from the third book, all the good stuff is going to be in the SECOND part and this whole film is all about ramping up to the (what will most assuredly by) the epic conclusion of this series.<br/><br/>That being said, this film still has many strengths, including Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence as she continues to shine as Katniss, this time as the woman who needs to rise and lead District 13 into a full on rebellion against The Capital while still trying to overcome the mental stress of all she has been through. And, of course, the very odd inclusion of the always great Julianne Moore as the rebellion leader, President Alma Coin.<br/><br/>The groundwork which is set by the film no doubts raises expectations of the final film very high, but I could not also help by feel that there seemed to be things even I missed as I watched this film. As I sat there, taking it all in, I wondered exactly what Effie (Elizabeth Banks) was doing there....it kind of went unexplained. Exactly how much time passed between the last film and this one? And it seemed like a lot of my questions stems from items that were, indeed, somewhat changed from the book. Effie should not be such a prominent character this early on in the final story, but Banks' character proved to simply be too popular to ignore.<br/><br/>That would be the only major downfall of this installment, and that is the lack of clarification of key points brought up in the film. But beyond that, everything else was right on par and I am most certainly looking forward to the final installment hitting theatres next November 20th.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"RforFilm","7","1","10","9 December 2014"," Though I would have rather gotten one 4 hour movie, Hunger Games: Mockingly Part 1 is satisfying enough to make me want to see the final story next time
","Let's face it, at least once in your life, you've fallen into a leader position for which you were either not ready or simply had no interest in. Some people want to be leaders and some would rather follow. I've heard of people wondering why some people don't take greater control of their life and to quit some dead end job that won't make them which. What the asking people don't understand is that while there is certainly a mindset to be your own person, you also need a particular personality. There are people out that simply feel better to taking instruction rather then give them. It's not that they don't want anything better in life, they simply don't feel like they need more; in another word, they're content.<br/><br/>This leads to Katness Everdeen's position as a leader in The Hunger Games franchise. This poor teenager had never dreamed of doing anything else besides farming and hunting. She may have the survival skills that helped her win the games the first time, but it spiraled out of control when she was seen as the sign of a revolution. She never wanted to take the spotlight, but she at least does her best with the situation. This is what makes her a great character. We are going into the beginning of the end here with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1.<br/><br/>The previous movie ended with Katness escaping the Games into a hideout while Peeta was left behind.<br/><br/>Living under the ruins of District 13, Katness Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) along with the other tributes that made it out, have been learning more about how a huge group of rebels have been planning an attack on the capital for a while. Katness is reunited with her mother, sister Prim-Rose and even Effie Trinket (played by Elizabeth Banks), but is bitter about leaving Peeta behind. She's introduced to the rebel leader, President Alma Coin (played by Julianne Moore) who asks Katness to be the ""Mockingjay"" for their cause. <br/><br/>She says no, but changes her mind once she's shown two horrific sites; her District 12 bombed out and Peeta (played by Josh Hutcherson) now appearing on Capital TV, with his mind brainwashed, asking for the rebels to stop. After staring in a series of propaganda commercial for the rebels, she then travels to District 8 to meet the injured, but only before the capital shows to bomb the place. Still going, Katness vows to continue fighting the Capital as she juggles being a symbol and sticking to her oath of saving Peeta. <br/><br/>I've never been a fan of splitting stories. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1 suffers from really only being half of a story. I would have been willing to sit through a four-hour movie, and I think fans would have done so too. Does only having a little of a story ruin it? Not totally. In fact, I still recommend this movie as a great continuation of this saga. <br/><br/>I've warmed up to The Hunger Games more recently as it's manages to get across a grim subject to teenagers and young adults about post traumatic stress and a Soviet-like government (I can't recommend this to anyone under 12 though; too violent). As before, the cast from before takes it's story very seriously and all play the parts well. Julianne Moore is a nice welcome who rarely picks a bad role. My favorite newcomer is Natalie Dormer as the resident director of Katness's propaganda movies. She is passionate about the rebellion, but knows when enough work is enough to allow Katness to be herself. <br/><br/>I'll give this seven hanging trees out of ten. What may throw off previous fans is that this is a slower, more political based Hunger Games story. Action fans will probably be pleased, though not as much as before; they just need to really pay attention. I'd see the other movies before checking this out. I'll be checking the final one come next year!"
"zardoz-13","7","1","11","8 December 2014"," Above-Average But Dreary ""Hunger Games"" Sequel
","As much as ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" captivated me, I'm less than elated that Lionsgate has split the final novel of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy into two movies. Watching ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" is like watching half of a good movie. Worse, Lionsgate plans to make audiences wait for another year before they fold this franchise. Of course, the ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Twilight"" franchises made a mint with this shrewd strategy, so it's no surprise Lionsgate, the same studio that released the ""Twilight"" epics, would not pass up such an obvious opportunity. As fastidious and well-made as ""Mockingjay Part 1"" remains, all ""Catching Fire"" director Francis Lawrence and scenarists Peter Craig of ""The Town"" and Danny Strong of ""The Butler"" have done is produce a potboiler that simmers more often than sizzles for two hours and three minutes. Indeed, this qualifies as the shortest entry in ""Hunger Games"" franchise. Comparatively, ""The Hunger Games"" clocked in at 142 minutes, while ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" edged it out at 146 minutes. The way they've made ""Mockingjay Part 1,"" we see more of Katniss Everdeen and Plutarch Heavensbee than President Snow, Haymitch Abernathy, Gale Hawthorne, Effie Trinket, Finnick Odair, Caesar Flickerman, and Johanna Mason. Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence spends more time shedding tears than shooting arrows. Indeed, she shoots only one arrow in this installment. Making the most of his handful of scenes, a gleefully wicked Donald Sutherland delivers the best line: ""Miss Everdeen, it is the things we love most that destroy us.""<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" picks up the plot after Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright of ""Casino Royale""), and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin of ""The Quiet Ones"") have been rescued. Unfortunately, the treacherous Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman of ""Doubt"") and the resistance have failed to liberate Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson of ""Red Dawn""), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone of ""Sucker Punch"") and Annie Cresta (Stef Dawson of ""Manhaters"") in the aftermath. Meantime, Katniss and her traumatized companions are recuperating from their tribulations in District 13, but our heroine doesn't know if Peeta managed to survive Panem's third Quarter Quell. If you haven't seen ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" you may be at a disadvantage. Eventually, she learns that Peeta is alive, but he is being held in the Capitol by President Snow. Plutarch and District 13 President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore of ""The Big Lebowski"") convince Katniss to serve as their standard-bearer for the rebellion. They need her ""anger-driven defiance"" desperately to shore up the sagging support among the other districts in the wake of District 12's annihilation. Remember, Katniss, Peeta, and Gale Hawthorne all (Liam Hemsworth of ""The Expendables 2"") grew up in District 12.<br/><br/>The action alternates between above ground and below ground. The above ground scenes where either Katniss or the rebels battle the enemy provide the most excitement. The scenes below ground in District 13's deeply entrenched bunkers, where Katniss agonizes over poor Peeta's ordeal, constitute classic, four-handkerchief, hand-wringing, chick flick fodder. Worse, the scenes involving the secret mission to snatch Peeta from under Snow's nose yield only a modicum of suspense. Nevertheless, as static as this sophomore sequel is, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1"" easily surpasses the half of the novel that it depicts without sacrificing much source material fidelity. <br/><br/>Essentially, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" combines elements of a war movie with a love story. The war story sequences generate fewer thrills than the tournament sequences in the two previous outings, while the scenes between a love-sick Katniss and a tortured Peeta are histrionic in every negative sense of the word. Katniss wanders around and whines, while a visibly wretched Peeta looks woebegone and far away. These scenes are as dreary as the air-raid sequence is tedious. The scenes of the lumberjacks scrambling up trees to avoid being massacred by President Snow's trigger-happy soldiers and later the assault on the dam are sensational, but these scenes cannot compensate from the loquacious inactivity during the subterranean sequences. The new characters that flesh out the action are fresh, but they lack charisma, while the regulars have been confined largely to the sidelines in cameos. Of course, each will play a larger part in the second half. <br/><br/>Mind you, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" looks terrific. The producers have blown a bundle on every scene. The destruction of the District 5 dam is nothing short of spectacular, with a chorus of suicidal heroes storming a gauntlet of soldiers to detonate crates of explosives. The concrete mountains of rubble, twisted metal, and skeletons galore in District 12 appear thoroughly convincing, too. Philip Messina's production designs, Larry Dias' set decoration, and the art direction by Andrew Max Cahn, Lauren E. Polizzi, David Scheunemann, Steve Summersgill, and Dan Webster enhance the atmosphere and credibility of the film. The sumptuous looking sets and slick production values, however, don't offset the film's sluggish pace. <br/><br/>Basically, nothing groundbreaking happens in ""Mockingjay Part 1."" The best scenes occur in the final moments, while most everything else serves as expository filler. Indeed, you know neither Katniss nor Peeta are in jeopardy. In other words, neither are going to die, and what happens to Peeta is the equivalent of having a regular series character slip into a coma while the filmmakers pause the plot to conjure up suspense. Altogether, neither Lawrence nor his scenarists have done anything in ""Mockingjay Part I"" other than delay the inevitable. The hospital bombing sequence, the air raid scene, Katniss' propaganda speeches to arouse the other districts as well as singing a song are dreary. Jennifer Lawrence has a few good lines. Unfortunately, when she isn't decked out in her combat fatigues with a bow and arrow in her fists, she doesn't cut the mustard. Lawrence looks ridiculous in her baggy uniform, and Julianne Moore actually upstages her. Hopefully, Lionsgate is saving the best for ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2."""

This one has a deeper meaning which is really interesting. Also there is a very interesting mystery with Peeta and the movie keeps you in front of your screen waiting to see what happened to him. Furthermore it wasn't so action-packed because it is the start of a revolution that will change everything and everyone must to clear some things out to understand what will happen in the next and last film.

The film fails to deliver action though and is kinda slow, but the script keeps it intriguing and you can never doubt The Hunger Games to succeed even when it has flaws. The world of this war torn country gets more unique and beautiful with every new entry in this film series. Liam Hemsworth actually steps up to the table and delivers some intense, moving and emotional lines and delivers the Gale I remember from the books. Julianne Moore as Alma Coin I thought was pretty cool and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is so good and I like what the direction their going with his character.

I can tell you that this movie was more interesting to me than the first half of the third book. I've been going to the theater with the same group of people for all of these movies and I expected this one to be really bad and it wasn't. It kept my attention, the acting was decent (except for Liam Hemsworth, I still fail to understand why he's allowed to be in movies) and it created some suspense that the book didn't have. Aspects of the book that seemed downright silly didn't appear that way in the movie. It gives the finale some hope, not that I wouldn't go see it anyway. <br/><br/>I give it an honest 7 out of 10 and I'm a pretty hard grader. It's worth going to see. It doesn't have the pizazz that Catching Fire did, but they're on the right track with this one. And a big reason it's not higher is because of the lack of material they had to work with.

","I was quite impressed by this movie and was surprised by the number of negative comments on IMDb. Still, reading through such reviews you see that most complaints are about ""lack of action"" and ""nothing happening"" in this third Hunger Games installment. This is definitely correct - the movie contains much less of ""slash and smash"" and suspense type of moments than the previous two titles. However, this is also exactly what blows your mind if you don't start watching it set on a suspense filled clash in life-or-death setting. What does blow you away is the development in the movie of the pain and hopelessness of the people of the Districts pitted against ruthless and inhumane actions of the Capital and president Snow. The movie develops in quite an orthogonal direction from the previous two titles, and this indeed rubbed a lot of HG1-2 fans the wrong way. <br/><br/>In short, the movie does not contain excessive amount of action or breath-taking developments, but connects on a deeper and emotional level to show the things about Panem that did need to be shown. Don't come set for a suspense/action flick, and you will be rewarded with a deep and rich experience."

The Hunger Games trying to avoid a decline in power at the box office moves forward with Katniss Everdeen(Lawrence)being persuaded to become the figurehead of a ""Mockingjay"" movement per say. The black-robed ninja with bodice-like breastplate and quiver of arrows will lead the downtrodden districts in a not-too-late war against tyrannical President Snow(Donald Sutherland), who has captured Peeta(Josh Hutcherson)forcing him to take part in propaganda interviews intended to appease his comrades ready to rebel. Katniss is sure that Peeta is being brainwashed and uses this as energy to allow herself to appear in a campaign series of anti-Snow vignettes to interrupt government TV broadcasts. Katniss will galvanize a rebellious attack against Snow at the same time attempting to rescue Peeta.<br/><br/>A cast overview: Liam Hemsworth, Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Jeffery Wright, Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","14","7 December 2014"," More great character-centered drama from this franchise, but drags and occasionally forgets to be entertaining
","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" takes a drastic turn from the previous two entries of North America's biggest active movie franchise, but any fan of Suzanne Collins' trilogy could tell you that was coming; what doesn't change is the series' devotion to character-driven drama. In fact, it takes center stage.<br/><br/>The games that defined the original ""Hunger Games"" and ""Catching Fire"" are long gone in this entry; Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has been taken to District 13, which exists entirely underground, where it has developed a massive operation aimed at revolting against the Capitol. President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her trusted adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) try to enlist Katniss as the Mockingjay, the face of the revolution, but she requires some convincing seeing as Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is in the Capitol's clutches.<br/><br/>""Mockingjay Part 1"" takes on the tone of a political thriller with 13 and the Capitol engaged in a chess match and Katniss and Peeta serving as their respective pawns. This is dramatically different, almost a 180 from the previous installments â€” those films were about survival and the main characters' lives were at stake; this film is about psychological warfare with the entire world of Panem at stake. Although ""Catching Fire"" does transition into a larger scale, it still ultimately becomes about the games.<br/><br/>Consequently, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" lacks in action and tries to make up for it in intrigue and suspense. At many points that suspense is quite effective, but screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong hope it will serve as a substitute for action sequences. Well, that's not how blockbusters work. Ultimately, the decision to split the book ""Mockingjay"" into two parts feels like the real culprit for the film's flaws. There's a ton of build-up, but very little payoff, probably because the payoff comes in ""Part 2.""<br/><br/>Otherwise, director Francis Lawrence really makes the most out of the story. This is a darker, much more introspective film, and seeing as those darker, introspective moments in ""Catching Fire"" worked so well, he doesn't struggle making the jump with to more of them in ""Mockingjay Part 1."" He's careful to give the other Lawrence, Jennifer, the time she needs to communicate what Katniss is struggling with to the audience. The change in this film turns Katniss' motivation from survival to something bigger â€” to the choice she must make about leading this revolution. Her wants and desires start to get foggy and the film does a pretty good job of making sense of her, honing in on her protective instinct.<br/><br/>The film also does really nice things with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). Before, they were colorful one-dimensional side characters; now, the way the start of this revolution has shaken them from their previous wants and desires comes through. We see a totally raw, emotional side of Effie, for example, that stands out among the better character components of the film. We also spend more time with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), seeing as Peeta remains rather distant from the plot of this third chapter.<br/><br/>All the character development is lovely, but the lack of action really makes ""Mockingjay Part 1"" drag. Toward the end you can really feel the plot stalling and the movie selling us small parts of the book as big climactic sequences. In order to make what was actually half of a story feel like a whole story, certain liberties need to be taken or scene/sub-plots added (take ""The Hobbit"" trilogy for instance). ""Mockingjay Part 1"" doesn't really do that, it just tries to exaggerate what's already there.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" franchise continues to deliver multi-dimensional storytelling and character development (in an extremely mature way for a mass-appeal PG-13 blockbuster) with ""Mockingjay Part 1,"" but it's missing the fun, sit-back-and-enjoy factor a movie of its kind ought to have. Even if you disagree that a huge event movie doesn't need to be action-packed, you can't disagree that this one feels longer and more dragged out than it needs to be given the summation of what happens. As slow as it might be, however, it should prove to be a pretty huge set up for a more exciting and satisfying finale.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"hannahrosecox","8","1","15","18 December 2014"," This film was brilliant!
","Over four years ago I read the entirety of The Hunger Games Trilogy. When the third book was released some loved it, and others loved to hate it. Events and ideas were mentioned in the first half of the book yet not told in great detail therefore confusing the readers. The book only began to pick up it's pace half-way through. This is why I was initially worried about the third book in this popular trilogy being made into a Part 1 and 2. Yet this film pulled all the best ideas and events out of Mockingjay into a film that had a heart. A heart that leads towards the climax of this franchise without the film dragging in pace. From the music to the acting this film had it all! I loved that this film wasn't afraid to bring forth strong themes that are often hard to swallow for the Young Adult demographic. This is now my second favourite film of this franchise (1.Catching Fire, 3.The Hunger Games) as it portrays themes similar to those in our own society. This film isn't all doom and gloom as some instances of comic relief are used perfectly. I think this film should appeal to teens and adults alike, both books readers or only movie goers."
"caseynicholson","8","1","15","14 December 2014"," The Hunger Games Branches Into New Territory
","In my review of ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", I noted that the first sequel in the Hunger Games franchise was expansive rather than just a retelling of the first film in a new episode of the next year's Hunger Games event. <br/><br/>If ""Catching Fire"" was expansive in nature, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is a full fledged disengagement from the theme of the original film. There is no new ""Hunger Games"" event, with the story instead focusing purely on developments that happen for Katniss, Peeta, and the variety of supporting characters that are now engaging in a rebellion against the Capitol City.<br/><br/>The good news is that while ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is very different in theme from its two predecessors, the movie never the less works in a way that is engaging and enjoyable, all while advancing the plot of the franchise well beyond what a more repetitive sequel would have done.<br/><br/>One thing that occurred to me while viewing this film (along with having watched ""Catching Fire"" again just before seeing it in the theater) is that the franchise itself can be interpreted as a robust criticism of fascism. The Capitol City is essentially a caricature of fascist ideology, and the rebellion against the Capitol can be read as a liberal (in the classic sense of the word) revolt against authoritarian ideology.<br/><br/>At any rate, regardless of what one makes of the political philosophy that undergirds ""The Hunger Games"" movies, ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is a great sequel in an expansive, visionary film franchise.<br/><br/>One word of caution, though: It was surprising and shocking to see Phillip Seymour- Hoffman on screen for the duration of the film, with his having died in early February of 2014. After reading up on this, it seems that Seymour-Hoffman must have filmed for ""Mockingjay Part 2"" before his death as well, and that film (which won't be released until November 2015) will be his last credited film. His performance was fine, but there was just something unnerving about seeing a dead man on screen for so long, particularly given the fact that the film came out nine months after his death.<br/><br/>Still, the movie was great--in my opinion, it was a step up from ""Catching Fire"", even if the original ""Hunger Games"" still stands out as the best film in the series. Thus my 8/10 stars."
"lesleyharris30","8","1","15","13 December 2014"," Not as Fast Paced or Intense as the Previous Installments,but a Good Warm Up for the Finale,
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Its still an enjoyable movie but it is certainly not as good as Hunger Games or Catching Fire,it suffers from the very same thing Deathly Hallows did,they made the first part very slow paced in order to save all the really good stuff for the finale.There is some action in this,but all the really intense stuff has clearly been saved for Mockingjay: Part 2,but I don't think that's entirely a bad thing,because they get through a lot of important things as regards to character development and building up to the finale which honestly would have taken up a lot of time had Mockingjay been one movie.The performances are certainly the highlight this time around,some characters who didn't get a chance to shine in the previous two do in this,Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as usual,we get to see a lot more Gale,played by Liam Hemsworth,who I honestly had very little care for previously,but in this they made him a genuinely interesting character,I also had little sympathy as regards to Elizabeth Banks on the past,but she shines in this as she takes off her make up and we get to see her character more for who she truly is,returning performances from Woody Harrelson,Josh Hutcherson,Donald Sutherland and the late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also very much appreciated,and a great new character played by the amazing Julianne Moore.Suffers significantly from slow pace and little action,but Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1 is still a really great movie that shouldn't be missed by the fans. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the previous two Hunger Games<br/><br/>After the destruction of District 12,Katniss must relocate to District 13,where President Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee convince her to become the symbol of the rebellion at the hopes of rescuing Peeta. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jennifer Lawrence Worst Performance: Jeffrey Wright"

","In the universe defined by the previous films, the story is now more focused on what is true in a system that is based on lies and illusions. This configuration of the society, Orwellian, deforms all human relationships and Katniss can be not more conscious of what Peeta is and thinks. So an atmosphere in all similar to the previous chapters (but with a movement toward the rebellion argument) is at the service of love story between Katniss and Gale or Peeta: the ambiguity of this strange triangle is very bad defined and the decisions of the main characters seem to be taken for contingent choices and can't react positively with the dystopian ambient. As the other films, good entertainment but with weak personalities and in general a movie rated really too much for what it really is: ""alternative"" commercial cinema."

"manizeh-78126","10","0","1","16 December 2018"," Once again, this series never fails to disappoint.
","It seems that as the series progresses, each movie becomes more scary, emotionally hard to take, and more complicated. I like how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) progresses from a simple girl trying to save her sister to a symbol in a rebellion that could start a civil war. I also liked Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson's) progression in the interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) as he slowly tries to warn Katniss to think about what she is doing in terms of being a symbol in a revolution. Each character progresses in a different way, even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).<br/><br/>Firstly, I would like to say that the acting is excellent. Jennifer Lawrence makes Katniss's fear for Peeta's life shine. As she sees the interview with Caesar Flickerman and realizes that Peeta is alive, she runs towards the TV screen and touches it. That is a sign that Katniss truly cares about Peeta at that point, which means that Katniss's love for Peeta becomes more real than it was in the 74th Hunger Games. It was easy to tell when the real Peeta shone through. The real Peeta always had watery eyes.<br/><br/>I also could tell that Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was probably against Alma Coin, (Julianne Moore) who is the president of the supposedly-obliterated District 13. I was actually second-guessing myself on this fact, because at one point, he seems totally on Coin's side. At other times, he seems to disagree.<br/><br/>I liked the scene where Plutarch tries to convince Effie to stop feeling as if she's a prisoner. That was funny. I totally cracked up when Effie changed her mind by saying, ""There isn't a soul in here who knows the first thing about Katniss"" after Plutarch told her that he'll have to find someone else to be a part of Katniss's propaganda team.<br/><br/>I also found it funny when Katniss listed her conditions to President Coin, ending with, ""My sister gets to keep her cat.""<br/><br/>I was very excited when the rescue of Peeta, Johanna (Jena Malone), Annie (Stef Dawson), and Enobaria (Meta Golding) was initiated. I was anticipating Katniss's first meeting with Peeta since his capture, since I read the books first. The scene where Peeta chokes Katniss is MUCH more violent than in the book. In the book, Peeta just puts his hands around Katniss's throat. In the movie, he first shoves Katniss against a glass structure, and she breaks it. Then, Katniss falls to the ground and Peeta attempts to choke her. Because Katniss's face actually turned red, I wonder whether Josh Hutcherson actually had to choke Jennifer Lawrence while filming.<br/><br/>The last scene is scary and emotional the same time. I felt my eyes growing bigger as Peeta tried, violently, to break the straps that held him down while screaming. I felt so bad for Katniss when she was staring in shock at what the Capitol had done to Peeta.<br/><br/>Guide: Recommended for 14 and older, no cuss words, and emotionally hard to take. Peeta screaming as he tries to break free from his restraints might be disturbing to younger kids."

"The-Sarkologist","3","0","1","3 February 2017"," Enough of Katnis Everdine
","Katnis Everdine is really, really starting to rub me up the wrong way. Sure, she is really good with a bow (and also seems to have the ability to magically bring arrows back into her quiver after firing all of them at a bunch a ravenous apes), but she also seems to be very prim, proper, and nothing like the rebel that everybody makes her out to be. Okay, I guess the whole idea is that she is supposed to be the reluctant hero, but as far as I'm concerned she really doesn't come across to me as being all that heroic. In fact after finishing this movie I had literally become sick of the sight of her, which is disappointing because she does play Mystique in the X-men really, really well.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film follows on from the previous one, after the rather annoying cliff hanger where it turned out that half of the people in Capital, including one of John Snow's closest confidants, turned out to be rebels, and that there has been a rebel movement building for quite a while. However, the mysterious district Thirteen, which was only mentioned once in the previous films, and was said to have been destroyed, turns out to be the rebel base. Mind you, as soon as you are introduced to this place, and their leader Coin, you, or at least I, raised the question as to what was so different here than there was elsewhere. Particularly since the so called rebels had this habit of kidnapping people that Katnis trusted.<br/><br/>So, what we have are the rebels wanting to use Katnis, the reluctant face of the rebellion, to film a number of propaganda videos – tell me again how these rebels differ from the rest of Panem? The problem is that Katnis turns out not to be all that good an actor, which was strange because she was a really good actor when it came to pretending to be in love with Peter, but then again we sort of wonder whether she actually is in love with him or not. So, they decide to go out to the war zone where she can be herself, and then use this as an opportunity to film the videos.<br/><br/>Oh, I should also mention that Peter, and some others, were captured by the Capital and are being used in propaganda videos of their own, so the rebels send in an elite strike force – of which Katnis isn't allowed to participate because, well, she actually isn't a warrior, she is just the human face of the rebellion. I am sort of wondering whether I should say anymore, but I won't because, well, I can't be bothered."

The Hunger Games is a unscrupulous photocopy of the masterpiece BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM, and should be avoided, if not boycotted.<br/><br/>Some will claim that The Hunger Games is a 'tribute' or a 'remake' of the BATTLE ROYALE. To them I ask one question: ""What kind of filmmakers make remakes of a movie when the original came out two years ago and has been selling DVDs very well internationally?"" It seems that this particular brand of Indian cinema has decided that it is quite content making money off of other people idea for free. And though it is impossible for the original filmmakers to sue the filmmakers of The Hunger Games (on the account that US copyright laws does not allow for such suit), The Hunger Games should be remembered as a true stain on the development of American Cinema.<br/><br/>Because it has photocopied a great movie, The Hunger Games avoids being an absolute terror of a movie. However, this does not excuse Gary Ross and the section of 'Bollywood' that has involved itself in The Hunger Games's production.

","The real-life lessons: well there was not a particular point or idea that I picked on. There wasn't anything that I thought 'well this could be used in real life as well'. <br/><br/>Plausibility: because of the gender of the movie talking about plausibility is not what one would expect but there are two things that I would emphasise-what they did good and what they did bad. What they did good in my opinion was the plausibility in terms of how you can motivate others to follow you-real emotion, past experience that they remember and a song (strangely quite powerful), i think they were right into believing that you need a person to be a symbol. What they did wrong is that it takes more than a show (marketing)-yes the song, the symbol, the speeches- to start a revolution. As I said those are necessary to get attention and followers but to start a revolution you need to do much more than that. Its not a reality show or marketing campaign.

"tomgillespie2002","6","0","3","25 November 2015"," As entertaining as it is frustratingly unsatisfying
","Following in the footsteps of fellow hit book franchises Harry Potter and Twilight (and arguably The Hobbit), the final entry into The Hunger Games series splits the final book in two, no doubt causing the producers to rub their hands together at the idea of doubling their profits while arguing that the decision was ultimately a creative one. While it would be cruel to state that the result is half a complete movie, Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel finished because, well, it isn't. So we get a build-up without a satisfying climax, while the action remains suitably thrilling and Jennifer Lawrence again demonstrates why she is the most powerful actress in the world right now.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games - which pitted a member of each of the lower-class districts against each other in a fight to the death - are now over, and full-scale rebellion is under way. Katniss Evergreen (Lawrence) has been whisked off to District 13, where freedom fighters are holed up as they plan to finally overthrow wealthy dictator President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Under the leadership of rebel leader President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), Katniss is groomed by former Hunger Games Gamekeeper Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to be the face of the rebellion and places her in propaganda videos, only Katniss can't act for s**t. In the hope of drumming up support, Katniss is sent out into the field with a group of film-makers to witness the destruction inflicted on her people in her absence.<br/><br/>My main gripe with the Hunger Games movies (I haven't read the books) are that the 'good guys' we are meant to root for are little more than a collection of one-dimensional generic heartthrobs. Noticeably lacking charisma are Katniss's two love interests, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), now a soldier in the rebellion, and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), survivor of two rounds of the games and now a prisoner of Snow. Out of the young actors on show, it's only Lawrence who manages to sell her character, evoking sympathy as she is forced in front of the camera as a tool of war to spout ridiculous speeches that she struggles to deliver with any earnestness. On the other side, Snow is placing Peeta in front of the camera as he interviewed by TV host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) pleading with the rebels to put down their weapons and end the fighting.<br/><br/>The focus on the artistry of propaganda from both sides is one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. Like the themes of class divide and capitalism from the first movie, the way the adult themes are weaved into an action movie made mainly for young adults works well, helping to give the story a gravitas rarely seen in blockbusters franchises. Sadly, scene-stealers Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks are given very little to do as the story struggles to fit them in, but the introduction of Moore as the straight- talking Coin adds class and Sutherland positively purrs his way through his role as the big bad, a character deserving of more development and screen-time. The film is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who tragically died during filming, and it's humbling to see the great actor deliver a masterclass when the role doesn't even call for it. As half of a finished movie, Mockingjay Part 1 is as entertaining as it is frustratingly unsatisfying."

","Since the first novel was released in 2008, The Hunger Games series has become one of the biggest YA franchises on the market, and it's been probably the only series to legitimately rival the Harry Potter franchise in sheer popularity. Although The Maze Runner and Divergent have enjoyed enough success to spawn their own film adaptations, neither have been nearly as lucrative as The Hunger Games. The franchise's complicated and timely hero as well as its biting political subtext has attracted many people to the series, and seven years, later the final film has been released to close the series. To get ready for it, I decided to watch the penultimate chapter, Mockingjay: Part 1. After destroying the arena at the 75th Annual Hunger Games, Katniss is brought to the underground District 13 in order to assume her identity as the Mockingjay, a symbol of hope and rebellion for the people of Panem. However, Katniss's hope begins to burn out when she realizes that Peeta was captured by the Capitol and is being brainwashed to convince the people to stop the rebellion. Even as a fan of the series, splitting the final book into two parts felt less like a narrative enhancement and more like an attempt to make more money. Some scenes seemed to drag on too long or be completely unnecessary. The book could easily be adapted into an epic three-hour conclusion and still be effective. There was also much less action than the previous films. However, the action scenes that were present are as poignant and exciting as ever. The series' strengths have always outweighed its issues, and Mockingjay: Part 1 is no exception. Jennifer Lawrence is still mesmerizing in her portrayal of Katniss, and the social commentary is just as timely and striking as it is in the other films. It may feel like too much exposition for the conclusion, but The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a grim and exciting set-up for a hopefully action-packed finale."

","Released in late 2014, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is the third part in the franchise based on Suzanne Collins' popular books. A new nation, Panem, exists in post-apocalyptic North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government led by the pompous President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and others (Natalie Dormer) from the obliterated District 12 go to the supposedly destroyed District 13 to hook up with President Coin (Julianne Moore) and her associates (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Mahershala Ali) where Katniss becomes the ""Mockingjay,"" the symbol of revolution for the oppressed districts of Panem. Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson are also on hand.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I'll watch 'em. I gave the first one a 7/10. This second sequel is a natural extension, but there isn't a lot of action and the drama isn't very compelling, but it's okay. It comes across as drama for teenage girls, which shouldn't be surprising since that's the target audience of the books. Nevertheless, Jennifer's a likable protagonist and I appreciate the realistic air and overall ambiance, as well as the entire dystopian concept. It just needs more oomph, which I hope we'll get with the final film.<br/><br/>Lorde's song during the credits is a highlight (""Yellow Flicker Beat"").<br/><br/>The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Georgia, Germany and Utah (the lake where Katniss sings).<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"

","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is still haunted by the Games. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is holding Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) hostage and using him as a media tool.

However it has to be executed with precision. Those scenes of trying to handle Katniss could have been funny or foreboding. Woody Harrelson has some fun but there are too many awkward moments with the media idea. The writing needs to be sharper. Katniss indirectly causes the destruction of the hospital and it doesn't even occurs to her.<br/><br/>I don't mind limiting the action in this episode. It's trying to set up a lot of things for the finale. Although the rescue ending could have been an exciting sequence. It needs Katniss joining the rescue team. The switching back and forth drains the tension out of the action. It wouldn't cost that much and it would be a great way to end the movie. At the very least, it would silence most of the complainers about the lack of action. This is a good set up for the finale. There are some awkwardness and minor annoyances. Lawrence is able to deliver on a difficult role. There are some good additions to the franchise. I expect a great explosive final chapter."

"tomsuthblack","9","0","7","9 June 2015"," Revolution in the USA? (soon, in a town near you)
","One of the weirdest theories circulating among writer-groups, budding script writers, and different species of crazy people is that this movie is but one of many movies made recently with the aim of psychologically priming and provoking the American people to revolt! ""And why would the Powers That Be want the American people to revolt?"" One wonders, and the answer is : to give a powerful group of army generals, political hawks, and the elites of the military-industrial complex (aka the usual suspects) a very good pretext to run the nation!! The chaos caused by that rebellion will allow for the disarming of the American people, the repressing of any riots that my be caused in the near future due to a sudden deterioration in the Economy caused by a sharp depreciation in the dollar. It will prepare for a governing system not very different from the one ruling China, which has proved to be very effective in generating money for the elites and preventing dissent!!! In other words, it will be a carefully calculated revolution that captures the hearts and minds of those who yearn for more freedoms, equality and economic prosperity, only to goad them in a trap of fascism and tyranny. A revolution designed to cause such chaos and fear that would make people accept the loss of their freedoms as a fair price for restoring the conditions of safety.<br/><br/>The ""Hunger games"" novels and movies are thus, according to that crazy theory, part of a major psychological trick played on the American people to encourage them to revolt. Many other novels and movies are involved. The list doesn't only include dystopian thrillers like ""Divergent"" and ""The Maze"" but also most innocent animation films like ""The Lego Movie""!!!! In my opinion, all this nonsense proves one thing: that Hunger Games have been elevated to the level of a cult novel, and a Cult Movie. The cultural message it contains is very powerful, that one almost wonders if the novels were indeed written by professional psychologists in some smoke-filled chamber of some super-secret Powers That be Think-Tank.<br/><br/>In other words a great series of Novels, and great bunch movies :) My only criticism would be that Pink Floyd is ought to sue for the musical score, part of which (the core theme of the rebellion song) is snatched, quite professional, from Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"" from their album ""Meddle"" (Listen top them, one after the other, and judge for yourself, in case you can't read musical sheets) This , however, official makes Pink Floyd's Echo the most plagiarized song ever. Andrew Lloyd Weber has stolen part of it and used it as the opening theme for his famous ""Phantom of The Opera"" in 1986. And before that the late great satire God, Douglas Adams, based a tale in his novel ""The restaurant at the End of the Universe"" on the Video of the song Echo, which was included in the Pink Floyd ""Live in Pompeii"" tour. I will not tell you which part of Douglas Adams book was based on that song, but I will give you a hint : Disaster Area Band. Just watch the Video and read the book and you will be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Having said that, the musical score is, however,a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ah, and the strangulation scene was rare achievement in acting and movie directing. A pity there is no such thing as ""Oscar For Best Strangling"" yet.<br/><br/>I gave the movie 9/10. The deducted one is because Donald Sutherland's acting was the taddest bit short of absolute perfection, of which he is capable."

","*** Review contains small spoilers***<br/><br/>For someone who reads a lot and is very often disappointed in movie adaptations, ""Mockingjay Part I"" is one of the better adaptations. Although I prefer consistent movies that are not split in 38472 Parts and sequels, it was a good idea to split the last book in two parts to contain the narrative of the last book. The screenplay seemed to be very structured and was able to build a good picture on the rebel revolution, but sadly, some scenes were just too melodramatic. This melodramatic touch was, unfortunately, reinforced by Jennifer Lawrence' portrayal of poor Katniss Everdeen, which seemed more often than necessary a bit over the top (who wakes up like this after a bad dream?). But the most disappointing was not the melodramatic display of the protagonist, but the boring ""I don't care what's going on"" acting of Julianne Moore, which couldn't be saved by the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann or Josh Hutcherson's accurate and surprisingly credible portrayal (if you just ignore the weird torture-Make up). <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I appreciated the small details like Katniss' Song, which is one of two moments in the film that can give you the heebie-jeebies - that is, of course, if you' re not already asleep."
"dwankan","6","0","4","1 May 2015"," Manufactured Tension
","I liked some moments in this movie, but too many of them consisted of forced conflict. It's hard to believe the main character is stupid enough to reject the cause of the rebellion, but she does, repeatedly, because there seems to be a desire to re-create the same formula as the previous in this part of the series. I guess the idea is that she's independent and thinks everyone is trying to use her, but she becomes utterly impossible to sympathize with in this film because she leverages everyone's life for Peeta's. Unfortunately, it doesn't work, and it isn't believable. I have to say, though, all the comparisons to the Japanese film Battle Royale are absurd, as the Japanese film is nothing like Hunger Games, and it also took its story from another, and so on. Rejecting a novel or a film because it has some plot similarity to another film or novel or short story will eliminate all stories ever made. If we want to be precise, we can go back to the original short story by Ralph Ellison and discount all variations, but that's wasted time, and it has nothing to do with the merits of this film. I'm on board with the complaints that this was artificially cut into two parts. Film makers are trying to trick us with this nonsense, and I refuse to pay any time and money to Peter Jackson's absurd over-extension of the one-book classic, when he spent three (admittedly overly long) films on a six book series. This should have been one film, and since it wasn't that great as the half of the film it should have been, I'm going to be reluctant to pay for the next part. In fact, I might just buy and read the book instead."

The scene when they fly in to rescue Peeta and the other tributes makes my heart race every single time I watch the film; even though I know what happens it never fails to draw a physical reaction out of me...

Not every scene has to be dramatic or action packed to convey meaning.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was once again awesome as Katniss. However, for me there were two big surprises. First, I am no Woody Harrelson fan, but he is great as Haymitch and may be my favorite character after Katniss and Peeta.<br/><br/>Second, after reading the novels, I wasn't sure who I would have picked as President Snow. However, Donald Sutherland is perfect and he could not have been better cast. Lastly, if anything about this movie is boring, its Liam Hemsworth's Gale.

","Having read the reviews that 'Mockingjay Pt1' has received till now I am forced to wonder, did anybody seriously expect anything of worth to happen in this film? It is only the first third of the book and nothing ever happens in the first third. We start as Katniss is being airlifted to District 13 where she is cajoled into becoming 'The Mockingjay' the symbol of the resistance. To do this she appears in a very bad mocked up propaganda video which fails to inspire and only gets it together when she witnesses the Capitol firebombing a hospital at which point she screams the immortal lines 'If we burn, you burn' at President Snow. The film then follows the path leading up to, we presume, the invasion of Capitol by the resistance. The film itself isn't too bad and Jennifer Lawrence, as always, gives an intense performance and while she is on the screen, the viewer is totally captivated. I am looking forward to the second half which is sure to be action packed. My only gripe is not with this movie but with the decision by Hollywood that every third book has to be split into two parts. It didn't work with 'Twilight', it didn't work with 'The Deathly Hallows', and it probably won't work with 'Mockingjay' but greed and the wish to bleed cinema goers of every last buck will probably ensure that they keep on doing it."

","This film is the third movie following The Hunger Games trilogy. It is the first of two films following the novel Mockingjay. The film follows the story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). The film begins with Katniss waking up in District 13. She has survived two hunger games and has now been retrieved by District 13, who was once thought to be non-existent. During the film Katniss works with the president of District 13, President Coin (Julianne Moore) to start a right in the Districts to rebel against the Capital. Reunited with her sister Prim (Willow Shields), her mother, and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss agrees to become the Mockingjay. A symbol for all of the Districts to symbolize and follow. Throughout the film the Capital and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) attempt to take down Katniss and District 13. President Snow is using Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) against Katniss. He knows that she loves him and in the beginning of the film, he drugged and used in attempts stop the rebelling throughout the Districts over the Capital. However, Katniss is determined to bring Peeta to District 13 with her. District 13 is successfully able to retrieve Peeta along with the other victors from the Capital. However, it is not what she expects. Peeta has been brainwashed and is programmed to kill Katniss. Peeta is kept in isolation in attempts to undo the hi-jacking"" of his brain, as they call it. The film is the groundwork for Mockingjay Part 2, where District 13 will take on the Capital. The theme of the film is to start a riot in the brainwashed Districts against the capital for the right of humanity. The film is centered on making the other people in the District see what is really happening in the Capital and to never lose hope. Katniss takes on the role as the Mockingjay to serve as a mascot for the fighting they are about to face. Many people in the Districts were unaware of the happenings in the other Districts and were not aware of the unfair treatment they had been receiving. Katniss works to reveal to them the cruelty against humanity and to take the Capital, which is the leading of brutality against the Districts. This film is very similar to the Divergent. That film involves a plot of citizens living in community divided by factions. The factions are unequal, just as the Districts. Much like the Hunger Games, the story involves tragedy in children/teens. The Hunger Games chooses their gaming entertainment among children, while Divergent determines the faction of each person as they are children. Divergent is the beginning of a rise against the government to end the abuse against humanity and the faction lifestyle. There are special effects and sounds used throughout The Mockingjay. As much of the film involves combat style fighting, there are hovercrafts flying through the air, special weapons being used, and a large amount of explosives. In addition to the effects from the fighting, the music in the film sets the scene to a dark feel. There are several songs used in the film that would make you feel more suspenseful, or uneasy. The music suggests to the viewers that something dramatic is about to happen without using any dialogue. Lastly, the film is a thriller. It will leave you on the edge of your seat, anxious to see what will be waiting in Mockingjay Part 2. It involves romance, action, and even comedy. Regardless if you have read the books or not, the films are definitely worth watching."

","I wasn't excited to see this film. That's because I've read all three Hunger Games books by author Suzanne Collins, and I knew that the first part of Mockingjay includes very little action. Still, I like what director Francis Lawrence did with Catching Fire (2013) so, when I had the time, I watched Mockingjay - Part 1. This was over a month after it was released in theaters. I have to say that I was again impressed by what Lawrence and producer Nina Jacobson managed to do. Mockingjay - Part 1 is not a dull film. In fact, it's quite entertaining. In my opinion, director Lawrence should get most of the credit. Together with the producers he once again made a thrilling and well-paced film in which not one scene is wasted. Parts of the film can even be called inspired. The actors also did a good job. I don't think that there's one performance that stood out for me but every actor was solid. This time Josh Hutcherson, playing Peeta Mellark, managed to pull off a good performance. It's particularly effective during the Capitol television interviews. In my previous reviews I mentioned that Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have the looks to play Katniss Everdeen. But I admit that she really is a good actress, and for this film she delivered her best Katniss performance yet. But it's Donald Sutherland, the master actor, who continues to impress the most as Coriolanus Snow. The way he speaks and his facial expressions are mesmerizing. He makes every second count, and in the bleak offering that is Mockingjay - Part 1 he is particularly memorable. Of course, this film is a Hollywood product, even if it is very well-made. It also doesn't leave a lasting impression on viewers, which is the big reason why reviewers didn't like it as much as, for example, Catching Fire. There's no big payoff or struggle at the end of the film. It can only be viewed as the first part of a larger film. But I still recommend it. The film's marketing campaign made me interested, and when I watched Mockingjay - Part 1 I wasn't disappointed at all."

","Mockingjay is satisfactory continuation of excellent franchise. Raises the series to a new level and does not suffer too much because of the separation of the two parts. Lawrence is perfect, the rest of the team at a high level, a political game cleverly designed. At times the action drags, but the script pulls out of boredom over Lawrence. The film feels overcrowding new characters, so they have the old minimum playing time. I can not help feeling that would not split the whole experience was more complete, and thus in the name of money cut good potential. If the first part was good, the second was even more improved version of the first, but the third part sums up the whole story in one goal Civil War"
"palombo-angelo","10","0","8","16 February 2015"," Good Adaptation.
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 1 is simply a great adaptation from the source material written by Suzanne Collins. Being a fan of the books and the movies i went into the theater with high hopes and i was not disappointed. If you are going to this movie just for the action and not the story then my friend you will be very disappointed. This movie has a few scenes of action here and there, but the main focal point of the film is Katniss struggling with Peeta being captured and becoming the Mockingjay. The director did an amazing job at exposing more of the country of Panem, and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is one of her best performances yet! In the novel, it is only through Katniss's view, so we only see and hear what she encounters, but in this film we see tons more and really feel the impact that she has on all the districts. Although, Katniss is still very hesitant taking on the role as the Mockingjay in this movie, i really hope she embraces it and kicks ass when Mockingjay part 2 rolls around this November."
"eddie052010","8","0","10","10 February 2015"," The best of the series so far.
","After watching a film, many people will have many different reactions to it, whether it be one of joy or one of hatred. Other times however, another reaction to a film could be one of disappointment. Whether it be the film not living up to its hype and potential or seeming like a film that was too big to fail, there are many films that while not overall bad, are considered major disappointments. Many would tell you that this film would be a continuation of this trend, due to being overlong, slow and not much payoff, as well as being a supposed weak follow-up to the previous films (which admittedly aren't great films to begin with). The film is a lot better than many give it credit for however, and is definitely the best of the series so far.<br/><br/>The story is that after the events of the previous film, Katniss has gone into hiding along with her family and the rest of the rebels who are planning to overthrow the capital. One way they'll try to do this is through propaganda videos, using Katniss' image as the Mockingjay in order to inspire rebellion in the other districts. However, with her allies at risk and the closing in on the rebels, will she give in?<br/><br/>The plot development is the best of the series yet, as despite not moving at the same quick pace as the previous films (mainly due to how the film is mostly set inside a bunker), in place of it, there is a lot more attention paid on character, story and themes that the other films lacked.<br/><br/>Firstly, all of the characters are well developed. Katniss finally forms into a three dimensional character at this point, and is a lot more interesting this time round. We see her interact with her family, her close friends and the rebels, and because of the amount of time spent on her, we become more sympathetic towards her cause, as she is no longer the whiny and annoying character as seen before, but as a caring, bold and rebellious young woman with a lot of internal conflict to deal with, due to her struggles with her image as the Mockingjay and how it affects everyone around her. Her character is much more rounded this time round, and Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all, clearly showing that after her previous below par performances in the other films, she is fully comfortable in her role. The supporting cast are all around great as well.<br/><br/>Another thing that is really well done is the themes, as they are delivered in a more subtle way this time round, in particular, the idea of the rebels being as bad as the Capitol, considering how they use propaganda and terrorist attacks to inspire rebellion, but arguably are no better than the Capitol, who use similar tactics against the rebels, and in the process, both sides take major losses. It's a very clever idea that's well handled that gives the series more depth than it did previously. <br/><br/>The action in the film is also well done, as there is none of the shaky cam nonsense of the previous films, but now scenes which are well shot and paced and have a strong sense of tension throughout. This is helped by the fact that the villains this time around feel a lot more threatening, with many scenes showing how ruthless they can be, with the highlight of these scenes being Katniss returning to District 12 and finding the place to be completely in ruins, eventually stumbling across skulls and other body parts in the rubble. It is due to this that the villains feel much more intimidating this time round, which makes you even more invested and caring towards the main characters. <br/><br/>However, despite many positive attributes, there are still some problems. Despite the increased threat that the villains have, Donald Sutherland still feels widely miscast as President Snow, delivers a goofy performance that would be more appropriate of the Adam West Batman show of the 60's, rather than a dark and gritty film like this. Luckily, he doesn't have much screen time, but kills the mood when on screen. There is also some really unfunny comic relief as well, particularly in the case of Katniss' cat and while humour is needed to calm the audience after so much action and dark moments, the comic relief sometimes goes too silly for its own good, and once again ruins the tone. <br/><br/>But outside of that, this film was fantastic. After the below par efforts previously, this sequel finally gives the series the jab in the arm it needed in order to truly take off, with a great story, strong characters that you care about, subtle themes and humour and a lot of exciting action with a lot of tension throughout. While not succeeding in every area, this film is something everyone should see as it is truly great cinema. Ignore the naysayers and check this movie out."

","I personally was very put off by the idea that Mockingjay would be split into 2 parts. (Now it seems every movie has/will do that-- Breaking Dawn, Deathly Hallows, Avengers: Infinity War, Allegiant, etc.) I read many reviews online, and they almost convinced me (without even watching the movie) that THG: Mockingjay--Part 1 was a pointless, boring cash-grab; a set-up movie filled with exposition and ""filler""; a holdover for ""THG Mockingjay--Part 2"". But if I have learned anything from watching so many recent films, it is this: don't judge a film by its posters, trailer, or reviews without seeing the movie for yourself--some films may really surprise you and are better (or worse) than you expected. <br/><br/>I think some of the characters didn't get the screen time they deserved. But I truly only think that because you got to know the characters well in the books, and I think it's kind of hard to replicate that in the movies without some kind of internal monologue. If Mockingjay was a standalone film not based on a book, I'd probably have a very difficult time relating to the characters. However, I know them all well enough to not be that disappointed by a character's short screen time. <br/><br/>I can understand why some people who didn't read the books were disappointed with and failed to connect to Mockingjay--Part 1. But those who read the books should've been satisfied with the film. I think that because I read the books, I maybe could appreciate the movie better than some people (due to the fact that many of scenes in the movie might've seemed pointless, unnecessary, or boring to those who haven't read the books). I personally wasn't bored during the movie—because while nobody was fighting to the death, and there wasn't much action—there was still good performances from the cast and some nice ""political subtext"". <br/><br/>Because of the focus given on character-driven story lines and political allegories, I think that some viewers were distanced by the film's approach. I personally think that instead of adapting the book as well as they did, they should've created some battle scenes (possibly focusing on missions from each side of the war between the districts and the capitol). Maybe they could've shown some battles that rebel and Capitol soldiers fought, with people such as Beetee, Haymitch, Boggs, President Snow, etc. overseeing it all. ""Mockingjay Part 1 is less popular than its predecessors because it's a deliberate move away from action towards a more cerebral, darker kind of war movie."" Because the movie doesn't rely on action scenes, and it's still good (IMO), it's proof that THG films aren't dumb YA novel adaptations. They can do well without deadly competitions in arenas and ""silly teenage romance"". <br/><br/>The movie has a lot of things that probably turned off some people-- no Hunger Games, not much real action/fighting, less of an emphasis on the love-triangle romance, being split in two parts, etc. And being on top of ""Fandango's list of most-anticipated films of 2014"" probably contributed to this film's lukewarm critical reception. When people had such enthusiasm and high expectations for the movie and they were disappointed, they probably got angry. So, besides a lack of action sequences and some characters getting little screen time, I actually thought that the movie wasn't bad. This movie probably could've explored/developed certain aspects of the movie's environment/atmosphere better than it did, but I think it's still a bit better than the first HG film. It's still not nearly as good as Catching Fire though. Mockingjay-Part 1 ""did not do a good enough job showcasing the conflict between the characters. The third book was very somber and full of distrust. The moviedidn't really capture all that you read, where previous movies they did."" The second one can reach level of tension and excitement that this one never can. <br/><br/>Mockingjay-Part 2 will be released on November 20, 2015. <br/><br/>I have reviewed 38 other movies on IMDb and Metacritic, including the 2014 and 2015 films: Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X- Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more. <br/><br/>I review TV shows (on IMDb & Metacritic), such as: Empire, The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship, Sleepy Hollow, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, The 100, 24: Live Another Day, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more.

","Well, I am a huge fan of this movies, but I have to admit that this movie doesn't have so many effects and action like Catchingfire. OK, you must be thinking like ""What are you saying?! How can this movie don't have so much action? It's a revolution movie!"". Well the fact is that this movie doesn't have so much action like the next movie. I think this movie is more like meet the character separately, Katniss without Peeta and without the capitol. I think is so cool the fact that we could think about her more like a person that someone just meaning a piece of games to cause fear in a country. This movie is really touching to see, when you know the characters and if you read the books. However, I think that something is missing in this movie, and I'm sure that we will see it in part 2 and I'm so exciting."
"singing_gal1994","9","0","10","14 January 2015"," Amazing Book Adaption- You'll love it if you have read the book!
","First of all I would like to say: There are no ""hunger games"" in this movie. That is supposed to be a good thing, because the whole point of the movie is standing up for the freedom of a country, by getting rid of President Snow and the Hunger Games. Yes, there is not a lot of action, and I think this is an good thing. I loved how they focused on the government and other important topics. I noticed that many of the people who have made low ratings, had not read the book. To be honest, that's probably why they didn't like it, because they didn't understand the whole meaning. That being said, I also know people with ages ranging from 20-50 who absolutely loved the movie, and they hadn't read the books. If you go in looking for more than just an action movie, you won't be disappointed. If all you are looking for is an action movie, don't bother going to see Part 2 because it becomes a lot more than Katniss firing an arrow at this point. If nothing else, go to see this movie for the acting, because that alone is worth the price of admission. I thought Mockingjay was the best one so far. Also, for all the comments about teenyboppers, I am 21 and know serious hunger games fans who are 20-30 years older than me, both genders. This is a movie that people of all ages can enjoy, but I would specifically recommend reading the book first. Then you can really understand the plot and get a lot more out of the movie. Have fun reading!"

","While the movie did give a feel to be a precursor to the final film, I felt that it did not detract from the feel, emotion, or overall story of the franchise.

There were several well done emotional points and I felt the Gale character was very well developed.

"beatrice-manuel-1997","8","0","11","11 January 2015"," The Best Yet
","If you thought the book was beautifully tragic, the movie makes it a point of drawing out all of that from the novel and amplifying it over a million times, leaving the audience both mesmerized and shaken all through out the 123 minutes that Mockingjay: Part I has to offer. The very first scene is a grieving Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), keeping to herself near a heating duct as she mumbles - clearly still stricken by the events that have transpired.<br/><br/>After destroying the arena in Catching Fire and further inciting the rebellion among the districts, Katniss moved to District 13 which is in fact continuing to function underground unbeknownst to the Capitol. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) having been left behind and now kept captive by the Capitol is a constant source of anger and guilt for Katniss. These emotions conflict in her truly embracing the role of the Mockingjay - something that both Plutarch Havensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), leader of the rebellion and District 13 want her to do.<br/><br/>Plutarch attempts to kick her into gear as they start producing propaganda videos. It doesn't go very well, until Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) throws in a helpful suggestion of having her be in real action rather than read lines off of some script. This is when we begin to witness Katniss's true transformation into the Mockingjay. It's a combination of the emotional toll of mainly two things: seeing what's left of her home, District 12, and more significantly, the horrendous bombing of the hospital in District 8.<br/><br/>What follows is one big political game in a growingly war-torn nation of Panem. The whole movie is really a gambit of sorts. Although Katniss is the face of the rebellion, she doesn't have much control over the situation as she watches helplessly from behind screens at what little the Capitol is willing to reveal of her beloved Peeta, further fuelling her rage. Much like the Capitol is using him as a tool, we all begin to realize that she is as much a pawn in the game that the rebellion brings forth.<br/><br/>We can clearly see that every actor in this movie really took it up to the next level in terms of their performances. From the minor characters such as Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) to our main star, Katniss, the acting on a whole was top-notch especially Jennifer Lawrence's. I think the effective portrayal of the political turmoil and desperation that forms the crux of the story is what really made this movie the most emotional one yet. As you're watching the film, you're right there with Katniss, living the horror through her eyes. You feel everything she does. J-Law's acting surfaced the character, more so in this movie than in its predecessors. As Katniss transforms into the Mockingjay, you see Jennifer Lawrence become Katniss Everdeen.<br/><br/>Another plus-point is that this film no longer explores the action of the Games in an arena much like the first two did. We see an all-together different side of the story. The uprisings grow in number, and with it, the death tolls of several people that are fighting for their rights. It's not just a Game confined within an arena but one that shakes the whole of Panem. We also see more of President Snow's dark side in this film (another example of character building that is clearly shown). <br/><br/>That brings me onto the next point. Some may feel that the film was slow-paced because of its lack of action. Most of the film is spent watching Katniss trying to accept her role in the rebellion as we watch her shoot propaganda videos and try to help move things along for the return of Peeta. Although it didn't bother me too much, other viewers might find it a little - dare I say - boring.<br/><br/>My next point might get me a little hate from the fans who ship Katniss and Gale (Liam Hemsworth). With Peeta out of the main picture in this film, it's Gale's turn in the spotlight to try and woo Katniss over to his side. Sure, they had some cute romantic moments but the chemistry between the two was just dead, even with their acting being brilliant and all. I'm not saying this because I ship Katniss and Peeta (which I do). I find everything romantic, trust me. But there was literally not one pinch of chemistry between Katniss and Gale - which could be a good thing as the main focus of the movie should be the tones of war and politics, not a love triangle. Also, even with Gale grabbing a lot more screen-time than Peeta in Mockingjay: Part I, I feel that the few minutes where Peeta did make it on the screen were far more emotionally appealing than the Katniss and Gale moments that were offered to us. You would have to be an emotionless robot to watch those scenes and not have your heartstrings played. Seriously.<br/><br/>It's great to see a mainstream franchise with important themes such as the destructive effects war, politics and propaganda can have on a society become a hit among the younger generation. Even though its based off of a fictional dystopia YA-novel, it appeals to all age groups and with a gripping story and characters, has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The ending was quite psychologically disturbing, and had my stomach churning. It ends on such a note that makes you both dread and anticipate the last instalment of the franchise.<br/><br/>Mockingjay: Part I is personally my favourite film from the series so far. I give it a 8/10 rating and cannot wait for the final movie to come out."
"sjarja","7","0","10","9 January 2015"," satisfied my expectations
","I liked this movie (although i seriously become annoyed by Hollywoods habit of splitting movies into part 1 and 2 like that!!!).<br/><br/>It shows a lot more character development than the first 2 movies and explains more about ""the world"" the hunger games are played in (for the people who did not read the novels) The effect of the propaganda movies is well done (a little blunt maybe but still well done) - and the replacement of politics and the escalation of the rebellion seemed believable.<br/><br/>What i did not like too much is that the displayed districts ""felt"" more like small stages than actual - well... countries (or states). But i guess there is only so much one can do in a movie. Also - i would have loved to see more action/reaction between district 13 and the Capitol to show that the conflict had entered exactly those stages where there were people actually fighting in the field and also fighting in the media - just as fiercely.<br/><br/>Especially the reveal that the Capitol had been the architect of pretty much everything should have been a MUCH greater shock than it came across."
"josephvinton","7","0","7","7 January 2015"," Mockinjay Part 1 is an intriguing depiction of the novel it is however not as good as either of the previous installments
","As I have read all three books and have now seen all the released movies I can safely say that I do believe that the Hunger Games franchise is in safe hands. For both people who have read the books or who have only seen the films I think they will be satisfied. <br/><br/>I was sceptical at first whilst going into the movie and yet I was intrigued to see how the narrative would play out on screen. I personally felt that the third book in the Hunger Games Trilogy ""Mockingjay"" was the most monotonous and disengaging out of the lot, so when I heard that Lionsgate was going to split the novel into two I like most people thought it was a heartless cash grab that would not pay off. <br/><br/>Mockingjay Part 1 is by no means better than the other two previous instalments of the series but it is not however a bad film contradictory of some of the other more naÃ¯ve reviews. It serves (as I had hoped) as an engaging build up for the final chapter in the Hunger Games cinematic series. Although I still think that it was not right to split Mockingjay up, the first part has proved to be better than I thought and I walked out of the cinema feeling exited for the finale. <br/><br/>For people who have not read the books and have only watched the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Catching Fire"" I have to mention that the movie is a complete deviation from the practically identical structure of the other two films. Mockingjay Part 1 delves deeper as you might expect into the intricacies of building a revolution against the capitol. If you enjoyed the two movies purely for the spectacle of the arena and the survival element of the plot you will not like this movie but if you are invested in the acting talents of this series you are more likely to see this movie as an enjoyable cinematic experience. <br/><br/>For people who have read the book I will say that Mockingjay Part 1 is a pleasant surprise. I thought like the book the film would be dull and slow paced. The first two thirds of this film are worth your time even if the final part felt a little stretched. All of the Mockingjay book by Suzanne Collins was a disappointment for me but I think the plot has been rectified and showcased properly in this film. The film unlike the book expands on Collin's world, in a subtle way and gives you more of an insight into the establishment of opposing propaganda clips which I found thoroughly entertaining and interesting (this was not depicted so much in the book). <br/><br/>I would have given this film a 5 instead of a 7 if it was not for the superb talents of Jennifer Lawrence & the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their performances arguably carry the story and do not falter throughout the duration of the movie. Hoffman's intellectual and shockingly comedic portrayal of Plutarch Heavensbee is yet another reminder of what a great character actor who we have lost and who will miss in the foreseeable future. <br/><br/>This movie includes a solid soundtrack and outstandingly realistic special effects. If you have enjoyed the acting and the characters you will like this movie. If you didn't like Mockingjay the book try out this feature because it may as I found surpass your expectations. This movie has at the very least made me want to rush to see the final film which I suppose was its primary function as a studio cash grab. <br/><br/>Even now I think that this time next year when the final movie of the Hunger Games has come and gone I may even be a little upset when I come to realize that it is all over."
"nicolechan916","8","0","11","2 January 2015"," Good development of the story with great effects and acting.
","There have been many negative reviews of this film, and the main reason why is because this film split the final book into two parts, thus, this film shows more of a story development rather than a story in itself. It complements the series, but it isn't a film to stand by itself. Having read the books as well as seen the previous films, I quite enjoyed part one of Mockingjay. True, there isn't much action, but we get to see a lot of character development which I'm always hoping for more in movies.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty great, though Hemsworth and Moore's portrayal of their characters seemed a bit flat. I guess Hemsworth's Gale has always been rather flat, but I was expecting a little more from Moore. Lawrence captures the emotions of her character well, as does Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch. But for me, Elizabeth Banks was the one who really shined. She isn't on screen for long, but her character's personality is so unique and blatant that you can't help but notice her. She has done a great job in playing Effie Trinket so consistently throughout the series.<br/><br/>The effects as well were well done. This had a lot of explosions in it, and thankfully they did not look fake. Also, the graphics for the debris and destruction was really life like.<br/><br/>However, there was one major goof that was quite noticeable in the film. While filming propaganda videos to show the other districts, footage that wasn't captured by on-screen characters turned up in the video, which makes one think: who filmed that? There were also several other scenes that had me questioning things like that.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't disappointed like many were and quite enjoyed it. At first I questioned the splitting of Mockingjay into two parts, but it gives room for them to add more detail into the finale. I can't wait for part two!<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","Coming into this film, I had no idea what to expect. I had not read the book or even seen a trailer, now that I think of it. I did indeed read the other 2 books in the series and see the movies. However, I did not have the slightest idea of the ride that was waiting for me!<br/><br/>It may start out a bit slow, but Jennifer Lawrence's acting does not disappoint (again!). One thing I can say about this film is that not only is the action thrilling, but the acting is superb and scarily believable. Although Josh Hutcherson did not have the most screen time in this one, his acting is astounding. Without spoiling anything, his last 2 scenes will leave you scarred in the best way possible and his scenes before that will have you tearing up. <br/><br/>Also, Liam Hemsworth stepped up his game from the last 2 films. Previously, Hemsworth played the lovesick boy-next-door who was also surprisingly hot. In this film he pulls through as a warrior and shows a step up in his emotional depth as Gale. However, I still believe that the true gem of this franchise is Josh Hutcherson. Although all eyes are constantly on the stunning, Oscar-winning JLaw, Hutcherson never fails to absolutely kill his performance and touch the audience. The show- stealing performers like Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson as the drunk...yet understanding Haymitch Abernathy, and Elizabeth Banks as the charismatic Effie Trinket that compliment Lawrence's performance and help to make the Hunger Games the international phenomenon it is.<br/><br/>The film's directing, writing, special effects, and (much to my surprise) score were very well done. The combination of those four aspects made for an excellent movie experience. There were moments during this film in which I was completely engulfed in what was happening. And to me, that is a true film success."

I think that the cast is awesome, except I don't like that the guy who is playing Peeta is about 5'1 in height. Peeta is supposed to be 6 foot at the least. But, other than that everyone does a good job. I will ask how they are going to do the Phillip Seymore Hoffman thing in the last film. Or they might have already filmed it.

","I will not judge the people that dislike the movie, simply because they haven't read the books, and I am sure for that. Mockingjay Part 1 is presented almost perfectly and watching this brought back my feelings, thoughts and all the images I have created in my mind when I had been reading the book. There are no more Games and now we see the aftermath. Katniss is trying to ""recover"" from her traumas mostly mental and psychological created by the Games. She has become a symbol of rebellion and hope to the people of Panem. They expect almost everything from her and that is what makes things worse for her. She is struggling to, lets say avoid her predetermined role, but deep inside she knows that she cannot. So this movie, Mockingjay Part 1 is all about her awakening, her personal transition to maturity, and the realization of what she has become. This is what matters in the end...for creating the path of the forthcoming Part 2. Jennifer Lawrence is yet again amazing, and we also see Julianne Moore, Elizabeth Banks, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland giving their true self and high level acting."

","I completely disagree with what other users said: ""set up"", ""boring"", ""melodrama"", all are valid opinions but I think these perspectives are missing something.<br/><br/>Most blockbuster films maintain a sense of detachment between the story and the audience. You walk into the theater, things explode, people hook up, and then you walk out, having gained two pounds in popcorn but gaining nothing emotionally. Maybe that's just what audiences want for entertainment, but I for one want to be impacted by a film somehow, or it's $15 wasted. To be bored by such a powerful and realistic depiction of a dystopia, you'd have to be totally missing the point. What happens in Mockingjay is happening in the world, and I don't see how you couldn't find that jarring and intense. The action that everyone says is missing is there, it's just more complex than your typical one- liner + apocalypse combo. The action is under the surface, in the complicated themes and ideas that the writers are conveying to you, in the internal and external conflicts between characters, in the emotions that are at once dramatic and hauntingly real. You don't get that every day anymore. If you wanted things blowing up and obvious plots that you don't have to invest yourself in, there's probably another Transformers movie you can go see instead. Indeed, I think what people are calling a ""set up"" movie presents a far more important story than what it's setting up for - the explosive conclusion is not what matters. Sorry, Suzanne Collins, but we all knew how Mockingjay would end. Why is that part so important to viewers? The interesting parts of the Hunger Games novels have never been in the love triangle plot devices or 'shocking' deaths. We see that all the time. No, what differentiates the Hunger Games from other series of its kind is the extra level of depth in its themes and morals. The characters are well-written, and the actors portray them well; the plots are simple, yes, but the emotions that drive them are not, and the movie doesn't over-simplify. I<br/><br/>This was the best Hunger Games movie by far. Emotional, intelligent, true to the story, and well-made. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible (though that goes without saying). A perfect balance is held between the witty romanticism of a YA lit adaptation and the somber, harrowing tone of a true dystopia. We throw the word dystopia around all the time, but what makes a good story of that genre is that it has both a sharp systemic criticism and a deep human aspect. This does that - you see Katniss as a symbol and also as a person, which is important. They talk big ideas about government, but they use that to say something about human nature, too.<br/><br/>(Also, if you say you didn't get chills in the Hanging Tree scene, you're lying.)"

","The Hunger Games-Mockingjay Part 1 is an immensely moving first half of the conclusion to this successful franchise.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence delivers what she has been delivering throughout The Hunger Games franchise: a strong character whose reactions to certain situations are crystal-clear and performance is un-cringeworthy. She, as always, leads the cast. Another actor who stood out from the crowd for me had to be Josh Hutcherson, due to the dramatic change in atmosphere he added to the story. He and Lawrence work perfectly together, and the scene involving their scuffle was executed well.<br/><br/>Despite the great tension that occurs every now and then, the pacing is a little sluggish, saved by Jennifer Lawrence's exceptional acting skills. Personally, I believe that this movie achieves what every first part of a franchise finale should achieve: intrigue the viewer into desiring to watch the second part, which is exactly what it has done for me."
"Rickting","7","0","9","25 December 2014"," Unnecessary but interesting
","Thanks to Harry Potter books are constantly being split on film. This doesn't usually work and one part of the double bill or trilogy is always just a 2 hour (3 hour in the case of The Hobbit) build up. Katniss, after destroying the games, becomes a symbol for the rebellion and tries to save Peeta for the Capitol. This is the weakest of the franchise, but I enjoyed it more than others have. Mockingjay Part 1's main problem is the lack of action, but it manages to get away with it just about. Thankfully it's not another Breaking Dawn Part 1. It can feel like something waiting for happen for 2 hours, but it's a pleasant wait. The acting is excellent, and Jennifer Lawrence is a great heroine aside from an overdone nightmare waking up scene. Donald Sutherland doesn't appear that much, but he's wonderful as President Snow. It's still got politics and emotional depth which is what makes the franchise maybe the best YA adaptation series of them all, and the depth combined with the acting places it far above the Harry Potter films.<br/><br/>It certainly comes up short on the action front, but there's enough going on to hold the attention. The trouble is that the film is a blatant cash grab and you can't help but yearn for a 3 hour finale instead of 2 films. Do we really need another hugely anticipated release in 2015? This is well made in many ways, but the endlessly drained colour palette occasionally evokes memories of Twilight and the last few Harry Potter films in a bad way. I still enjoyed this movie and it has plenty of drama which makes it very watchable, but there's too much filming political videos and not enough actually happening. They have a good twist and jump scare at the end though. A decent but disappointing sequel which I enjoyed, but without the acting this would be less bearable. I might go as far as to call this slightly underrated, but the way this is just unnecessary is fairly off putting. Still, it makes us even more eager for the final chapter.<br/><br/>7/10"
"squirrel_burst","7","0","10","9 December 2014"," Good half of a chapter; it'll be essential viewing come 2015
","I find reviewing ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" to be kind of tricky. I'm literally seeing half the story, which means we have a beginning, a middle and kind of an ending, but not really. I suppose in a way the movie feels somewhat underwhelming, but then again, anytime you go into a movie where a portion of the title is dedicated to ""Part 1"", can you really expect a big action-packed climax and a resolution to all of the plots? It tells you from the get-go that you're only seeing half the movie here. Despite this, on its own, we are just seeing the first half of a bigger story and that makes this easily the weakest of all of the ""Hunger Games"" films. Does that make it bad? Not at all, it just means that it is incomplete. I think it's only fair that we all re-evaluating how good this film is when the whole story is concluded, but I still feel like in the mean time, there's plenty of material here to make it worth your while. If you haven't seen the previous chapters, this is not a good point to suddenly jump in. At the end of the last film, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her new allies escaped from the Hunger Games. Unfortunately, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been left behind and captured by President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Learning that her home District has been completely annihilated by military forces as punishment for her rebellion, Katniss prepares herself to become the symbol of the rebellion against the Capitol.<br/><br/>While in the first two films there was plenty of action to balance out the character drama, this film is much more focused on the emotions of the characters. There are a lot of things going on here. Peeta has been captured by Snow and he's probably feeling pretty betrayed by the fact that he's waiting on Katniss to come and rescue him. Our heroine feels guilty about leaving her friend (is it OK to call him her boyfriend at this point?) behind and also feels outrage at what happened to her home. She wants to go up to the old tyrant and shoot an arrow right through his forehead. On the other hand, she doesn't want to get manipulated into being a figurehead for a cause she doesn't believe in. Then we've got other angles as the relationship between Katniss and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) is being tested and the strange relationship between Snow and Katniss. Just because you're not going to see nearly as much of Katniss jumping around shooting her trademark bow, doesn't mean this film is lacking in material. Seeing the movie actually really made me appreciate the performances and the characters that we've seen develop throughout these films. If you're planning on seeing ""Mokingjay part 1"", I'd highly recommend that you freshen up on the first two films, particularly if you haven't seen them since they were released in theatres because it will give you a whole new appreciation for the story that's developing here.<br/><br/>There is a good mix of big developments and small intimate moments here. As much as I liked seeing the seeds for the rebellion against the Capitol being sown and seeing Katniss debate whether or not she wanted to join up with the fight, I think I actually enjoyed the quieter moments more. I realized that some of the characters that I didn't take seriously when the series started have really started to grow on me. The best example has to be Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I distinctly remember thinking that her character was just a generic, airhead minion for the big bad in the first film, but now more than ever I see her as a truly three-dimensional character. If we have to sacrifice action for more intimate moments with the people of this world, I'm not entirely opposed to it. I'm even less offended at the idea knowing that when the next part of the story comes around, all of the big action and epic conclusions we've been waiting for since 2012, when the first ""Hunger Games"" was released is going to be there. A bit of quiet time before the storm ensures that everyone watching the movie will care about what the outcomes are.<br/><br/>I'll admit there were times where I did find myself craving sequences with Katniss going around kicking butt instead of seeing the dominos get set up for the big conclusion. Combine that with the fact that the movie has an ending, but not a big splashy one like you would prefer seeing and yes, that does mean that some people are going to be disappointed with this film. Just keep in mind that there is more coming. This is only Part 1, and they're getting ready to load that one in the firing chamber, it's not like there's any chance whatsoever that we're not going to get a conclusion to this franchise, so just calm down. ""Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" is setting up the high stakes for the final fight, and it will be essential viewing when November 2015 comes around. If you're a fan of these movies, just keep that in mind and I think you'll be more than happy with the movie, even happier when part 2 finally arrives and we get to see how it all comes together.
