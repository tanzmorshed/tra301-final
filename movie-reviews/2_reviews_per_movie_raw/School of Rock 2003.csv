"Chris_Docker","7","156","170","18 February 2004"," Unbelievably - does what it says on the packet
","A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!"

","Greetings again from the darkness.  With so few good comedies these days, it was pure joy to laugh out loud a few times during this Jack Black showcase. Is he over the top? Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes, down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater (the underappreciated gem ""Dazed and Confused"") uses his spot-on observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White (""The Good Girl"") also plays Black's wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine, it is White's writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack, who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today's youngsters, but the tributes to Pete Townsend, Jimi Hendrix, Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role, but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!"

","The perfect vehicle for Jack Black, a film to show that given the right material he's a bona fide comedic actor of some worth. Plot has Black as Dewey Finn, a wastrel musician who has no job prospects and who spends his time mooching off of his best mate Ned Sheebly (Mike White). When Dewey is fired from his rock band he's left in limbo and in danger of being homeless. But when he answers a phone call offering Ned a job assignment, Dewey decides to take it upon himself to impersonate Ned and take the employment himself; as a schoolteacher!<br/><br/>So it's Jack Black in a classroom full of kids, it probably shouldn't work, and even might seem like some sort of cruel and unusual punishment to anyone with an aversion to Black, but this is feel good nirvana and a paean to rock and roll. It's perhaps unsurprising that it's crammed with clichés from the classroom splinter of moviedom, the kids a roll call of characters we have seen numerous times. The spoilt swot, the roughneck, the one suffering parental peer pressure, the weight issue one and on it goes, but boy can they play music when Dewey takes them out of classical mode and into rock central.<br/><br/>How nice to find that director Richard Linklater and writer Mike White have managed to rise above the clichés and avoid syrupy fodder, there's such a zest and earnestness to it all, and the kids acting is high in quality as well, led by the big kid himself, Black on full tilt. But most of all, even as the morals and life affirming threads come wading in with the pulsing rock soundtrack, it's a very funny picture, the gag quota enormously high. Be it Black trying to bluff the kids, the kids trying to bluff everyone else - or the wonderful Joan Cusack as the scatty stickler for the rules Principal Mullins – a laugh is never far away. Rock on! 8.5/10"

","Finally! Somebody has done right by Jack Black. Somebody has actually made a movie where Jack Black can be the man and show off his talents. This is Jack Black at his best and I feel privileged to be alive while this guy's star continues to skyrocket! <br/><br/>Dewey Finn (Jack Black) loves rock and roll. He is the consummate fan who knows every worthwhile group and song. He is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist in his own band called ""No Vacancy."" But other members of the group have grown tired of his immature stage antics, such as 20-minute solos and stage-dives. They vote him out and hire someone to replace him for an upcoming Battle of the Bands contest.<br/><br/>Downcast and distraught, Dewey doesn't know what to do. Plus, his usually patient roommate Ned (Mike White), a schoolteacher, is being pressured by his aggressive girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) to make Dewey pay the money he owes for rent or get out. When a call comes in to Ned asking him to serve as a substitute teacher at the prestigious Horace Green Elementary School, Dewey decides to assume his identity and take the job.<br/><br/>Of course, faced with a class of fifth-graders all nicely clothed in their school uniforms, this rocker doesn't have a clue as to what to do. So he tells them to chill out and enjoy some downtime. This scheme works for a little while but then Dewey visits the orchestra class. Lights go off in his head and bingo! -- the new class project is to form a rock band. He decides to teach them everything he knows about rock with lectures on its history, the evils of ""The Man,"" and the essentials of playing rock songs.<br/><br/>Dewey's spirits are lifted when he realizes that there are some talented musicians in the class including Zack (Joey Gaydos, Jr.), the lead guitarist; Katie (Rebecca Brown) on bass; and Lawrence (Robert Tsai) on keyboards. Freddy (Kevin Clark), the class rebel, turns out to be an eager learner on drums, and Tomika (Maryam Hassan) surprises him with her unusual singing talent. The smartest girl in the class, Summer (Miranda Cosgrove), gets her chance to excel as band manager while others serve as back-up singers, special effects wizard, head of security, and the official selectors of the band's name.<br/><br/>The humor quotient of the film is heightened by the funny performance of Joan Cusack as the uptight and unlocked principal of Horace Green Elementary School. When Dewey discovers that she is a secret fan of Fleetwood Mac, they are able to connect as friends. The rock fan gets his wish when he has the class entered in the local Battle of the Bands. By the end of this rollicking film, you'll happily be chanting, ""For those about to rock, we salute you!""<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"

","What can I say? I'm a rockaholic. I eat, breath, and dream of classic rock and it's glory days. I listen to only rock radios, and every other morning I go on an AC/DC Binge. Rock is pure, and beautiful.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not the only music out there.<br/><br/>Pop culture today sucks, putting it nicely. All that stuff out there is ruining the minds of people of today. For a little while it seems like rock disappeared, hiding underneath everything else, being disregarded by fans today.<br/><br/>Then 'School of Rock' came along.<br/><br/>Dewey Finn (played by Jack Black) is a bum who gets himself kicked out of his own band because of his unruly antics. To top this off, his substitute teacher roommate Ned and Ned's girlfriend Patti begin to nag Dewey for rent money. Dewey can't pay it off. After spending some time trying to sell his personal belongings, a phone call from a prestigious prep school looking for a substitute teacher catches Dewey's attention and he parades around as Ned, hoping to just walk in, let the kids do what they want, get some money, and be gone like nothing every happened.<br/><br/>Until he finds out that the class of fifth graders he has been assigned to teach are musically and vocally talented.<br/><br/>This sparks an idea off in Dewey's mind, thinking that he can turn his group of fifth graders into a rock group so that he can win 25,000 dollars in a contest called 'The Battle of the Bands'.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful, classic - rock fueled movie. Jack Black is hysterical as Dewey Finn. The children are all talented, particularly the ones on instruments and vocals.<br/><br/>If you want to love rock music, go watch this movie.<br/><br/>If not, then you'll have missed out on something great."

","When I first watched this film I did not know what to expect. But was entertained and delighted by its content and spirit. My first thought was how come nothing quite like this has ever been attempted before. It had all the elements that go to make a great story,the enthusiasm of a yet to make it musician, a responsive youthful group of teenage, gifted but unrealised musicians, a controlling, misguided, but persuadable Establishment, and in the blend, the unauthorised teacher of the group nearly discredited. To top it all a contest was entered by this new group of hopefuls, and after initial resistance and disappointment, a final electric performance, gave them all the prize they deserved. There,s only one thing left to say, ""they stuck it to the man""."
"Wizard-8","Null","122","145","10 October 2003"," Maybe it's not intelligent - but it's funny and it rocks!
","Glancing at what other people have written about this movie, it seems that these individuals are taking this film a bit too seriously. Worrying about the ""messages"" this movie is delivering? Come on, there is no way that the con that Jack Black's character pulls off could ever get far in the real world! I don't think any sane person watching this movie would take this seriously. This is a comedy, for crying out loud, made to make us laugh!<br/><br/>I thought Black was fine in this movie. Sure, maybe his character is a little one-note with his proclamations of ""rock on"" and ""stick it to the man"", but Black somehow manages to do it over and over without being boring. He's unbelievably energetic AND versatile, delivering these same things in different ways each time that prevent the movie from getting into a rut. I think it's safe to say that only Black himself could have made this role work so well.<br/><br/>There is plenty of humor and great music. Even my senior citizen parents kept laughing, and told me after it was over that they enjoyed the rock soundtrack as well. It's a great movie for the whole family. Why was this rated PG-13? Sure, there are some references to stuff like alcohol and groupies, but they are not emphasized at all in their brief passing - and your kids will already have seen these kind of things treated much worse elsewhere! In fact, here in British Columbia, the ratings board gave it a ""G"" rating."

","Dewey Finn is a lazy freeloader and a guitarist in a rock band who plays gigs every night and sleeps every day, in his friend Ned Schneebly's apartment. One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn't pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn't go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. <br/><br/>School Of Rock is a great feel-good comedy, fun for just about anyone of any age, kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won't be too harsh on the kids in the movie, they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack, it just wouldn't be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life, and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music, he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film, and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.<br/><br/>This comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. <br/><br/>9/10"

","After being fired from his own band, the guitar player Dewey Finn (Jack Black) needs to raise some money to pay for his rent and his bills. When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly (Mike White) is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school, Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class, and he decides to form a rock-and-roll band with the students and win a competition called ""Battle of Bands"" to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.<br/><br/>""The School of Rock"" is a very funny and politically incorrect comedy tailored for Jack Black. He steals the movie and rocks in the role of a rock-and-roll lover, who dreams to be successful as a guitar player. Most of the lines belong to him, and I believe this movie is his best individual performance in his successful career. Joan Cusack is excellent as usual, and Miranda Cosgrove seems to have potential and be a great promise as actress. The soundtrack is a great homage to rock-and-roll, with many classics including Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". The DVD is full of worthwhile Extras, and in the end this film is an excellent funny entertainment. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Escola de Rock"" (""School of Rock"")"

","If there was an inspirational rock movie then here it is. <br/><br/>All through my engineering that is from 2004 October (when I first saw) till the end of my studies and even today, this movie inspires me with its flamboyance of the JUST DO IT spirit. It's a well written tale and extremely well directed. To take this screenplay and bringing it to life and to extract such great acting from the kids is a serious director's job and kudos to Linklater for having done that so well.<br/><br/>It's a tribute to all those rock bands that have inspired over the years and this movie played a big part for my introduction to Rock music. A bunch of school guys form a band with the help of their teacher. Rather the teacher forms a band with help of school kids assigning them a job and its their journey from becoming a band to making songs. Passionate is how I would say the acting of Jack Black was as he lead the film all through bearing the weight solely on his shoulders.<br/><br/>There was no big star cast except him in the movie and this modest film budget did not allow the movie to explore may be. However, this movie is extremely well made in all departments. Production deign, editing must be given appreciation. editor for sure would have had a major job to have the unwanted and unnecessary things out. <br/><br/>The music selection is also top notch with apt songs coming at the right time.<br/><br/>It's 4/5 for one of the best musical movies ever."

I just saw it as another Sister act minus the nuns, choirs and Whoopi Goldberg, but I was very surprised.<br/><br/>The children were very talented, they played instruments and sang so well it was impressive and you had no choice but to smile.<br/><br/>The music was catchy and realistic to what young children their age would have been able to do.<br/><br/>Jack Black was so funny. Every time something bad happened to him you couldn't help but feel his pain because he was entertaining and down to earth.<br/><br/>Even though the ""music competition"" is so often used in movies, it is different this time.<br/><br/>Basically give this film a chance.

","I wish they made more of these kinds of films. It's refreshing to see a G-rated comedy that had kids but was also funny without having to resort to body function jokes.<br/><br/>It's a film about accomplishment. It's a film about deception to achieve your dreams. It's a film about how children can achieve remarkable things. It's a film about how they can still make good clean movies, even if they're made with kids in mind they can still be funny without being too saccharine. <br/><br/>I just don't get why they don't make more movies like this. Jack Black is in his usual rare comedic and terrific performance form. And the supporting cast is also dynamic, especially the kids who do a bang up job. <br/><br/>There's a bit of three stooges here. There's a little bit of Jerry Lewis. There's a healthy dash of classic post 1950s rock injected into this film, but again clean enough that children and their parents can enjoy it. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic, a conman of a want to be rock star who's on the outs with his former band and one friend, does a bit of double dealing to help bring rock to young minds, enlighten their parents, and make his way back into the thing he loves most; music.<br/><br/>Definitely worth streaming, possibly buying the bluray when it becomes available for your library.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Has anyone noticed that School Of Rock is like a modern, rock version, and 10-millions times better version of Sound Of Music? Both are about a teacher who spends time with a small group of kids and inspires true music in them. Anyone who is 50-90 years old loves the Sound of Music, as a member of the younger generation today I think it's safe to say The School of Rock is the ""Sound of Music"" version of the new millennia, because I doubt another movie in the next 100 or maybe even 1000 years with the same plot (teacher inspiring kids with music) will do better than School Of Rock, just like no movie between 1900-2000 did better than the Sound Of Music in this regard.<br/><br/>Jack Black's passion for the music is obviously sincere and true, just like the teacher lady in the Sound Of Music passionately cared about music and proceeded to teach the children the basic of doe ray memes while running through grassy fields. The Sound Of Music is the mushy Brady Bunch goody goody corny serious set-in-world war II version (which can be enjoyable), the School Of Rock is the hard and humorous and much more up to date version. In the Sound Of Music the main character's main plight was surviving the harsh realities of Nazi World War II along with her love interest; in the School Of Rock, Jack Black's main plight is to survive the commercialization of music (instead of Nazism), i.e. getting kicked off his own band while his band members replaced him with a gorgeous dude with a great body who is more marketable, and seeing that today's elementary kids are fed nothing but crap music. See how it is all modernized more up to date? Basically, the School of Rock ROCKS!"

"lovinyakees","10","5","5","23 February 2015"," A Tale of Two Bands
","Dewey Finn is an arrogant, outlandish musician without a cent to his name; however, he is a catalyst to pursuing ambitions. Through its humor the movie is able to relate to the dreamer that will never quit in every viewer. School of Rock is an inspiring movie about children and young adults not only pursuing their ambitions, but also inspiring and encouraging others to pursue theirs, even through opposition. <br/><br/>The perception of Jack Black's character Dewey Finn is an overweight, washed-up, broke musician. Despite the criticism he receives, he refuses to be anything other than a musician. Ebert says, ""Dewey Finn does not start as a disreputable character and then turn gooey. Jack Black remains true to his irascible character all the way through; he makes Dewey's personality not a plot gimmick, but a way of life"". Black is in almost the entire movie and wildly entertaining in each scene. Whether he is dancing like a maniac in front of his class or singing math songs, his mannerisms and facial responses are the highlight of the comedic genius in School of Rock. <br/><br/>After being kicked out of his rock and roll band, Dewey finds himself at a crossroads: be poor or give up music. Desperate to pay rent and still be a musician he steals a ""gig"" from Ned Schneebly, his friend and his landlord, as a substitute teacher at a private school. This uptight private school is the last place a person of Dewey's crude personality and short temper belongs. Ned is Dewey's ironic antagonist; he represents what would happen if Dewey gave up on his dreams; but unlike most antagonists, he is soft spoken and a pushover. Ned (Mike White) is a dullard who says few words in the movie, except when he tells Dewey that he misses music everyday. Dewey is dumbfounded when he realizes a substitute teacher is more than just a ""temp"" who sits behind the desk quietly; this shocks him into realizing that he does not belong in the classroom. Rainer points out, ""His fifth-grade class doesn't know what to make of him, especially when he declares an all-day recess and, hungry, swipes a sandwich from one of his students."" Dewey hatches the idea to teach the children about the only thing he can teach: rock and roll, or what he considers real music. Holden says, ""Dewey is flabbergasted when his students cite Christina Aguilera, the musical Annie and Liza Minnelli as their musical influences and claim total ignorance of Dewey's personal hard-rock pantheon."" In order to culture them, he teaches them more than just names and songs, he teaches them how to act like rock and roll stars. Motivation to be productive as a substitute comes to Dewey when he recognizes that the students are talented and they need someone to enhance their rock and roll abilities. Dewey is energized at the chalkboard when he draws an intricate diagram covering the vast topic of rock and roll. He turns the dry, mundane classroom into a creative space that is unique for each student's passions. Holden says, ""Those who are not musicians design lights, costumes and sound, or serve as roadies."" Dewey explores what each member is capable of and uses it to enhance the band as a whole. School of Rock connects with viewers by attesting to the fact that no goal can be accomplished without overcoming some obstacles. Lawrence, a keyboardist, tells Dewey that he ""is not cool enough to be in the band""(School of Rock). Dewey tells him, ""you could be the ugliest sad sack on the planet, but if you are in a rocking band you are the cat's pajamas""(School of Rock). Dewey has personally faced many critics for his appearance or how he is not cool enough but continues to perform regardless. Tomika (Myra Hassan), another student, asks Dewey if she can avoid preforming because she is sensitive about her weight. Ebert notes this scene, ""You have an issue with weight? "" Dewey asks. ""You know who else has a weight issue? Me! But I get up there on the stage and start to sing, and people worship me."" This touches on the fact that most viewers have felt inadequate in the pursuit of his dreams; but in the achievement of his or her dreams he or she becomes adequate and even prodigious. The most worthwhile lesson Dewey teaches the class is about ""sticking it to the man"" (School of Rock). Dewey has all his students get heated and tell him off. Lawrence, generally quiet, tells him ""he is a fat loser and has body odor""(School of Rock). The students have all gained a backbone, and some, since the beginning of the movie when they were conformists to their systematic school. Whether the school is enforcing the strict dress code or the student's parent is yelling at them for listening to rock and roll, the students have learned to think for themselves and do what they believe in. The students are diverse; there is a grade grubber, a stereotypically cool kid, an insecure girl, and every other type of child. The children connect with Black convincingly throughout the entirety of the movie, whether they are supposed to believe Black to be their new substitute or their fellow band member. As a band, Black and the students are able to ""stick it to the man"" and pursue their ambitions despite the negativity they receive.<br/><br/>School of Rock ends with a grand finale at the Battle of the Bands with a conglomeration of the parents, teachers, the former band, and the new band, School of Rock. Despite the fact that the entire movie is about performing at the Battle of the Bands, it becomes less and less important as the movie progresses. School of Rock becomes more about how finding a passion that gives you joy and pursuing is greater than focusing on being the absolute best."

This casting decision to hire Jack to play Dewey, an unappreciated musician with a deep-seated desire to perform, elevates this film into a joyous occasion in which we can all share.<br/><br/>The young actors are worthy of mention. Fortunately, the film's an almost perfect vehicle for their talents. I'll also give credit where its due to Joan Cusack.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","10","12","15 November 2008"," Jack Black's School Of Rock And Roll
","Director Richard Linklater and writer/actor Mike White come up with a hilarious rock and roll comedy casting Jack Black in the lead. 'School of Rock' does in a way fall on the same lines of 'Sister Act' and at the same time it, funnily enough, mocks all those teacher-student bonding movies about the meaning of life etc. As a teacher, Black's Ned aka Dewey breaks all school rules. Screw maths. Screw History. Screw all academics. He pretty much gets his initially timid students to throw away academics and eventually to solely focus on one thing only, and that is rock and roll. Although the thought might pop up 'come on, rock and roll is good but academic studies are important too', Dewey doesn't care and, as the film proceeds, neither does the viewer. 'School of Rock' is a Jack Black film. The actor uses his fantastic flair for comedy to the max. For me he is one of the funniest actors. But, 'School of Rock' is very much a collaborative effort as the kids are very good too and their interaction with Jack Black are among the highlights of the film. Joan Cusack holds her own as the uptight principle who does have a wild rocker in her and Mike White is likable too. Sarah Silverman is annoying but, thankfully, she's only there in a few scenes. The cast and crew clearly, as is evident in the special features, had a lot of fun in the making. The soundtrack is a must-have. 'School of Rock' does follow the path of 'safe' Hollywood films as the storyline isn't exactly novel but the director and writer infuse excellent materials of humour making the experience great fun with loads of laugh out loud moments. Moreover, watching the DVD is a bonus as it has some awesome special features that only contributes to the laugh out loud quality of the film."
"Buddy-51","7","49","74","20 December 2004"," Black attack
","After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in ""The School of Rock,"" a sporadically funny comedy that is part ""Sister Act"" and part genial spoof of all those movies about a ""super teacher"" who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.<br/><br/>Black plays Dewey Finn, an aging rock'n'roller who is still awaiting that moment when he will ""make it big"" in the music world. He lives with Ned Schneebly, his longtime rocker buddy, who has traded in his dreams of musical glory for a nagging girlfriend and a job as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money to pay the rent, Dewey pretends to be Schneebly and takes a job as a sub at a snooty, tradition-bound prep school, where the last thing the administration and the parents would want is a Jimmy Hendricks knockoff teaching their kids. And since Dewey really only knows one thing, this uncredentialed professorial imposter decides to make rock'n'roll the sole focus of his curriculum, turning these inward, shy, nerdish kids into a viable rock band - all under the radar screen of the ever-watchful administrators and parents of course.<br/><br/>Although the storyline wends its way along a predictable path, writer Mike White and director Richard Linklater find a great deal of warmth and humor in the material. Dewey's utter obsession with rock music and rock history is reflected in the fact that he leads the band members in a prayer to the ""god of rock"" before a concert, and screams in frustration - ""What have they been teaching you kids at this school?"" - when he finds out his pupils have never been educated in the basics of Hendricks, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Dewey is so preposterously well-meaning and good-natured that the audience can't help but root for him and his students as they embark on their mad quest to appear at a local battle of the bands competition, unbeknownst to the powers-that-be at the school.<br/><br/>The children playing the students are all winning and charming, and Joan Cusack cuts a sympathetic figure as the uptight school principal who harbors a little bit of Stevie Nicks under her prim and proper exterior. But it is Black who makes this film his own, turning what might have been a buffoonish caricature into a fully-rounded human being. Black is not afraid to cut loose and take over the screen when necessary, hitting heights of unbridled mania to rival the master, Jim Carrey. Yet, he also realizes that he is part of an ensemble effort here and understands the importance of integrating himself into the material and not always dominating it. As a result, even when certain elements of the film fall flat, as they frequently do, Black is always there to prop the movie back up.<br/><br/>""The School of Rock"" is an entertaining little comedy, but unlike a real satire which would skewer the conventions of the genre it is attacking, this film loses its nerve and winds up endorsing those conventions. Dewey, for all his talk about defying ""The Man,"" is really a rebel in name only, and the film reflects the kind of feel-good populism that no true hard line iconoclast would be caught dead supporting. I guess it's too much to expect a mainstream Hollywood comedy to launch a truly savage assault on mainstream values (in the way rock, at its best, often does). Still, it might be nice to come across the unexpected sometime (after all, movies like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""MASH"" were able to do it).<br/><br/>Until then, we'll settle for what we can get. And Jack Black is good enough for now."

","School of Rock, well, it rocked! I had to say that I had my doubts, I mean, I love Jack Black, but this seemed like most of his movies where he just plays the typical junkie and probably has either the same or lame humor. Don't get me wrong, I love Jack, just I was starting to get worried about him being type cast. But School of Rock proved not only to be great, but an incredibly touching movie with some great humor.<br/><br/>Jack plays Dewey Finn, a guitar player who has just got kicked out of his band. He also owes his roommate, a substitute teacher, a lot of money for the rent. So, when Dewey answers the phone that was meant for his roommate and takes a job, posing as his roommate, as the new substitute teacher at a high class prep school. Since he doesn't really care and just wants the money, he just sits back and relaxes. He wants to get back at his band still by competing in Battle of Bands, so he takes these kids and turns them into his rock band, better, into the School of Rock.<br/><br/>This has endless humor and just over all a terrific story that is so touching and I think anyone can appreciate. Even though the ending is just a smidge unrealistic, it's what everyone wanted, and I think we can say that it rocked! <br/><br/>10/10"

","Can a movie with Jack Black, an insanely excellent comedian, combined with a bunch of insanely talented kids and the insane rock music be anything else than insanely fantastic? Nope. Jack Black really gives it all whenever he's in a movie and he's also a musician, actually. It's pretty impossible not to roll on the floor laughing when he gets his crazy attacks and rock 'n roll visions. The kids in the movie aren't older than 11 or so, but they're already better musicians than what most adults are these days. The story actually surprised me in a good way too, still at the very last moments i thought it was going to end in a cheesy way, but it didn't. It's entertaining and funny from the very beginning to the very end, i can tell."
"PauldeRev","10","9","14","3 February 2005"," If you don't love this movie... You might not have a soul.
","This movie as a bunch of little kids in it... And they play rock 'n' roll. Can anyone argue against that? Anyone who does looks like Ebeneezer Scrooge! ""School of Rock,"" quite simply, combines the most joyous parts of rock 'n' roll music, a little bit of satire from Spinal Tap (perhaps), and a genuinely touching rock story about following your dreams -- from Almost Famous.<br/><br/>The three films I just named are at a ridiculous, stupid three-way tie for my favorite non-foreign language, non-documentary, major studio movie of all time. It's just that simple. You have Richard Linklater, unarguably the most versatile director living today, and Mike White, who is proving himself to be an insufferably clever screenwriter. Maybe not brilliant, but he's got some solid screenplays under his belt, and he works really well with Jack Black.<br/><br/>Sure, if I put a comment like this on ""Mulholland Drive"" (like many idiots have) or some other silly (yet admittedly enjoyable) art-house movie, I might seem way more sophisticated; and if I put a comment like on ""Control Room"" (which I really like as a journalistic documentation) I'd seem more intelligent. I'm also pretty sure that if I qualified foreign language movies and put Wong Kar Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" or Jean-Jacques Beineix's ""Betty Blue"" on my list, I'd look way, way cooler. But who cares? There is so much joy to be had in this movie, it's impossible not to smile while watching it. In fact, I was so filled with joy when I first saw it, I honestly cried. That's how much I love this movie."
"powermandan","10","4","5","9 February 2015"," My Favourite Rock Movie.
","I like to consider myself a rock 'n' roller and metalhead. I love all rock music from Chuck Berry and Little Richard to Alter Bridge and Weezer. (Actually, not really all rock music these days, I'm very picky.) I love all metal from Black Sabbath and Motorhead to Trivium and All That Remains. Several movies look into the subject of rock and roll, but for some reason, I find this to be the best one. Not because they explore the subject of heavy metal along with rock and punk. I guess because it was the first rock movie I'd ever seen and it had a huge impact on me. Well, one reason.<br/><br/>In his breakout role, Jack Black plays a talented and hyper musician named Dewey Finn who aspires to be a famous rockstar. Desperate for money he owes to his more conservative roommate (White) and fired from his group due to his out of control behaviour, he lies about being his roommate who is a substitute teacher and goes to make big bucks at a prep school. When he sees how talented the kids are, he decides to make a band with them and gets them entered in the ""Battle of the Bands"" contest to win some money and beat his old band.<br/><br/>Everybody knows that Jack Black is funny and a good actor, but School of Rock shows his highly impressive talent in music and just how good of an actor he can be. Black really does know all the music knowledge he displays in the film and it really is him playing all those instruments and singing. I got some of my musical knowledge from watching this. I never knew how amazing of a singer Black is. I honestly think he could sing opera. One of the best voices I have ever heard. In his previous band, ""No Vacancy,"" Broadway star, Adam Pascal, plays the lead singer. We get to hear some of his juicy chops too. Pascal is classically trained and was the original Roger in Rent, but I think Black is just a natural. It is tough to say who is better. It is also tough to say who is better between Black and the kids. All the kids are great musicians and great actors.<br/><br/>Gene Shallit panned this movie, because of Jack Black. He is worse in other films like Year One. Although not his most serious, it does justify that Black can act.<br/><br/>Another quality I liked about this is that is about giving the chance to open up and be themselves. In order to be a rockstar, you to have to be crazy and let loose. He subs at a super strict prep school, so the kids are more than just mechanical. He brings them out of their shells which leads to a student writing their title song. But it's not just the kids he influences: Joan Cusack plays the uptight principal who is overly stressed at her work. He even has a positive influence on her. This element is really what sets this apart from the others.<br/><br/>4/4"

Thankfully, Mike White wrote such a charming though admittedly predictable story, and Richard Linklater steered the this ship safely to land; of a musician way past his time trying to make it big and somehow found inspiration in a classroom full of children of a stuffy school.<br/><br/>Jack Black not only nailed his part, he owned it and killed it. Black is charismatic, enthusiastic, energetic and infectious. He is just fun to watch. Everybody else played their part well, even Joan Cusack who I think is underused.

"lee_eisenberg","10","2","2","27 November 2016"," Stick it to the man!
","Every once in a while there comes a piece of work focusing on disillusionment. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" looks at the conversion of Christmas from a religious festivity to a cynical excuse for frenzied commercialism. Michelangelo Antonioni's trilogy consisting of ""L'avventura"", ""La notte"" and ""L'eclisse"" focuses on the alienation resulting from modernity. And now, Richard Linklater's ""School of Rock"", which looks at anger arising from the co-opting of popular culture. Jack Black plays a raucous, unambitious musician who poses as his friend (a substitute teacher) to take a position at a prestigious elementary school. He proceeds to teach the students about rock's rebellious origins, and how it got turned into a dumbed-down product. Soon, he gets the class to form a band.<br/><br/>In addition to how Black's character gets the students to stick it to the man (his words), the movie also addresses the obsession that many parents have with seeing their children be the best at everything. Joan Cusack's strict disciplinarian is the embodiment of this attitude. Basically, the movie is an excuse to have fun, and it succeeds in every way. It was also interesting to see Sarah Silverman in an early role (I didn't know about her until a few years later, although it turns out that she had appeared in some movies by this point). True, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's not supposed to be. If you laugh while watching the movie, then it's done its job."

Belushi always gave 110% of himself in everything he did. Black is from the same mold.

Jack Black is a bit of a scary guy, but his character in this film (Dewey) is so loveable, you feel like you know him and his troubles so well.

","I wasn't far into this flick when I began thinking that we've all been down this road before: a prestigious private school, a rebellious instructor with unorthodox teaching methods, disapproving school leadership. Yea, this is the ""Dead Poets Society"" wearing a clown's clothing. Just change a few variables: switch drama with juvenile comedy, switch high school with grade school, Robin Williams with Jack Black, poetry with Rock n' Roll, and ""carpe diem"" with ""stick it to the man"" and you get School of Rock. And somehow this formula works to create an enjoyable giggle film. Just don't expect knee slapping humor though: I can count on my left thumb the number of times I laughed out loud watching this.<br/><br/>Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, a misunderstood artist who is so misunderstood, the members of his own rock band pull a Pete-Best move on him by voting him out. This leaves Dewey without a band to compete in an upcoming battle of the bands contest, a potential source of revenue that Dewey could have used to appease his roommate's girlfriend by paying his share of the rent for once. With no band and no job, Dewey sleazes his way into a substitute teaching assignment at Horace Green Prep, the state's best elementary school. The gig was intended for Ned Schneebly, Dewey's substitute-teaching roomie, but fortunately for Dewey, a simple ID check by the school's administrators wasn't on their to-do list. Dewey even asks to get paid in cash or third-party check, but that doesn't raise suspicions. Nor does the fact that he didn't know how to spell Schneebly. ""Just call me Mr. S"" he says.<br/><br/>Now, you didn't have to watch the trailers or even know the film's title to figure out where this film was heading when, after Dewey makes a disparaging remark about teaching, his roommate tells him that he wouldn't last a single day in a class full of kids. As any movie fan worth the salt on their popcorn knows, such challenges rarely go unanswered, even if they require a metaphysical soul switching procedure (as in either version of Freaky Friday).<br/><br/>Dewey's teaching career starts off with complete ambivalence on his part, but his interest in the kids perks up when he discovers that they can play music. What luck. He was in need of a set of musicians to form a new band. He runs out to his decrepit van parked along side late model Volvos, collects a set of instruments, and introduces his class to their new, secret project: rock band. In addition to musicians, there are groupies, roadies, a security crew and even a band stylist with a thing for Liza Minelli. Don't bother wondering how a rock band can practice in a quiet prep school without being detected: it's not worth the amino acid computing power. Just let it go.<br/><br/>Horace Green is headed by Joan Cusack, who gives whole new meaning to being sent to the principal's office. A pair of eyeglasses might shield Clark Kent's secret identity, but they don't hide Cusack's sex appeal. (My grade school principal resembled Nikita Kruschev, but without all the charm.) And then there are the kids. Other than Angelo Massagli, who plays Bobby Baccalieri Jr. on ""The Sopranos,"" they are all virtually unknowns. The really amazing thing here is that the kids in the band were recruited as musicians first, not actors. They really do a superb job, and when I learned that they played their own instruments, I was doubly impressed. I actually enjoyed the song they perform at the battle of the bands contest, and a few times I booted up the DVD just to listen to the song.<br/><br/>Before watching ""School of Rock,"" I wondered if I could stand a movie staring Jack Black. He's great as the fat, somewhat annoying but lovable, wise-cracking sidekick, as he was in ""High Fidelity"" (that one with two Cusacks), but 90 minutes of him? I wasn't sure. To me, Jack Black is a cross between the late John Belushi and the current Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's a funny guy, and does a great job in this film, but there was still something missing with him as the star.<br/><br/>One head-scratching point about this film, is that it left me wondering who the target audience really is. There were about three or four lines in this film, including one about pedophilia, that should have been removed to allow the under 10 crowd to watch. It might be prudish of me, but I'm not sure my eight-year old daughter should be exposed to words such as slut. Anyway, I'll always give extra credit points to any DVD that doesn't start out by forcing the owner to watch a bunch of advertisements, unlike the DVDs from some Mickey Mouse company I know (I won't mention any names).<br/><br/>Do the kids win in the battle of the bands? Do rebellious teach and hot principal hook up? Do the parents find out what's going on? You'll all just have to learn this for yourselves. See you in the back row."

","School Of Rock 
The name of the movie I saw is ""School of Rock"". It was a funny and good movie. It had a different plot and an amazing cast.
It was a good movie for four reasons. The first reason is because it is a funny comedy movie. The funniest part was when Finn crowd surfed and the crowd didn't catch him. The second reason is that the writers wrote a good plot. The plot was about a man that was kicked out of a band and pretended to be a sub. It was funny because he didn't teach the children what they needed to learn.
The third reason is that the movie had a good cast. My favorite characters were Miranda Cosgrove and Joey Gaydos Jr. because they added a lot to the movie. 
The fourth reason is because the ending was good. I liked the ending because at the beginning he failed crowd surfing and in the end he was able to crowd surf.
Those are the reasons I like the movie."
"zkonedog","6","3","4","14 March 2017"," First & Foremost A Jack Black Vehicle, But Still Pretty Entertaining
","It is clear from fairly early on in ""School of Rock"" that its primary purpose is to showcase the manic acting talents of Jack Black over everything else. Oftentimes, that can lead to a rather shallow movie (as the plot and auxiliary characters aren't fleshed out as they should be), but in this case the film still ends up being rather entertaining because of the novelty and the music.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""School of Rock"" tells the story of Dewey Finn (Black), a middle-aged man who crashes (never paying the rent) at the home of enabling friend Ned (Mike White). You see, Dewey still harbors the rock-and-roll band fantasies of his youth despite the fact that his prospects do not look great. One day, however, Dewey intercepts a substitute teaching call for Ned and assumes his identity, showing up completely unprepared at a fancy prep academy for grade school-ers. The one thing Dewey does know how to do/teach? Rock.<br/><br/>Like I said, ""School of Rock"" is primarily a vehicle to showcase Black's manic style of performing, and it does that very well. Black never loses energy in a single scene, and his ""Legend of the Rent"" performance in front of his pupils (shot all in one take) is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on film! I feel like watching too much of Black would be exhausting, but contained in this single movie it is a rush of energy.<br/><br/>Two other aspects of the film really keep it entertaining: <br/><br/>-The basic concept (teaching children how to rock) has never really been done before, at least that I've on. It is entertaining to see the students go from stuck up preppies to confident rockers over the course of the film.<br/><br/>-The music, which is always upbeat and fun to listen to. During the times in the film where the plot drags or becomes a bit too corny, there's always that next musical number right around the corner to look forward to.<br/><br/>So, I can consider ""School of Rock"" very entertaining despite its obvious limitations (being a vehicle film, having a super-cheesy plot, etc.).

","For a movie that started off as clichéd as possible and just pure fantasy – this would NEVER happen – the move was one of those rare experiences that got progressively better and funnier. Sure, it kept its, ah-hem, theme, but it did improve and absolutely worth the whole experience to get to the finale. Not to mention, the kids did great in their roles. Butthat all said, overall, the number one best quality was Jack Black himself. His chemistry with the kids, his enthusiasm and belief in this, wasn't just charming and contagious, it was sorely welcomed in this kind of age-old comedy. My only regret: it took me this long to finally see it. In the great words of Kevin Carr: It totally ROCKED!"

","In a star making role Jack Black unleashes a very satisfying performance as a rock lover down on his luck. Him with his fellow supporting class makes me a country music lover start listening to rock 'n' roll. Jack is funny, witty, compassionate, and in some cases dramatic. Before I saw this I didn't think much of Jack Black but now I do. And don't worry you don't need to be a rock fan to watch this. Like I said I'm a country music kind of person, and I loved this film. Let's not forget the other cast members like Joan Cusack as a very funny and stressful principal, then there is future iCarly star Miranda Cosgrove in her very first film role. It is a film you have to see to not only believe, but rock 'n' roll all night long."

","Like Steven Soderbergh, Richard Linklater has proven capable of working within the studio system while remaining a presence in the avant garde and though `The School Of Rock' seems a bit too compromised (it is a Paramount picture, after all), it still serves as a contemporary family film featuring a fine, exciting performance by Jack Black. He stars as a heavy metal musician masquerading as a substitute teacher at a tony prep school who recruits his class of adolescents to form a rock band. Though it's ultimately satisfying, there seems to be quite a bit of movie left on the cutting room floor (most of the supporting characters played by such talented performers as Joan Cusack, Sarah Silverman and Mike White--who also wrote the screenplay--are reduced to caricatures) and the filmmakers play it safe by selecting heavy metal--easy parody material--as the music of choice. Though Linklater clearly likes this project, he doesn't invest a lot of emotion in it; it could have been much more significant than the knock-off it is. Black is often compared to John Belushi with his raucous, exaggerated mannerisms but he infuses his Neanderthal freneticism with a spontaneous articulation that highlights the versatility Belushi lacked and is vital to the picture's success. Together with `Shallow Hal', this proves Black can almost single-handedly carry a film and his future bodes well--a good thing for mass audiences."

","Based on Jack Black's brilliant characterization in ""High Fidelity"" I was very much looking forward to this movie. I was expecting Mr. Black to take a character something like that further. Instead, I found the movie and the characterization both a dumbing down and flattening out. The same predictable jokes and shticks are repeated ad nauseam inside the most well-worn movie formula: ""let's put on a show and save the teacher""/""let's put on a show and save the spontaneity/innocent joy/etc of the kids"" (of which qualities we see precious little). No surprise, inspiration, nor creativity in the dialog or plot.  It's rather sad to see Mr. Black pumping more and more energy into his performance hoping for funny or inspired and achieving only dead-end maniac.<br/><br/>Still, I look forward to Jack Black's next effort.

After a slight case of mistaken identity, he end up temping as a teacher for a bunch of fifth graders at some posh school. needless to say, he then goes on to teach the kids to play rock and ""stick it to the Man""...<br/><br/>First off, I really hated this film. The School of Rock may not be a lousy film as far as the technical aspects are concerned, it's just that the script and Jack Black are so incredibly awful that it hurts. The script brings nothing new to the screen, it's just the same old clichés you've already seen too many times before. You can predict exactly what's going to happen at any given moment. The characters are are bunch of one dimensional stereotypes without any connection with the real world. Sometimes a script like this will make you shrug your shoulders with indifference, but School of Rock seems so content with being unoriginal that it makes me sad.<br/><br/>Then there's Jack Black - playing... Jack Black, I guess. It's becoming painfully obvious that his talents are limited to screaming and jumping around. Here, he manages to surpass all his previous efforts by doing this ALL the time. I think Black is nearly every frame of this film, and he's constantly staring, glaring, shouting, twitching, and doing all other sorts of funny (read: nauseating) stuff. The character he plays is supposed to be a lovable rouge, who teaches the kids about real life, but all I could see was an obnoxious, egocentric, mooching bastard that cared about nothing except himself.<br/><br/>There is something wrong when the theme of a film is that you should fight against conformity by adopting another set of conformity - not to mention a film where our hero tells the kids who can't sing or play an instrument, that they can be groupies... way to go, Teach.

At the studio where his rock band is rehearsing for the big nation-wide ""Battle of the Bands"" competition Dewey is told that he's been voted off the band and replaced, in short he's been canned. With the whole world collapsing around him Dewey gets a phone call at home that changes his, and those who he later comes in contact with, world forever. <br/><br/>Wanting to talk to his room-mate Ned who's away Horace Green Elementary School Principle Rosalie Mullins, Joan Cusack,tells Dewy that one of the teacher at the school just got hurt and that Ned was highly recommended to teach in this very prestigious prep elementary school. <br/><br/>Dewey pretending to be Ned says he'll be over to teach as soon as possible feeling that he'll make the money he needs for the rent working there and no one will know the difference if he's a teacher or not. Dewey as well as the students that he was to teach at first didn't know it but that he as well as they were in for the surprise of their lives. <br/><br/>Rip roaring movie much like the old Judy Garland Mickey Rooney musicals of the 1940's about a group of kids who never really had any good and constructive fun in their lives due to their strict upbringing by their stuffed up parents and teachers letting their hair down and their singing voices and musical instruments up. In the end the students making it to the ""battle of the Band"" competition contest and at the same time feeling a lot better about themselves and those around them by doing that; all because of that nobody who was really somebody, but at the time didn't know it, Dewey Finn. <br/><br/>Jack Black gives a solid as well as touching performance as Dewey Finn the washed up musician who through teaching music gave him a new lease on life as well as the young students that he was teaching. What worked so well in the movie was that the music that the students were playing was a composition of all their efforts put together to make it into a beautiful harmony. Where everyone pitches in together like a well synchronized symphony orchestra to make it all work. Also very moving in the movie ""School of Rock"" was the Horace Green Elementary School's Principle Rosalie Mullins played by Joan Cusack. Tight and stuck up and with no sense of humor we see her after having a mug of beer with Dewey at a local bar open up and tell him the pressures that she's under from the school staff and the students parents. As it just burns her to keep all that tension in and not allowing any of her real feelings to come out. <br/><br/>In the end the music that Dewey and his students practiced and later played at the ""Battle of the Bands"" competition not only let her come out of her shell but the students parents as well. Dewys music brought the best out of their kids by teaching them to be together as a team in success as well as in failure instead of trying to one up each other at the expense of those who didn't make it.<br/><br/>Like the saying by the great American Writer/Composer Aaron Copland says about music: That after silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music."

Realizing that the students actually have musical potential, the bum signs them up to a Battle of the Bands music competition, the winner of which will win 20,000 dollars.<br/><br/>For a film which encourages us to ""rebel like rockers"" and ""stick it to the man"", this film is ridiculously formulaic and about as ""anti-establishment"" as a box of Oreos. The obstacles are clichéd, the characters are paper thin and the climax, in which the students lose the battle but win both our hearts and the cheers of a crowd, is straight out of, not only ""Rocky"" and ""Sister Act"", but every high-school and teen movie on the planet.<br/><br/>And yet...the film has deservedly become a classic of sorts. Jack Black has never been better, his manic antics, Jack Nicholson eyebrows and musical talents put to good effect. The cast of kids is similarly infectious, Joan Cussak is cute, the soundtrack is catchy and director Richard Linklater, always reliable, manages to side-step most clichés in favour for subtle character moments and a healthy respect for both the powers of music and the educational ideals which are often lost in the pursuit of examination success.<br/><br/>Mostly, though, the film is rather unique in that it gets its laughs without resorting to vulgarity, gross out humour (except for a stereotypical gay kid) or desperate antics. Rarely does a film aim for the 9 to 40 age group and pull things off. Now raise your goblet of rock and lift a toast to those who rock!<br/><br/>8/10 – Some funny dialogue and antics by Jack Black, but mostly its the gentle direction of Richard Linklater which lifts this production.

So, (we can see the creative team around Rudin saying) let's just let him be funny doing his rock faces, in a `Mighty Ducks' deal.<br/><br/>
And why should I object to that? Because, friends, I am sick of films that preach one thing and themselves contradict that thing. Usually these are movies about being individual and not a copy, but everything about the movie is cookiecutter. In this case, we are talking about a culture of energy that is de-energized..<br/><br/>All movies are about other movies, never life. Music is similarly always about other music as well, but has the advantage that for us to connect it to life, we have to invent a cultural container. Rock isn't music at all, but the container we made up to contain some music made by folks we think fit the template. Rock music is what rock stars do, not the other way around.<br/><br/>The vehicle here is that large formula that has an unlikely bunch (often kids) excelling in a performance. Sometimes it is a sporting performance, otherwise - as here - it is a stage performance. Usually there is an unlikely mentor. Ho hum, push those buttons, connect the dots and we get ersatz rock and just the kind of movie which rock is against.<br/><br/>`Spinal Tap' was an ode to rock disguised as a satire, and funny as all getout.

","I'm glad to read the other 'hated it' reviews and see that other people were as annoyed by this film as I was! I only caught it on TV, so didn't actually waste any money on it. I was able to walk away from the TV too .. another great plus! The only reason I didn't change channels is because other people in the room wanted to watch it (they also concluded it was lame, by the way). So what is wrong with this movie? Well quite a lot, actually. As other people have mentioned, the script is almost a direct rip off of Sister Act II and other 'conservative people rock out in the end' type movies. This makes it tiresome and banal, as one keeps anticipating an unexpected digression from cliché that never actually happens.<br/><br/>But I guess the worst problem in this movie can be summed up in two words - Jack Black! What a hyped up, overly energetic, frustrated Led Zepplin wannabe this guy is! His persona seems to totally dominate everything in this movie, and his screaming attempts at rock singing are almost enough to turn me off some of my favourite music! Maybe I could have tolerated (only just!) some of this if the script was any good, but since it wasn't .. I couldn't! Consider this - school kids play loud rock music during class at conservative private school and nobody knocks on the classroom door to investigate!! Nobody hears the music flooding down the hallway or if they do, they don't take any notice!?? This isn't just a stretch of reality, this is now the realms of fantasy; bad, mindless fantasy! SOR is obviously not a serious movie, but it is still meant to be reality-based, however .. it isn't! There are a few good sentiments in the film, like when 'Dewey' (Black's character) tells his class that the purpose of rock n' roll is not girls or drugs but 'sticking it to the man' (even though he proceeds to train them up to perform like little monkeys). I like this anti-drug sentiment in a movie involving kids. However, none of this can detract from Black's OTT annoyance factor! <br/><br/>Bad movies can leave you with a variety of different feelings but this one, I have to say, left me feeling depressed more than anything else. I guess it was the overall sentiment - little kids giving up valuable education to play music they are too young to really understand yet. There's something exploitative (albiet, ridiculous) about small children being drawn into the 'cock rock' aims of some dude that's just been fired from a band and has lied his way into becoming their school teacher. Sure, introduce them to the music, but don't force them to perform it every day. Didn't the Jackson Five teach anyone anything?<br/><br/>1 out of 10"

","I think there's nothing that upsets me more than watching a classic movie that I don't like. Although I do feel just as bad after seeing a recent movie that almost everyone liked. That's how I feel about The School of Rock. One would say that this is director Richard Linklater's selling-out film (of course, this was before Before Sunset), which I guess is a good film in which to sell out, because everyone seems charmed by it. Now Linklater can get away with either art films or Hollywood films, and we can probably expect both more great films (like Sunset) and more crap (like School).<br/><br/>Dewey (Jack Black) is kicked out of a mediocre, going nowhere rock band and hasn't paid the rent for a while. His roommate, who is a substitute teacher, receives a call to come in, but Dewey pretends to be him to get some money. He doesn't know what to do until he realizes that if he enters the fourth grade class at a prep elementary school he's teaching into a battle of the bands, he could get some money. And if you find a way to believe that plot, then I'm the king of Australia.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie makes no sense. These rich, snotty, supposed-to-be-precocious kids (in addition to being annoying as hell) who only care about being taught don't go tell the principal that they're not being taught. They can play as well as a philharmonic (they're in fourth grade), and switching instruments is easy as pie. They want to learn in class but don't mind when their homework is to listen to a CD. And every single student-nay, every single character-is either a stereotype, underdeveloped, or obnoxious. There's the prissy, stuck up leader girl in the class, the smart yet geeky Asian, there's a homosexual student (with some of the stupidest dialogue ever written-clichéd and stereotypical), there's the by-the-books principal (Joan Cusack). Every kid to whom they give names is underdeveloped, with no meaning. And Jack Black's character is just a fat obnoxious person. There's no reason to feel for this character. He's lazy, he's untalented, he's selfish, and an annoying person overall. Why should we care about his stupid misadventures in an elementary school? And wouldn't the teachers get at least a little suspicious when not only the teacher doesn't have ID, but the curriculum that Dewey pretends to teach varies from the theory of relativity to the basics of Christopher Columbus? And since when are there hard rock battle of the bands concerts at about noon? You're probably thinking that that's just artistic license. I'd agree with you, and I'd ignore as much of it as possible if the movie was funny. But it wasn't.<br/><br/>Most of the jokes are lame and obvious. When asked what music they like, the kids say various teen pop artists, as would be expected by elementary schoolers. But it's stretched into this whole gag that never works. And School of Rock's supposed to make us laugh by not only seeing Black's Jim Carrey-esque facial expressions, but by the ""wackiness"" of him playing an electric guitar in class. Raising hell in a classroom. That's a new topic there. Later, as the whole class goes on a field trip to register for the battle of the bands (during school, without a chaperone, and no one wonders where they went), everyone fits into Dewey's van, along with all of the equipment (that completely filled his car before). Another obvious joke is when it's said that Cusack's character gets drunk while listening to a certain song, what do you think Dewey will do? Seriously, this character is supposed to be likable and all, but he just comes off as manipulative and completely phony. School's only saving grace is me smiling a few times, but that's it. It's pretty awful what movies will be made for a quick buck. I'd rather Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 do better than The School of Rock did, just to knock this movie down a peg.<br/><br/>My rating: 2/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for some rude humor and drug references."

He teaches them that academic studies are basically of no value, and instead that they should learn to be angry and insolent towards the world.<br/><br/>Now, this certainly will go over well with certain audiences, but it disturbs me.

He could be described as a character actor or less nicely, an actor with not much of a range.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, in this movie he is an obnoxious, selfish, immature guy who sings in a low-level band and exploits an old friend for free lodgings. When the girlfriend of said friend asks him to pay the rent, he resentfully set out to find a job. Said girlfriend portrayed as an unpleasant bitch, only because she makes a reasonable request...<br/><br/>Through a series of implausible events Jack (apologies, I mean Dewey) ends up teaching rock to a bunch of kids in a posh school. Not because he likes teaching but because he needs them to be his ""support band"" for the battle of the bands, since no legitimate rock band would have him.<br/><br/>It is quite creepy to hear a grown-up man telling pre-pubescent girls they could be groupies, not to mention the manipulation of kids for his own purpose. <br/><br/>At the end Jack (I mean Dewey) acknowledges that the band is more important than any single member, but throughout the movie we see him in every single scene playing the only ""cool"" character among a bunch of boring, nasty, square people of all ages.<br/><br/>Besides Black being totally predictable, the screenplay is even more so. Finally, for a comedy there are very few real funny moments. The only saving grace is the music, with a totally unexpected bit from Led Zeppelin exploding in a scene.<br/><br/>For die-hard Black's fans and people who think being a freeloader is a cool way to live. P.S. also probably the worst Linklater film."

","Not sure what everyone else saw or if they're merely shills for the film or perhaps friends & family of the cast and crew, but SOR sucked. At least as far as Jack Black's performance(that's a stretch) is concerned. Jack Black was stupid which is not unusual, unfortunatly it wasn't funny this time. He seems to play the same friggin' character in nearly all his movies. It now BORES me to watch him. Right up there with Tom Green, another over-rated bore.<br/><br/>This is the last time I waste my money on this particular boring clown."

","Ouch.  I'm hurting after this one.  Richard Linklater (who directed one of my all-time favorite films ""Dazed And Confused""), Mike White (who penned the very good ""The Good Girl""), and Jack Black (who writes some nifty songs for Tenacious D in addition to having a wonderfully comedic presence on screen) all added together ""SHOULD"" have equaled at least a half-way decent film or maybe even a home run.  Instead, it's a mess.  Linklater and White are capable of writing/directing films in which subtle characterization can deepen a film's story, but, instead, the story is bulldozed over by Jack Black's high-voltage acting.  <br/><br/>And yet, Jack Black is the best thing about this film.  If a gag or joke doesn't work, he just keeps speeding forward throwing out more and more gags and jokes.  At the speed he's going, you have to admire his ability to have so much energy and never burn out. (I think if this had been a one-man stage show, it would have been terrific.)  As it stands now, all logic and character development is thrown out of the window and what we're left with is clichés and a very predictable plot.    <br/><br/>Mr. Linklater, you once gave us a very believable high school filled with `real' students, teachers, and parents.  It's shame you couldn't do the same with `The School of Rock.'  (Then again, maybe your hands were tied.  Maybe you were forced to make the movie the way it was due to the influence of the `suits' at the studio because I KNOW you're capable of much, much better work.)<br/><br/>Score: 1.75 out of 5"

","This film is about a failed rock wannabe crashing in to become a substitute teacher in a prestigious school.<br/><br/>The film is basically only about Jack Black and the kids, so it is very important that they deliver. Indeed, Jack Black tries his best in playing the musical instruments, pull funny faces and learns a to about rock music to impress the viewers. There are many times that the film feels like a one man show. Fortunatelym the kids also does well in the film. They are very impressive and convincing in playing the instruments.<br/><br/>The plot is unreal but funny. Apart from being entertaining, it also touches on how people can achieve their potential when given the chance to and with proper encouragement. I am particularly impressed by the fact that the film lifts the self esteem of an obese African young girl by a string of encouraging remarks.<br/><br/>This film is brain off entertainment, forgettable but enjoyable."
"Hellrazr360","8","2","3","22 February 2006"," Jack Black's The Sub? Screw Skipping Class!
","With the so-called ""music"" that fuels people to buying CDs and downloading songs, the genre that seems to be slowly dying is rock. After the emergence of the rap, pop and emo genres the rock genre sees a slow but steady decline in popularity. But before the genre does die away there's one movie that will shine as rock's last stand, a movie that isn't afraid to speak the truth about economy and provide a good laugh. Ladies and gentlemen, I give the School of Rock! In School of Rock, Jack Black plays Dewy Finn; a die-hard and overzealous rocker stuck in the 70's and 80's music era. After being knocked out of his band by the other members he seeks out people to be a part of his new band. However, word of his ""excellence"" has spread already, and people aren't exactly hot about him trying to form another band. Along with no success to his new band attempt he's also stuck with having to pay a rent for the apartment he shares with his long-time friend Ned, who is practically bossed by his girlfriend. The problem here, Dewy has no money and no job. After failing to sell one of his guitars to get the rent money he gets a call saying that a private elementary school needs a substitute for a class, and Dewy takes it upon himself to take the job.<br/><br/>As the name of the movie might imply, Dewy eventually finds out the fifth grade students he's teaching actually have some musical talent, enough for his band. And behold, the fifth graders become Dewy's new ""band"", and the movie builds up from there. The one thing that School of Rock of course stands with is classic rock music, which the movie's soundtrack is composed of, all-time classic songs. Not only does the movie play songs from bands such as Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Jimi Hendrix but it also mentions them as bands that you have to know if you have any clue of what music is.<br/><br/>However, School of Rock stands against more than what it stands for. Jack Black works his magic amazingly to emphasize this with one of my all-time favorite quotes: ""Stick it to da man!"" The movie also talks about how rock n' roll was the way to give ""The Man"" hell and how it reached a downfall with one of my favorite jokes (but it's an honest one), the creation of MTV. School of Rock also mentions a few terms used during the era of rock n' roll such as groupies, but it doesn't emphasize these terms that much. This also seems odd in the favor of School of Rock's PG-13 rating, which seems more than misplaced after watching the movie.<br/><br/>As if a movie that stands for true rock music and against the crap that makes up the majority of today's music there's also plenty of laughs to be found. Pretty much every moment of laughter that School of Rock creates is brought up by Jack Black's outrageous personality. With so many classic quotes and jokes brought that show Black's true potential as a comedian, it's almost impossible not to at least chuckle at School of Rock. The fifth grade performers in School of Rock are also very likable characters that get the attention they deserve. The movie does seem to focus on mostly the same young actors/actresses but by the end of the movie the viewer has gotten acquainted with each ""band member"" of the movie.<br/><br/>If you like rock n' roll or just comedies in general I'd highly recommend School of Rock. In fact, I'd recommend this to most any movie viewer, unless you actually enjoy watching the music that this movie is easily against (rap, pop, emo) obviously. Yet, I'd have to say that anyone should enjoy this movie, even my grandmother liked this movie and went as far as to say that it ""rocked"", and she was able to tell almost everything that would happen. Now that, is what I call a true family film!"

","The School Of Rock is a fantastic, well acted & well performed movie. It was simply brilliant. <br/><br/>Jack Black was fantastic as the die hard rocker who refused to give up the love of his life (and to become a ROCK GOD!)<br/><br/>With a fantastic array of supporting cast, The School of Rock is Undoubtedly the best movie I have seen in the last few years. The kids were awesome!!!!<br/><br/>Zack, played by Joey Gaydos Jr, was incredible. Never have I seen such talent on a guitar for a kid of his age. The same can be said for Lawrence on the keyboard(played by Robert Tsai), and Freddy on the drums(played by Kevin Alexander Clark).<br/><br/>This movie had it all. It was funny, sad & most of all, inspirational. I was so inspired by this film that by the end of the movie I was depressed as to why I couldn't play an instrument. I have since begun the slow & exciting process of learning to play the guitar.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7 out of 10 for the acting but a full 10 out of 10 for the musical talent."

"quiqueperezsoler","9","1","1","8 April 2020"," It knows what it is: a self-aware tale of rebelling against the norms fueled by the static of Rock and Roll
","From the name of the band that brings about the most unconventionally awesome band name, members and style to the world of Rock. A long forgotten movement is revived in a movie that never takes itself too seriously. Consequences are thrown overboard to let Rock n' Roll conquer a story channelled through the kids that most need it: the snobby pressuring-parents type.<br/><br/>There are no genders, there's no bullying, there's no discrimination, the story itself is aware of how unlikely it is of being a real take of such a premise. It's not trying to portray the intricacies of pulling such a plot and that's why it is so uplifting and heartwarming. It plain just makes you wanna rock and roll, to wish you had such a teacher and such a class project. Damn the consequences and damn the repercussions, the most optimistic story propelled by the world of music I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The main role suits Jack Black perfectly up to the point of seeming as if it was tailored for him. Any genre of music could have been picked to rebel against the norms but to choose classic Rock is but the best choice as it lends for extravagant guitar, drums and voice solos that are just a delight and the perfect messenger making the audience wish the movie were even more musical than it actually is.<br/><br/>The people behind the movie have done such a great well-realised tale of uninspired private school kids being touched by music and they have done it so well that the story continues throughout the end credits. Best end credits of any movie ever. The movie is so fun, energetic and endearing that every kid from now to the end of time should watch and it's the best reminder of what Rock and Roll means and how it makes you feel, like an unstoppable force against anything life throws at you. This review is not objective, I did not care for narrative structure, cinematography or child performance, I simply watched the movie and Rock n' rolled hard!"

","I am such a big fan of Richard Linklater, yet I hadn't seen School of Rock until now, and I think it is another one, of which there are many, of his best movies. It's so much fun from start to finish, has awesome performances even though it has a cast largely consisting of kids, which is normally rarely a good thing, though here a cast like that totally delivered. The passion for making a fun and uplifting film is felt all the time and Linklater also manages to not overdo it. It's not too sugary and feels fully authentic. Jack Black is brilliant in the role and is a big reason why the film works so perfectly and why the kids were able to have great chemistry together and literally rock. Shout-out to Miranda Cosgrove who I was so happy to see in this. I belong to the generation that saw iCarly as a kid, so that was a hilarious surprise. She's so adorable, funny and just fantastic in her role.<br/><br/>I am sure I'll watch this movie many many more times. Richard Linklater, I say it all the time, I love that dude and can't wait to catch up on every single one of his movies."

","""School of Rock"" is a vehicle to display Jack Black's immense talent as a comedian and musician.<br/><br/>The Good. Where do I begin. This film is well-paced, well-acted (especially by some of the kid actors), well-written, with an incredibly enjoyable story led by our hero Dewey (Black). Truthfully, Jack Black steals the show. I understand it's his movie, but there is no one else who could've done this role and film and made it into such a well-loved comedy. Black shines in every moment he's on screen whether its Dewey the slacker, Dewey the fake teacher, Dewey the ACTUAL teacher, or Dewey the Rock God. This movie encapsulates everything rock music is about through a deep understanding via the main star and writers.<br/><br/>The Bad. I don't have much to say that's wrong with this film to be honest. Perhaps some of the kid actors don't inspire much awe, but truth is, most of them really do. Two child actors that especially stand out are Miranda Cosgrove as Summer, the over-achieving golden child, and Kevin Alexander Clark as Freddy (Fancy Pants) who actually gets some of the best lines and laughs in the movie despite his limited screen time.<br/><br/>The Fantastic. The Rock Music. A story about teaching a new generation about the musical history that came before them is a greatly appreciated film for people to see. As mentioned earlier, this film flows through Black's performance as any other actor would've been an act. Black gives a genuine love for rock music that is evidently clear. But ultimately, the most important scene of this movie is the climax where the School of Rock give their performance at the Battle of the Bands...can't say much more about it, you should see it if you haven't. It's as good as any live rock concert you've been to.<br/><br/>Great music. Great laughs. Great performances. And great rock appreciation.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>I really don't have much to say that's wrong with this movie. On a technical level it's pretty flawless. I will say its not as funny as some other comedies, and 90 percent of the laughs come from Jack Black, but I don't think nonstop laughs from beginning to end was its goal. And that's okay. It works. I just can't give it a 10 for those comedies that are truly special, but this is a perfectly fine movie I'd recommend to anyone. I like to rate movies based on how well they achieve what they're trying to achieve rather than what I want a film to be."

","Jack Black stars as a failed rock musician who in financial desperation, pretends to be his friend Mike White and takes a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious private elementary school. Having no qualification, he initially treats it as an opportunity to goof of, until he realizes that his students are fairly gifted musicians. He trains them to be a rock band so that he can enter a battle of the bands competition and get revenge on his former band mates who kicked him out. Do I even need to tell you that Black learns to care about these kids? There's really nothing original here, but Black is in his element here and makes the material work. He gets some pretty solid support from Joan Cusack as the school principal. It's hardly among Richard Linklater's best films, but his relaxed, stoner style is well suited for the material."

","Dewey Finn: Dude, I service society by rocking, OK? I'm out there on the front lines liberating people with my music! ""We don't need no education."" School of Rock has been another go to movie for me for the last 7 or 8 years. For me, this is an easy winner because I am a Jack Black fan and because I love the music their playing. Black is a musician that can hold his own and the kids in the movie are great at their respected instrument. The film is funny, well-written by Mike White, and directed with surprising style by Richard Linklater. Like I said, Black is in the lead and he gives probably the best comedic performance of his life as Dewey Finn. School of Rock follows the misadventures of Dewey. He's a loser who is trying to make it big in the music industry. His band plays small bars and he lives with a friend and his friends girlfriend, mooching of them for rent. Dewey's friend at the request of his girlfriend tells him if he doesn't come up with rent, they are going to kick him out. More bad news comes in the form of Dewey getting kicked out of his band. He tries to rebound with a new band, but finding people isn't easy. When he takes a substitute teaching job, posing as his friend teacher, he meets a group of kids that can rock, and tries to use them to win the Battle of the Bands. This is a different type of movie for Linklater. I guess if you examine his film career, this would tie in most closely with Bad News Bears; except that School of Rock is much, much better. It also rings with great music much like his comedic stoner masterpiece Dazed and Confused did. School of Rock is just plain fun. It's hard not to have a good time watching Jack Black totally embrace a role like this. This is the Jack Black character. He is at his best when he plays himself, and Dewey Finn is just less profane Jack Black from Tenacious D. So seeing him here is just as much fun as watching him in Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny. A great, family friendly, music comedy from a great director and a cast of good musicians. The songs are catchy, the jokes funny, and the story clever. Yeah, it follows a pretty basic formula for its success, but you can't sent the luring power of the pit stops White take with his writing. The lessons in class, the lunchroom conversations, and just letting Black perform."

","""School of Rock"" is one of those movies where the casting is key. It's got a good story, but if you don't have an endearing lead and a great group of kids for him to teach, there's really no movie. Hack Black's perpetual motion (er, spasticity?) does a lot to make this movie work, and he's got a genuine rapport with these kids (musically talented in their own right). The story doesn't really hold any surprises; the jig's coming up and you can see it from afar), but the stand-up message is worth it. And it's overall some good fun.

","Jack Black had one of the best roles of his somewhat questionable career in 2003's School of Rock an entertaining comedy that provides pretty consistent laughs in addition to a moment of genuine warmth here and there.<br/><br/>Black plays Dewey Finn, a homeless and penniless wanna be rock star who is crashing at his best friend's apartment, who one day takes a phone call, meant for his friend, accepting a position as a substitute teacher at a local grade school. Bored with teaching history, Dewey takes it upon himself to form a rock band out of the students in the classroom, on the DL, without the school's principal (Joan Cusack) finding out.<br/><br/>Black found a role that fits him like a glove here. He is completely and naturally hilarious as Finn not only teaches the kids rock music but tries to educate them about the history of rock music as well. It's fun as we get to watch Finn bring some students out of their shell musically and put other students' egos in check as well as getting the tightly wound principal to lighten up as well.<br/><br/>Richard Linklater's energetic direction, along with the performances of Black and Cusack that are the primary selling points here, not to mention Black's effortless charisma with the children that makes this film definitely worth checking out."

You simply cannot see any actor-musician in the role of Dewey Finn besides Black. Jared Leto? No way.<br/><br/>Not that this is Black's best performance. That would probably have to be ""Bernie"". But this is the only film where Black really gets to be Black and it propels the story, makes him out to be a hero. Sure, it may not be completely realistic. But it really is not supposed to be.

","7 years on and this still ranks as Black's best. Thankfully he has a number of restraints on him as he isn't the only driving force here. White is a good comedic writer, Linklater is a talented director that has handled many different kinds of films, and the kids themselves often impress more than Black. The humor isn't fast and furious, but the jokes come regularly enough to remind you it's a comedy. The songs are also, thankfully, rather enjoyable and catchy, something that can sink a film about music. It's also nice to see a film of perfect length, never boring, never rushed, it flows naturally. Shool of Rock is a feelgood film, without schmaltz or unnecessary subplots such as a love interest for the protagonist."

Lights go off in his head and bingo! -- the new class project is to form a rock band. He decides to teach them everything he knows about rock with lectures on its history, the evils of ""The Man,"" and the essentials of playing rock songs.<br/><br/>Dewey's spirits are lifted when he realizes that there are some talented musicians in the class including Zack (Joey Gaydos, Jr.), the lead guitarist; Katie (Rebecca Brown) on bass; and Lawrence (Robert Tsai) on keyboards. Freddy (Kevin Clark), the class rebel, turns out to be an eager learner on drums, and Tomika (Maryam Hassan) surprises him with her unusual singing talent. The smartest girl in the class, Summer (Miranda Cosgrove), gets her chance to excel as band manager while others serve as back-up singers, special effects wizard, head of security, and the official selectors of the band's name.<br/><br/>The humor quotient of the film is heightened by the funny performance of Joan Cusack as the uptight and unlocked principal of Horace Green Elementary School. When Dewey discovers that she is a secret fan of Fleetwood Mac, they are able to connect as friends. The rock fan gets his wish when he has the class entered in the local Battle of the Bands. By the end of this rollicking film, you'll happily be chanting, ""For those about to rock, we salute you!"""
"jaddison383","9","1","1","2 June 2009"," The Creation of Musical Fusion...
","Every now and then a mainstream entertaining film comes along that breaks the boundaries of what we expect and turns itself in as a truly great film. School of Rock is one of those movies. Sharp direction from Richard Linklater, a talented cast, and a fabulous script from Mike White meld together to create a heartfelt, gut-bustingly hilarious tribute to rock 'n roll that will make a believer out of anyone.<br/><br/>Not enough praise can be given to Jack Black in what is truly the greatest performance of his career. As Dewey Finn, a down-on-his-luck guitar player/singer who pretends to be a substitute teacher in place of his friend and forms a band out of his class of ten-year-olds, Black creates a laugh-out-loud hilarious hero for the ages. Never on screen have I witnessed a more passionate, genuine performance, and the film is truly what it is because of him. He speaks about rock 'n roll as something 'pure' and 'awesome', and every word is filled with love and admiration. Extolling the virtues of rock 'n roll to his classroom, he talks about 'creating musical fusion' and how 'one great rock show can change the world.' What makes the whole thing work is that Black truly believes every word he's saying. And so do the kids.<br/><br/>The movie never stops being funny and yet still manages to maturely show the deeper changes Black affects in the students lives, from helping an unpopular boy gain confidence to encouraging an overweight girl with her self-consciousness issues. And it's not just about the kids either; it's a personal journey of self-discovery for the main character as well. In the same way the the kids help him to find meaning in himself, he helps them come alive from their drab and plain school days. The film even goes so far as to subtly suggest the flaws of the educational system and the lack of values put into special talents.<br/><br/>But without ever delving that deep, School of Rock is still a masterpiece of comedy that is impossible not to enjoy. And when that final rock show scene is reached, it's one of the most emotional, rocking moments in history. It IS musical fusion. It IS something pure, and cool, and awesome. And it is a genuine, verifiable triumph that you get the feeling might just change the world. 9/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","To be honest, I waited two years since it's first release to watch this. I honestly had no interest in it, Jack Black who I consider just a ""good"" actor, and then it's partly classified under the ""music"" genre, to be honest I couldn't care to watch it, but I finally bought it on DVD and god it's fantastic! There are plenty of wonderful characters (a majority of them making their Hollywood or film debuts), followed by catchy, stuck in your head music and some memorable quotes. Surely a movie not to forget. It's just not a comedy, whereas there is just over-exaggerated characters and fart or sexual humor, this is more. Surely Jack Black's best work in the movie industry, and you can see his passion for rock and music solidly in this movie. Surely one to watch for all ages. Young or old. Oh yea, especially for rock fans, too."

With a little teaching from the right teacher and these kids could make it big. Step up MR.S! he teaches the secrets of rock, he finds his bass, lead, drums, keyboard and backup.

","So the story is tired, the characters predictable, and some of the dialogue totally lame -- who cares when Jack Black is exploding off the screen in every scene??<br/><br/>I've never cared for Black as an actor (and I don't know why, but he's struck me as a bit of a jerk off-screen) but in this movie he gives all performers a model for what it means to be ""committed to the role."" He's so committed, so over-the-top, so genuine, that I suspect this is really Jack Black, not a character.<br/><br/>As others have noted, the sheer exuberance of Black coupled with music that, for those of us in a certain age group, remains utterly, primally FUN is a combination that's tough to beat. <br/><br/>Too thin to be watched often, but unexpectedly delightful all the same."

","When I first watched School of Rock, I was completely enthralled. The story was imaginative and original, the music was a joy to hear and the acting was perfection. Jack Black was perfectly cast as Dewey Finn, an aspiring rock star who steals his flatmates substitute teaching job at a private school, Horace Green, in order to pay the rent. There he meets head teacher, Rosalie Mullins(Joan Cusack) and a whole herd of rich kids, who are more into classical than rock. He embarks on a mission to win ""Battle of the bands"" with the school kids as his band, in order to scorn his former band mates. Dewey manages to charm Miss Mullins into a downtown bar and get her drunk, get the kids rocking, only to be discovered as a fraud. The kids, who have a new found passion for life, decide to take matters into their own hands, and force Dewey to play at ""Battle of the bands"". There, the formerly outraged parents gain respect for rock. School of Rock is a hilarious film. Jack Black lights up the screen, and Joan Cusack is as wonderful as ever as an uptight head teacher with a secret passion for rock. The supporting cast and child actors are great, too, so watch School of Rock and be amazed!"
"saarvardi","10","1","1","9 July 2007"," School of Rock presents: Jack Black in all his comedic and musical glory
","I've always been a sucker for musical films  biographical (Ray, Walk the Line) or straight-out musicals (Moulin Rouge!, Chicago). Alongside that, I'm also a long time fan of the ""inspirational teacher"" sub-genre, ever since I tumbled upon Dead Poet's Society way back when I was 13 years old. Understandable, when a movie that mixed both these genres came along, I was more than pleased.<br/><br/>School of Rock presents you Jack Black in all his comedic and musical glory. Black plays Dewey Finn, a grown-up who never really gave up on his dreams of making it big in the world of music. However, reality hits on his face when his band kicks him out and his friend's bossy girlfriend doesn't want him lurching around their apartment anymore. Now, Finn has to find a real job to support himself, and figure out a way to participate in a lucrative rock contest without his band. Shortly after, he begins posing as an Elementary School substitute teacher, where he spends his lessons teaching his very gifted pupils how to play rock and roll, appreciate the classic rock monsters, and basically ""stick it to the man"". While this is far from the study material the kids were supposed to be learning, Finn manages to sweep them off their feet (as well as their principle, portrayed by Joan Cusack), and uncover their hidden talent for singing, playing music and writing lyrics while at it. Alas, a lie can only get so far, and with the rock contest approaching, Finn's cover starts to wear off, as it is obvious he is using them to enter the competition.<br/><br/>I won't write down what happens next since I don't want to spoil the film. I will, however, strongly recommend watching School of Rock for its uplifting spirit; inspiring plot and soundtrack (one of the best, and most original, of the past decade); for its versatile director Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Fast Food Nation) and his remarkable achievement; for Jack Black's powerful and wonderful performance (there's a reason he was nominated for a Golden Globe for this one) and especially  for the young actors and actresses, who steal the show in every seen. Watch out for the adorable kid that plays Summer Hathaway, and for the exploding talent of Maryam Hassan, who portrays Tomika. Now there's a future singer if I've ever seen one!"
"KUAlum26","10","1","1","27 May 2007"," In a word: Unique
","Director Richard Linklater is no stranger to making odd,interesting and even delightful films. Slacker,Dazed and Confused,Before Sunrise are films that come to my mind in regards to films he's helmed that fit that category. This one ranks right up there,if not top them all.<br/><br/>A boozy,unemployed,disbanded rock musician Dewey Finn(Jack Black,born to take command of a movie like this!)assumes his put-upon roomy Ned's identity and takes a job as a substitute teacher at a prep school and decides,in order to cover up his lack of credentials,to teach what he knows,and what he knows is rock 'n roll. Little by little,he gets the kids,who are all to a one bright and to varying degrees bored or under-inspired,to get in on a class project to form a rock band and take part in a ""Battle of the BAnds"" contest,to which Dewey desperately wants to break through.<br/><br/>A whole cast of kids(for whom I will not name each,since there are so many and I am,well...lazy)play their roles not cute or to mug for the camera,playing themselves honestly and,to my thinking,maybe the best element of this already finely crafted show. And that's to take nothing away from the adults here,particularly Black,Mike White(as Dewey's put-upon roomy and one-time band-mate Ned),SArah Silverman(as Ned's shrewish girlfriend)and Joan Cusack(priceless as the repressed fuddy-dudy who runs the school). There aren't,I'd estimate,that many films out there like this one:namely,a smart movie that deals in current themes and consists of kids. My suggestion:check this film out and find out for yourself."
"ElmStreetsLastBrat","8","1","1","9 April 2007"," One of Jack Black's Funniest Films
","2003's The School of Rock is a really good film. I love Jack Black anyway and this was one of his funniest films. His humor is top notch and to me, not only does he have a great sense of humor and great comedic abilities, he's just a funny guy to look at! I don't mean that in a negative way either. I think he knows he's funny looking and that he uses that mug to make people laugh too. He has great facial expressions. I think that's what makes him one of the best comedic actors of this generation. He plays Dewey Finn, a slacker who decides to substitute a classroom of children after the real substitute is unable to attend. But Dewey has no idea how to teach a classroom of children or where to even begin. But he's doing it because he desperately needs the money. So, having no idea how or what to teach the children today, Dewey decides to break out his guitar and talk to the children about music and playing in a rock band. He teaches them about AC/DC and the great bands of the 70s and 80s and he teaches them about music notes and how to play an instrument. And the children become very interested. Then Dewey realizes that the children have no self confidence and that they have amazing talents that they refuse to show and use for fear of what other people will think. So he decides to bring the children out of their shells and open up by forming a rock band. So he teaches the children how to become great singers and musicians. And that enables the children to realize that school can be fun and that they should always use their talents even if they say to themselves that they have no talent. Everyone has some kind of talent! I thought this was a great plot. And even though it does sound a little silly, Jack Black makes it work. It is a joy to see him teach and perform with the children. It was a joy to see him work with the children on how to hold and play their instruments and how to use their voices. He made the children smile and laugh and the children grew to like him. I loved the finale when he and the children and their band, ""The School of Rock"", were performing their big concert. The children were so cute when they were singing and it is so much fun to see Jack Black sing and perform in concert. He exudes energy and charisma and he makes playing the guitar funny! And he seemed to enjoy working with kids too. Joan Cusack was great as the uptight teacher Mrs. Mullins. She had no sense of humor and I loved how Jack Black made her come out of her shell too. Joan is always a joy to watch in the films because she is a great actress. And all of the child actors were great too. They were so cute and funny and you just loved all of them. None of them were disappointing.<br/><br/>The School of Rock is a funny and entertaining film and any fan of Jack Black should see it. I loved every minute of it and even if you don't like Jack Black I think you should see it if you love comedies. You won't be disappointed. Thank you for reading my review!"

He has a dream class and throws out the curriculum to teach them all about rock music including performing it.<br/><br/>Forget the fact that it takes almost an hour into the film for the principal to show up to observe him. It's unrealistic and unorthodox, however, the picture works due to the performances of Jack Black and the kids that he molds. Joan Cusack has the right temperament of a principal who is ready to break out of her shell.<br/><br/>Even goody-goody kids have hangups as the picture shows.

Kudoes to everyone involved in the making of this one.<br/><br/>A lot of people I know who did not like it said it's because it's to feel good and by the numbers-that it's not unpredictable enough. I can see that applying to certain types of movies but not to something like this. This is a movie about, above all else, rock-n-roll. The first criteria should not be :does it have twists and turns, is it unpredictable enough etc. What the main criteria, in my opinion, should be is: does the movie rock??!! Does it make you feel good as great rock-n-roll does? Does it contain believable characters, characters that one can relate to? Does it have great rock-n-roll moments that inspire one to remember what it is they love about rock-n-roll in the first place? The answers to these questions are:yes, yes, yes and YES!<br/><br/>This isn't the best rock movie ever done but it is maybe one of the most lovable. I really didn't care how predictable the plot was if I could visualize it happening and relate to it. School of Rock somehow captures the essence of what it is to just love your craft (your craft being music.) It is exceptionally well written and just all out cool! Jack Black does quite an impressive job here as do all the children and pretty much everybody. Unfortunately I did not see this in the theater though I wish I had. I really enjoyed this and am pleased to see that Hollywood still knows how to make great rock-n-roll movies. (I was kind of thinking they didn't.) My vote is 8.5 of 10. Good movie."

","School Of Rock is the best comedy Jack Black has done so far. Why I waited until DVD when I could have rocked out to Dolby Digital is something I will not forgive myself for.<br/><br/>Black plays Dewey Finn, a ""rock star"" who's only success in the music biz would probably the one hit wonders featured on MTV. The members of the band have had enough of his screw ups (especially when he air dives into the audience only to crash on to the floor) and sends him to the unemployment line.<br/><br/>However, Dewey was self employed so no cash or food stamps from welfare are available but fortunately Finn has been able to live rent free and gladly admits to his roommate Ned (Mike White who also wrote the hilarious screenplay) that he is taking full advantage of him.<br/><br/>But luck has changed. One morning the phone rings and it's the principal (Joan Cusak) from an anal retentive private school calling for Ned. Despite the free rent, Dewey realizes he needs to eat so he pretends to be Ned and gets the job as a substitute teacher.<br/><br/>Now its obvious that the only education he has is music and happily a student named Zack plays the guitar. Zack is a bright and very intelligent boy who is vastly unappreciated by his father.<br/><br/>Now the fun gets going. Dewey, (now known as Mr. Finn) has announced that the new assignment is rock band. He orders the students to pledge allegiance to the band and its time to get rockn'. Coincidently, there is the battle of the bands going on and its the perfect way for Dewey to get his finances in order. He forms the band with help from Zack (who is one hell of a guitar player) and as things progress, we see that Dewey really cares about the students and has found a unique way to build their self esteem and his too.<br/><br/>But as good as one intentions might be, Dewey's roommate finds out after he receives a paycheck from a school that he has never taught at. The children's parents also find out and now think their children have been kidnapped when they take off with Dewey to perform at the competition.<br/><br/>The timing is perfect when the parents arrive at the show to rescue the kids just as the band is going on stage. To be nice, I won't give it all away, but the next 10 minutes is a terrific and great piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>I had debated on how many stars to give School Of Rock and to be fully convinced, I went out and bought the soundtrack. It gets 5 and School gets 4. This is the best comedy of 2003.<br/><br/>NOTE: I could not agree more with Roger Ebert on the MPAA decision to rate this movie PG-13.

A collection of unknown preteens with musical talents no child has a right to make this movie special.<br/><br/>Jack Black is Dewey Finn, a rock singer and guitarist who has just been kicked out of his own band for his pathetic ""showmanship."" His best friend and roommate is Ned Schneebly (Mike White), a substitute teacher working toward his teaching certificate (like yours truly). One day, Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), principal of an elite prep school, calls looking for Ned for a long-term sub position. Dewey seizes the opportunity, pretends to be Ned and accepts the position. He proceeds to introduce his fifth graders to rock & roll, creating a complete rock band (including roadies, groupies, security, and a manager). Along the way he inspires them to follow their dreams, and teaches them the important life lesson of sticking it to the man.<br/><br/>But he also uses the kids to get himself into a city-wide Battle of the Bands. He tricks the neurotic, overprotective Principal Mullins into allowing a ""class trip"" to the concert. He has the children forsake normal fifth grade classwork to learn about rock music. Then the parents find out.<br/><br/>I especially want to point out the musicians Joey Gaydos (Zack, guitar), Robert Tsai (Lawrence, keyboard), Rebecca Brown (Katie, cello and bass), Kevin Clark (Freddy, drums), and most of all, vocalists Maryam Hassan, Caitlin Hale, and Aleisha Allen (Tamika, Marta, and Alicia respectively) whose vocal cords are gifts from G*d.<br/><br/>""School of Rock"" was warm-hearted, funny movie that really rocked, thanks in part to Black's comedic and musical talent, White's screen- and song-writing, Joan Cusack's anal goofiness, and mostly, the children.<br/><br/>Rating note: There is absolutely no reason that the MPAA gave ""School of Rock"" a PG13 rating instead of a PG. There is some minor language, some crude humor, and one drug reference in which Dewey jokes another teacher is on crack."

","The classroom provides one with a space within which to mold, to sculpt, to aid in the brilliant development of young minds.  It gives one the inside view of a child's world and the yearning to learn.  It can also unconventionally provide one with the chance to rebel against the stifling conduct code of a private preparatory school  and form a rock band. O, but the classroom is a noble place and Jack Black proves himself king yet again.<br/><br/>Black is back with the most adorable, sickeningly sweet vengeance.  Black stars as ne'er do well, ever-hopeful-for-fame-à-la-Led-Zeplin, Dewey Finn. After being kicked out of his own band, he is on the way to being thrown from his apartment by the girlfriend of his friend and former band member Ned Schneebly (Mike White, also the film's writer).  Sarah Silverman is Ned's nagging girlfriend and hits the nail of playing an annoying wench on the head.<br/><br/>Cash is now first and foremost on Finn's mind - well, second and secondmost as rocking out is always prevalent.  So he underhandedly takes a substitute teaching job at a prestigious school run by a sterile tyrant, Principal Rosalie Mullins as portrayed by the mouthy, hilarious Joan Cusack.  Before long, Finn discovers the amazing musical talent of his students and like any rock obsessed teacher would, devises a plan to create a rock band comprised of the classically trained pre-teen guitarists, pianists, percussionists and vocalists in hopes of enrolling them in a Battle of the Bands competition.<br/><br/>The humor is heaped forth as Finn and the students desperately try to maintain the secret of their percussive in-school practices and off campus rehearsals.  Though Black is, per usual, energetically entertaining with all of his facial contortions, flailing about with his air guitar and tacky grunge ensembles, the children put up a fair fight for screen time.  Their genuine, naïve humor is revitalizing and their musical talent - dee-lish. It should be noted that all of the child actors performed their own musical instruments and sang their own vocals.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a playground flick with plenty of those highly sought Jack Blackisms, classic rock, talented juveniles, original numbers, and feel good musicality."

","I found this film hilarious. Jack Black was fantasticaly funny and I couldn't stop laughing. Everyone in this film plays and adapts to their part perfectly. Built on a firm storyline, and topped up with comedy this film was definately a big hit for my family and I. I have always found Jack Black amusing but I think this part was his best. He played Dewey Finn's character perfectly. His facial expressions and movements were so funny. The storyline was fantastic, comical, and not in the least bit vague. You were given a very clear idea of what was going on. The story itself was amusing. I think although the was probably aimed at teenagers,this production would appeal to people of all ages.All the children in the film were so individual and they all acted superbley. I would defenately gives this film thumbs up!! SIDE SPLITTING!!!"
"funmelodies","Null","1","1","6 April 2004"," ""How can you kick me out of what is MINE?""
","""School of Rock"" is a highly enjoyable musical comedy. Jack Black gives his best performance to date as a intensly passionate rocker who, after getting kicked out of the band that he formed, schemes his way into a substitute teaching gig at a prep school in order to pay his rent. When he finds out that the kids can play, he recruits them to be in his band in an attemp to win the local Battle of the Bands contest. What really makes this movie shine is not so much Jack Black the wild man, but rather his subtle comedic instincts. When put on the spot by the children to play his song to them in the classroom, he manages to get the full arrangement out with only his voice and mannerisms. With lyrics like, ""in the end of time an artist led the way"" the song itself is autobiographical, conceptual, melodic and hilarious. When doing the song later on with the children backing him, notice how he rolls his r's during the ""and the legend of the RENT was way hardcore"" line. This passionately pretensious moment is probably my favorite part in the whole movie.  The child actors in the movie are also great, each and every one of them, and they can actually rock. They never come across as cute or cringy, which is a difficult feat to accomplish. Overall, the movie has a great energy throughout. Joan Cusack gives her usual great performance as the school principal. Instead of playing the voice of authority, her character is a misunderstood Stevie Nicks lover, who can't balance the pressure of her job with her desire to have fun. Go check this movie out. It's a timeless comedy that feels more like it was made in the 1980's, because comedy's of this caliber are too few and far between these days."

","Never mind all the generic cliche comments of many critics on this post who have trouble spelling.  For all the people who think they're really smart by saying the movie has holes in the plot, or that it's unrealistic... Or who try to compare it to Sister Act or Dead Poets Society?  Get a life people. This movie is in its own category.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely hillarious and Jack Black provides the most unique humor I've seen to date.  He's a natural with the kids, they love him. His passion is matched by none, as his personality really comes through in a breakthrough fashion.<br/><br/>Is it realistic?  Who cares, its a comedy... you're supposed to laugh and enjoy it, not analyze how likely these events would happen in real life. No substitute teacher would ever slip through the cracks like ""Mr. Shneebly"" did in the movie, but who cares.  Get over it.  It's hillarious and that's all it's meant to be, along with the kids becoming a little more ""loose"" and Dewey gaining a sense of responsibility.<br/><br/>I would not compare this movie to Sister Act or any past cliche story because it doesn't deserve that.  The comedy is genuine, the sentiment is pure, and Jack Black really gets to be himself... well, a kid-tested and mother-approved version of him anyway.  Watch the movie and just relax. Don't be ""tight wound"" like the principal and put a magnifying glass to any events that might not slide in the real world.  Leave that to a scrooge or a grinch.  Of course if you are a grinch or a scrooge, don't watch the movie. If you're a happy person and enjoy a good laugh, definitely watch it."

","This is the best Jack Black movie. It is funny and it isn't afraid to have sensativity. This is the best rock and roll film next to This is Spinal Tap.7.5 is a good grade but I do think it deserves higher.The best part of this movie is the song sequence when it shows Dewey teaching the kids about rock and roll. In case no one knew , all the kids in the movie were actually playing there instruments AND the only person who had to learn to play an instrument was Jack Black because he only knows how to play acoustic.

Any kid under the age of 5 is gonna find it hard to sit through especially if they're not particularly into rock music! My 6 yr old brother only just managed the whole film but i think that was just cause he was waiting for the moments when 'THE WHO' music was being played!!! Jack Black completely stole the film as he was in nearly every film but it definately worked as no one could get bored of him! All the children were great alas, especially the drummer and Zach, the lead guitarist! I must say I though that it would be funnier but there were a few funny moments which worked. I wouldn't quite call it a must see because not everyone is into rock music but if you are then maybe you'll just find one of you're fave. bands being mentioned in there!

","We already know from the entertaining Dazed and Confused (1993) that Richard Linklater knows how to handle this kind of nostalgic rock n' roll movie, so it's right that expectations should be set fairly high, especially since the project also involves Jack Black. Okay -- so Jack can only play one character, but he is usually very funny and it's good that he is becoming a bankable comedian now.<br/><br/>The premise is straightforward, as is the movie itself -- Jack Black is kicked out of his rock band so he sneakily takes a job as a temp a prep school, and begins forming his class into a rock n' roll band. As far as the class is concerned, the performances are pretty much what you expect from child actors, and the most notable talent is the lead guitar playing of twelve year old Joey Gaydos Jr.<br/><br/>It manages to be funny and original throughout, and it's no surprise that it was such a success at the box office. Jack Black spends much of the time carrying the movie himself, and if anything this did result with a green-light for the upcoming project of the Tenacious D movie which I await with nervous anticipation ..."

","This movie is a tribute to rock 'n' roll.  AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Ramones, The Clash, The Who, Stevie Nicks and more.  <br/><br/>This is a story of a looser without job that gets a call for a friend and become him.  We have seen that.  But this movie entertains you from the beginning to the end with full of joy and jokes and very good performances (specially Joan Cusack).  And you have the music and memorable quotes and moments (when Dewey seduces Rosalie, the principal of the school is epic). And the kids can act, and know how to do it.  They are gifted.  Musically speaking (all of them) and some of them acting (one of the best is Kevin Clark as Freddie the drummer).  I saw this movie twice and I find it excellent. <br/><br/>Well, if you want to find defects you could say about that we seen this, some things like how can he be a teacher without giving information or how he entered teaching in the school.  Or if you thing Jack Black overacts. That may be true but the overacting is the main characteristic of his character.<br/><br/>With brilliant moments, the great music and the fact that you wont be looking at your watch to see how many minutes left and this is very important because it's related to be bored.  <br/><br/>The performances are great and I salute you, Richard Linklater, Mike White, Jack Black, the kids and specially Joan Cusack.<br/><br/>Finally I would have liked that the song School of Rock would have had a nomination for the Academy Awards.

","For those who are still contemplating seeing the film, believe the hype. Believe every positive thing you hear about it. Support movies like this: clean movies where characters can act crazy and unconventional and still inspire children. A movie that steps away from reality and allows kids the chance to be kids. One of the cleanest movies to come out of Hollywood in years, way more intelligent than most children movies, and, most importantly, humor that stretches beyond the trap of fart jokes and standard bathroom humor. None of the kids are encouraged to forego their lifestyle in the name of rebellion, as is the case in many films done with this formula, just tweak it slightly and learn to feel passionately about something; learn to feel alive. Most importantly, learn to come to these feelings without their parent's guidance; giving the children a sense of pride in work they can call their own. The passion Jack Black shows herein is unbelievable. Every decision he makes, while sometimes selfish, is with the best intentions, and that type of honesty should be rewarded. Black possesses the ability to bring out the best in everyone he's around, from the tight nosed principal (Joan Cusack) to his ex-metal-head-turned-whipped-by-his-unsupportive-and-conservative-girlfriend best friend Ned (Mike White). If all of this description sounds like it's been done a hundred times before, it has. It is a formulaic movie, but one that redefines the formula. Expect some cheesiness, expect a simple plot, and expect to see one of the most fun films to come out in recent memory. This movie is, without a doubt, a classic genre movie, and one that should be seen by everyone. Rating: 35/40"

Jack Black is astounding, and if this doesn't make him a big star, nothing will. The kids are awesome musicians and comedians. Joan Cusack is great as the principal of the school that Jack Black liberates. This is a strange, hilarious, and inspiring movie that is saucy enough for adults and fun enough for kids.

Victory at Battle of the Bands.<br/><br/>Comments: Cute, a little funny but overall very predictable and very close to being a family-movie. The movie itself actually fails in its own theme; to revolt, to challenge and to ""stick it to the Man"". Unfortunately the movie and its jokes are completely mainstream. There are no surprises or new ideas, just the same old proved ones. And to be honest, the proved approach does work, to a certain extent. That is why it has stuck around, but by only using this there is nothing new, no refreshing approach, nothing to elevate the movie. Nothing to give the viewer a little jolt. Because the movie is too slow sometimes and does not rock at all.<br/><br/>Jack Black is perfect as Finn, and the child actors impressed me. And then there is the music.

The scenes where they are discovering rock music are precious. <br/><br/>I can't believe how much energy Jack Black has. He's so prepared to take risks and seems not to care about embarrassing himself. He's totally over-the-top in School of Rock, but, luckily, it totally works.

","Having enjoyed Jack Black's performance as a rock music obsessive in Stephen Frears' ""High Fidelity"", I had relatively high hopes for this movie. Alas they were not met. Thinking about it, the blame can really be laid solely at director Richard Linklater's feet, because the cast struggle gamely to rise above a leaden parade of clichÃ©d and stereotyped characters and settings, failing most of the time, alas. Only at the very climax - obviously enough, a 'Battle Of The Bands' talent contest -was there a sense of any excitement, and it was hard to judge whether that was because of the music or because of the audience of actors acting excitedly. As a fan of rock music, I certainly found much to argue with from a musical point of view - 'rock' here was clearly defined in terms of 1970s' arena rock. This may play to a large and wealthy demographic, and thus elicit maximal box-office receipts, but any film that claims 'School Of Rock' as its title and fails to mention either Elvis Presley or The Beatles (if it did, I missed it) is dishing out Rock History-Lite. Ironically, the cookie-cutter anonymous song that Black and his school band cobble together freely borrows the 'Oooh-la-la' chorus from The Beatles' ""You Won't See Me"" - and that made me cringe rather than smile. A few asides verbally and musically to the punk rock movement were made to bolster 'the stick it to The Man' philosophy that Black's character tried to get across, but it was all style (and not interesting style) and no substance here. All in all, a great disappointment."

","To me, Jack Black belongs to a category of ""Luck"" Celebrities such as Jim Carrey, Pauley Shore, Rob Schneider, Adam Sandler and David Spade who somehow became big time stars by proving to be as little talented as possible, (it gives hope to other no-talents to break into show business) although Spade did do Dickie Roberts and Carrey did Bruce Almighty so there is hope for the rest. In this odd little piece of would-be MST3K fodder, Black plays a screwed up, conspiratorial pothead who thinks he's a musician who impersonates a substitute teacher and somehow gets away with it with even unlikelier results. The major snafu in this movie is that he tells these kids ""to keep it a secret."" Thankfully, he seems to live in a world where logic does not exist. If these kids were as smart as they seemed, especially in a world where kids can be abducted, kidnapped from their homes or abused, they'd be reporting him to everyone who would listen. They're smart enough to keep it a secret, but dumb enough to not figure out what's going on. Like I said, this film occurs in a fishbowl with the dumbest fish somehow coming up with an end result and then orchestrating an unlikely and implausible sequence of events to get there. I hate to think what this movie stands for: Warping and ruining the minds of kids is acceptable as long as you can prove to everyone you can pretend to be a responsible adult. I'm sorry, but I refuse to accept that."

Mr. Black has this amazing bizarre grace and screen presence, but what's he going to do with a script this bad? It would have been better for him to adlib the whole way through. All the characters are stereotypes, none of them have any good lines, basically it's hard to make comedy when you're doing a kids movie and can't offend the Church Lady in the audience.<br/><br/>PLOT) A by-the-numbers underdog kids sports movie, but with rock and roll instead of a sport. It's semiinteresting the way music is treated as a science, with its complex history and charts in the training montage, but that's probably the only good part of the movie. I find it hard to believe that little kids are that capable of the maturity displayed (where's the fighting? the crying? does no one in Hollywood remember what life was actually like before college?). It's also kind of disgusting how much Black is rewarded (and never arrested) for multiple crimes and destroying all those kids' futures by not teaching them anything.<br/><br/>Avoid."
"The_Void","8","2","4","28 November 2005"," Jack Black makes School of Rock a very fun movie indeed
","School of Rock is one of those films where you know what's going to happen. You know that Jack Black and his class of would-be rockers will have a bumpy ride at first, you know that they'll start enjoying themselves, and then something bad will happen...only for it all to work out fine in the end. However, unlike most films of this ilk - it doesn't matter that it's predictable; as getting there is so much fun! Jack Black fits his role here like a glove, and the rest of the cast - children and adults - really give it their all, making School of Rock a very lively film indeed. The fact that it's hilarious throughout, and there's a strong degree of respect for the classic rock gods doesn't exactly hinder it either. The plot line is fairly typical, and it follows Jack Black's waster, who manages to cheat his way into a job as a substitute teacher. Of course, he has no idea how to teach; so maths, science, geography etc go out the window, in favour of a more 'relaxed' style of teaching. However, it isn't long before the bummed out rocker finds his students have musical ability; and he decides to use them to realise his dream of winning 'Battle of the Bands'.<br/><br/>The central message of the movie seems to be that having a good time and 'sticking it to the man' is more important than boring school subjects. Depending on how you look at life, this can actually be true - I mean, if we only live once; why not spend that time rocking in the Battle of the Bands competition rather than sitting listening to some teacher waffle on about what happened three hundred years ago in some other country? Of course, proper schooling tends to allow people to leave with better prospects - but rocking is so much more fun! Jack Black embodies this sort of ideology with his role in this film, and it's clear that roles like this are what really put him in his element. Black certainly isn't the greatest actor of all time - but he's definitely one of the most exciting leading men around at the minute. At first, I thought this film was something of a departure for the usually sombre director of Before Sunrise; but School of Rock, with its slacker roots and strong sense of fun actually compliments Richard Linklater's filmography nicely. On the whole, I recommend this movie to everyone. On paper, it's not my cup of tea - but it's hard not to enjoy a movie like this, and I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to anyway."
"burningfiresofhell","Null","2","4","30 August 2004"," Beyond my Expectations...
","Well... let me just say that my initial expectations of this film were pretty negative. <br/><br/> From just looking at the picture on the case, its not difficult to spot the group of snobbish irritating children, their cheesy smiles and Jack Black with his mildly untidy hair, leading the group, and looking as though he would feel more at home in a circus or nursery. As you can imagine, this put me off straight away, despite my love and passion for Metal/ Rock sort of music. However, I watched it.<br/><br/>Fantastic. This film really is superbly acted (I REALLY mean this- amazingly talented actors) and features a lot of humour specifically aimed at adults, though it would still be fine for children to hear it as most likely they wouldn't understand certain parts.<br/><br/>What else I found to be a truly great element to the film is the fact that the child actors are actually trained musicians, so when you see them playing, they really are! To see a 10 year old boy play completely professionally is a spectacular sight and brings a realistic and believable dimension to the film.<br/><br/>If you got the DVD (recommended) then be sure to watch the extra features, such as the 'lessons learned...' option, basically the making of the movie. I was also taken by the comedy of the adults director's commentary... probably the best extras section i have ever seen on a DVD!<br/><br/>Basically, this film is very good, especially for those into Rock music to spot the references to great bands like Led Zeppelin, Nirvana and many many others. Just Watch It!"

"Brad2002","6","2","4","7 March 2004"," so-so comedy
","I wasn't really impressed with this movie. It was somewhat of an original idea ( teaching the kids about rock n' roll ), but did use the teacher-who-frees-the-minds-of-his-students theme, which I've seen a few times before ( ""Dead Poet's Society"", for example ). The dialogue was smart and cleaver, which is a plus. I didn't find it all that funny, though. A few good laughs, but not as funny as the better comedies I've seen. I think the movie would have been a lot better if the kids had learned a few other classic rock songs ( I imagine the cost of using those songs was the reason there weren't ). Most of the performances by the kids were good, which is usually the downfall of movies featuring lots of kids. All in all, a little above average comedy."

","Jack Black (Shallow Hal) stars as Dewey Finn, a loser who gets dropped from his band, and is chased out of his apartment. In a desperate bid to get some cash to pay his rent, he poses as his friend, Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and becomes a substitute teacher at a prep school. Soon he discovers the musical talents of his class and prepares them for Battle Of The Bands under the pretext of a inter-state school competition.<br/><br/>School Of Rock isn't a very original idea. However it is kind of cute to see a bunch of ten-year-old kids undergo the transition from classical music to, well, rock. Most of the movie is predictable, but that isn't really bad. I expected some major obstacle to prevent the band from performing at Battle Of The Bands, and not only was it not as major as I expected, but the obstacle was something entirely different from the one I had in mind. No explanation about the result of the Battle Of The Bands, which left me confused, but hey, everyone loved them and they even did an encore.<br/><br/>School Of Rock is a mediocre movie, something to watch on a boring weekend. 6 out of 10. If you listen (or listened) to rock 'n' roll, add another point."
"iadoredave","7","2","4","29 February 2004"," Easily digested entertainment
","School of Rock is a feel-good attempt at combining Dangerous Minds with Sister Act, pumping with high-energy rock 'n' roll music that features shrieking vocals and raging rhythms. Yes, the classic kind that recalls the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. But this time around it's the kids who do it all, led by the goofy-looking Jack Black.<br/><br/>Jack Black (Shallow Hal), plays Dewey, a sloppy, down-on-his-luck die-hard classic rocker who gets dumped by his band mates. Desperate to pay for his rent, he lies his way into getting a job as a elementary school teacher pretending to be his housemate. It's hardly surprising that he is nothing like the discipline-loving teacher in To Sir with Love, instead, the quick-witted Dewey sees the awesome musical talents in his class of fifth-graders, turns them into a professional rock band for a big-time competition, and inspires them along the way.<br/><br/>Black, capitalising on his rockin' talents as a real-life member of the rock/comedy band ""Tenacious D"", is simply terrific as an unorthodox teacher who ignores all the rules but finally earns respect for his passion in rock music. He is the soul of the film, not just looking perfect for the role of a seemingly eccentric underdog but delivering snappy dialogue in his funny interactions with students. Joan Cusack is also fine in the role of the stuffy but good-hearted principal, Black¡¦s antithesis who adds some tension and conflict to the plot. And yet, kids may be too young to appreciate this family entertainment, at least not as much as adults nostalgic of vintage rock. I constantly heard kids crying out loud in one of the first previews, perhaps it¡¦s the bombing sounds that scared them. Overall, the film is a joy to watch with a talented cast plus smooth and engaging direction (Richard Linklater, Before Sunrise)."
"MovieAddict2016","9","2","4","8 February 2004"," This ""School"" Rocks...
","It was just a matter of time until a film like this came along. A slacker decides to transform a bunch of repressed children into well-educated young adults. Wait a minute, what am I saying? Films like this have come along many times before--""The Dead Poets Society,"" ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" ""Hardball,"" and ""The Emperor's Club,"" and that's only naming a few titles of many.<br/><br/>But here's a movie so different from the rest it deserves some type of attention. Gone are the clean morals of, say, ""Mr. Holland's Opus""--here come lines like, ""Stick it to the man!"" with a trailer that advertises, ""...a man who taught them to break the rules."" These rules, by the way, are applied and kept in order by a private elementary school, where Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is posing as a teacher in order to get some cash to put together his own rock band.<br/><br/>""'The Man' is everywhere,"" he preaches to a small group of children. ""You've gotta stick it to him."" So they stick it to ""The Man"" by forming a rock band during school hours and entering into the Battle of the Bands--in hope that they'll win the jackpot reward for first place.<br/><br/>I need to start at the beginning.<br/><br/>Dewey Finn is a slacker loser who plays guitar like a pro--the only problem is that he gets stoned when he and his band are performing and embarrasses his fellow players. After they kick him out prior to preparing for the upcoming Battle of the Bands, Dewey decides to form together his own band by getting some money. But how?<br/><br/>Dewey's roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White, who also wrote the film and a song in it) is a substitute teacher (""Not a temp!""), and so when the phone rings and the call is for Ned, Dewey decides to pose as his best friend in hopes of getting some quick cash. He soon finds himself at ""the best school in the state,"" teaching a class of strange kids and trying to avoid getting found out by the principal (Joan Cusack). A school dropout himself, Dewey only knows one thing: Music. So he teaches music to the kids after finding out they can play various instruments--piano, guitar, drums, and even the cello (which he decides to leave out of the forming band).<br/><br/>Dewey decides to enter his ""School of Rock"" into the Battle of the Bands, much to the laughter of other competing bands. But he has true faith in his pack of school kids. That's part of what makes the film so inspirational and different from the other junk adorning the market right now--this seems real, and so does the affection, and Jack Black turns Dewey Finn into a likable character--the opposite of what someone like Adam Sandler might have done with the kids. (I can see him in the role, but the film would undoubtedly have been a bit less of a serious comedy--it would've turned into a loud, noisy, sporadically amusing comedy.)<br/><br/>The movie uses a lot of old cliches, but they all come off as--at the very least--acceptable, given the material. This is a refreshingly refreshing comedy, the type of film that makes you feel good after leaving the theater--which is a very rare thing these days. The final Battle of the Bands is both realistic and uplifting. Even the end credits are fun to sit through.<br/><br/>The film completely relies upon Jack Black as its carrier, and lucky enough for the film he is a very good lead. This is the film lover's version of a Rob Schneider or Chris Farley. Black has been around for a long time, always playing good co-star roles, and in ""High Fidelity"" he proved that he was more in-tune with the present times than any other recent ""SNL"" comedian. Not that Adam Sandler is bad given the right material, but how many times do we have to put up with re-makes of ""Happy Gilmore""?<br/><br/>Black is arguably one of the funniest fat comedians since John Candy, when given the appropriate material. He's the type of comedian who could become quite annoying very quickly, but with the right material and director focusing behind the camera he turns out to be funnier than most guys out there. Black's ability to pick increasingly good scripts is something John Candy never seemed to be able to master; although I think it was basically because Hollywood didn't want Candy to get good scripts.<br/><br/>Once and a long time there comes the surprise hit wonder. Nobody ever thought that ""School of Rock,"" a movie starring Jack Black as a slob rock guitarist, would ever amount to anything. But it turned out to be one of the most critically-praised films of the year, and after seeing it for myself, I have to agree that this is a well-made film that has certainly been done before, but rarely this good, and even rarer is the formula ever this likable.<br/><br/>4/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

I really liked the moment when Jack Black (the fake teach) told one of his students/drummer in his band not to think Rock music means that musicians do drugs or be alcoholic. 
I personally think that he tried to swipe off the negative image of rock music. It is not rock 'n' roll anymore when the musician lose themselves in drug/alcohol abuse. Jack Black throws a big question how the rock music should be and not.

Overrated is the word that comes to mind."
"Semisonic","7","0","0","15 March 2016"," A goof parade, but with heart
","I guess the concept behind School of Rock's story is old as the hills. A good-hearted but too much of a screw-around loser gets kicked out of his natural habitat and has to pretend to be someone else to get around people who have no prejudice against him. Then he screws around some more, doing antics that make you cringe, until his good-heartedness finally wins you over piece by piece, and then the happy ending ensues. Have fun, feel good, bye-bye!<br/><br/>Well, Jack Black has a real talent for turning the ""feel good"" into ""feel embarrassed"". A good half of this film, when he's moping around and making idiotic jokes and faces, you really have to battle your instinct to shut your eyes and ears to avoid that horrible shame. Because when it comes to that, one can think of no man more obnoxious and annoying than Mr Black.<br/><br/>But, luckily for us, School of Rock is not about our chubby narcissistic doofus. It's about the kids who he teaches while on the mission of impersonating his spineless roommate to earn some easy cash. The kids really steal the show, providing the film with enough character versatility and the real-world child issues. And despite being an abysmal teacher of proper things, Jack Black's infantile character manages to reach out to the kids, gain their trust and wake up the talents which the ""proper"" education tries so hard to mould into something useful, convenient but utterly generic. And from then on, the students take over and lead this unlikely alliance to something that ultimately makes this flick enjoyable and even fun.<br/><br/>The ""everyone is special, you just need to find your true self"" trope gets kinda worn out with time, especially since the real world is not as shiny as it is in the movies, and not everyone is just a vessel of pure talent waiting to be unearthed. But this time, School of Rock managed to nail this theme without getting cloying or force-feeding us that political correctness. And although i would hardly want my kids (if i had any) to be tutored by a lazy bum like Dewey Finn, i'd definitely show them this liberating piece of teen spirit. Because self-confidence is what kids need the most to grow into someone mentally healthy and capable to love and respect himself. And what could be a better source of self-confidence than a sloppy fat guy basking in the self-propagated glory of a rock star, especially if that's what he is really good at."
"Snowgo","8","0","0","5 January 2015"," Uneven but Humorous
","This is a thoroughly-enjoyable romp that helps us to see that our individual talents and self-esteem are sometimes bolstered in unusual, or even very unusual, ways. The most humorous parts of this movie are the scenes which show both the skepticism and approval with which the students see their new teacher and his ""curriculum"".<br/><br/>""You are a fat loser.., and you have body odor!"" one student rebels. Another states adamantly, ""You're a joke! You're the worst teacher I've ever had.""<br/><br/>Dewey Finn's plan to get these children to think for themselves and kick up their heels at authority works perfectly: Their latent talents and identities increase and improve as this most-ulikely-of-mentors utilizes their skills for his own selfish-though-understandable reason.<br/><br/>Although we never do find out why Dewey wasn't arrested at the school meeting, nor where the ""soundproofing"" that supposedly was put on the classroom walls went, we can forgive all this because of the movie's big heart. Jack Black carried off the madman/genius/slacker/overachiever as few could. The School of Rock, though somewhat uneven, even ungainly, is a humorous look at ""what if"".<br/><br/>The odd sequence at the end where we hear an AC/DC vamp being repeated ad-infinitum, appears to be a studio outtake, and is one of the weakest endings to a movie (by far) that I have awarded an ""8"" to that I have ever seen. The time and film should have been spent, instead, in showing a scene where Dewey's best friend, Ned, finally stands up to his controlling girlfriend, and perhaps the children assert themselves to their parents.<br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't have hurt to have informed us how Dewey avoided charges of fraud, contributing to the delinquency of a minor (20 counts) and forgery (on job application).<br/><br/>We'd also like to know how the experience has changed Ross, the Principal. The movie deserves a better ending, and although I am tempted to detract one star because of it, I will not. <br/><br/>One scene that I hated was when Dewey went behind the Palace to fetch Zach. It was totally out-of-character when Dewey treated Zach like a dictator, and went all ""high-and-mighty"" on the members of the band that were playing cards with Zach. This scene lent to the unevenness of the movie.<br/><br/>Although I consider Orange County to be an overall better movie, School of Rock is unforgettable and one-for-the-books."

That being said, all the child actors are rather well- cast and do a good job of playing both disciplined, well-behaved and capable of rocking.<br/><br/>As for Linklater, a well-renowned independent director, he keeps his style to a minimum, wisely focusing on the story at hand and allowing Black to go wild in his performance.

"StevePulaski","8","0","0","4 January 2012"," Cut footloose and attend The School of Rock
","Just when you think kids movies hit an all time low along comes a film that shows that effort and life can still be injected into them. School of Rock was Jack Black's rebound after a string of critical failures like Orange County and Saving Silverman. He proves that, like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy, he can play the lovable louse in a clean yet fun manner appealing to many different audiences.<br/><br/>Though it's a kids movies, I can see adults enjoying it more. At least understanding it more. It focuses a lot on the history of rock and many bands rock icons such as AC/DC, Black Sabbath, and Led Zepplin that I'm not sure many kid would instantaneously recognize. But it has enough slapstick humor, colors, and off the wall humor for them to still be interested or at least amused in the storyline.<br/><br/>The story follows Dewey Finn (Black) a layabout who has been mooching off his roommate Ned Schneebly (White) for rent money. After Ned's girlfriend gets fed up with his behavior, they both force Dewey to get a job and pay them by the end of the week. Since Ned is a substitute teacher, Dewey gets a call one day from prestigious elementary school in Woodbury, New York asking for Ned to fill in for a week or so. Dewey pretends to be Ned so he can fill in for the position and collect the check.<br/><br/>At first, he goes down the lackadaisical route and just lets the children do whatever they want. Soon, he discovers that they are very tightly wound, but can play instruments very well, each with their own talent. It then becomes clear that Dewey must teach these kids how to overcome their drone-like lifestyles and, well, rock out.<br/><br/>Avoiding clichés, Dewey doesn't just take one student under his wing to befriend them, he takes them all, each giving them an equal amount of screen time. It has almost become a law that when a movie has a teacher for the main character, he/she must take them under their wing and guide them through their troubles. Here, Dewey assists each one. All the kids are stuck in the same boat of being put under a very large amount of pressure, but everyone has their own hidden talent they can't show. That's why they need Dewey.<br/><br/>Jack Black is a charismatic joy in the film. He's crazy, yet lovable in a way that is hard to accomplish. He sometimes goes overboard, but he quickly stops himself to regain his previous behaviors. It's a little hard to identify what makes him so likable. I think it's because so many characters on Television and in movies try too hard to be liked, and out of the blue we get this character who is inspiring, hip, exciting, unpredictable, and funny.<br/><br/>I was reminded of the 80's hit Footloose more than once during this film. That was a film I think I saw in the wrong time period, thus cementing my dislike for its messy execution. It simply tried to be too many things and didn't do a very good job at any of them. School of Rock has the same sort of message, but both films have seriously different plots. Footloose centers around a town on the verge of banning music, but teenagers across the town say it's one of the many forms of ""cutting loose"" in the world. School of Rock is about a genial sack who pretends to be a teacher to get a job at a school so he can obtain money, but then it becomes clear he wants to teach the tightly-wound runts to ""cut loose"" as well. Both films are about being yourself, individuality, and sticking it to ""the man,"" but School of Rock does it in a more fun and controlled manner.<br/><br/>It had been solely for the music and the message I would've recommended it, but the fact that it features a great cast of kids and a strong and sentimental lead actor seals the deal of this not only being a great movie but a proof that fun kids films still exist. School of Rock is a big-hearted, energetic, joyous exercise in the field of comedy proving that it can appeal to those who pay for the ticket and those who go along for ride.<br/><br/>The MPAA can also thank themselves for giving a perfect film for ages seven and up a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Starring: Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Mike White, Miranda Cosgrove, Sarah Silverman, and Adam Pascal.

","The School of Rock is a such a funny film. I remember seeing this through my childhood years after this came out. Now that I am a college student, I was still able to watch this film with extreme pleasure. School of Rock is the best musical ever, better than Grease or Sound of Music.<br/><br/>This is about a lazy musician who is told to come up with rent money or he'll get kicked out. He decides to pose as a substitute teacher and teach his class the gift of rock and roll music.<br/><br/>Jack Black is ...well Jack Black. I say that in a good way because I like his style of acting. The kids were pretty darn great. Sarah Silverman is great as the hothead girlfriend.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best musical I have ever seen. This will be one of my favorites for years to come.

","Full of energy. Charming. Jack Black plays a lovable loser who secretly takes a substitute teaching job in his roommate's name and then gets overly-ambitious dreams inspired by the student's musical abilities. It's a cute movie, with a pretty unlikely plot, but if you overlook that, you'll have a good time. It has a satisfying conclusion, albeit somewhat cheesy. It's a feel good movie though. You'll feel nice after watching it.<br/><br/>The acting is good by Black and Cusack, but you know how kids act. They're average, sometimes really bad, but I wasn't surprised. It's pretty rare that I'm impressed with a kid actor. :/ It's a really funny movie, I laughed out loud quite a few times. I had a really fun time watching it and I own it happily. I definitely recommend it. It's got a cute message."

","I really enjoy ""The School of Rock"" , but to compare it to ""The Sound of Music"" you must be a little deranged. Maria, a nun in the Sound of Music doesn't lie or falsify who she is. The music in the Sound of Music may seem corny to the younger set, but I believe they are classics loved by more people than the song ""The School of Rock"". I love Led Zeppelin, Areosmith and others that Dewey Smith's character loves. Anyway, I enjoyed ""The School of Rock"", especially the final scene with the kids performances, but you CANNOT compare this movie with ""The Sound of Music"".

"saumya14588","6","0","0","6 October 2009"," funny attempt at creating a new genre- school rock
","School of rock is in the end, a simplistic comedy movie and should be judged in that light. So I tried to ignore the logical bypasses in it, and after that it came out as a nice, clean entertainer. I felt the film seems funnier while watching than if you think about it after it ends. Jack Black brings a certain comic timing to it that makes you tickle, inspite of all his 'overacting' in parts.<br/><br/>The movie deserves credit for the concept, cast selection and situational humor. Also, in this age of cheap pop music, a little passionate infusion of Rock culture is a welcome change. The kids did a fine job considering their ages and the limited scope and screenspace presented to them, as Black dominated the movie quite thoroughly. The bottled-up principal and Black's room mates were fine too. The parents though, could have been better than the headless chickens shown.<br/><br/>As for the drawbacks, I found several though some might be overlooked in the movie's genre. Black comes across as a non conformist with his aversion to dieting, drugs, girls and rest of the habits dogging most rock wannabes. However, some of his takes on Rock music are so cliché' it's difficult to accept his credibility as a free-thinking musician. The over-the-top antics on solos, diving in the crowd, praying to some rock god, driving a junky wagon are just the sort of stupid conformism he fights against. While he dresses in a school uniform for the concert, the rest of the kids are in some alternate, disjointed clothing and sporting crazy hairdos disputing the very theme of the movie- That you don't need to be a freak and lead an unhealthy lifestyle to be a rock artist. Also the slanders to classical music were uncalled for; the very reason that those kids were able to pick up rock instruments so fast was because of their training in classical. Ahem, they could have made someone else sing the songsJack was really ordinary in the concert.<br/><br/>But yes, if taken in a light hearted way, the movie was a genuine entertainer and well worth a watch."

","Richard Linklater couldn't use, back in 1993, Led Zeppelin's classic, and totally mind blowing, tune for his film Dazed and Confused (still a great soundtrack certainly, and if Wikipedia is to be believed ""while Jimmy Page agreed Robert Plant refused"") but here in this Linklater film, The School of Rock, we have not only a Zeppelin classic (I just saw for the very first time the video with Jack Black that was sent to Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones! Lords of Rock Led Zeppelin!!!) but also classics by such great bands like the Doors, the Who, Cream, Deep Purple, the Ramones, AC/DC, etc. The School of Rock, written by Mike White (who also plays a not that minor character. He is all right but certainly he ain't a really good actor), is certainly Jack Black's show, and is like a for hire film for Linklater in the vein of his 2005 Bad News Bears (a remake of the 1976 The Bad News Bears, which I haven't seen) however comparing one film with the other, I mean The School of Rock and Bad News Bears, I can say there's a really notable difference, The School of Rock is a fast-paced, hilarious and highly re-watchable Hollywood entertainment, you can forgive its typical elements, that is predictable and stuff.<br/><br/>And as I think you already know Tenacious D member Jack Black is Dewey Finn, and like Jack Black himself the main character (Dewey Finn) of this film may not be the God of Rock but for sure he is a good guitar player, yet basically at the very beginning of the film each time Black scores by making us laugh Dewey Finn is one step closer to stop being part of the rock band No Vacancy, one step closer to be basically broke and without the dream of rock 'n' roll. However at one point we are going to enjoy part of a classic by Cream (I doubt that a rock fan doesn't get at least a little excited when the riff of ""Sunshine of Your Love"" begins), is like the rebirth of Dewey (though at that point Dewey is known at his workplace as Ned Schneebly) after finding a new hope in order to fight in the upcoming battle of the bands. It will be kids hearing for the very first time about the Doors, Hendrix, etc., hell it would have been really cool to have checking out the vocal solo from Pink Floyd's ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" instead of some math problems as homework or having as a class the history of rock instead of history of the world, don't you think? And this thing (Dewey not only pretends to be his best friend Ned Schneebly, who is a substitute teacher, but also will use ""his"" students for the battle of bands by telling them is a secret school project) certainly will bring troubles, of course eventually everybody will know the truth about Dewey and of course the kids will stay with their rock teacher. And is like you have to do what the principal (Joan Cusack is terrific. ""Well I went today, maybe I will go again... tomorrow!"") and the parents of the kids will do, sort of: for once forget about everything else and just enjoy the show, enjoy the hilarious show of Jack Black, enjoy the show of the talented kids, enjoy this Linklater film!"

","Well, I might be a nerd but who doesn't like music? If anyone out there doesn't like music, they should be very, very, lonely. Well let's thin down the category. What about Rock Music? Well, you might like classical, pop, jazz or reggae but rock rocks too. Now what about Jack Black? You've seen him recently in Kung-Fu Panda and Nacho Libre but before all of that he was in this gem. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you, my review of The School of Rock. The main characters are... OH MY GOSH HOW MANY!!!!!! Let's start. We have Dewey Finn played by Jack Black, Class Factotum (president, schedule keeper) Summer Hathaway (Miranda Cosgrove), Asian (with one of the most hilarious lines in the film) Lawrence (Robert Tsai), Freddy Jones (Kevin Clark), and Tomika (Maryam Hassan). There's a lot more but these stand out more. Jack is hilarious as always and Miranda was cute and funny in here, everyone else did a good job. The main villain is who exactly? Well if you look at the movie, the main villain is Patty (Sarah Silverman)! She told Dewey to get a job, kept abusing Dewey, and when Dewey finally gets his share of the rent, she ****s it up for him. She also annoys me. Supporting characters are the other kids and Principal Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack). The other kids are also funny but Mullins gets the cake here. She doesn't have many funny moments but she's not annoying and doesn't hinder the story too much. Not allowing Dewey a field trip is the school rules so it's not her fault. The comedy here isn't too dirty and there aren't many jokes but when there is, it can make you laugh really hard. The story is pretty good. Simple funny and awesome. I give this film, 78% awesome!"

He soon starts teaching his students all about rock music and he and the class secretly for a rock band to perform in the ""Battle of the Bands."" Some of the biggest laughs come when Jack Black makes odd references to bands from several decades ago that would, in reality, go over the heads of most kids in the grade he is teaching but would easily be understand by the average adult. Black's hyper personality and hilarious remarks in the conversations with other staff members are also very funny, as he makes additional references to song lyrics and even quotes from Woody Allen. Joan Cusack is superbly cast as the school principal, suspicious yet still completely unaware of what's going on in the classroom. It's implausible that no one would figure out what the class was doing, but that's another thing that makes this film so funny. Parents, there are occasional sex and drug references, so you may want to wait until your kids are old enough to know better, which depends on the age and maturity of your individual children.

That must all stink for Dewey when he gets drunk during a concert and is kicked out of his own band. Desperate for money, (He is liable to get kicked out of his own apartment if he doesn't pay the rent.) Dewey answers the phone when a school principal is calling Dewey's roommate, Ned Schneebly. Ned just happens to be a substitute teacher, so Dewey Finn takes over the job, and pretends to be Ned.<br/><br/>School of Rock tries to be, and becomes one thing, and one thing only- a comedy. But, it is a funny, witty and excellent comedy. So, it succeeds at its goal. How so? Take many of the scenes, like when Dewey is writing his name on the board. Or, look at the dialogue, which is also funny, but mostly because of the way Jack Black delivers them.<br/><br/>It was no surprise that such a silly movie was inspired by Jack running down the halls of an apartment, blasting his favorite rock music.<br/><br/>To counter the only upside, School of Rock doesn't have very many downsides. The characters are great, the jokes are not over-drawn and the film is never boring. The only major flaw I could find was that it was clichéd, and doesn't have enough things going for it (drama, action, story, special effects, etc.) to be any better than it already is.<br/><br/>Though it is clichéd, School of Rock doesn't fail as a film.

Besides having an awesome soundtrack, this movie is a rocking romp, and truly shows how the power of music can make one rise above all the bullshit that surrounds you in life. It's not a perfect movie, as some cuts and beats are just a little illogical, such as when the Battle of the Bands manager just suddenly changes his mind on Dewey, but because the movie's message is so strong and the music is so good, all is forgiven, and hopefully this movie will endure as a cult classic for years to come."

Most dominantly, what is immediately received from this film is that these kids rock. But what's really important is that these kids really, really do rock. Combine them with the personality of Black and the acting of Joan Cusack, and you get really enjoyable performances all around.<br/><br/>Also, Mike White's writing and roll in this film are very much worth mentioning. What seems like a typical story really does have things to say about following your dreams, but more importantly it also shows the pitfalls of those dreams as well... the characters willing to ""sell out"", the fact that they don't really win the competition, the necessity of avoiding those that just want to use rock as a way to be a bum... all of that is cleverly put in there. Just Cusack's little monologue when her character's drunk in the van with Black is enough to point out that there's actually real substance behind this script and it's not just a cop-out Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Which is great because it's also low on the overt ""stupid loser"" jokes that tend to be mostly thrown around in the attempt to make a story about a supposed loser funny. It's also low on language, so really it can be very enjoyable for many reasons, whichever way you want to approach it.<br/><br/>It seems on the cover to be a film that would be a quick fad and then eventually disappear into the annuls of lost comedies, but if it actually does, that's tragic, because it really is a film worth appreciating.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

It also felt like they were still busy rewriting the script during filming. A lot of subplot-lines are never completed, which gives the movie an at times incomplete and incoherent feeling. The movie also never really goes deep with the story or characters and therefor you never feel really emotionally involved or attached to the movie.<br/><br/>Still the movie is above average which is due to Jack Black's performance. He really carries the movie with his performance, that seems to be simply written for him. The child actors aren't really the greatest ever but at least they know how to play an instrument.<br/><br/>It basically is a silly, good movie that is enjoyable and entertaining but in my opinion it's not great. The movie has too many loose ends and bits for that.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Jack Black is what would be called ""awesome"" most things he does is just fun and chalked full of greatness. After re-watching School of Rock since I saw it the week it came out I have come to decide that this movie is fantastic. You can tell that this movie was written for Jack Black, cause you can't see anyone else close to how dynamic Jack Black is.<br/><br/>Jack Black's character Dewey Finn gets kicked out of his band and has no job and no girlfriend. He relies on his best friend Ned Schneely to pay for everything, but Ned gets a domineering girlfriend played by Sarah Silverman (Evolution) who decided for both of them that enough is enough and that if Dewey doesn't get a job he's kicked out of the apartment. And when a call for a sub teacher is intercepted by Jack Black instead of his roommate Ned he doesn't wanna give up the chance for 650 dollars a week as a sub. Dewey takes Ned's identity and becomes a sub at a prestigious private elementary school. What Dewey comes to learn is that his group of 10 year-olds are quite talented in the art of RAWKING and he decides to make a band.<br/><br/>Even all of the talent of Jack Black can't carry this movie by itself, the children led by guitarist Zack and drummer Freddy Jones are superior supporting actors in this film, and the fiery little Summer Hathaway always barking and ass kissing her way to the top of the class. All these great actors and actresses make this movie fun, entertaining, and PURE RAWK for the family, so people should check it out"

","Rock Spoilers.<br/><br/>A beautiful rarity when an actor is bequeathed a role that envelops him (in the words of Ace Ventura) ""like a glove"". This movie IS Jack Black. And Jack Black IS this movie. Had he not piloted this vehicle like a deranged Timothy Leary by way of Keith Moon, it would have coagulated into limp-wristed Disney clichés and bilious sermonizing.<br/><br/>As it is, it still requires a concentrated dose of ""suspension of disbelief"" sturdy enough to knock over an elephant, as this story's premise is quite foundation-less and upon successive viewings, reads as ever more idiotic - but the surfeit of unrealistic contrivance doesn't intrude as much as it should, for Black eats alive every frame he is in, erupting so much hilarious energy into even his simplest chatting scenes, that he somehow salves any gripes we may have with script inadequacies.<br/><br/>There hasn't been anyone this shameless since Bill Clinton.<br/><br/>We meet Black's rock-fanatic character, Dewey Finn, fired by his garage band, jobless, squatting in the loft of his best friend, Ned Schneebly (played by Mike White, the film's writer), who is Every Man's Worst Vagina-Whipped Casualty. Dewey accepts a substitute-teacher post under Schneebly's identity, rationalizing the duplicity as beneficial since he owes Ned much back rent. And thus does the whole movie play, with Dewey committing sin after rationalizing sin, yet providing such consummate entertainment that we rarely contemplate his immoralities.<br/><br/>In his guise of substitute teacher, Dewey stumbles across a substitute BAND  the young kids of his class  to fulfill his lowbrow scheme as contender in a Battle Of The Bands (Intentionally, we hear The Who's ""Substitute - your lies for fact"") Enlisting their musical aid as if it were a school project, Dewey's initially duplicitous scheme transcends its meanness when, in his quest to achieve small-time stardom, Dewey ends up imparting profound advice to all and sundry, as well as educating his class (and the viewer) with the many facets required to make a rock show roll.<br/><br/>As ascetic Principal Mullins, Joan Cusack (veteran hausfrau and leading-lady sidekick)  uncharacteristically OOZES Woman-Heat in her severe schoolmarm attire.<br/><br/>The children were thankfully not the usual clutch of precocious smart-alecks  after countless spoiled, irritating, screeching pig-brats on screen, we finally get kids who act like KIDS. The boys were actually likable and the girls were actually cute! And this is one of those rare films that pays attention to its music synch (except for a short, dodgy classical passage).<br/><br/>One aspect which annoyed me *personally* was the widespread notion that WE KEYBOARDISTS are non-stop NERDS: Dewey bequeaths Lawrence the keyboardist Yes's ""Fragile"" album - why not ""Machine Head"" or ""Demons & Wizards"" for the Lord or Hensley stamps of majesty and showmanship? Why not a Hammond XB juggernaut to smack down the thunder, instead of the furiously metrosexual Yamaha synth? As a musician of 30 years who has shredded and smashed the hells bells out of my share of keyboards, let me assure you that Lawrence's end jamm solo was TOTALLY shirt-lifting  put some STANK on it, fey keyboardist DORK-STALKER! To get those audience panties wet, play in the same mode as GUITARISTS (the pentatonic mode) - throw that classical noodling OUT! The first lesson of the School Of Rock: it's not how good you ARE  it's how good you LOOK. So start by standing with those legs APART, for the love of - - but the damage is done yet again <br/><br/>The story is ""formulaic"" to an extent, yet holds most clichés at bay. Cliché would have Dewey's kids WINNING the Band Competition  they didn't; cliché would have Dewey plant one on Cusack at film's end  he didn't; cliché would force Dewey into recanting his wicked ways  he didn't, which was the bravest cliché omission, separating this film from gutless Disney fare.<br/><br/>Dewey was incorrigible! He did NOT arc from selfish cad Bad Boy to mushy princess Home Girl  his third-act epiphany allowed him to ADMIT his selfishness and mendacity, even whilst retaining those base natures! For the wheels of his con were so firmly in motion that everyone simply HAD to ride it out.<br/><br/>All his displays of concern and inspiring pep-talks  over the keyboardist's lack of cool; the drummer led astray by Poseurs; the fat girl's insecurities; the guitarist's bullying father; even his tentatively romantic overtures towards Cusack's ice-queen Principal  were merely to cultivate HIS agenda. (That his actions WERE meaningful to the parties persuaded was merely a BY-PRODUCT of his false pretenses.) Yet, by film's end, Dewey had gone from self-appointed El Capitano Band Leader, to praising ""OUR"" band. It was this small shift in stance that allowed his ""end"" to justify his ""means"", otherwise, even in the movie universe, he would have met with Zeppelin's Gallows Pole.<br/><br/>Black trod that knife-edge between sociopath and savior, milking the storyline like a blue-ribbon set of udders, for the pleasure of rock burnouts of the Alice Cooper generation (Pre-Comeback). High time!  enough with the 70s-disco movies, or the street-cred ""alternative"" soundtracks  here is a soundtrack with The Immigrant Song, Smoke On The Water and It's A Long Way To The Top searing our aural cavities - unabashedly, unapologetically - not as satire or denigration, but as the embodiment of the lead character's motivation. These same tracks having driven at least three generations to long hair, cheap pot and bad fashion, why has it taken so long for film-makers to ""get"" it, groove it, milk it, market it? <br/><br/>Much like Black illustrating the street-greeting to Lawrence, this movie is one big Secret Handshake to crazed musicians of all disposition, crammed as it is with rock-scene esoterica. A flashback sans LSD.<br/><br/>Thank Jesus H. Pants that we're back in Black.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

","""School of Rock"" is one of those movies that could get cut to ribbons if taken too seriously. And it doesn't deserve that. It featured loud, rockin' music - new tunes as well as old, and humorous references to real rock performers both past and present. Jack Black did a fine job as the whacky, wanabee, elementary school teacher. A lovable loser. He took a class of up-tight rich kids and transformed them into the rock band of his dreams. He got them to listen to and respect him as a leader when his peers no longer had any use for him. Ya gotta give the movie a little time to grow on ya. It was painful at first to get into it. Jack Black can be annoying and rub you the wrong way. I kept thinking that Jim Carrey would be much funnier and believable in the same role. But, after getting over the initial boredom and impatience with the lame dialogue, you find yourself in love the 10 year old kids who are so cute and lovable. And the music will get you up on your feet to play a little air guitar along with Jack. ""Hey, I can do that too"", you'll shout, since everybody at one time wanted to be a rock star.<br/><br/>And if that fat kid in the class looks familiar. He is. That's ""Bobby Baccala's"" son. And if you don't know who ""Bobby Baccala"" is......you're from another planet and will definitely love ""School of Rock"". <br/><br/>So let the kids and the music put you into a rockin' mood and don't take it all too seriously. You'll have a rockin' 'n rollin' good time."

","I would say the high-point of the movie is Jack Black's hilarious and yet touching performance. I think this movie was really his chance to shine. The movie is centered around Dewey Finn (Black) who is the over-zealous lead guitarist for a heavy-metal rock band led by Broadway's RENT star Adam Pascal. After causing many scenes at various gigs (including taking off his shirt and jumping into the audience where nobody would catch him, and passing out drunk) Dewey gets fired from the band. Since now he has no income instead of little he can't pay his vastly overdue rent he owes his roommate Ned Schneebly (played by Mike White who also wrote the film) and his scary nagging girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman). In order to solve this problem, he decides to take the identity of Ned who is a substitute teacher, without him knowing, and start teaching at a prestigious private Elementary School. There he gets the class to form a rock band so he can win enough money at the battle of the bands to pay off his rent. The film features a lot of hilarious scenes involving the uptight principal of the school Principal Mullins (played by Joan Cusack) where Jack Black makes her reveal her secret love for Stevie Knicks songs. The film overall has an equal balance of comedy and life lessons, making it as touching as it is funny. The film overall is nicely crafted, but at the end I kind of wanted more. I recommend this film to anyone look for a nice evening with Jack Black. Grade: B (review retrieved from yahoo.com; written 10/13/03)"

","Jack Black is like Jim Carrey--he works so hard at his comedy that the strain at first overshadows the humour. But like Jim Carrey, he keeps so insistently at his viewers that they can't help but be won over totally by his zaniness. I didn't think Black was very funny when this movie started, but he plays the role so earnestly and with so much personality that I was a Jack Black fan by the time it was over. There seems to be a generation of film makers now (Richard Linklater, Cameron Crowe) that are redefining the qualities that can make someone ""cool,"" and their movies are full of welcome messages. Cool isn't about how you look or dress or act. Cool's a state of mind, man. Peace out.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","As someone who will soon be an elementary school teacher, there were parts of this movie that really tested the boundaries of my ability to suspend my disbelief enough to sympathize with Jack Black's Dewey. Many times I thought he deserved to be locked up, but of course it's a comedy, so in the end he wins over the hearts of the stereotypical hard-ass parents and generally applauded as a great guy, despite breaking nearly every regulation in the book and more than a couple laws.<br/><br/>With all that said, in the end it was a fun movie.

","Jack Black plays a rock musician that gets kicked out of his band prior to the big battle of the bands contest. Unable to hold a job, Jack is pressured to pay up or get out by his best friends wife (Jack rents a room from them). Other than his music, Jack has no ambition towards work until he happens to answer the phone from his friend. It seems a school needs a substitute teacher and will pay well for Jack friend's services. Jack pretends to be his friend and goes to the school posing as his friend.<br/><br/>The school happens to be a very upscale and exclusive private school. What happens the rest of the movie is totally unrealistic, but entertaining nonetheless. Jack is assigned a class and he sits in the front of the class being totally obnoxious with the kids and teaching nothing. By chance he happens upon a few of the kids in music class and realizes that they have talent. He cooks up the idea that he will be able to teach the kids how to play rock music and then go to the battle of the bands contest with the class.<br/><br/>If you can dismiss how such a prominent school doesn't verify the credentials of its faculty (they don't ask for a driver's license, social security card, etc. that jobs are required to hire you), can't hear the loud music blaring down the halls, uncaring parents, etc., then the movie itself is highly entertaining."

","This movie made quite an impression on me, seeing it for the first time made me appreciate that modern film can actually have an impact like the old classics although its the kind you would least expect it from. The film has a good balance throughout and the plot is nice and tight, i certainly didn't expect to be impressed by JB but i was amazed at how well he traveled through it, he made me laugh so much probably unaware by how much he appeals to British humour. Beneath the silliness of this picture (which really works btw) you get the feel good factor but their not trying to give you it if you know what i mean. All of the child actors in this film are also great, non seem out of place or uninvolved like you often see in other movies each child and their personality gives something to it. Everyone seems to revolve around Dewey although being daft and outgoing you know he has an element of seriousness but he'll never show you, watching the behind the scenes bit on the DVD <br/><br/>JB seems to be a lot like he is in the movie in real life, he is referred to as being silly and he is but it works there a few scenes that made me think wow this guy can really act particularly the scene where the camera is panning away from him as he describes his song to the kids he really impressive i was really glued to the screen here, not many actors could hold a shot for this long without the camera cutting away to someone else.All in all this is a very good Film and one of the best DVD's I've ever bought and i believe the people i went to watch it with at the cinema would say the same, you know you've seen a good one when your walking out still chuckling about it ;)."

On the back of this film though, I'm not sure I want to rent anything else with Mr Black in it, I have to say. But having said that, he is a good actor in everything he does in this movie.<br/><br/>Onto the film itself. What a refreshing change that the kids play their own instruments as opposed to dubbing something professional over the top of it later. The final concert was good as well, as was the song that went ""so get off your ath/let's do some math"". I thought the comment about MTV was quite apt really and very true to boot - I personally think MTV has contributed to the general decline of decent music in recent years but that's another topic.<br/><br/>The film follows the same pattern of copious other films, in which somebody gets into a situation which they're not qualified for, it takes weeks and a third party tip-off before anybody notices and is then usually followed by moping about and a comeback. Yep, School of Rock to a T.<br/><br/>Anybody who's ever seen movies such as The Sandlot Kids, Little Rascals and other similar types of movies will know that they put together a group of kids who have the ability to on screen be both annoying on their own and in their respective groups. School of Rock though greets you with a group of kids who are actually likable on screen, good chemistry and at least look as if they know what they're doing even though they were all chosen on the back of musical ability as opposed to acting ability.<br/><br/>Worth a rental I reckon, if Jack Black's style is your sort of thing and/or you like Led Zepplin, AC/DC, that sort of music."

","OK, here it goes: I just been on a one month vacation in Thailand and saw many movies sitting in small cafes/ bar where they show different movies all nigh long using a DVD machine. One of those movies was 'school of rocks' starring Jack Black. I really enjoyed the movie being a rock fan myself and thought that Mr. Black done a great job taking a whole movie on his brilliant comic shoulders. Then as it happens in Thailand I saw this movie again a couple of days after the first time and then it struck me: Jack Black is or his character for that matter is actually Malcolm McDowell or his character from Kubrick's 'clock work orange' Alexander de large. Everything from shooting angles of black face to his voice up to a very distinctive walk in the class of school of rocks is a tribute to McDowell unforgettable roll. When I mention it to a guy sitting next to me he smiled and probably thought that I had too many Banana shakes (very popular in Thailand) and I thought that maby it's probably it's just in my mind. Well it's not. Now I'm back home (alive and well) I turned to 'google' to see if there is any connection between the two and to my surprise I found that yes there is since Black played in a movie called Orange county which had the following Tag line :being the adventures of a young man whose interests are rape Ultra violence and getting in to Stanfordwell the pic that came along is here: well I guess that I was right after all..Black has decided, as a private joke, to relive the ultimate evil character of all times in a non rated film for children. He managed with great talent to combine the energy of Alexander de large into a grown up Angus Young fan and for that my hat goes down for him. I'm sure that if you look at that movie once more with that in mind yours will too."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>There's always films out there which run along the same plot of a loser who turns a child (or loads of children's) life around. It's hardly the most unique of ideas, and yet in ""The School of Rock"", Jack Black manages to give us a fun, easy going film, with an absolutely stunning soundtrack.<br/><br/>In his first decent lead performance (ignoring 2001's awful ""Shallow Hal""), Black plays Dewey Finn. Finn is a no-hoper who spends all his time playing rock rather than getting a job. His best friend and flatmate has cut his hair and stopped being a goth. This friend Ned (writer of the film and Black's old friend Mike White) has settled down with bitchy Patty (Sarah Silverman) and is now a substitute teacher. One day, Finn receives a phone call for Ned and in a moment of weakness, he pretends to be his friend to earn some money. Lazing around, Finn is useless until he hears the children playing in a music class. Inspired, he leads them through the basics of rock and teaches them to shake the world.<br/><br/>Simply put, without Jack Black, this film would be abysmal. At the same time though, since White actually wrote the film FOR Black, without him it wouldn't have been made. It's a pure Jack Black driven comedy and he is wonderful in it. Running around and being so energetic that it's a wonder he survived, Black is superb as the guitarist who wants to pass on the genius of past masters to a younger generation. Leading a team of specifically recruited musical children, Black spends the majority of the film jamming and listening to such legends as AC/DC, Black Sabbath and the god-like Led Zeppelin.<br/><br/>Aside from Black's extreme performance and the absolutely breathtaking soundtrack, the film's young cast are also superb, demonstrating musical abilities which a lot of people would die for (myself included). Joey Gaydos Junior as Zach is in particular amazing and whilst maybe still slightly too young, in not that long he could be the lead guitarist for yet another amazing Detroit band.<br/><br/>Finally it's possibly worth praising Richard Linklater for doing a good job as director. Whilst often focusing on short stories and more indie films (his following film being 2004's ""Before Sunset""), Linklater has done a superb job allowing Black to run riot and simply record it.<br/><br/>To sum the film up, it's not perfect, but it was never going to be. It's a pure Jack Black vehicle, but with a jaw dropping soundtrack and some amazing musical talent by Black's young supporting cast, the film is brilliant. Watch and enjoy."

","What looks like a potentially horrible comedy actually is quite a funny and clever excursion into music comedy, even with the often hard-to-take Jack Black in the lead. <br/><br/>Black of course plays a fake sub teacher at a sophisticated elementary school where he manages to teach the kids all about rock and roll, and uses them to form a band to compete with in a local battle of the bands. He even shows film clips (notably Keith Moon) and shows still pics (notably The Ramones), and teaches the kids attitude, stance and ""sticking it to the man.""<br/><br/>Of course this is all very much completely unbelievable but it is a film and a comedy, so suspending belief for a while definitely helps. It's a little odd seeing 10 year-olds sing AC/DC at the end and wear a Ramones shirt for instance, but it's all good. The Ramones even get a song in the film, so you can't beat that.<br/><br/>Black is really funny especially when he spurts out cliches left and right like ""let's rock"" and such, even making the kids pray ""to the God of Rock."" One odd thing is that while many classic rock bands are mentioned and/or acknowledged (The Who, The Ramones, Sex Pistols, AC/Dc, Led Zep, etc) there is no mention of either The Beatles or KISS. But someone is on the ball seeing ""Buzzcocks"" on the ""punk"" list on the blackboard.<br/><br/>Definitely a fun comedy and probably the only movie I have ever seen Jack Black in that I didn't get tired of him really fast. Not that he's not good in general, he is, but he is definitely not for everyone, myself very much included. But he's really good in this though. And if you like the ""librarian"" type of woman, as I certainly do, the school principal was very hot."

","Basic story: Dewey-Jack Black is in desperate need of cash so when his substitute teacher friend is offered some work at a prestigious school, he pretends to be him to get some money. Unsurprisingly he has no idea of what to do with the children, used to a top class education. On day two as their teacher he makes up a project to do with them called, ROCK BAND! This is where the fun begins as we see them learning rocking Music all day. He has them convinced it is a top project when really he wants to win Â£20,000 at battle of the bands. They perform a rockin' show at battle of the bands thus earning the respect of the audience and their stuffy parents who were insisting on a classical music upbringing. I liked this film very much, enjoying watching the children's progress as he helps them rock out, and earns their respect. I thought the children made better rockers than classical players especially when dressed and styled by that boy with the suspiciously high voice. The character Tamika had an amazing voice, just made for soulful singing. Basically, what a film. A must see for any rock fans, featuring classic rock tunes and rockin' kids. See it now!"

So what!! The way it was done worked brilliantly - the young rockers really could rock!! I think some people objected to the MATERIAL of the script rather than the quality of the film - ie it was ludicrous that rich school kids would be hijacked to play in a battle of the bands or that the school principal was pictured getting a bit drunk. Oh take your propaganda elsewhere!!<br/><br/>The film captures the spirit of rock 'n roll and that is no mean feat - just witness the appalling 'Garage Days' and cheesy pop song. Probably the best aspect of School of Rock was how real the performance scenes were. Yes the band really played but the crowd reaction and atmosphere were pretty authentic for a staged film performance. For lovers of rock music, it was like we were transported to the gig - we really felt for the music and performers because we remember what it was like to first pick up an instrument and totally rock out.

","Despite pretty strong performances from Jack Black and Joan Cusack and the kids in Black's class, this movie was very disappointing. It was extremely predictable. It tended to labor on near the end and a person is left wishing they would just get to the ""Battle of the Bands"" already. (How many movies have had these Battle of the Bands?)This movie is filled with just about every cookie-cutter character that movies of this sort could have; the unconventional teacher, the talented kid being stifled by his oppressive father, the oppressive father, the uptight principal with the wild-child inside etc. It's too bad with such a talented cast, they couldn't have come up with a better plot."

","... you really have to be willing to take this movie on its own terms:  as a ""pure"" vehicle for the over-the-top antics of Jack Black.  This guy is a solar system unto himself, really.  <br/><br/>Is it believable?  No way, not even close.  But--and this is its point--who cares?  <br/><br/>In its purest terms, then, this movie should be thought of as a scenario where some whacky drunken, crazy rock-and-roller who has and probably will never grow up somehow gets a bizarre opportunity to transfer his wild, out-of-control enthusiasm for his muse to transfer to the kids in a stuck-up elitist boarding school.  Likely to happen?  Uh-uh.  The story is more like the playing out of two guys drinking on a Friday night saying, ""Hey, what if...?"" or ""Wouldn't it be funny if...?"" Then elevator-pitching the story to some half-baked Hollywood types the next Monday who think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.<br/><br/>So, given the bizarre underpinnings and lack of believability of the scenario, we still have to consider this film on its own merits.  Jack Black is funny, wild, weird, even, I'd argue, strangely satanic.  Maybe I'm stretching, but don't ya think?  Anyway, he is the only character that is truly believable in the movie, though he is, like the ""new Chris Farley,"" completely over the top.  I mean, he is SO enthusiastic and SO wild and SO out of control on-screen sometimes you think -- where did this guy come from?  His facial expressions are priceless - reminds me of John Belushi. Let's hope he doesn't end up like Belushi and Farley. <br/><br/>The kids are believable within the confines of the relative unbelievability of the scenario itself.  They seem strangely forlorn about being given a free educational ride by their teacher though.  I don't get it--kids want an education?  Ack!<br/><br/>I would take this movie very lightly -- it's just fun and funny and not at all serious nor is it supposed to be.  Joan Cusack is very, very good as the school principal and I love it when she cuts loose--ever since ""Working Girl"" she has been one of the most underutilized and unrecognized character actresses of her time.  Still, Jack Black is the center of the hurricane--and the hurricane itself.  I think his huge persona might be ""pricing"" him (in a non-literal sense) out of the business.  How can the guy even fit on the screen with anyone else, his persona and charisma is so huge.  Well, I guess he makes it work with ""Shallow Hal"" and when he has to play opposite someone, but I tell you it's tough because he's the center of attention."

","The best part about ""School of Rock"" is that it hits home when it spoofs metal/rock fans, which is also what makes it funny.  I remember my own days in high school and early college when I thought certain rock bands were ""it"".  I wasn't hard-core like Jack Black's character in the movie, but I did have some friends who were, and this is exactly how they were (or still are).  To them, ""ROCK is life!""  It's the only thing that really matters, and it's the coolest thing since...well, EVER!!  Without it they'd have no purpose in life.  Whether or not that's a good thing, or if it's sad or whatever, isn't the point.  The point is that this is exactly how many metal-heads are!<br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie isn't funny all the way through; it's mostly just amusing, cliched, or sort-of entertaining, but there are a few parts that made me laugh so hard for minutes at a time that I was crying and could hardly breathe!  It was worth watching, for sure.  One of the best parts (SPOILER WARNING...) is where he demonstrates how important it is for a rock guitarist to have ""an awesome stance"".  Another is when he shows his students actual video clips of Hendrix, Townshend, and others going berserk on stage, implying that this is the way a cool guitarist should be.  Another funny part is where he tells three innocent little girls that, ""uh, you can be groupies"", as they are assigned parts in the class's new Band.  He essentially tells them that their role is to worship the Band.  I almost died laughing! Yes, such things are a suggestive sexually, but it wasn't inappropriate or tasteless and it wasn't meant to be suggestive to these particular girls; only that it's the way it is.  Furthermore, it does fit right in with the whole ""rock"" mentality, and hence fits right in with this movie.<br/><br/>

","One of the surprise movies of last year in the States, finally makes its way to British shores and I have to say that the praise heaped upon it, and particularly Jack Black is more than warranted. The film is the sort of `loser learning the error of his ways and becoming a winner' type of movie we have seen many times before but not in a long time has a film with the predictable formula been as good. This film has been compared to Sister Act 2, because the subject matter is so similar. A musician poses as a teacher and teaches their class the joys of music and then takes their pupils to compete for a musical prize. While Sister Act 2 was attempting to be more meaningful and speaking more about society (while not particularly succeeding), School Of Rock is more pure entertainment and more exuberant. It in many ways inverts what Sister Act 2 did. While Whoopi Goldbergs character attempts to bring her pupils together and on the straight and narrow by making them into a choir, Jack Black leads his kids astray with rock. School Of Rock it must be said is infinitely more entertaining.<br/><br/>
The film follows rock enthusiast Dewey, a Bum who dreams of being as big as the likes of his idols Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. He falls out with his band because he embarrasses them by taking things too far and generally not being as good as he thinks he his. When his former band are preparing to enter a battle of the bands, Dewey is attempting to form a new band because his ultimate goal is to win this battle of the bands. At the same time his flatmates girlfriend is annoyed that Dewey never pays Ned (his flatmate) any respect and owes him over 2000 dollars in back rent. Dewey now needs some cash and so needs a job. When the principal of a posh private school (Joan Cusack) calls for Ned (a temp teacher) to replace an injured teacher, Dewey pretends to be Ned and takes the job as an easy two weeks to make a lot of money. Dewey has no intention of doing any work with the pupils and is quite content to give them a two week recess. That is until he hears them in their music class and sees his opportunity to mould them into his own rock band and enter them in this battle of the bands under the pre-text that they are in a school competition. Anyway the plot is simple enough and while we know what will happen you just have to sit back and love the film.<br/><br/>Jack Black is a one man army here. The film entertains at the level it does for two key reasons: Jack Black and the brilliant soundtrack. Jack Black is superb. His exuberant, screeching, gyrating and facially contorting performance is non-stop entertainment. He is superb. I'm a fan of Jack Black, he is always great value and a scene stealer in his supporting parts but as yet I wasn't convinced he could lead a film. Shallow Hal he was funny but wasn't as rampart through 90 minutes and add to that a disappointing showing from the Farrelly Brothers. Here however Black takes his big step to comedy A-list. While the likes of Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin seem to be dying painfully unfunny deaths in tripe, the likes of Black, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson are on the rise. Ample replacements for some legends indeed. The rest of the cast are good. The kids can act and to give the film even more charm they can actually play their instruments and sing. Also Joan Cusack is always good and once again she shines too. <br/><br/>Finally I'll mention the soundtrack again. There wasn't a single song I didn't like. You have classic rock tunes from AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton and more. There are also some great original songs too including the centre piece song School Of Rock. Jack Black also writes several of the songs and also sings on them. The best way to describe this film would be: It Rocks!! ****"

It'd be cool to get Freddie and Zach (well, the actors anyway, I can't think of their names) to be in my band cause they actually did play their instruments.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a perfect 10, but there were too many plotholes and it is unrealistic, so I give it 8/10.<br/><br/>""It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll."" - AC/DC"
"kintopf432","Null","0","0","15 March 2004"," Very likable
","2003 was a year of likable rather than great movies, and 'The School of Rock' might be the most likable of them all. The concept plays almost like a remake of 'Sister Act,' with Jack Black's die-hard rock reactionary in place of Whoopi Goldberg's R&B lounge act, and cute li'l schoolkids in place of cute li'l nuns. It's really no more complex than that, but its good nature and genuine heart make it easy enough to swallow. Plus, it's got some terrific performances. Jack Black provides all the inspired 'Spinal Tap'-esquire silliness we expect (the improvised version of 'In the End of Time' before the class is just one blindingly good example), but his best moments actually are those in which we see his instinctive compassion for the kids he works with. The character, though simple, is a nice archetype: the gifted loser who finally manages to contribute something brilliant to the world, if not in the way he expected. If there's a touch of mad genius in his performance, it's matched by Joan Cusack, who always improves just about anything she's in--for a special treat, pay close attention to all the marvelous things she does with her hands here. And the children themselves are very well cast, with the band principals, Miranda Cosgrove, and Maryam Hassan perhaps standing out. When the end comes, we might feel momentarily disappointed at how routine it actually all was, but then we'll remember the individual moments and smile. Recommended. 8 out of 10."

","School of Rock (2003) Jack Black, Mike White, Joan Cusack, Sarah Silverman, Joey Gaydos, Miranda Cosgrove, Kevin Clark, Rebecca Julia Brown, Robert Tsai, D: Richard Linklater. Irresponsible, down-on-his-luck ne'er-do-well, who can't pay half of the rent for his roommate's apartment, gets kicked out of his band. For money, he takes over his buddy's job as a substitute teacher for a classroom of stuffy 10-year-olds at a prep school, principally run by tight-wound Cusack. He loosens the kids' spirits and educates their minds with the history of rock to get them ready for a Battle of the Bands competition. If the story isn't completely original, Black sure is; here, he's a frivolous, quick-witted, and likable guy and delivers the laughs. Cheerful and invigorating family comedy that's also sweet, and you will definitely find affection for rock! Running Time: 108 minutes and rated PG-13 for some rude humor and drug references. ***"

","The movie is awesome.The character of Dewey Finn (Jack Black)is made in the way to present all those people who love rock music, but are not understood by their friends, because they have their unique way of dedicating to that music. Dewey gets a chance to shows that he knows the history of rock music and all the features, and he findes way to present all he knows. Also he courages one class to show what they know, and to express their love to the music to the others. The competition is great, and also the last reactions of the parents. And finally his friend Ned understands that he also loves rock music and teaches little children to play guitar. The best thing done is that all the instrument players are professionals.

And they also made up some real good songs in it. What I liked about the end is that they made is you want to watch the ending because they are still in the movie but it's the end credits.

","I've been a fan of Jack Black for years, but I was not impressed with any of his film roles until High Fidelity.  Then I saw School of Rock and it was the perfect movie for him.  Black uses his amazing and untouchable facial expressions and body language to express the passion for music that only few understand while also showing an unbelievable gift for physical humor. His vocal control is also ridiculously impressive; his range and his ability to be so versatile with his voice is incredible and obviously shows some real talent.  Some might mistake this movie for being predictable, but in my opinion, even if you think so, in doesn't matter due to the amazing comedy and message.  This is one of the first mainstream movies I have seen that has shown kids/teenagers the true message of music instead of pandering to the bubblegum Brittany Spears pop that has seemed to replace the real meaning of music.  In a time where kids are growing up thinking great music can be written by different people than who it is performed by, this movie shows what it really means to be passionate about such an art form.  Look out for many references to ""old"" bands such as Zepplin, the Who, AC/DC, Blondie, Stevie Nicks, Ramones...not only audible references but clothes and physical movements as well.  The kids in the movie also all rock at their instrument and one of the girls has an absolutely amazing voice...all talented kids! This is a great movie for any music lover and anyone who loves Jack Black's genius comedic style. Also, Joan Cusack does an amazing job! One of my favorite movies of the year..."

","I thought this movie was going to be a comedy, but it turned into something much more.  Jack Black as pretty much everybody associates him as being a doofus, but in this movie Jack plays a different sort of character, a character that actually has feelings.  In the beginning of the movie Jack Black plays kind of a doofus, the doofus that we all know and love him for, but when his friend/roommate get's a call to be a substitute, Jack pretends he's his friend, just to make some cash.  I love Jack's voice, it's very rock and rollish.  I like how the soundtrack combines a bunch of artists who defined rock and roll, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The Who ect.  Jack shows us another side to his wild and crazy personality, who knew that Jack could play a character that had some brains?  The kids in the movie were excellent, I couldn't beleive how well they played for 10 yr. olds.  I was a pretty big Jack Black fan before I saw the movie, and am even a bigger fan since seeing that.  I can't wait to see Jack in another movie.

It's about an aging rock star wanabee, called Dewey Finn, fired by his band he is left poor and jobless. A golden opportunity approaches, a job as a substitute teacher at a rich kids school. He makes his class into a rock band and the rest is classic.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely perfect, the kids are great and are some of the most talented kid actors I've ever seen. However, the stand-out performer is Jack Black (as Dewey Finn), this man is the top comedy actor in the U.S at the moment. His performance is energy packed, and that energy spreads through the audience in the form of laughter.<br/><br/>This may not be an award winner, this is down to the fact that it doesn't take its self seriously, this is to the films credit though.

Despite the fact that the plot was very easy to follow, and a lot of the devices used can be seen a mile off, this film is still amazing in what it tries to portray.<br/><br/>As someone else who commented on here said, it is a great look into the mind of a true rocker :) It's also a really good feel good story, and I'm not sure why people feel that this sort of thing doesn't deserve to make it to the cinemas, as this is what cinema is about to most people - going out for a night and having a damn good time, and coming out of the place with a big old silly grin on your face.<br/><br/>Jack Black, as always, makes the film, and with his Tenacious D background (didn't see Kyle in it anywhere.. Whats going on?!) his character really worked well I feel. And a lot of the stuff going on may well have been contrived, but if you exercise a bit of suspension of disbelief then it's almost like all the events in the film were 'possible' broadly speaking, the band that won the battle giving away the encore is all plausible in a way.. At least it worked in my head :)<br/><br/>All in all it may have been done before, but that doesn't mean it can't be done well - look at the Magnificent 7."

","So very pleasing to see a movie exhibiting a cheery feel-good plot void of sex and gore. Jack Black has always been a prime candidate for a love/hate response and for those of you who usually sway towards the latter, you should probably stand well back. For the rest of us though Black shines in a role that permits him to release some excess energy as the high-octane character with a passion for rock music. The comedy side to Mr. Black never seems forced or even planned in TSOR so be wary that you don't find yourself with a permanently fixated smile that might begin to ache somewhat. Don't be duped into thinking that this is a laugh-a-minute picture, because that isn't the case, but it will go some length to brightening your day. An American feel-good classic minus the typical overdose of sentimentality.<br/><br/>PJW"

","Check it out.<br/><br/>Heart. Rock. Soul. Passion.  If you're low on inspiration this February (the longest month of the year), check out Jack Black's `School of Rock.'  A hard-core, stage-diving rocker lands in a sterile prep school and manages to light a fire in his students and moviegoers alike.  This film will leave you feeling renewed and ready to rock.<br/><br/>The characters are well-drawn ranging from the slovenly, beer-drinking Black himself to his timid roommate and his roommate's angry and emasculating girlfriend. An uptight, female school principal with a long-buried free spirit rounds out the main adult cast.  But it's the students themselves and their heartfelt chemistry with Black that sends this show solidly into the `To Sir with Love'  and `Stand and Deliver' category.<br/><br/>Black deftly channels the kids' `smarts' into soulfulness by being fully himself.  His passion for rock music and his authenticity offer a lesson we can all embrace: Don't check your passion at life's door. The best gift you can give the world is to be ALL there! His scenes with a young, Aretha-like teenage singer suffering from stage fright are worth the price of admission alone.  Thanks and kudos to Jack Black for `The School of Rock.' With its Harold Hill `Music Man' overtones, it has just the right recipe to feed your soul this winter!"

","Most Jack Black movies crack me up.  I thought Saving Silverman was hilarious, and Orange County was a funny, upbeat movie.  While Jack Black may not be the best actor out there, or really had to step too far out of his range in The School of Rock, he is an extremely good fit in this movie. While I don't think this movie was as laugh-out-loud hilarious as Saving Silverman, School of Rock definitely had some very funny moments.  Jack Black's mannerisms and comedic timing are fun to watch in about any movie (except Shallow Hal.  I could have avoided that.)<br/><br/>The kids in the movie also showed some real talent.  Whoever decided to hire kids that are musically talented rather than `professional actors' deserves a hearty pat on the back.  The kids were tremendous, and the final concert scene was absolutely perfect.  The chemistry between the kids and Jack Black was great too as you can tell this movie must have been a lot of fun for everyone to make.<br/><br/>The School of Rock does something kind of rare by being a family film with an edge and even some heart (which I don't think Jack Black will ever readily admit).  Teachers, particularly music teachers, music fans, and just movie fans altogether should enjoy this movie.  I think it will be a comedy classic for many people out there.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)"

I'm so friggin' in love with this flick now! Friggin' loved it!!!!!<br/><br/>In summary, this simultaneously acerbic yet uncloyingly feel good one man show deserves all these following superlatives and then some; most obviously) brilliantly acted(Black's da man), ireverently tongue-in-cheek, rip roaringly LOL, exceedingly reverential (to Rock Music), intelligently scripted, wildly energetic (both musically and cinematically), emotionally grounded, warm and surprisingly generous....<br/><br/>Jack Black is now in my shortlist for best male performance of 2003. His spot-on comic timing straddles easily between physical slapstick and razor sharp witticism. In fact, that acidic tongue of his unleashed so many devilicious one liners, reconstructive gut surgeries may be in order. What's more, when the occasion called for it, Black the funny man is also capable of emoting warmth and genuine empathy for the people within his sphere of greatness. This performance was so f***in' tour de force, you really have to see it to believe it. And guess what, THIS MAN CAN SING!!!! O, Praise the lord for this man of jaw dropping wonders!<br/><br/>In an ideal world, JB and this great film will have a berth reserved, come the Oscar announcement (in an ideal world, that is). But seriously, School of Rock solicited a strong response from me. For it also paid glorious tribute (albeit a movie escaping one) to the enlightened state of hardcore geekdom. It emphatically presents this notion, that regardless of one geek's object/ subject of desire (in this case, rock and roll), this positive message of embracing one's passion should be unabashedly celebrated.<br/><br/>That's it, I am so won over now. For its sentience of geek psychology is intuitive and all encompassing. In fact, it can just as easily be transposed onto any other geeky pursuits, however trivial its deemed by cynics. This exuberantly concocted gem has completely exceeded my wildest expectations.<br/><br/>My Verdict:<br/><br/>School of Rock is one of the best commercial films to dot the local cinemas this quarter (and will easily rank amongst my favourites this entire calendar year). Folks, you've got nothing to lose. Trust the hype. GO SEE SCHOOL OF ROCK!!!!!"

","Overall, I loved this movie. Some parts were pretty, um, unbelievable, for lack of a better word at the moment. Like, Jack Black posing as Mr. Sneebly. I honestly think that would NOT go over in real life, but hey, it worked on the silver screen. The music in this movie was awesome, and the students were talented actors and musicians.<br/><br/>Jack Black overacts sometimes, but for the most part he is pretty good. I got a case of the giggles when I saw his ""Gettin' lucky in Kentucky"" shirt. He had a lot of great lines and I think he was cast perfectly for the part.<br/><br/>This is one of few movies I've actually sat through the credits at the end.

","Jack Black owns this movie like no other actor has ever owned a movie. Everything he does, every choice he makes is perfect.  And hilarious.  If the Academy gave out Oscars for great performances as opposed to just performances in which an actor has to emote or pretend to be disabled or die or all three combined, Jack Black would be a shoo-in.

","It is rare you find a film that features one central character as the centre of almost every single scene, and shot for that matter that can hold your attention for any length of time...<br/><br/>Jack Black manages to stun the audience with a non-stop parade of over the top, almost ridiculous antics that (believe me or not) are actually very enjoyable and extremely funny! He boarders on falling flat on his face so many times in the movie, but he manages to keep it going with a sense of confidence that forces a laugh when it would otherwise have scored a chorus of moans. This film is probably a fine example of what energy and confidence can do for a performance.<br/><br/>It ain't all about Black however, the support cast of extremely taltented and young musicians are amazing, this film will certainly do wonders if any of them wish to explore a career in the music industry. The draw back is they aren't great actors, but they grace the screen with an honesty and some brutal raw talent that means you can't ignore them. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic and it really ain't worth talking about... Needless to say it is totally unbelievable and would in reality be very dangerous territory for anyone to explore. But that ain't the point, because the plot don't really matter! If anything this film succeeds in suspending your disbelief and allows you to be caught in the moment. A Jack Black moment yes, but a moment none the less.<br/><br/>For Black fans this is his best film ever, for comedy fans this is definately worth the price and for the rest... Well if you hate black, you still might like this film - A must see!"

Also, the arguement that Jack Black doesn't do the part well is just incorrect, as Mike White wrote the part explicitly for him (I asked him personally). Anyway, I loved the movie as it was funny and entertaining. I recommend it to fans of Jack Black, Mike White (writer of Orange County, Freaks & Geeks, and other stuff), and fans of music like Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Deep Purple and Jimi Hendrix."

"WalterFrith","Null","0","0","1 November 2003"," A great re-introduction of history.
","This film is a miracle.  It introduces today's young people to an older generation of music that mattered.  Today's music (if you can call it that) is based largely on marketing and not talent.  The criminal element is given too much opportunity and exposure and shouldn't even be given the time of day.  A lot of today's acts lip-synch at concerts, dress up in sexy tight clothing (or wear very little clothing) and a lot of the female artists look like strippers instead of pop stars.  Classic rock's style of music sold itself with very little promotion because it was so good. <br/><br/>
Jack Black plays a man who masquerades as a substitute teacher and introduces his 5th graders to rock and roll from the likes of such immortals as Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, The Doors and The Who.  The kids respond very well and learn that not only is the music important but that it's fun to learn about.<br/><br/>Black learns a lot about himself in the process and turns his meaningless life around while he helps educate a group of kids in the process.  Director Richard Linklater has a very steady approach to this film, knows when to inject humour and knows when to keep the tone serious.  It's a very well developed film and I honestly think Jack Black could get an Oscar nomination for this film because his character is honest, passionate and totally convincing.  And the academy loves good teacher performances.  A gem of a film!!  <br/><br/>And where did Linklater get the idea of injecting 1988's 'Bonzo Goes to Bitburg' by the Ramones halfway through the film as a montage to the film's progress in the first act?  That song is a little known buried treasure that was not a top 40 hit but is known among people who love the depth of the music industry.  What a great move!!"

","""The School of Rock"" is a great movie for all ages!  Jack Black stars as failed rock and roller Dewey Finn, who finds a chance to get rocking again by posing as a teacher, and forming a band out of his most talented students.  What Dewey lacks in musical talent, he more than makes up for with enthusiasm and attitude.  Black is electrifying in his performance, with the right demonic facial expressions and energy for rock music.  The kids, who are all actual musical students, are very talented.  And Joan Cusack provides a classic moment when she sings along to ""Edge of Seventeen.""  Anyone who sees this movie will learn what rock music was before the proliferation of the soft pop music so prevalent today.

What is positive about the film on both school and rock n' roll is that the film shows respect to both sides. With school, Jack Black doesn't hate it, he respects it; but he uses the metaphor ""the man"" to prove that with there are some things in society that can't be beaten.  With music, on the other hand, it is so cool to hear rock music instead of rap and disco and all that sissy stuff."

I could give a laundry list of names that could have been mentioned.  But I digress.<br/><br/>As for the plot, *POSSIBLE SPOILER* let's just say that it is highly unlikely that someone of Dewey's caliber is going to land a sub's job at an expensive private school without an extensive background check.  And why aren't these kid's parents wondering about their homework in math and English and such?  And NO ONE in that school could hear a set of drums being played?

You don't have to be a musician or even a fan of rock music to get off on this film, which, at its heart, is about finding yourself and remaining true to that self against all the odds, and the coolest thing about the movie is how White's script never gets preachy or heavy-handed but the message is there, grinning at us between the lines of every heart-felt frame."

","THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is a surprise and a half. Dewey Finn (the hilarious Jack Black) is an out of work rocker who can't pay the rent and has just been thrown out of his own band. He pretends to be his friend Ned (Mike White) and becomes a substitute teacher at the prestigous Horace Green elementary school. At first, he ignores them. Then he realizes their music potential. So, he starts up a band featuring his students. Along the way, he dodges the watchful eye of Horace Green's principal Ms. Mullens (Joan Cusack) and teaches the kids self esteem. It all climaxes when the students play at the local Battle of the Bands contest and play a very catchy tune called 'SCHOOL OF ROCK'. This movie is adorable times two. The kids are very charming. Each and every one of them. And fine actors to boot. Without being cutsy pie. Jack Black is now a bonafide comedy star. His funny actions and motions are very enjoyable to watch. And the music! It's awesome. The song they play at the end is kick ass! The movie has very little if nothing wrong with it at all. It's hilarious, fun, and also tugs at the heartstrings a bit. The director Richard Linklater was an odd choice, because his movies are often obscure independent films. A family film isn't exactly what you'd expect from him. But he DOES know comedy. He manages not to make another gross or boring kid's film. It's not a family film, as much as it is a film that everyone can enjoy. Not one person I saw this movie with was bored and mostly all of them just plain loved it. As did I. This is the funniest comedy all year. And probably of the last 5 years.

","""The School Of Rock"" is the movie I have been waiting to see for a long, long time. After years of empty, unimaginative music consistently topping the charts, I am thrilled that now there's a movie devoted to that music that has moved me like none other ever since I was a little kid...ROCK. Just in those 4 letters lies the whole truth to my universe. Sure, I listen to lots of other kinds of music (everything from blues to techno) but, as Jack Black might say, I will always return to rocking. And will this movie turn all today's kids who are brainwashed by Christina Aguilera and P. Diddy into cool rocking kids? Probably not. But definitely some. <br/><br/>Jack Black, the wild-eyed madman who is one-half of the brilliant satirical rock band Tenacious D stars as Dewey Finn, a hotshot lead guitarist who is booted from his band for being an embarrassment, and is right on the edge of being kicked out of his apartment by his roommate, Ned (Mike White, who also wrote the script). <br/><br/>When Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), the principal of an expensive prep school, calls to offer a job to Ned (who is a substitute teacher), Dewey jumps at the opportunity to earn some money and accepts the job, posing as Ned. <br/><br/>Dewey doesn't have much to teach the room of little middle-school kids he is faced with, but when he finds out that they are experienced musicians, he decides to form them into a rock band. It will take some work though, because these kids don't know Led Zeppelin from Liza Minelli.<br/><br/>
Of course you can see exactly where this is going, but in a movie like this, its predictability actually makes it MORE entertaining, because if the kids didn't play their hearts out at the Battle Of The Bands and if the movie ended unhappily, that would suck and you know it. <br/><br/>His style may not be to everyone's taste, but to me, Jack Black is a comic genius. Every yell, curve of his eyebrows, and spastic motion of his body is pure comedy heaven. And the kids are great too; smart, charismatic and funny, especially Joey Gaydos, who is an amazing guitarist (and he's 10!) and Robert Tsai as the shy keyboardist. This is a great movie, one of the best of the year, so go. And besides, is there anything cooler that a training montage set to the Ramones' ""My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)""? Nope, I don't think so."

","Synopsis Spoiler! Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a depressed rock musician that was kicked out of his own band.  Dewey is sharing an apartment with an old band member, Ned Schneebly (Mike White), who is now a substitute teacher. Dewey is 4 months behind in his share of the rent, and Ned is about to kick him out.  Needing money and a job, Dewey answers a phone call for Ned, and then he pretends to be Ned Schneebly. Dewey accepts a job as a 5th grade substitute teacher at a snobbish private school.  Dewey forms a rock band with the kids in his class in an effort to win the $10,000 prize money offered by a local band contest.  He must do this in secret so that the school principal (Joan Cusack) and the kid's parents know nothing of his plan.  If Dewey can win the battle of the bands competition, it will solve his financial problems, and put him back in rock.  Jack Black was perfect for this part.  The kids as always stole the show, especially, Zach (Joey Gaydos), who is a guitar prodigy, and Freddy (Kevin Clark), who beats a mean drum.  (Paramount, Run time 1:48, Rating PG-13) 6/10"

I have seen other rock and roll films like Rock and roll High School and all them others, and I would have to admit School of Rock was the best out of them all!  It was amazing how a guy that got fired from his own band could impersonate his roommate and use his name to make a comeback and substitute 5th graders, find out their talents, and use them in a band, so he could make a rock and roll comeback by competing in the Battle of the Bands!  I would have to recommend people seeing this if their dream is to play rock and roll!  Thank you!"

","Get ready for one of the most biased reviews you'll read today. Because I gotta be honest with you: I love Jack Black. You hear me Jack? I love you. Jack Black is not only one of the most talented entertainers in the world today, but he seems to be one of tomorrow's finest comedic acting stars. He carries with him a seemingly inexhaustible supply of physical comedy mixed with precision comic timing. His style, while one dimensional and unchanged since High Fidelity and even The Cable Guy (that's right, even while playing a very minor character, he still commanded a hilarious screen presence) will never get old, even if he plays essentially the same character in every film.<br/><br/>School of Rock was a field day for Black. It's obvious in every frame that he had as much fun shooting this movie as we did watching it. Director Richard Linklater (responsible for the classic Dazed and Confused and the enigmatic Waking Life) probably had one of the easiest tasks in the world directing Jack Black as a rock-obsessed Dewey Finn who spends the whole movie rocking out and then rocking out some more. Dewey is kicked out of his band and needs money for the rent. Why not pose as his roommate who got a request to do some substitute teaching? And while he's there sitting out of his element in a room full of schoolchildren, why not train them to rock out with him? Ridiculous, right? Correct!<br/><br/>And I wouldn't have it any other way. This movie plays out like a long episode of the short lived HBO series, Tenacious D. With no rhyme or reason, Dewey invades these kids' sterile worlds and lights the fever of rock and roll within them. And when he gets them to help him win the battle of the bands, he will be able to pay the rent and stick it to his old band all in one fell swoop. From a structural point of view, this movie is nothing to get excited about. It has the classic `oh no, the whole plan is gonna fall apart' moments, followed by the happy and rockin' conclusion. Nothing in the plot itself suggests anything of originality. But when you consider that the topic is rock (which would be my second major bias), and the teacher is rock legend Jack Black lecturing our faces off on the ways of rock, it makes for nothing but a good time.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what School of Rock is. It's a classic feel good movie that makes for a great time at the theatre. Don't get me wrong: if you happen to hate Jack Black, you're probably not going to enjoy this movie. Because I can't stress this enough: it is chock full of him. Not just the fact that he's the lead actor, but every scene reeks of classic JB form, complete with all the usual flourishes that his performances pack. He takes a standard theme-the struggle to succeed in a mission-and makes it a work of art. And I say 'he' as if he were the writer, director, and producer. Well at times it felt as if there couldn't have possibly been anybody else involved in the making of this movie except JB himself and a dozen goofy kids. And if that doesn't get you excited to see School of Rock, then you better go back to listening to your Admiral Levigne album."

","I liked this movie.  It was fun and had a lesson.  This is a movie you can just sit back and watch or really focus on the messages intertwined throughout the film.<br/><br/>Jack Black is great.  He's a known entity and he plays it without apology. The kids are terrific.  The music and watching the artistic process are quite enjoyable.  Joan Cusack plays a good part, but is a bit stereotypical.<br/><br/>My only complaint ...

","Most of the time I suffer through films my kids want to watch.  They are often inane or superficial or just plain dull.  But I thoroughly enjoyed this film. <br/><br/>Being myself only about 5 years older than Jack Black, I relate to his passion for good old-fashioned ""rock and roll"".  And this film was nothing if not his homage to that music and what it stood for. <br/><br/>
The kids are highly talented musicians and they aren't turned into superhumans or little mini-adults.   <br/><br/>It was a great laugh -- lots of little gags that the adults can pick up on and the kids just liked seeing Jack Black's antics."
"eddy_currents","10","0","0","11 October 2003"," Best family comedy since Mrs. Doubtfire
","This is the most fun I have had at a movie all year. I wasn't alone -- everyone was laughing throughout and a few even applauded at the end. If you are willing to suspend belief long enough to allow that Black's character might be desperate enough to try something like this, and then pull it off (for a while at least), then the rest of the plot is even plausible.<br/><br/>It's fresh and funny and easy to follow. My eight year old loved it. Other than a few mild curses and adult situations, there isn't much objectionable for families. <br/><br/>Black did a good job as the lovable loser, and although he looked out of place at times, I can't imagine anyone else in that role. But it's the kids who steal the show. They were all good actors and made believable musicians and they get some of the best lines. My son was even inspired to practice piano when we got home.<br/><br/>There are strong messages about teamwork (the film was careful to show all kids filling their roles) and working toward your dreams, and that it's good sometimes just to have fun.  The kids were occasionally encouraged towards precociousness but they never got truly rebellious.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for young and old."

","Rock movies that manage to be truly insightful are rare. Kid's movies that happen to be sincere and honest are even rarer. Mixing the two genres together could have conceivably ended up as a critical nightmare.<br/><br/>But `The School of Rock' fuses the two categories together into a film that is funny, touching, energetic, and most important, does indeed rock.<br/><br/>Time has not been kind to rocker Dewey Finn (Jack Black), who has just been fired from his position of lead guitar in a rock band because the rest of the group feels his on-stage antics are out of place in the 21st Century. To top it off, he still crashes at the apartment of his buddy Ned Schneebly, who has grown out of the rock 'n roll age and become a respectable substitute teacher.<br/><br/>Faced with the unfortunate prospect of getting a real job so that he can fork over his share of the rent, Dewey pretends to be Ned when answering a phone call and excepts an urgently needed teaching position at a local prep school. He soon butts heads with the school principal Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), who's stern but amicable, and also shocks his fourth grade students with his flagrant disregard for traditional classroom protocol.<br/><br/>Dewey at first sees his job as nothing more than a baby-sitting gig and is content to let the kids run free all day long, all the while trying to put together his own band to compete in an upcoming rock competition. Just when he's about to give up hope, however, he realizes the children in his class are talented musicians, at least in a classical music sense, and the bass guitar in his brain soon strikes the right note.<br/><br/>Dewey plans to mold his little class of 10-year-olds into the ultimate rocking band, all the while promising them that they're training for a secret school project. They include teacher's pet and general smarty pants Summer (Miranda Cosgrove), who Dewey assigns as band manager, socially awkward Lawrence (Robert Tsai) who quickly makes the transition from piano to keyboard, introverted Zack (Joey Gaydos) who moves from acoustic to electric guitar and class showoff Kevin who gets to become the drummer.<br/><br/>`The School of Rock' works because it is clever, observational and never condescending to its audience. Dewey is shocked to discover a whole generation of kids who have never heard of Led Zeppelin or The Who, and thinks the full scope of all musical entertainment revolves around MTV.<br/><br/>The film's biggest mistake could have been making the children all typical Hollywood kids, which come in the form of either perfect little angels or out of control hellions. These children, however, all behave like real kids and the movie is better for that. As in real life there are attention seekers, like Summer and Kevin, shy kids afraid to express themselves like Lawrence, Tomika (Maryam Hassen) and Katie (Rebecca Brown), and children yearning for their parents' acceptance like Zack.<br/><br/>Black easily walks away with the whole movie as Dewey, a tried and true rocker who hands out classic rock CDs to his class as homework and feels a rock song just isn't right unless it has a wicked guitar solo. Black is a livewire on camera, the modern answer to John Belushi and the proof that geeks, not cool people, are the ones who truly rule the rock 'n roll scene.<br/><br/>The children also all give heartfelt performances, and quickly learn from Dewey to ditch pop divas and jam to the gods of rock. Cosgrove plays Summer as just the right balance of confidence and control freak, and Gaydos makes Zack a believably sad but determined child. Needless to say the children all give strong characterizations to their roles, and the movie is all the more likable because of this when they are ultimately triumphant.<br/><br/>Many may accuse Houston-born indie director Richard Linklater of selling out with this mainstream offering after a decade of art house projects, but he clearly has his heart in every frame. The story may be formulaic but Linklater is able to get good performances out of everyone, and movie rolls along with a nice pace. The result is a movie where the use of classic rock hits like Led Zeppelin's `The Immigrant Song' and AC/DC's `Back in Black' seems earned, and not just tacked on by studio execs to please the demographics.<br/><br/>`The School of Rock' may not be a rock masterpiece, but it is definitely destined to be an underground hit for years to come. This is an entertaining film the whole family should enjoy, and for those filmgoers who chose to rock, we salute you.<br/><br/>Eight out of ten star. Jack Black and the kids make this movie a great fusion of ""To Sir, With Love"" and ""This is Spinal Tap."""

","As someone who appreciates classic rock, I was tapping my feet and nodding my head up and down throughout most of the picture. It was that as well as Jack Black's unapologetic shameless devotion to the art of rock and roll that made me really enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Black plays Dewey Finn, a fat rock slob who gets kicked out of his band shortly before his battle-of-the-bands contest. Through a series of twists and turns that I will not divulge here, he ends up subbing at a prep school that is as prestigious as it is stiff. He seems content to let them have all day recess until one day he happens to overhear the class playing classical music in a different class. As he is watching them, you can see the dim light bulb over his head start to flicker as the main plot to the movie unfolds. He tells them about a school project called ""Rockband"" and tells them about a Rockband competition. ""A victory goes on your permanent record! Harvard! Hello?"" He reiterates, giving the kids their only needed incentive. For homework, Finn assigns classic rock CD's each tailored to each band members role. In this band, each kid has a job in the band. Either as band members, as technicians, as  backup singers, even security and groupies. ""I don't want to be a groupie! I did some research on the Internet. They're sluts! They sleep with the band!"" That little gem comes from former groupie turned band manager Summer, the class smarty-pants. <br/><br/>Not only does Black and the band have to win the contest, they have to get there. Enter Joan Cusak, the school principal. She would rather not see this happen, but she is also a very likable character despite herself. She, the last paragraph notwithstanding, is a groupie wannabe stuck in the body of a cold headmistress. She's as hard as they come, but get her drunk and play a Stevie Nicks song and she's all yours. Cusak plays this role perfectly, as does most of the cast here. The kids are very talented. (That's if they were really playing. I was given no indication if they really were playing or if a group was really playing off camera so I guess that's up to debate.)<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this movie is the mild language uttered by the kids. Granted, they never stray from the PG profanities, but come on! These are 10-year old kids! They should not be using any kind of profanity, ever. My 10-year old and I would have SERIOUS problems if I heard her using those kind of words. Children who swear are never cute or funny, and just makes me want to stop enjoying the movie long enough to slap them. However, it's not like they use profanity exclusively, and the movie stands on it's own merits boldly and hilariously enough for me to forgive this seemingly increasing trend and give this movie a very high recommendation, courtesy of PROFESSOR BLACK, DOCTOR OF ROCKOLOGY.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 out of 5"

","I knew I would love this movie because I love Jack Black and I love music. What I didn't know is that I would love this movie because it showcases that young kids ARE SMART - much more than we give them credit for.<br/><br/>At an age where one assumes that a child cannot handle certain responsibilities or isn't ready for ""the real world"" - this movie challenges that aspect.<br/><br/>Granted, it is a MOVIE hence, some FANTASY - but I was inspired at how Jack Black's character, for the most part, doesn't ""talk down"" to these young talented kids.  He treats them as if ""of COURSE they can handle things and BE IN CHARGE of certain activities"" -even at the age of 10 and this pleases me.<br/><br/>This movie will be much funnier to you if you like rock music and are familiar with the AC/DC references.

","...not! Nearly 40% of voters give this thing a 10/10, putting this movie among the 150 best movies of all time. I get suspicious when looking at this and some other movies' ratings forming a consistent curve which is broken by an incongruous multiplicity of 10s. <br/><br/>This is a feel-good movie whose ""loser earns redemption"" theme is the oldest whore in the house. It handles itself decently, though, and rates a respectable inflation-adjusted 6.2.<br/><br/>Nowadays, there's some concern with lying in society, be it Enron, White House interns or WMD. Hollywood merits special consideration, because Hollywood is make-believe. The 10-year-old drummer is played by a 15-year-old actor and the 10-year-old guitarist with 3 years' experience is played by a 12-year-old actor with 9 years' experience, and the kids in the class are not a fortuitous assemblage of kids in some random class, but are selected by Hollywood to show what heartfelt rebellious pep-talking can do to actualize young children. Jack Black's pep talks are a little too frantic and wouldn't dupe most sub-10-year-olds I know. However, to appreciate the good side of this enjoyable story, one must accept these lies as artistic licence. I believe most movie-goers embed this ""caveat emptor"" into their appreciation of movies and now sometimes even into their ratings."

","I came to School of Rock with low expectations. What else can one bestow upon a film with the concept of Jack Black coning his way into a teaching job, and turning his class into a tournament favorite at Battle of the Bands? Such material seemed primed for smarmy ""family time"" sentiment, pushing the cheese meter as far into the red zone as ever before.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film's creators understand all the seedy and rebellious overtones of rock music's essence, and they picked the perfect star. Black seems to be much like Jason Lee. He is not an actor, but a star, and shines when given a chance to unveil his personality within the proper context. Linklater and White have given us a movie which seems tailor made for Black's bulbous hyperactivity, and the man never disappoints.<br/><br/>The film spends a great deal of time paying homage to rock's greats, both past and present. It laments the lost innocence of the music business, and the growing trend of using music as nothing more than a vehicle to sell other lifestyle products which sponsor MTV (the sacred cow of the biz). Black spends much of his time teaching his class about rock history and giving them audio and video of the greats at the peak of their form. He gives yet more support to the growing sentiment that the late '60s and early '70s were the golden age of rock music, but manages not to get overly sentimental for the sake of appeasing old timers.<br/><br/>Going back on a history of horrible movies based on the premise of rock music and youth rebellion (and there are a plethora), just about any other cast and set of creators could have welcomed us into just another nightmare. School of rock is, instead, an infinite dream. It gives hope for the persistence and resiliency of a musical style which has become an institution unto itself. There is worship and reverence from those who sincerely love the music, but aren't afraid to laugh at it (or themselves). Most importantly, this flic gives just as little respect to authority or convention as rock music should. Its anti-hero is not forgiven all his transgressions (though he is put in charge of an after-school group), and he doesn't get the girl. This is a Jack Black character, and not a role for Adam Sandler. It's about a f*ck-up who's not ashamed of who he is, but managed to make a small difference in spite of himself. To paraphrase Frank Zappa, Black's not a man for all seasons, but he must be doing something right."

It was nice to see a movie pay tribute to real music finally.<br/><br/>Other than that, the story was well written, and very funny.

","While the presence of Jack Black certainly gives it a different slant, when I first heard about this movie, it seemed like Linklater was following the path of Robert Rodriguez and making a safe, bankable, parent-friendly, feel-good kids movie, and that's what he did.  The other parallel that inevitably would be drawn is to Bad News Bears.  This film is nowhere near as cynical or acerbic as BNB, though, and Jack Black is no Walter Matthau. Besides, the kids are a lot cuter and they can actually play before coming together as a rock band.  And yes, the kids are really playing.  They recruited kids who are professional-caliber musicians first, actors second.<br/><br/>It has some Tenacious D-style ""hard rockin'"" Zepplinesque moments as you might hope, and as much of a screw-up as Black's character is portrayed to be, you know from the first frame that he won't let the kids down.  There are plenty of laughs strewn throughout, and the tension is never allowed to get too high.<br/><br/>I thought it was good and, for the type of movie it is, I give it a B+."

","Let me go over my title summary of this just amazing movie School of Rock.<br/><br/>A - other than signalling that a noun is coming, slap on a plus and there's a grade for this School<br/><br/>Great - which it is. This movie is hilarious, filled with great sight gags and one liners, and actually filled with some great music in-jokes. The plot actually seems to work, and doesn't leave you with a slight guilt that you're believing this could happen like many comedies like this would. It has the abillity to pull you into the movie and make you forget about everything else, except maybe to look at your friend to see their reaction to the great jokes, or when the whole audience bends over holding their gut when a certain Chinese boy says a certain one line about the certain main star. When you find out what I'm talking about by going to see this movie, you'll agree that the director has done a great job, cutting the film perfectly (who needs a DVD?), and keeping it superbly timed.<br/><br/>Film - it's almost sad to think that this movie can't be more than a film. Sure, a CD, a DVD, a launching pad for Jack Black's no doubt about-to-explode career, but just for being what it is, it's sad it can't be a great pop culture franchise. If a tear's in your eye, don't skip ahead to the word ""Cry""<br/><br/>to - OK, I may skip a few words . . .<br/><br/>Make - create, force, start to create a forcing . . .<br/><br/>the - . . .<br/><br/>Audience - which will be brought into a great atmosphere. When I saw the movie, every 20 minutes somebody pointed a laser pointer at the screen. Although I was loving the movie anyway, it couldn't get off somebody's nerves. With 30 minutes of the movie to go, the laser pointer showed up again, and someone from the front of the packed room yelled out, clearly audible, ""If if find that laser pointer, I'm going to shove it up the owner's ---!!!"", which was of course followed by a roar of applause from the audience. It was just that upbeat in there. We also happened to clap and cheer numerous times in the last 15 minutes of the movie. It's alomost going to be impossible to find a negative guy while the movie's rollin'.<br/><br/>Laugh - oh will you laugh. OH WILL YOU LAUGH! IT IS NOT A CHOICE! YET IT IS NOT A COMMAND! YOU CANNOT CONTROL IT! IT WILL HAVE YOU! !!!!!!YOU MUST LAUGH!!!!!!<br/><br/>Cry - here's something nobody was expecting. The child actors are so great, that multiple times one will come up to the main character Dewey, speak a heart-wrenching line about why they have no self-esteem, and the woman in the audience, and the less than tough guys, will all on cue give out a caring ""aaawwwwwwww!"", like sighing for them will help them out of their problem. It seems to work. Anyway, this, tied in with the humor, helps attract some of the ladies to the film, because, no offense, it can't be for any big hot studs taking the lead of the film.<br/><br/>and - that means there's one more thing.<br/><br/>Cheer - unless for some reason you've skipped right down to this riveting word right here, you'll understand why.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: See the movie. Love the movie. Be sure to laugh with everyone, awwwww with everyone, and cheer at the right parts, which will hopefully come naturally. Oh, and always, ALWAYS remember to threaten the laser pointer guy (it worked) from a crowded area, in an indistinct voice. Rock on."

","School of Rock is hilarious, touching, in addition to having an awesome soundtrack. If you see one comedy this year, this should be it. The script and plot are well crafted and coherent, and Jack Black's comic timing is flawless. The kids also bring a lot of humor to the film (my favorite was the Asian keyboard player). Even if you hate Jack Black, this movie is worth the money! You just might change your mind about him once you've seen it."

","This movie has a wonderful, powerful message without hitting you over the head with it.  You know where the story is going, but this is not one of those dime-a-dozen, overly sentimental feel-good movie.  Jack Black provides an Oscar-worthy performance ... he's that good, but he's not just doing a comedy schtick with kids.  There's great chemistry between him and his students as they grow together.  Excellent casting to go along with a top-notch script."

The music is outstanding, the kids in the band are so talented.  This movie made me feel like i missed out big time in school, by not having a teacher like Dewey (jack black).

","...I'd be a rock star already.  I went into this movie expecting something funny and cool, especcially since I saw a screen cap of the web chart with all the different kinds of music.  I came out amazed, metal horns blazing. I was unfortunate enough not to fall in love with music until I entered freshman year in high school (I'm a senior now), but if I'd know someone like Dewey when I was these kid's age I would be well on my way to making the music I love and getting it out there already.<br/><br/>This movie touched the music geek in me.  Not only did I get the jokes (""I believe that children are our future"", and the Ozzy riff...hee), but I reveled and celebrated in them.  I WAS that girl who wants to sing, I WAS that kid who loves his guitar (in my case, voice and piano) and who's parents think that they can, to quote Good Charlotte, ""tell me this guitar won't get me anywhere"".  Jack Black knows how to relate to the music lover in me, the passion I feel for true rock music (Buzzcocks!  Blondie!  Patti Smith!  And the Angus Young outfit!).<br/><br/>Amazing.  This is going on my favorite movies of all time list, right next to Empire Records.  Amazingly talented cast, perfect music, perfect writing, perfect passion."

Especially the lead guitarist and the drummer. And that chubby black girl can REALLY sing! And third, besides being PG-13, it is very kid friendly. I took my eight year old sister and my 11 year old cousin with me and they loved it too. <br/><br/>I only have one complaint. No, it's not about the movie, it's about the two women I had to sit next to. They just WOULDN'T STOP LAUGHIN'!!!! Even on the serious stuff they were positively cackling.

"john_murdoch2002","9","0","0","30 September 2003"," A brilliant and inspiring film.
","One of the many joys about going to the movies is getting more out of a film than anticipated. After hearing rave reviews from both The New York Times and an ""A"" average from Entertainment Weekly, I figured ""The School of Rock"" would be a pretty enjoyable film. When I left this movie, my legs were shaking from the sheer joy and inspiration that this movie elicits. If anyone is wondering what kind of film this is, the best allegory would be to imagine what it was like the first time you saw ""Big"" with Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The School of Rock is about a lazy dreamer, Dewey Finn, played by Jack Black, who knows what is great about rock music, but can't quite be as great as the artists that inspire him. Since his vision is only narrowed to rock music, he hasn't ventured anywhere else in the world, leaving him in debt to his roommate for rent money.<br/><br/>Finn assumes his roommate's identity as a substitute teacher at a prestigious elementary school in order to pay the rent. When he meets the students, there is an immediate culture class, in that Finn has the inspiration, but lacks the class whereas the students have the class, but lack the inspiration.<br/><br/>When Finn hears the students playing in their music class, he gets the idea to start a rock band with the class as his band members. From here, the movie takes a rather unique turn in that the script allows Finn to play off of the students' unique personalities and qualities instead of having them play off of Finn's eccentric personality.<br/><br/>Finn allows the students to be themselves while defying both their parents and faculty, reviving the non-conformist spirit of the 70s metal bands that Finn has immersed himself in. Finn branches out his love of the music to the class and relates it to them. The students, in turn, flourish and become more confident with their gifts.<br/><br/>Jack Black is perfectly cast as Dewey Finn. Black is the perfect embodiment for Dewey's eccentric and passionate behavior. But what Black also brings to this role is his musical gifts for both playing guitars and, in one hilarious scene, writing on the spot music about Math that would have the cast of Whose Line is it Anyway turn green with envy. Finn becomes the teacher that we all have either been blessed enough to have or have wished to have. This one role establishes Jack Black as the most prolific and dynamic new actor working in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Joan Cusack also has a funny role as the uptight elementary school principal with a predilection for Stevie Nicks. Cusack herself is wonderful in most everything she does (look at her roles in Say Anything, Working Girl, and her brilliant comic turn in In and Out.) Her mannerisms and accentuation are so perfectly executed, she proves herself as the funniest lady in Hollywood.<br/><br/>As for the students themselves, they display enough individual promise to have a new career going for themselves. Miranda Cosgrove shines as the eager overachiever, Summer, Joey Gaydos is wonderful as the fledgling rock God, Zack, Maryam Hassan has a wonderful part as the timid singer with the great voice, Robert Tsai as the student who worries he isn't cool enough to be in a band, and Kevin Alexander Clark as the one student with enough attitude to match Dewey Finn's. These are only a few of the wonderful child performances that are on display in this film. Hollywood, treat these kids well.<br/><br/>All this wonderful acting talent works so well with a brilliant script by Mike White (Chuck & Buck). This script is witty, clever, inspiring, and sentimental enough that it isn't sappy, but not so light that it passes through you without leaving an impression. And Richard Linklater must be credited with bringing this movie to the screen with enough vivacity and passion that one could leave The School of Rock wanting to start their own rock band without even being interested in going into music."

","I saw a preview of ""School of Rock"" tonight. It was a genuine crowd pleaser...and I usually hate crowd pleasers. But this worked for me. This should be the break-out hit for Jack Black that ""Shallow Hal"" should've been. He's wonderfully zany and the audience kept cracking up when he was on screen. The supporting cast is great too -- especially Joan Cusack and the kids. Children in movies have a tendency to mug for the camera and come off as cloying but the director, Richard Linklater, was smart enough to let the kids be kids and leave the mugging up to Jack. Mike White (who used to write for the brilliant, but short-lived ""Freaks & Geeks"" television series) wrote an enjoyable script and Richard Linklater's direction is inspired. The children also seem to be singing and playing their own instruments for the most part here (no Monkee business) and they do a fine job. It reminded me somewhat of The Commitments. Anyway, this is a good family film, and I'm sure it will be a hit when its released in October."

","This screenplay was written with Jack Black in mind and honestly, who else could pull this piece of delightful hokum off? Nobody! His mugging might turn some folks off but I couldn't get enough. His insanely intense love for rock was so infectious that you couldn't help but embrace it, accept it, bring it home and raise it like your own. <br/><br/>It's a silly little plot: Jack's character Dewey needs cash so he takes over his roomie's persona at a prep school playing a substitute teacher. He essentially shapes the students into a music act for a ""Battle of the Bands"" after he was kicked out of his own band. None of it really makes any sense but in the Jack Black universe, it makes all the sense in the world. And that's all that matters to me to give this a solid 9 out of 10.

","This evening I saw a pre-release screening for Richard Linklater's newest film starring Jack Black and supported by Joan Cusack, SCHOOL OF ROCK.<br/><br/> Director, Richard Linklater, is known for his past films. Slacker, Dazed And Confused and the animated film, Waking Life. He also created an interesting film I reviewed previously called Tape a three person film which casted Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard, so I knew the film could have potential even though I went to see the film primarily because it was free since I had major doubts about the film plot.<br/><br/> Jack Black either rubs you the wrong way or you really love him. I am one of the people who usually do not even notice him except for when I saw him perform live with his real life band, Tenacious D, at a benefit a few years back. I was, however, quite surprised by his comedic timing with the story and the kids in the film did a superb job. Joan Cusak was great in her role as a principal of a prestigious private school.<br/><br/>
 The film starts off with Black being thrown out of his band and faces being tossed out of his apartment if he can not pay his share of the rent. He winds up masquerading as his room-mate, a substitute teacher, after he realizes he will make $650 for a week. His room-mate is played by Mike White, who you may remember from the dark comedic film, Chuck & Buck. White wrote the screenplay for this film as well as composing music for the film along with Black and is currently working on the upcoming film The Stepford Wives which will feature a huge cast comprised of Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Faith Hill and Glenn Close.<br/><br/>The film takes the p**s out on so many situations of the music world and while it hints at some adult themes, it stays true to it's core focus for a broad audience which is not an easy task. There are many hoots, hollers and guffaws to be had during this film as well as the confidence theme, ""Fight da man"". It was a fun piece of entertainment and it will leave you satisfied if you are looking for something light. Kids will enjoy it while older kids aka those 30s and up will find something as well and will catch the nostalgic and crafty references ;)."

","I saw this at a pre-screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. I wasn't expecting much more than to be entertained, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This movie doesn't try to be more than it is, which is a sweet, and slightly wacky comedy, but it succeeds at being clever, entertaining, and nicely put together.<br/><br/>Jack Black plays an oh so struggling musician, Dewey Finn,  who is kicked out of his band for grandstanding, and frankly enjoying performing a little too much.  Mike White plays his ever suffering and much mooched upon room mate, who, with the badgering of his girlfriend , played by Sarah Silverman, gives Dewey the option of coming up with rent money, or getting the hell out.  Desperate for cash, he accepts a job as a substitute teacher at an exclusive private school, that was intended for his roomate.  Once there he realizes that the children he is ""teaching"" are musically gifted and tricks them into forming a band with him so that he can compete against his old group in a Battle of the Bands.<br/><br/>This movie is sweet, smart and totally watchable.  The story doesn't lag, and the preformances are believable and touching.  Jack Black delivers a fantastic character with more depth than he has been given before.  The music in this flim is lots of fun, especially if you have an appriciation for some earlier rock music from the 70's and 80's.<br/><br/>Take a break from your real life and go enjoy some pure entertainment, you won't regret it."

","I wasn't totally irritated by this movie, but it has that somewhat recent Hollywood practice of turning a fantasy movie into a 'comedy/drama' with some -apparently- moral lessons. The plot was pointless. It is beyond impossible that anything close to reality happened in this movie. But when the continuously overacting Black gets that serious look and the music indicates an important subject relating to the student's life, I can't help but cringe. I don't care about the copying of other movies. Hollywood only has a small number of plot formulas to work with. THEY ARE MARKETING FOR THE BOTTOM LINE! What I do care about is having a silly fantasy movie made into a semi-serious kids movie. Keep it a kids movie and make it all fantasy. Just think of how popular Animal House would have been if it had any moments of moral seriousness. How about the Blues Brothers? The only thing that kept me watching this zero movie was that the kids were really playing their instruments, at least somewhat. That's why I gave it a 2 star."

Director Richard Linklater goes commercial (and cookie-cutter) in this friendly-enough family film, yet it's one which offers few surprises, beginning with a supporting cast of young actors who are over-trained in precociousness.

","School of Rock is a feel-good movie with a good plot and no unnecessary baggage.  Unfortunately, it sends mixed messages to viewers, especially young viewers.<br/><br/>First, it's okay to be a prolific liar.  The main character lies to every other character without exception.  Aside from a couple awkward moments, there are no negative consequences.<br/><br/>Second, aspiring to rock stardom is a higher goal than academic excellence, including musical quality.  The main character easily tempts young students away from learning math, grammar, and music theory.  He transforms them into rockers, ironically relying on their existing academic and musical development for his selfish plans.  This is all okay with students, friends, teachers, the principle, and parents, who are all enlightened by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Still, these flaws are so obvious it's easy to ignore them and enjoy the show.  In fact, I used the film to discuss those moral issues with my kids and it worked very well.<br/><br/>After all, movies are an escape from reality, not about it.  Just don't get the two mixed up!"

","Comedy in which lazy, benefit dependent waster is finally brought to book on backrent and illegally assumes his best-friend's position as a substitute teacher as he has no employment prospects of his own and ends up teaching rock music appreciation to privileged ten year olds as a perverse form of wish-fulfillment in order that he can use them to enter a music competition which he hopes will pave his way to fame and fortune although experience and common-sense suggests the dimateric opposite will occur.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this picture? Perhaps the idea that you can teach the spirit of civic and moral rebellion to a group of middle-class private school children who are culturally and intellectually incapable of placing the iconoclastic ethos and social commentary invested in the music into context. The most offensive of these kids, Zack,understandably feels angry with a life of comfort, top dollar education and the certainty of social and economic advantage in the future and so turns to punk - a movement born out of social deprivation, counter-cultural disillusion and the British working class as a focus for his musical muse. Black meanwhile, strutting around the classroom like a one man comic book convention - extols a curriculum of half-bakery, cod-philosophy and rock truisms without ever encouraging the children to find their own musical and spiritual direction. In a typical exchange he tells the kids that rock is about 'giving it to the man' and 'venting your frustrations' but in reality he is pursuing an agenda of wealth and worldwide fame. We realize what he's REALLY saying during a conversation with a awkward, keyboard playing child of oriental origin in which Black notes that 'if you're in a great rock band everyone will want to party with you'. In other words, clearly lacking any other social advantage (looks, a focused work ethic, intelligence) Black only real interest is in making himself popular - the very anthithesis of what Rock is about. Further to this we're forced to endure the spectre of black sexualising younger girls as groupies and tip-toeing dangerously close to the line as he attempts to compensate for his lack of success with women and the inevitable sexual frustration that follows. The whole sorry affair climaxing in an sub-mini pops concert in which Black's training produces songs on the subject on school work and exam results, and they let this man teach music afterwards? I'd lock the b*stard up.<br/><br/>Honestly, what is this film for?"

Joan Cusack was really the only good actress in the film, and in a way she should have been considered for at least a golden globe. Granted, this isn't the kind of film you would normally see an award coming to, this specific area of the movie, would be the only one I would support its giving.<br/><br/>The movie itself is definitely a kid's film, and I would recommend it to anyone seven and up. It's not a movie for adults, and the only reason why anyone older than thirteen may want to see it, is because of Jack Black and possibly Joan Cusack. Otherwise, it's most certainly geared toward kids. There was only one thing that I was actually bothered by, and that's the fact that one of the little boys in the movie was gay. I disagree that they should be conditioning kids at such a young age, to that way of life, and suggesting that a little boy at ten years old would have an affectation of a feminine kind. It really bothered me, and although it was meant to be funny, I found it distasteful, and offensive. <br/><br/>But, otherwise it's light enough and enjoyable enough for kids that it's worth a look.

","School of Rock (2003): Dir: Richard Linklater / Cast: Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Mike White, Sarah Silverman, Miranda Cosgrove: Overrated comedy about music and education with Jack Black being fired from his band and replacing his roommate as a substitute teacher in order to earn some cash. Director Richard Linklater understands music and dealt with older students in his superior Dazed and Confused. Black is likable but his role is by the numbers. One big flaw is that he only teaches these kids about music. Understanding that music is what he knows works against the film when factoring other school subjects. Joan Cusack plays the harden principal who will eventually soften after Black gets her drunk over Stevie Nicks tunes. Mike White is standard issue as his roommate who regrets trusting Black but unable to reverse his decision. Sarah Silverman plays his complaining girlfriend who tries to be witty but comes off as annoying due to formula writing. Miranda Cosgrove plays the band manager and that is about it. Obviously the screenplay didn't have a manager. It is a celebration of music and the artists that contributed to make it rock. That would be great if it was a music academy but unfortunately for Black these kids live in reality. Behind the energy and music trivia is a film slowed down to writing presented many times before just like the same old love songs. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

However, apart from that the film doesn't really hit the spot. However, I can't put my finger on why it doesn't quite work. Perhaps the whole thing is just too American, or cutesy, or obvious, I can't decide. The kids play their parts well, and it's pleasing to see that they can actually play their instruments. The headteacher (principle) is especially poor and she really doesn't make the most of the part. The scene where she has a beer and is suppose to reveal her rock-chick side is a real let down - this could have been a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>The music is great, a classic selection of tracks and I'm sure the soundtrack is well worth a listen.<br/><br/>My advice would be to rent rather than buy this film.

Like i said, it has its flaws but it all builds up to a finale that doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Decent enough for any Jack Black fan, decent enough for all ages then I guess. 6.5/10."
"bravesfan35","7","1","2","21 August 2014"," It was okay
","I really wish I could give this movie a 10 but just the fact that Jack Black is in it prevents that. I never cared much for him as an actor or as a musician. Now onto the movie itself. I found a lot of the script dull and some of the lines really stupid like ""It's 9 and that's a magic number."" About the only time Black does remotely good acting is when he's ranting about ""the man"" to the kids. The rest of the film, his ""acting"" is well below average. Sarah Silverman was also pretty lame in this film. When it's discovered that Black is pretending to be his roommate and the scene returns to the apartment, the first thing Sarah says is ""I have nothing to say to you"" and then 5 seconds later she starts tearing him a new one. Really? The only reason I gave this a rating of 7 is that I like the intro song and the song the kids perform for the competition. Definitely not the kind of movie you want to watch if you're looking for laughs unless you like laughing at how comically horrible this movie is."

","By far my favorite Jack Black movie! And no i am not just seeing this now quite frankly its like the 500th time i have seen it.However only noticed today that no review was attached by moi...so lets remedy that shall we? I have seen pretty much every project that has had Jack Black's moniker on it and i still haven't seen anything as good as the performance he gives within this film. Dewey Finn (Black) is an aging rocker who gives it all behind the mic! After being told that he is fired from his band and that he needs to come up with rent money pronto or no home as well. He intercepts a phone call originally for his roommate (a substitute teacher) and after learning that a nearby private school requires a teacher to fill in for a couple of weeks he pretends to be his roommate and accepts the job. Before you know it he is teaching the students how to be free and shake the image of strictness,let their hair down and just play some metal! He turns the class into a band themselves finally giving him his spotlight thats he has always desired. the one thing of many that this movie made me want to do was look into an obviously talented musician that i didn't know until viewing this film that Jack Black is, which in turn led me into becoming a fan of Blacks own comedy type band with his lifelong friend Kyle Gass and that is Tenacious D. These are the movies i think should be really looked at as hidden gems. Not only for the family but for the hidden rock star in us all!"

Somehow though Black glues the mishmash together, and, I guess that is his magic.<br/><br/>Pick a night where you the wife and the kids (wife and kids optional) are kicking back doing something dull like, I dunno, writing Christmas cards, grab a couple beers, and put this on in the background. I guarantee you will be caught.<br/><br/>If you do as I suggest and sit through some of the derivative Jack Black slapstick character presentation, you will arrive at one of the best 5 min surprises in ""feel good"" movie history.

","The true test of a great movie is one that, months or years after its release, has me watching it again and again. School of Rock is just such a movie.<br/><br/>It never pretends to be anything more than it is: a lighthearted, feel-good comedy, one of those teacher-inspires-kids plots with a twist, sort of a Sister Act II with Jack Black instead of Whoopi Goldberg (a vast improvement if you ask me). Nothing we haven't seen or heard before, but a great script, some enthusiasm, kids with actual talent, and Jack Black's natural zaniness make this movie work. And you know what? It's actually funny. As in, really, really funny.<br/><br/>Jack Black is one of those actors who you can just wind up and let go with a script, and he'll take it to a whole new level. His enthusiasm is contagious, and the audience gets as caught up in it as the kids. Joan Cusack is laugh-out-loud funny in her role as the foil/school principal. And the music ain't half bad either.<br/><br/>Okay, so the plot is unrealistic, the movie's about as deep as a frat boy, and there is very little to learn here about the human condition. But here's a movie that doesn't promise anything other than to entertain. And entertain it does."
"trobinson727","10","1","2","20 January 2008"," School of Rock rocks!
","Jack Black plays the musical sage in this captivating film. He liberates a bunch of upper class school kids with a let-your-hair-down lesson plan aimed at scoring a ""great rock moment."" It's a personal moment for the kids and it comes off great. The climax song ""Teacher's Pet"" is the composition of 12-year old ""Zack"" (Joey Gaydos Jr.), who gets to play a hot guitar solo. The chorus girls include an adorable little blond named ""Marta"" (Caitlin Hale), who makes a permanent impression. They sing ""ooh la la la"" back-ups stolen from the Beatles song ""You Won't See Me."" Joan Cusack is perfectly cast as the uptight school principal. The wimpy ""Ned Schneebly"" character (Mike White) is played by the key writer of the screen play, so he's more important than you think. Comedian Sarah Silverman plays his bitchy girlfriend and she's despicable. I like Sarah, but it's mostly physical. School of Rock was an exciting and joyful film. Three thumbs up!"
"hunk-of-monk","10","1","2","17 November 2007"," Setting the standard for family comedies.
","A perfect score is hard to justify, especially for a kid's film, so why is it that School of Rock warrants a ten out of ten score? It's because it does everything a family comedy should do perfectly, but it also succeeds in appealing to parents, teenagers, kids alike. <br/><br/>School of Rock's goofy storyline, of a try-hard ageing rocker turned primary school teacher turned band manager, is one that, refreshingly, has some original ideas. Never does the film repeat tired routines that would, undoubtedly appeal to (but be also familiar to) its core fan-base, instead the moment of inspiration writer Mike White felt when he decided to write a movie in which Jack Black heads a band of kids, never becomes compromised to avoid challenging the young masses.<br/><br/>Obviously, much credit must be bestowed upon Richard Linklater, a director not traditionally associated with mainstream film making, instead choosing to devote time to more innovative cinema (such as Waking Life), it is his sincerity throughout the film that lifts it out of the forgettable family film forest.<br/><br/>Continuously, School of Rock throws comedic gem after comedic gem at the viewer, the younger audience members will remember Jack Black playing the big kid, parents can reminisce their own years of rebellion, and everyone will enjoy stand out performances from the young class of students coerced by Black into embracing the spirit of rock.<br/><br/>Rather than opting for glib references to bands from the alternative culture, in an attempt to strive for nonchalant cool, School of Rock gains its credibility from showing genuine love for the music it celebrates, as well as being a hilarious family film that is what many aren't, memorable."
"ldybach","9","1","2","7 April 2007"," Fun to watch
","Okay, (possible spoiler) The people who rate this as ""trite"" or ""vapid"" just miss the point. Everyone has a certain taste for movies and obviously nothing suits everyone. But I thought this movie was fun and amusing and cheered me up.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to react more to other reviewers reviews than to actually just review this movie but I was annoyed. <br/><br/>It wasn't meant to be taken seriously. No one claimed the music was stellar. It pretty much was exactly as the commercials depicted. A schlub of a guy teaching some uptight young kids to loosen up and learn to appreciate and play rock music. That's it.<br/><br/>The people leaving bad reviews saying the music was lame and how Jack Black stinks as a singer and musician don't understand that no one was saying the music would be great or that Jack Black was anything other than a guy who couldn't cut it in a real band and finally realized it. Jack wasn't trying to seem talented or anything - just enthusiastic about rock. A wannabee. And he woke up and found he could teach. Duh. He even says so in the movie ""Those that can't do teach. And those that can't teach, teach gym."". Although he doesn't yet realize at that point that he may suck.<br/><br/>As for the comparisons to Sister Act, there may be similar qualities, but I didn't care for Sister Act very much and loved this. I don't even remember it, it was so long ago. It's just different even if the plot is similar. Try finding a movie that isn't similar in plot to another that's been made. And who cares if the plot is the same? If it's still amusing and you find it different than great. Really, some people see way too many movies.<br/><br/>If it had been a rip off of Sister Act and I never saw Sister Act and the characters and music are different where's the harm? And some people weren't born when Sister Act came out. Not everyone has seen every movie made. I've still never seen E.T. and many other classics.<br/><br/>It was fun to watch the transition when the kids moved from classical to rock instruments even if it was unrealistic to think they accomplished it all in three week.<br/><br/>Even the kids, who I was prepared to dislike because they were kids, were great. I think the fact that they were all relatively unknown helped. There was no ""star kid"".<br/><br/>If you don't like Jack Black you probably won't like it because he's his animated self. I would find him annoying if he weren't so human and kind seeming. I like him but can understand why others would not. <br/><br/>All in all I found it a funny, touching, movie with good music (classic rock soundtrack) and quite frankly was glad the kids were learning rock. Not enough kids today are growing up appreciating good rock. <br/><br/>It was just nice. And I'm actually quite fussy and will turn a movie off that I've rented and walk away if it's pathetic. But everyone's tastes are different. If you dislike silly scenarios, hyper actors, Jack Black, children, Joan Cusak (who was great), and rock music - or are particular about who plays the rock music than don't watch it. Otherwise give it a try. You can always turn it off."
"whiteknight_copley","9","1","2","9 February 2007"," Strength in Depth!!
","Lots of folks have commented on Jack Black's and Joan Cusack's performances so I will say no more on them except that I agree totally! They are brilliant!!! A great strength of the film is the casting with some wonderful cameos adding to the overall enjoyment. I would like to give shout-outs to Lucas Papeilias as the dudey-sensitive bassist from No Vacancy (who did NOT suck!)and Lucas Babin (Spider) who stole the show whenever he appeared! Sarah Silverman and Tim Hopper were great as the bad guys (Patti and Zach's dad respectively). Tim Hopper carried the pushy parental theme at the core of the film to perfection and deserves especial praise. Even tiny parts like the Battle of the Bands security guard (Carlos da Silva) and the cop (Barry Shurchin) were played well.<br/><br/>There were also great performances among the ""backstage"" kids. Watch out for Cole Hawkins (""Ya mean we're not in the buuh-yand?""), Zachary Infante as geeky, but oh-so-temperamentally-artistic Gordon and Brian Falduto's hilarious portrayal as the Band stylist - constantly on the verge of flouncing off in disgust at Dewey's style-shortcomings.<br/><br/>Another strength is the camera work - with some great continuing shots: the long moving-in shot for the encore segueing into the credit sequence was superb as was the opening credits sequence. The tracking of Dewey's van was done very well especially the overtaking shot (when the Immigrant Song was used). This gave the film a great sense of dynamism.<br/><br/>The DVD extras make it very clear that there was a lot of fun, humour, respect (dare I say love?) between cast and crew, across the ages, and I'm sure this helped the fun factor in the movie come through. The kids commentary showed the strength of the ensemble with generous acknowledgements by the musicians of the talents of the other children who had smaller roles. This was a nice aspect.<br/><br/>All in all one of my top ten films!! It is so funny and so well done."

","I love Jack Black. YOu can have your Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, Jude Law, and any other hunk but I'll take Jack Black because he is not only funny but he appears normal like the rest of us. He rocks this film playing a guitarist who gets kicked out of his own band. Hard on his luck, he accepts a substitute teaching job for $650.00 per week under his roommate's name. Under pressure for not chipping into the rent, his roommate's girlfriend played beautifully by Kathy Silverman even in this small role does a great job. So he takes the substitute job with hopes that he will start a band again. Anyway, he discovers the band under his nose when he learns that the kids play musical instruments at a top notch private school where tuition is about $15,000 per year. Joan Cusack was perfectly cast as the school principal, uptight and disliked by the teachers. Of course, Jack Black's character and the students of ten year old wonder actors and actresses all have a part in the project of a rock band under the disguise of a competition. Anyway, everybody even know-it-all Summer has a part as band manager. The band has a role for everybody in the class. One student works the light while another works the security in hopes of keeping the principal away from the classroom secret. I love his role of teaching rock and roll history. I feel ancient now. Jack Black earned a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy Film and I think the honor is very well-deserved and I look forward to more of Jack Black."
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","2","4 December 2006"," engaging and laughable musical comedy
","The narrative.<br/><br/>At the beginning I was assuming that it would appear as a very clichéd unrealistic musical comedy. But by the end I was so delighted by the amount of musical elements, the excitement, the childish jokes and the gentle plot I couldn't help but smile at the story's brilliance. The story focuses upon a desperate rock and roller who takes the life of a teacher to push his own musical career forward. Rather than be a tale of a desperate pathetic loser it is an enjoyably capture of positive perception in the darkest of times. Having positive characters encoded emphasises good will and justifies a comedy genre when the general idea of the plot is dwelled upon, becoming a teacher to allow younger students to join you in a rock band. Unrealistic of course but its one of those films you can't help but feel relaxed in and loving towards. The plot is kept consistent through the character of Jack Black (King Kong) who achieves his first major role as a successful artist here, a complete knock out performance. He steals the show with great jokes. Clichéd child centred jokes from the students but it's such a relaxing and enjoyable plot you can't help but smile and laugh. There are stereotypes of rock and rollers which is used well to drive the plot along and keep audience interest. <br/><br/>Music.<br/><br/>The reason I loved this film so much was the amount of effort encoded to justify a musical lifestyle. As a member of the infamous band Tenacious D and a great comedian when given the right roles, Jack Black was simply perfect to play the rocker teacher. His guitar playing and singing are outstanding and the way he encourages the students to take a life of rock shows how important music was to this film and his own personal life. There are many references to famous rock bands over the last 20 years which gives an educational view into the art of music, a great inspiration for young viewers who are interested in music. <br/><br/>watch it if....you love music"
"TheHande","8","1","2","13 August 2006"," Heavy Metal and Little Kids
","Family comedies are not a genre I regularly watch and I had a lot of reservations to actually watch the School of Rock, even after I had bought the ""Tenacious D"" album and been convinced by Black's musical talents and comical delivery. When compared for instance against the comical-portrayals of Martin Lawrence Black's has a lot less irks and his craziness is simply enjoyable, similarly to Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Plot-wise the movie is of course a bit of a stretch but the feeling is right and there's nothing horribly cheesy about it which makes it easy to watch even for a more mature viewer. I may be a bit biased given that I listen to so much Heavy Metal, but I did think that the musical input of Black and the Kids was pretty damn good.<br/><br/>The film is of high quality and very enjoyable, though I think they could have had a better ending."

","I have to admit, my initial impression of School of Rock was not a good one. When it was first released, I had though it would be one of those turgid family ""comedies"" if the term can even be used to describe the horrible predictable messes they usually turn out to be, a-la Rebound and R.V. However, once I was finally persuaded to go see it, my mind was blown as to how very wrong I was. <br/><br/>It's true, the subject matter is very limited and the premise seemed very questionable: an over the hill rocker (Black) intercepts his roommate's call to be a substitute teacher for a class of private school kids, poses as his roommate to make some money, and ends up teaching the class about the art of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and turning the entire class into a rock band, with the intent of competing in the local battle of the bands competition. It may sound silly and unbelievable, but the lesson learned here is never underestimate the amazing talents of director Richard Linklater and star Jack Black. <br/><br/>School of Rock seemed to be yet another quirky edition to Linklater's extremely varied resumé, going from serious romantic dramas like ""Before Sunrise"" to lowbrow stoner comedies such as the underrated ""Dazed and Confused"". But Linklater for whatever reason turned out to be the perfect choice to pull School of Rock together, making the very best possible use of the source material and even managing to make a bunch of young kids funny. This would normally be a painful process and even more painful result, but surprisingly enough the kids are actually really funny, and get a fair amount of side-splitting punch lines. This is an accomplishment in film-making itself, without even mentioning the colossal force of the film's star: Jack Black.<br/><br/>I suppose it would really be a matter of taste, but these days it would seem Jack Black is without question one of the most watchable performers in the industry. It is true that he goes shamelessly over the top with boundless enthusiasm, but for whatever reason instead of completely falling flat, his energy is ultimately infectious, and makes you want to be rolling around on the floor, hooting hollering and busting out a violent air guitar solo with him. Black has launched quite the successful career off the success of this movie, and upon viewing his recent popularity is no surprise. There's a very likable quality about Black, even when playing a complete washed up feckless loser he still manages to capture our hearts with his cheeky, infectious enthusiasm. This goes without mentioning the guy has the best use of eyebrows since Jack Nicholson - indeed, it would seem Black can do no wrong. <br/><br/>But although Black is without question the star of the movie, and the main attraction as well, he is not the only talent on display here: the music itself also plays a huge part in the story, and is worth the price of a rental just to listen to the soundtrack, with clips from classic Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and the Doors, not to mention Black's new humorous concoctions such as singing ""Math is a wonderful thing"" when trying to convince the stuffy headmistress, (Joan Cusack, hilarious and also very much worth seeing) that he is in fact teaching the class through song. There's also a funny little role from writer Mike White as Black's roommate, the wonderfully named Ned Schneebly, and Cusack herself has moments where she threatens to outdo Black. The wonderful cast pull off the material brilliantly and again help to raise the quality bar even more. <br/><br/>School of Rock may have sounded like a bomb waiting to explode, but in the end it turned out marvelously infectious and one of the best feel good and laugh out loud movies of the year. Black is nothing less than superb, a force of comedy nature waiting to be reckoned with, and the kids even manage to be funny and show some genuine acting (as well as musical) ability. The music itself of course is worth checking out the entire movie for, as it features one of the best soundtracks in recent history. Safe to say School of Rock is very much worth the viewing, even for those who aren't fans of Rock music, you are unlikely to be disappointed.<br/><br/>-8/10"

They need to clean the theater!"").<br/><br/>The character's Peter Pan immersion in '70's culture is recreated down to his sheets -- the same ones I had, but even the rags cut I cut from them fell apart long ago. But it also has an intelligent maturity angle, as Black's character grows into his school teacher role to demonstrate a surprising sense of responsibility for his charges, including respect for legitimate music education, both hands-on and appreciation (the rock history lesson charts are excellent).<br/><br/>Joan Cusack again shows what a wonderful comedienne she is, as she was in the recent Muppet TV movie, so that even as something of the villain of the piece she's still quite human, and the movie doesn't even swerve into a silly romance (though it will probably show up in the ""deleted scenes"" section of the DVD).<br/><br/>The only weak touch is the ""Queer Eye for a Straight Guy"" reference that's over done with one of the kids.<br/><br/>For some reason, though, parents brought very young children as if it's ""Finding Nemo,"" including babes in arms and toddlers, who ran around the theater from boredom as they didn't get any of the jokes. <br/><br/>(originally written 10/25/2003)"

","A musical comedy about a rocker named Dewey Finn (Jack Black) who lived with his close friend Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and later on, he was kicked out of his rock group.<br/><br/>A few minutes later, a call came through in connection with Ned being a sub-teacher at the one of the best elementary schools in the States. So Dewey decided be pretend he was Ned. And when it came to teaching, the only ate and sent the kids to recess. TERRIBLE! For example, he had to ask one of the kids for a snack and he thought merits and demerits were pathetic! On the following day, he watched his class as they attended a music lesson. He was impressed with what they could do! As his eye brows went with the flow of the music. This was a time when he wanted to form a new rock band.<br/><br/>When the kids got back to class, Dewey taught a boy named Zack Mooneyham (Joey Gaydos Jr) how to play the guitar the ROCKIN' way. Then, he thought Lawrence (Robert Tsai)how to play the key board, Katie (Rebecca Brown) how to play a bass guitar. And Freddy Jones (Kevin Alexander Clark) how to play the drums. And from here, Dewey started to give the class confidence. E.g.- Saying that they are all special. Dewey told the kids why he was doing this, because, he wanted to create a ""rock project"".And all the kids agreed on it.<br/><br/>There were some SUCH funny moments. For example, Dewey calling the girls ""Groupees"" and on the following day, Summer Hathaway (Miranda Cosgrove) was most disgusted when her mother told her what the word groupies meant. It meant: ""Sluts who sleep with the band!"" Oops.<br/><br/>It was amazing to see how these kids worked on the project! Dewey taught them how Rockers behaved. It was anger- ""Shutup, Schneebly!"" Followed with the kids being taught: the history of rock, the theory of rock and practical rock.<br/><br/>Another funny scene when the Head Mistress, Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack) walked past a boy named Franky (Angelo Massagli). Frankly said: ""Hey, Miss. Mullins. You're the man!"" And Rosalie said: ""Thank you, Frankie"".<br/><br/>Not so soon, two girls came up the the perfect name to call their band: ""The School Of Rock"". Those kids sure are CREATIVE! And Dewey decided the kids should wear their uniforms for the concert. At the parent evening, Dewey came out of the closet and told Rosalie that he was not at teacher, Rosalie didn't believe him. And suddenly, there were lots of complaints which came from the parents due to their kids being obsessed with music. And at that very moment, Ned's girlfriend Patty Di Marco (Sarah Silverman)arrived at the scene with Ned and the cops. Then Dewey told the parents that he wasn't a teacher and he also told the kids that there was NO project. Dewey only wanted to earn money for his rock show. MAN! Those adults were FURIOUS! The next morning, the kids decided to go visit Dewey because, they liked him so much for who he was and they also wanted to win the band contest. Dewey was amazed by the kids punk-rock style e.g.- the body language and the spoken language. Later, the parents heard that their kids went missing and soon discovered them at ""The Battle Of The Bands"" THE KIDS PERFORMED THEIR HEARTS OUT!!! THEY ALSO IMPRESSED THE AUDIENCE WITH THEIR STUNNING MOTTO IN THE BACKGROUND!!!!!!!!!!! It was an Awesome coat of arms and their song they performed was very catchy too!!! He sure did create some rockin' kids! And the principal was impressed by their performance.And, they also won!!! At the end, Dewey opened up : ""The School Of Rock After School Program"". Impressive! And Ned looked after the kids who were battling to get their notes right. And remember what Dewey said: ""Remember, those who want to create a band. Don't let the man get you down!"" Believe in it, I recommend this quote and film to the young rockers and those who want to start up a music band of their own. Cheers."

","So, this modern fairy-tale is one hell of a ride through the best of rock music mixed with a type of humor it had never experienced before. Well, the basic plot is as adorable as it can be. A down-and-out rocker takes a job of a substitute teacher at a private school and forms his own rock band with his fifth grade students by influencing them from classical music to rock. This excellent story is backed by smart and really funny screenplay (there are some brilliant bits e.g. ""Pig Rectum?"") and passionate direction by Linklater. But what makes it really great is no-one but Jack Black and also, the supporting cast.<br/><br/>Jack Black is a good comedy actor. We all knew about that. But he's also a guy who has real passion for rock and himself a good musician too. So in this film his performance is not only exceptional, it's perhaps inspirational to all the child actors present. Besides his trademark facial expressions and accent, his stage persona that we see in this film is also something that makes this film really entertaining. Joan Cusack delivers also another brilliant performance as the school's tough principal yet a secret Fleetwood Mac fan. All the kids in this film gave their best efforts when it comes to acting and really, as musicians some of them are indeed jaw-dropping, especially Joey Gaydos as the lead guitarist and Kevin Clark as the drummer with a 'bad boy' image. You might want to follow their music career as well.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier that this film is like a fairy-tale, one should not give too much thoughts about reality. Indeed some things may appear impossible, like Freddie learning drums in, well, the speed of light. The primary objective of the film is top quality entertainment. And it never fails in that, with great performances, truly funny dialogues, smart characters and yes, excellent soundtrack. Indeed, it provides the most fun I've had watching movies in a while."

","Great comedy by the very talented Richard Linklater. This time Linklater didn't work with Ethan Hawke for a change(he made several movies with Hawke as male lead: Before Sunrise/Sunset, Tape...), but with comedy/rock star Jack Black. ""The School Of Rock"" is about a guy who gets kicked out of his own band and starts teaching to kids. Well yeah teaching...<br/><br/>The first movie I saw starring Jack Black was ""High Fidelity"", where he makes an excellent team with that other underrated star called John Cusack. In that movie he was funny as well, but he was only supporting actor. In ""The School Of Rock"" it's all about Jack. Joan Cusack is also highly enjoyable as the principal of the school. The result is outstanding: Linklater has made another funny movie and Jack has played another hilarious role.<br/><br/>This is certainly a movie you must see. Some fine music and excellent acting as well! By the way, Jack loooves stage diving, so be prepared!<br/><br/>8/10"
"astro_92","10","1","2","10 June 2005"," This movie is a lot of great fun!
","In my opinion, the feature film School of Rock is lots (and lots and lots) of great fun for everybody. The movie provides a vast amount of amusement to audiences with its interesting plot and memorable moments. I enjoyed it so much that I am going to recommend the title to just about everyone that I know.<br/><br/>Jack Black is terrific as the lead character, Dewey Finn. However, my favorite of all the characters is Summer Hathaway, played by Miranda Cosgrove. Summer, in my opinion, is a true standout amongst all the other people that are seen here; she has a lot of charisma and is very down-to-earth. The other players in this movie are also very wonderful, but Summer appeals to me more than any other.<br/><br/>I have taken a strong liking to this movie partly because I am a great lover of the world of rock music. Even if you are not particularly a rock fan does not mean that you will not like viewing this. The picture contains numerous scenes that are very mesmerizing, especially the concert scene at the end.<br/><br/>Check out School of Rock as soon as you get the chance. This motion picture will keep you entertained from beginning to end, no doubt about it. This film will forever remain to be one of my favorites. Long live rock!"
"padme_star","10","1","2","3 May 2005"," The School Of Rock Rocks!
","The School of Rock, in my opinion, is a brilliant movie. This movie would be loved by all audiences. It's more than just a ""kid's movie"". This movie is made for music lovers although non-music lovers, like me, enjoy it just as much. The movie has a serious and humorous tone that makes the movie enjoyable. All the characters have their own role to fulfill; and the way they achieve, makes you want to do more with your talent.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with the main character, Dewey Finn (Jack Black) having a bad time. First of all, he was kicked out of his band and he needed money to pay the rent. When a phone call asks for his roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White), to sub at a private grade school, he pretends to be Ned. At first he ignored the lesson plan, but then he noticed that the kids had music talent. Telling them it was a ""school project"" Dewey transformed them into a rock group. The band has its ups and downs but they all triumph in the end.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are wonderfully portrayed. The characters remain the same throughout the whole movie. Dewey Finn remained the same dedicated and lazy music fan he was in the beginning. Summer (Miranda Cosgrove), the girl who was appointed Manager, remained stubborn and prideful throughout the whole movie. All the kids had learned something in the end; like that they didn't need to play to win but to play the greatest show. All the kids were extremely talented with their instruments. All the characters have their own little role in the movie, from lead guitarist, to manager, to groupies. The young actors that they had casted did an amazing job with their own characters. Most of the kid's were starting out, but they did an amazing job. They caught each of the characters personality perfect. My favorite role is the principal, Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack). Shockingly she isn't a stubborn, pushover, but she just loves her job which makes her a bit aggressive. Everyone's ""favorite"" would be Ned Schneebly's girlfriend, Patti De Marco (Sarah Silverman). She is a stubborn stuck-up woman. She pushes Ned around the whole movie. I think everyone loved when Ned slammed the door on her face. The movie overall is a big success. It stays true to the music. The cast was wonderful, and the script was beautiful. You would have a smile and a laugh throughout the whole movie. This is a movie that I would defiantly buy. I would recommend it to everyone, young and old."

","I always knew that Jack Black, is a very good comedian, he just wasn't given the right parts. School Of Rock was written for him, and the result is an excellent movie.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Dewey Finn ( Jack Black ), a guitarist who was just sacked from the band he formed. He doesn't have the money to pay the rent. Through some misunderstanding, he gets a job as a teacher at a prep school, and here's where the fun really begins.<br/><br/>I think kids movies are very risky to make. The kids are almost always annoying, the movies are completely predictable, etc. This is not the case here. All the kids here are great, and despite some stereotypes ( the fat girl, the unconfident boy ), the writer, Mike White has succeeded in creating characters that you feel, and like.<br/><br/>I was very excited to know that kids actually learned to play their instruments before shooting the movie. This fact makes the movie seem like a true story.<br/><br/>Music is an important factor in a movie like this, and the music in School Of Rock is great. Some songs not only rock very hard, but they're hilarious too ( The Legend Of The Rent by Jack Black ). <br/><br/>Jack Black displays in this film his ability as a top notch actor. I truly believe this is his best performance to date. Joan Allen is very good too.<br/><br/>Director Richard Linklater proves, once again, what a great director he is. I really wish he does more work with Jack Black in the future.<br/><br/>So i HIGHLY recommend watching School Of Rock. The story, acting, directing, and music are all first class, what more do you want from a movie?"
"caspian1978","6","1","2","18 March 2005"," Ben Stiller / Jack Black
","Welcome Mr.Black! Before, Jack Black was just an amazing actor who could play just about any wild or crazy role that was offered to him. Although his character in School of Rock is nutty, Blackn does a great job leading a cast and starring in a comedy. More than that, this is a family film. Many ""wild"" actors can make a good living doing a small / supporting role, but to make that jump into family entertainment, very few can do. Joan Cusack gives another good performance even though Jack Black is in most of the movie. The kids in the film are the other highlight. When you get a group of kids on a movie, they can make or break the movie. Here, they are surprisingly great as they add and not take away to the story. A good family comedy!"

Jack Black is hilarious, ""What are kids bein taught these days?!"".<br/><br/>In future when it comes to movies I'm gonna listen a lot less to my brother, don't get me wrong he doesn't think its crap or anything, just doesn't agree with the hype.<br/><br/>After talking about 'School Of Rock' which I have seen three times now, I already wanna watch it again.

","I loved this movie so much! It can be considered a comedy, or a musical. It involves talented and young newcomers who know so much about band instruments. The casting directors did a magnificent job in casting such proficient youngsters. Jack Black is totally hilarious. He really puts realism in his character and he can also be considered a very good actor. Meanwhile, the other supporting actors are great as well. There's a very good blend in music, though they're mostly rock(of course). You can hear songs by Led Zeppelin, Stevie Nicks, and many other known rock stars and rock bands. The director in turn, did a great job! The movie is such a success, and I hope they make a sequel out of it."
"AmishDudesRok","10","1","2","8 January 2005"," My favorite movie
","I never got to see this movie in theaters, and it tears me up inside. This movie rocks my world. First, I love music. If you love music, I think you're really going to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>First, Jack Black is hilarious. He just is. If you don't think he's funny enough by what he says (or how he marches), pay close attention to his facial expressions. They're priceless. He leads the kids perfectly with his own sense of childishness, complimenting the great cast as the perfect leader. His willingness to let go and just be funny is perfect.<br/><br/>Joan Cusack is strikingly sexy as she plays an up-tight principal. She has a great supporting role, but really didn't get to shine enough, which is noticeable in the Jack Black/Richard Linklater commentary's mention of all the deleted scenes featuring her.<br/><br/>Mike White is perfect for his role, and his girlfriend is played by the sexy Sarah Silverman.<br/><br/>Despite the great casting already mentioned (and No Vacancy's involvement), this movie really shines with the introductions of a literal class-load of children. Aged nine to thirteen at the time it was filmed, School of Rock introduces instant-stars, playing ten year old ""miracle musicians"".<br/><br/>Kevin Alexander Clark (Freddy Jones), Joey Gaydos Jr (Zack Mooneyham), and Rebecca Julia Brown (Katie) really stole my heart. Kevin and Joey rock; they inspire me by their acting and musical performance. Rebecca does the same, but her character is painfully under-developed - one of few flaws in SOR.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is just great. It shows the inner workings of the band with humor and class, as well as the development of the characters (who ironically are already very aptly skilled in real life).<br/><br/>The final concert amazes me every time I see it. I just absolutely love this movie. It rocks, teaches to rock, and makes you laugh the whole time. Highly recommended, greatly loved, this movie will have a special place in my heart for all time.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and I got the soundtrack. It rocks too!"
"radonner","9","1","2","22 December 2004"," Outstanding performance
","I was never a Jack Black fan, but that was mostly because I wasn't all that familiar with him. But after this performance, he's near the top of my list. I shan't discuss the plot, since so many others here have. I'm here simply to make the case to any music lover - preferably, of course ROCK music - to see this immediately. First of all, the kids are all excellent actors. Some are better than others, of course, but overall the acting is great. The kids are also very good musicians, which is not surprising when you read their education resumes after the movie. Black's performance is superb, and it's obvious that he really took a liking to the kids, not just in his character but as the actor himself. The chemistry is magnificent, and the kids are a great bunch. I would love to see what these kids are doing in 10 years; right now they're all 12 or so, with entire careers ahead of them. I liked the writing, and the fact that the writer of the movie plays one of the main characters was a neat surprise. Sarah Silverman, of course, is gorgeous, and plays her role perfectly. One of the feel-good movies that everyone in a family could watch together, and that everyone should see - especially if it turns them away from hip hop and gets them on the ROCK tip!"
"aurelie_ledoyen","Null","1","2","7 December 2004"," Possibly better than Dazed & Confused
","...that's a big ""possibly"", because D&C was awesome. I say it might edge it out if you're looking for something more well-rounded. Dazed was more of a realistic,personal coming-of age heart charmer. In a way, School of Rock is just like that, except it's even funnier than Dazed. (but of course Matthew Macconoughey and Ben Affleck are still hilarious every time!) Linklater is himself here, especially with the length of his pan-in and -out shots (I have editing deficit disorder, so I appreciate it). There's also his persistence at keeping everything completely realistic and keeping a great narrative throughout until a great climax.<br/><br/>All the characters are fleshed out, even the no-name band mates of Dewey's at the beginning of the film. He trusts that the audience wants something steady that takes its time, not something flashy, overly edited, and unreal. This is even more crucial if you're working with someone like Jack Black, who can never sit still and who never goes out of character. Though his character's been established as a ""loser"" by society, the director and the script let you know that this guy is able to really connect with a good band, for all his passion and intensity for rock and roll music.<br/><br/>Kudos should also be given to Mike White, who had a vision of Jack Black with a bunch of kids forming a band.<br/><br/>The kids are just the coolest. They're all each so different in their own ways, yet bright and work all together and never try to grab any attention from anybody else. They're very natural.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that Zeppelin, Hendrix, and ac/dc comprise the soundtrack doesn't hurt things either. Overall, this was a really kick-@ss movie that showed Jack Black in a not-so-raunchy role. A hilarious script that could've been cheapened by one of those first-time directors, but turned here into almost a comedic masterpiece.<br/><br/>p.s. Don't drink milk while watching Jack Black; it'll come out of your nose."
"jpsemprini","Null","1","2","15 November 2004"," The School of Rock Rocks!
","This is a very cool film. Richard Linklater, Jack Black, Mike White and everyone involved in the making of this movie must have a great deal of respect for the classic rock of which this effort pays homage. Jack Black is wonderfully cast as the would be great musician who honestly believes that its about the band, man. With an all-star soundtrack one can actually enjoy the film just for the music (the catchy theme song itself is a classic) but don't give up on this very entertaining tale of the slacker who attempts to teach a bunch of prep school students the only thing he knows anything about--rock music. He turns them into a viable entry for a local battle of the bands competition and in the process he also learns a little bit about life himself."
"derekisdman","Null","1","2","14 November 2004"," Pleasantly Surprised...
","I went into this not really expecting much. With all of the lame comedies being released lately, I feel I was justified in my expectations. I do like all of Linklaters other films, but I thought the premise of this was a little lame, but I was very wrong. <br/><br/>The beginning seemed a little Adam Sandlerish, but when the school scenes started I was really getting into it. The kids were all very charming and likable. I couldn't help but laugh with lines like ""you're fat and have body odor"". I'm a huge classic rock/metal fan and I was really impressed and excited seeing the way that it was represented. Black totally convinced me that he was a music crazed fool who loved rock, and I could relate to him. I've seen it 1 1/2 times now, and I'd give it a high 8-9 rating out of 10. It really is a film that I think anyone could enjoy. Highly recommended!"
"donjmiller","8","1","2","14 November 2004"," Spinal Tap with kids!
","A fine effort. This role was made for Jack Black (literally), whose musical prowess is legendary (i.e., part truth, part imagination - see also ""Tenacious D"") - he is a genuine musician, with a voice of his own and a deft touch with lyrics that put the *iron* in *irony*. He's a force to be reckoned with as an actor, too - he brings it to you, and you know it. As in ""This Is Spinal Tap"", the music is actually played (and some of it written) by the folks you see on the screen. For me, this gives it ""street cred"" you can't get any other way. Linklater's direction is generally on the money; the only quibble I have is that the pace flags in spots. Perhaps it could have been edited a bit tighter? I'd hate to have to decide what to cut, though. It's fairly predictable, in the ""Bad News Bears"" sense, but there's still fun to be had in seeing how they get there. Joan Cusack does her usual utterly convincing job, and the kids are great."
"rosscinema","7","1","2","7 November 2004"," Energetic School of Rock
","Watching this film I was reminded of John Belushi and the natural screen persona that he possessed and I do believe that the star of this effort has every one of his qualities and maybe more. Story is about Dewey Finn (Jack Black) who lives with his best friend Ned Schneebly (Mike White) but he has no real job and lives for rock 'n' roll although he has just been kicked out of his band for being embarrassing. Dewey answers the telephone one day and it's for Ned with the opportunity to be a substitute teacher at a private school so he decides to tell them that he's Ned and assumes his friends identity to teach 5th grade and make some money.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Dewey at first tells his class to constantly go on recess while he catnaps at his desk until one day he hears them play in music class and he gets the idea of forming a new band with them so they can enter a radio station sponsored event called ""The Battle of the Bands"". Dewey gives them all jobs and they practice everyday but they have to be careful of the Principle Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack) who checks on them from time to time.<br/><br/>Richard Linklater is a very well known and respected independent film maker and here he gets his first chance to direct a film without worrying about the budget. The story could have been something like ""Kindergarten Cop"" but it avoids the all to easy path of sentiment which can be tempting when you have children in the main cast and it instead is more of a showcase for the considerable talent of Black. This film is really all Black and he shows more natural screen presence than I care to remember but it's not that he's not a trained actor because he is but it's his high octane energy that he's born with that's incredible to watch. There are maybe two scenes in this film that are basically shot with little or no edits and the one that stands out is the scene where he starts his class playing a rock song for the first time and he moves from one kid to another so that they all end up knowing how to start playing. I didn't notice any editing during this and the camera just follows Black in a slow and deliberate swoop that is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. Black is in a band in real life and does love rock music which adds to his performance and he's so terrific in this film that I can't think of another actor that could have played this role. It's the type of performance in a film that doesn't get Oscar nominations but you have to think that maybe that's a tribute to Black who makes it all look so natural and easy. The young actors that play his pupils are all very good but my personal choice of the funniest is the kid nicknamed ""Fancypants"". The film works for just about everyone at any age level and along with Linklater's precise direction and Black's brilliant blend of comedy and insight this is something that we will all look back at as it stands the test of time."

","'School of rock' is the type of movie dedicated to a sector of life, which you will not enjoy really if you do not like the respective sector. This time this is about rock music, and as a rock music fan I enjoyed the film a lot. Still I am aware that rock music apart, this is just a 'feel good' film, a little above the average comedy. Just last week I gave a lower rate to 'Master and Commander' as the naval history epic says me nothing, and the film - which many enjoyed - seemed just boring to me. Many will have the opposite reaction, I am sure.<br/><br/>There is a message in this film about an aging and fatty rocker stealing a teacher job, just to turn his elementary school class in a band of rockers. The message is that rock music is a way of life - and it is presented as a superior one, and a culture revolution - which is is presented as positive and significant. Some may dispute these points, I happen to agree.<br/><br/>
Jack Black is not the greatest comedian on earth, but he acts with passion. The kids succeed to be less sweet and conventional  than you would be concerned, and this is certainly the director's merit. Music is fabulous. If you like rock, you may love this movie. If rock tells you nothing, avoid! 7/10 on my personal scale."

","This is a very cool and amusing movie about a rock musician who fakes a job as a substitute teacher, and instead of the normal curriculum, teaches the private school kids how to make a rock band, and also the philosophy behind it. The teacher is the comedian Jack Black (from Tenacious D), who exhibits plenty of funny facial expressions and movements. If you grew up with other children who were brought up playing classical, then the contrasts between the stereotypical rich private school kids and their rock music fanatic teacher are especially amusing to see. Being into rock music and concerts, for me, this light-hearted flick was well worth watching. 3 out of 5 stars."
"kyle_furr","6","1","2","6 April 2004"," just OK
","This was nothing special but you can get tired of Jack Black for 90 minutes. He's better in supporting roles like High Fidelity but he can't carry a movie by himself. There isn't much of a plot just Black teaching kids in elementary school how to rock. Black's roommate is p***ed at him for not paying the rent and he wants him to get a job and stop with the music. His band kicks him out and when he gets a job as a substitute teacher, he lies about who he is and tells them he is his roommate. Most of the kids in his class are pretty talented musically and Joan Cusack is the principal. This was Richard Linklater's first mainstream film after all those independent films but Dazed and Confused really wasn't an independent film."

"CitizenCaine","7","1","2","24 December 2003"," School Of Rock Is Formulaic But Enjoyable
","For those about to rock...um...yeah. This is a very formulaic comedy film that is very predictable right from the start, which makes it even more of a burden to be successful at entertaining us. Entertain us, it does however. Jack Black is literally a one man band in this film as the impostor substitute teacher, who teaches his class about rock music instead of regular subjects. He infuses the film with his unique brand of energy and innocence. The kids are of the rich, rigid parent variety. The kids are all great, especially Summer. They play all the instruments and sing themselves. They end up learning about having fun and their parents learn to loosen up a bit. This formula has been done from the 30's and 40's' ""let's put on a show"" movies to the rock and roll B movies of the 50's and 60's, etc. It works because of the severe contrast between Jack Black's enthusiasm and the saintly restraint of the kids and parents. Joan Cusack adds great support as the prim principal of the school, who exudes prep school formality. I did not even recognize her with the librarian hair and glasses, despite her being listed in the opening credits. There's just the right blend of humor and story without it turning into either a farce or becoming overly sentimental. The music is great for anyone that likes the heavy rock sounds of the late 60's and 70's and there are several in-jokes regarding this. I have a problem with listing the Go-Gos with Fleetwood Mac; otherwise, the blackboard paradigm on rock music is pretty good. Even a visual ode to Angus Young is included in the finale. It's a funny, feel good movie that is entertaining and enjoyable, despite the fact that the formula has been used numerous times before. *** of 4 stars."

","To not put too fine a point on it, this movie doesn't have the most believable of plots.  But Jack Black is a man with the gift of the gab so in many ways you can, for the duration of the movie, believe that he could pull off everything he does here.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the plot for you. Excellent comedy aside, Jack Black is telling the kids in the school - and therefore people in the audience - that sometimes it's too easy to forget how to have fun.   He proceeds to motivate the kids in his school to believe in themselves by using rock music and his own inimitable energy to convey what life should be about - passion, conviction, commitment and much more.<br/><br/>He is the star of the show, getting fired up about sticking it to the man and using the word rock as many times as he possibly can. His character develops from a washed-up rock musician into a fine teacher, what he many lack in knowledge made up for a thousand times by his unswerving belief in himself and the kids, who can play and act almost as well as he can.<br/><br/>The School of Rock is an excellent piece of film-making that never takes itself too seriously - Jack Black and his students have a great time, the soundtrack is fantastic and the subtle morals of the movie are refreshing. 7/10"
"sjh-4","6","1","2","31 October 2003"," Funny, but kinda empty
","I saw this movie to screen it before letting my kids see it.  I was hoping for a funny movie w/lots of good music, and for the most part the movie is that.<br/><br/>But there are areas where it's lacking.  For instance, while the kids' new teacher praises their musical abilities while they're playing classical stuff (and later uses those talents), he comes across as not caring at all about their other subjects - so much so that the movie might imply those are worthless.  They're not of course, and the movie could've left the impression those were important too, even if we don't focus on them while the kids are learning to rock.<br/><br/>Then too, both the rock classes and the epic concert at the end are based on both kids' and teacher's lying.  And although the teacher eventually get caught and fesses up, for the kids their dishonesty is ultimately rewarded. It's not exactly what I'd want my young kids to learn.<br/><br/>Finally - the biggest issue for me is the emptiness of the purpose.  The teacher insists that the kids rock 'to stick it to the man', and later even offer up prayers to the 'god of rock'.  That's not enough reason for all the passion the kids work up, and it comes across as silly and empty when put on film.  Ever heard of Larry Norman?  Or Phil Keaggy?  DC Talk?  Five Iron Frenzy?  Daniel Amos?  The 77s?  Go ahead and google them - these are folks who know how to rock, but have a much better reason for the passion and effort they put into their music.<br/><br/>I rate it a 6 out of 10."

I happen to like Black and I like the School of Rock. Black has starred in two other highly entertaining comedies, Saving Silverman and Orange County. While, the School of Rock represents a good diversion movie, it is less successful than those two. <br/><br/>The film is not hilarious but it has its funny moments. Jack Black seems to be having a blast in this role. He carries the movie, and while this is no performance that will gain any awards, Black is fun to watch. Joan Cusack is less impressive, she is constantly irritating as the School's principal. The kids are all ok in their roles. <br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws. The ""Man"" joke that starts is funny on occasion but becomes tiresome after awhile. There was also a bit of a drag when Black's character first appears at the school. Like I also said, Joan Cusack was irritating and kind of distracted me. Richard Linklater's direction was nothing noteworthy, the camera could have been given to Black and it would have been just as good if not better. Overall, the movie is fun to watch despite its flaws."

","Very suspicious guilty pleasure that seems to stumble around and succeed for the most part in spite of itself. Disillusioned small-time rocker Jack Black (a tornado of enthusiasm) is about to be tossed out of his apartment by roommate Mike White (who wrote the screenplay) and White's new girlfriend (the constantly annoying Sarah Silverman) for not paying his share of the rent. White, a substitute teacher, is called one day by prep school principal Joan Cusack to take over a class for an extended period of time. Of course Black, not White (How ironic is that?), is the one who answers the phone and he ends up posing as his best friend for some much needed cash. So now Black is way over his head in a class of children that all seem a bit more intelligent than he is. Black, who really knows nothing but rock music, convinces his class to create a band and enter a contest. Naturally his motives are to make money from the contest, become a star and show up his old band. But what happens when things get complicated for all involved? ""The School of Rock"" is candy-coated dribble, but it has a beat and rhythm to it that I liked anyway. Black is the catalyst. He takes a simple, and honestly kind of mediocre, story and runs with the material as fast as he can. So much is done so fast that you find yourself doing your best to keep up with the enjoyable characters. Far from anything really extraordinary, but still a unique over-achiever nonetheless. 4 stars out of 5."

","When I first saw the ads for School of Rock I had no interest in seeing it. It looked like some dumb formulaic comedy.  I was surprised when I saw the good reviews and when I saw Linklatter was the director.  I haven't always liked Linklatter's films, but he's certainly got enough indie cred to force you to take him seriously.  <br/><br/>Then my friends started telling me they saw it and it was really good, so I went and it was.  Funny, quick moving with the requisite amount of heart, it doesn't take itself too seriously but treats its premise in a surprisingly intelligent manner.  I suppose there are people who don't like this movie, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to my mom, but in terms of this year's comedies this is as close to a sure bet as you're going to find (and who knows, even my mom might like it)."

Of course, Dewey has absolutely no idea how to teach but when he finds out that his class can play instruments very well he decides to form a band with them and is determined to win ""The Battle of the Bands"". This was a very funny and entertaining movie with great music. Jack Black is his usual insane hilarious self and all the kids are adorable and extremely talented.

Not even the most experienced adult actors can achieve such pure expression when on-camera.

","This movie's plot deals with a no-good wannabe rock star (Jack Black, wildly overacting as usual) suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school (right, things like this happen all the time), and using it to teach rock music to his students (who are around 9) to the consternation of the school authorities. Most of the rock is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time like director Linklater (actually, I think rock ""culture"" is overrated, period). This reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!."

Jack Black, who seemed to appear in everything a few years ago - usually of dodgy quality - was excellent in this. The idea of turning kids onto rock music really worked and it helped that they could already play instruments. My wife enjoyed it in spite of herself and warmed to the humour and the execution of the plot. Joan Cusack was good in her part as the principal of the school and the kids in Black's class were great too without being the ""cutesy"" school kids that usually appear in this kind of film."

","After watching this highly unrealistic film recently I decided not to let my two children: Nicholas (aged 7) and Roderick (age 5) see it. I highly doubt that this situation would ever occur. Even if it did, when Jack Black spells his name wrong in front of the class and the headmistress. It is more than likely that the headmistress would see him as inadequate teacher for these highly intellectual children. But however for some reason she does not replace him. Then the a very strong issue which is the main reason why my two children will not be viewing this film. The issue of paedophilia comes up. I quote 'Your children have touched me and I am pretty sure I have touched them' At this point I felt a real sense of sickness in my stomach. Now I do not want my children or your children to be affected by this monstrosity of a film. It is also made quite apparent that this Jack Black holds very little acting talent. I believe that this film could of been really something if for instance all Paedophile issues were removed and if someone like Al Pacino, a very talented actor took the lead role. I can't understand why the writer Mike White (not me or any relation would write the part to entail Jack Black) <br/><br/>If you are looking for a film for your children do not choose this as it is to unrealistic. I would suggest a more realistic film for example 'The Lost Weekend' starring Ray Milland. I hope you found this review helpful. Keep your children safe"

But this movie is a kiddie flick for adult audiences. It misfires every time, all the time.

Either he overacts all the time, or he, well... keeps overacting a bit more. You never get to care about him, because quite frankly, you get the feeling all the things he does are for himself.

Jack Black is just disgusting, although perfect for his part. <br/><br/>This movie reminded me that some 80's rock was horrible and that the whole 'monsters of rock' thing was as dated as rap is now.

","Dewey Finn is a middle-aged rock fan who hopes for big things with his band. However when one day brings both his band dropping and his flat mates threaten to kick him out unless he starts paying rent, he gets depressed. However when he pretends to be his friend Ned Schneebly he gets a job as a substitute teacher for a few weeks.  Determined just to hang in there and collect the money, Dewey changes his mind when he finds that his class can mostly play instruments and his thoughts turn to the idea of still winning the battle of the bands contest.<br/><br/>The trailer looked energetic and funny, however the film isn't.  It seemed like a good idea - after all, Black's music obsessed character stole High Fidelity and his character here seems to be just an exaggerated and focused version of that one.  However the film then bases the majority of the film upon Black's abilities to drive it forward, and this is a problem.  The script is pretty weak and lacks any real belly laughs; it is amiable enough but it would be too generous to describe it as `funny'.  Only in the final quarter do things happen - before this it is just the basic pitch run over and over again (`guy teaches uptight kids to rock'), however the final 30 minutes is actually pretty good and, despite not really enjoying the majority of this, I still found the gig at the end to be pretty uplifting and enjoyable!<br/><br/>Black is certainly a different leading man, but his performance here just grated a little bit after a while.  His overacting would have been more fun if it had been funnier - instead the material really lets him down.  It isn't that it is awful, it is just fairly average and unfunny for the most part - and the `energy' that was in the trailer isn't enough by itself. The cast of kids is actually very good - there are none that are horribly cute and they all give pretty good performances (although some are used better than others).  In fact had the film developed them more rather than pushing Black to the extreme fore it may have been better for it.  Cusack stands out in an amusing role in an adult cast that is really a distant third behind Black and the kids.<br/><br/>Overall this film is disappointing and fairly poor for the majority.  When it finally does more than just deliver the pitch and actually has things happen it gets better, but by then it is almost too late.  I'll admit I was going to walk out after an hour as it just didn't seem to be going anywhere or doing anything, but I hung in there to find it got a bit better.  If you don't expect very much, and you're in the mood then this may well be enjoyable enough for you, but I was simply disappointed by how unfunny it was."

","I have to watch to Jack Black's recent Tenacious D feature to choose where i like to see Black in ""related to music"" projects more: the two options for me are either ""tenacious d, the pick of destiny"" or ""High Fidelity"". This ""school of rock"" is not running for it. Definitely not.<br/><br/>I give great credit to Black, for his complete comedy skills, he successfully joins physical, verbal and gimmick comedy. As important as hearing is seeing him. In High Fidelity he was perfectly adapted and integrated in a correct crew (actors, producers, directors) and was serving a rather intelligent construction, great writing. Here he is prima donna. And he delivers it. If there is one good reason to watch this, is for Black's performance. And that's about it. All the rest is just lazy.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment is definitely Linklater. Apparently, with this one, he moves one step towards uselessness through ""blockbusterization"" of his once clever and personal film-making style. It happened before, Frankenheimer comes to my mind. His youth work (not that he is old now) was serious, by someone talented, and very pertinent. Than he had ""before sunrise"" where he came out as fresh as ever, with all the quality and spontaneity of the low budget features. ""Before sunset"" had none of that, but it was still competent and had some elements. This completely blows it. I have to see his ""Fast food nation"" to understand if this is to Linklater as a number of films (Jack, The rainmaker, etc) are to Coppola (fund raiser projects, basically) or if he's really giving up trying to do what he once did well.<br/><br/>My evaluation: 1/5 You don't have to watch it, unless for Black.<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"slokes","4","2","8","28 September 2004"," Something For The Kids
","""School Of Rock"" is cute for what it is, a kid-friendly starring vehicle for emerging comic actor Jack Black. It contains its share of engaging moments, real chuckles, and formulaic moments. The weakness of the central premise keeps SOR from being especially memorable or engaging, but it fills time well.<br/><br/>Director Richard Linklater was my main reason for wanting to see this; he was the guy that made the ultimate youth comedy, ""Dazed And Confused,"" and some other top films I've heard much about. Also, Jack Black was clearly making a sequel in spirit to another great film with rock music at its core, ""High Fidelity,"" which also featured Joan Cusack. Black got many of the big laughs in ""High Fidelity,"" so giving his clueless type-A persona a movie of his own seemed a cool idea.<br/><br/>Black plays Dewey Finn, a struggling musician who believes in the power of classic rock music, i.e. hard rock post-Beatles, pre-MTV. He finds both a job and a prospective vehicle for his musical ambitions as an impostor substitute teacher at a hoity-toity elementary prep school where the students are being loaded down with their parents' transplanted ambitions and are dying for an excuse to cut loose, especially after Finn injects them with his gospel of ""sticking it to the Man."" Finn has what they need, and they take it and try to run with it, but will the Man come down on him before they get the chance to strut what they got?<br/><br/>Watching this film, I've come to realize I enjoy Black more in smaller doses, like in ""High Fidelity"" and in ""Saving Silverman,"" where he's either a second banana or has a partner to play off of. His shtick is funny in bursts, and I think he's generally good in this film, but in his scenes with the kids, he grinds his teeth, flaps his arms, and works his eyebrows to the point of distraction. By trying to fill every moment of screen time with some silly business, Black too often comes across often as a physical comedian with nothing to say.<br/><br/>That's not to say Black is bad, just wearying and a bit one-note. He does a better job playing off his young charges than Bill Murray did in his first starring vehicle, ""Meatballs,"" and Murray's gone on to better things. The script leans too heavily on Black to provide the humor, and while Black delivered enough to make this film his career breakout, I suspect it won't have quite the shelf life in five years' time.<br/><br/>The central problem is the story. We are asked to believe that this substitute could really mold this class of yuppie offspring into Led Zeppelin wannabes over a period of weeks without their parents or the school brass catching on. There's no attempt at surrealism, like you might get in a Will Farrell comedy, because the comedy's focus is squarely on pre-pubescent audiences. I admired the film's lack of rudeness, but sometimes it's Olestra-soft. Everything happens too easy.<br/><br/>At least the kids are bright and charming, each in his or her own way. I sense we will be hearing from some of them for a while. And Joan Cusack shines as the stiff-spined school principal with a secret affection for Stevie Nicks music. Her telling a roomful of already-angry parents that she just lost their children is the biggest laugh in the movie.<br/><br/>It's scary realizing the music I grew up with is now as passÃ© as swing with the present generation, and ""School of Rock"" could have done more with that concept. It could have done more with a lot of things, but for what it is, it's better than a stick in the eye."

","""School of Rock"" is a pleasant, somewhat funny, upbeat movie, but it doesn't live up to the rave reviews it received.<br/><br/>I love rock, and I even like movies in which an inspirational teacher changes a ragtag bunch of students for the better. I liked this movie; I just wish it had had tighter pacing, less Jack Black, and more laughs.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with Jack Black being fat and outrageous. The problem is that Jack Black isn't fat and outrageous enough.<br/><br/>We have a long and hallowed tradition of fat, outrageous comic actors in this country, going back to Fatty Arbuckle and including John Belushi, John Candy, and Chris Farley. I worship at the throne of Belushi. From Samurai deli to killer bee, Belushi had some of the thinnest routines in history, but he made them come alive with just a twitch of his eyebrows.<br/><br/>Jack Black is no John Belushi. In fact, he strikes me as an uptight businessman in a fat loser's body. He doesn't have the earthiness, the inherent funniness, the weird sexuality, the musicality of a great, fat man comic actor.<br/><br/>He's okay here, just not you-laugh-just-to-see-him-on screen great.<br/><br/>Black is in just about every scene, and that gets a bit boring. The movie really takes off when some of the other cast members are allowed to shine, including Miranda Cosgrove as a very ambitious ten year old. In fact, every kid in the class/rock band is adorable, funny, and an interesting character; many are talented musicians. I wish ""Tomika"" had been given more on screen singing time.<br/><br/>One real joy here is Joan Cusack as a prep school's tightly wound principal. Cusack is pitch perfect and fully satisfying in a way that Black manages to be only intermittently. Cusack is intimidating and poignant, often at the same time ... and frequently the funniest thing on screen.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't make enough use of Cusack, and leaves her hanging, without an adequate resolution to her character's many dilemmas. That's a real lack in the plot. Cusack is so real, so endearing, and so funny, you really want to see more of her.<br/><br/>Sarah Silverman, in a supporting role, is *perfectly cast.* Silverman, as we discovered from her nasty little turn in ""The Aristocrats,"" where she made a pathetic, attention-grabbing accusation against a show biz legend, is a nasty little woman. Casting her here as a malicious, destructive female was type casting. She really conveys the menace the role requires.<br/><br/>""School of Rock"" is a sweet, upbeat movie that can give you some smiles and laughs, but it's the kind of movie I like to be doing some chore while watching; it's not a movie that requires your full attention."

To consider a few examples: 1) Dewey doesn't provide any identification to the school upon his arrival nor is he asked for any - really?? 2) The police don't take any action against Dewey despite his deliberate and repeated acts of fraud, identity theft, child abduction and child engagement and he's even able to work unsupervised with children again?- really??? 3)He has no teaching assistants in his class and he doesn't have any member of the senior member team observe him(apart from a small bit which is clearly for the purposes of plot development) 4) are we really supposed to believe that the parents seriously care about their children's education if they wait until the parents evening to voice their concerns? Wouldn't the lack of academic homework or the fact that they would have been giving vague answers about what they had done at school that day have rung alarm bells earlier - particularly as it was a private and not a public school?(and I find it impossible to believe that none of the children would have told their parents about the band) This point is made even worse by the fact that the parents of Lawrence knew he's been asked to listen to the album, which probably causes a safeguarding concern by itself as its probably not age appropriate music for a child of his age to listen to.<br/><br/>5) A battle of the bands completion can sell out a medium sized venue at 2/3 in the afternoon on a weekday? Doesn't anybody in this film have a job? 6) the promoter gave them the spot on the bill without even listening to them - for he knew they could been absolutely rubbish 7) The police weren't called when all the children went missing and the concert went ahead anyway - a quick phone call to social services could have got the place shut down in a second.<br/><br/>8) the field trip was still booked - this is the most ridiculous plot hole of all because (a) The bus would have been booked via the school and I find it hard to believe it wouldn't have been cancelled immediately once Dewey's deception was found out and (b) The Bus driver hasn't been told about the deception or even found out about it(I would imagine it would have made at least the local news or got around the town pretty quickly).<br/><br/>9) How on earth does Summer know where Dewey lives??? - either he gave her his home address(why) or she got it from the school(how) - both of which are data protection and safeguarding issues.<br/><br/>Yes, OK... it's 'just a film' but just take a moment to think about what the subtext of this 'film' is actually saying about these various issues"

The edgy Director dips his toe in the Mainstream waters and decides to dive in.<br/><br/>Jack Black's amped up performance is set at 11 on the dial, which is only a notch above his usual 10, but thankfully the Kids here keep things at less than ear-splitting level and are pleasing to the eye, with Personality and Charm.<br/><br/>Not a great Movie or anything groundbreaking, but it is a nice diversionary piece of Movie Making and is a feel good, neatly done, all around good time."

","Thrown out of the heavy-metal group he formed, chubby guitarist Jack Black (as Dewey Finn) finds his dreams of rock stardom further shattered when former band-mate Mike White (as Ned Schneebly) and shrewish live-in Sarah Silverman (as Patty DiMarco) threaten to throw him out for lacking rent money. Unsuccessful in rock, Mr. Black gets a job as a long-term sub for a classroom of ten-year-olds. With no teaching experience, Black teaches the kids the history of classic rock. For a class project, they form a group called ""School of Rock"" and take a field trip to the ""battle of the bands"" contest Black wanted to enter...<br/><br/>Aimed at a pre-teen audience and led by a star you might not trust to be kid-friendly, ""The School of Rock"" is a nice surprise. The language and sexual situations are post-TV's ""Bart Simpson"", which is tame for movies. For parents keeping track, the expletives range from ""hell"" to ""ass"" with only a hint of stronger stuff. Script by Mr. White is fun, with his and the other adults guided very well by director Richard Linklater. The students are surely professional musicians, but they all ring true as inexperienced actors; the combination works beautifully. There is little evidence of mugging, method or sickening sweetness...<br/><br/>The main focus is on Black's young front-men; possibly punk Kevin Clark (as Freddy Jones) takes the drums like AC/DC, lead guitarist Joey Gaydos (as Zack Mooneyham) picks up Deep Purple's ""Smoke on the Water"" easily, and shy keyboardist Robert Tsai (as Lawrence) grasps The Doors' ""Touch Me"" quickly. Female bass player Rebecca Brown (as Katie) has less to do. Most obvious stereotype is overweight Maryam Hassan (as Tomika), who naturally belts out Aretha Franklin's ""Chain of Fools"" on cue. Least obvious may be presumably gay ""stylist"" Brian Falduto (as Billy). As in class plays, many students must play trees...<br/><br/>Though not taking center stage, tightly-wound principal Joan Cusack (as Rosalie ""Ros"" Mullins) and budding band manager Miranda Cosgrove (as Summer Hathaway) contribute great support. White offers keen ""between the lines"" observations about the importance of a toned chest in the post-MTV generation; nothing revelatory, but it's presented in a very appealing package. The ending would have been better if Black had declined taking the microphone, and allowed one of the kids to take the lead. He should also consider substitute teaching when the acting gigs dry up. Children of all ages should appreciate the soundtrack.<br/><br/>******* The School of Rock (9/9/03) Richard Linklater ~ Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Mike White, Miranda Cosgrove"

","Critics despair at how many plot holes this film has and say it's cheesy and mimics films like Dead Poets Society. That's true - and when I watched it for the third or fourth time recently, I realised that some of the stunts that bogus emergency teacher Dewey (Jack Black) pulls off would be, er, punished rather seriously in real life. But I would advise viewers to just sit back and enjoy. The acting, the writing, the music and the kids are all fantastic. Sure, Jack Black is over the top but it really works here; you believe he really is a loser musician who is up for anything and just stumbles on to yet another scheme to try and improve his life. But he throws everything at it, despite having little chance at success, and you cheer him on. The film does have something to say about how parents who are obsessed with their kids' academic success, often don't value their kids getting into music, or even valuing them being happy pursuing what they really want to do. As the ultra-repressed, but longing to be cool, school principal Joan Cusack is very funny - a real standout of the movie, as she was in Addams Family Values. Dewey's roommates and even the kids have great timing, playing it straight to Dewey's wackiness. Little details such as Dewey assigning the kids roles in the band that match their strengths, and manipulating the class busybody to be the band manager, come off beautifully. For me, the highlight is Dewey's manic address to the parents. Good on them for keeping it in the film. And any film that showcases bands like AC/DC is OK by me."

"chelsearhyan","8","0","1","28 August 2010"," Favorite movie for 7 years!
","""School of Rock"" has been one of my favorite movies since its release in 2003; however, my eighteen year old self appreciates the humor much more than my preteen self. That is primarily why I love this movie so much; even seven years later, I still find the film entertaining. Furthermore, with each viewing of the movie (and I've literally watched it ten times), I notice or learn something else about a particular character. Undoubtedly, there is no shortage of characters in this film. While I find that irritating and disrupting in other movies, I like the large number of differing personalities, opinions, and perspectives brought forth by the lengthy ""School of Rock"" cast. Presumably, one would imagine that because of the films' PG-13 rating and the age of the main actors, the humor would only be suitable for teenagers. Although I am still a teenager myself, I would imagine that people of all ages would enjoy this movie. Additionally, considering most of the actors in this movie were kids, the acting itself deserves some attention. I was surprisingly impressed with their comedic timing, as plenty of more experienced actors still struggle with the delivery of a joke. As with any movie, ""School of Rock"" is flawed. Firstly, I do not find the script to be anywhere close to original, though I find it hilarious. The movie by no means was unpredictable, nor suspenseful, nor left me feeling compelled or curious. It's definitely a mindless film, which can be taken as a pro or con. While I do enjoy leisurely films that don't require me to piece together ambiguous parts of the plot, some level of suspense or inquiry is also appreciated. As I mentioned earlier, I don't find this movie to be anywhere near the realm of original. In fact, I find the plot of the movie ""Kicking and Screaming"" to be very similar. In brief, Jack Black's character starts a band with a group of kids in attempt to battle his old band because they ditched him. In ""Kicking and Screaming"", Will Ferrell's character coaches a little league soccer team in attempts to show his father that he is capable of following through with something. In addition to having a parallel theme, the style of humor in both movies is extremely comparable. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a good (but not particularly advanced or witty) sense of humor. Although I wouldn't categorize this film as unique or innovative, I still definitely think it's a must see!"

","The School of Rock is an enormously entertaining feel-good family film, that is nigh on perfection. The story is great, and doesn't preach in any way, and Jack Black, who I like, although I hated NeverEnding Story 3 which had him in(and wasted him), is outstanding as Dewey Finn, an ex-rocker who is hired as a substitute teacher at a prep school. Joan Cusack gives a very good account of herself as the prim and proper headmistress, and all the children, whom Dewey accidentally discovers their musical talents give strong performances too. The soundtrack is awesome, and the script verges very often to hysterically funny, with some undertone of sensitivity. There are one or two slow bits in the middle half, other than that, it is an exhilarating and hugely enjoyable comedy film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","""The School of Rock"" is a fun and lighthearted movie. Even it's rated PG, it could may be suitable for kids, cause it's not the worst film a child could watch (parents who are reading this, please don't kill me, he he).<br/><br/>The story is simple and predictable, but it's still working. But there are some few problems; the movie is starting too fast and when it finally have really starting the plot (or saying, when Jack are starting the rock group with the children), the story slows down quite for a long time during the movie.<br/><br/>Jack Black acts well as the eccentric rock vocalist, but he doesn't show a big range of emotions on his act. Joan Cusack is very stiff as the principal Mullins and Mike White as Ned Schneebly is just embarrassing.<br/><br/>But those things aren't ruining the movie at all. The children actors does a great job without stealing the entire show away. I especially liked the character of Summer, who were funny and charming (SPOILER: to quote her: ""I've searched groupies on the Internet; They're sluts who sleeps with the band!"" SPOILERS OVER). I also liked the character of Patty, Ned's girlfriend, who were annoying, but also funny in her own way. The songs are enjoyable and the dialog is funny. <br/><br/>And besides, fortunately you don't need to be rock fan to enjoy this movie. So rock on! Hehe."

","No one should ever underestimate a child. The life-affirming feeling I got from watching this film came from seeing the kids in the film play the music and being real kids. Jack Black's character, while being a fake teacher, actually turned himself into the sort of teacher who makes a real impression on his pupils - the sort who inspires them to do great things. The unlikely events of the plot were easy to believe because of the enthusiasm of all involved, it wasn't at all cheesy and the music was great. The British TV show Rock School, where a real ex-rocker went into a real school and made a rock band out of some pupils, must have been based on this film concept, and that was exciting too. This film reminded me of what I liked about the show, but The School of Rock is better, in terms of excitement and sheer entertainment value. The kids involved were very young, but as we all know, kids can do anything and if you are talented, you are never too young to be musical."

He then teaches the class about rock music and the history rock and he forms a band with them and himself and enters them in the battle f the bands, but while they win battle of the bands and will he get caught out? I really do believe that this movie brought rock music to teens and especially the old rock bands. Everyone knows who the Beatles are and the Rolling Stones, but before this movie not many knew who Led Zeppelin of ACDC was or at least listened to their music and this movie really brought the rock legends back into people midscope. I think this is a great movie and although the storyline is a bit unbelievable I still think it makes a great movie and definitely one you would want to watch again and again.

","I didn't realise that the main star of this film was really a singer and had his own band, so he was definitely the right choice for main character, and song writer/performer. Golden Globe nominated Jack Black stars as Dewey Finn, a rocker who has recently had a lowdown because his band is breaking up, but he vows to create his own new band to go to the Battle of the Bands. One day there is a call for Dewey's roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White), for a new substitute teacher at an elementary school, and he knows Ned gets loads a week for that, so he takes his place. When he goes to the school, he originally didn't care about teaching the kids anything, but when he hears them playing musical instruments, he gets the idea for a ""special project"". He gets these kids to practise playing rock music, studying it, creating all the necessary elements for a band, and assigning them all places in the band. Obviously he is doing this in secret, without Principal Rosalie Mullins (Toys' Joan Cusack) knowing. It is really good to see how enthusiastic Dewey is about rock, the preparation for the Battle of the Bands, and the kids are all fantastic.

","I wouldn't put The School of Rock into a pantheon of great, artistic cinema lists, but then again the subject matter itself defies that possibility. Fact is, like the film Airheads (only this film is a little more convincing in its 'logic'), School of Rock is like that fresh treat of a comedy that I wish in some ways I saw as kid, as I know I would've been even more amazed at its silliness but also its true enthusiasm for rock music, GOOD rock music I might add. It's not just that it has director Richard Linklater- who also laid down his film Dazed and Confused with the same good solid hard rock and roll pathos- giving the film some needed push into the right direction (through Mike White's clever script), but also because he lets the reins off just enough on Jack Black. He is an actor with such a distinctive personality he either elicits his avid admirers (some through Tenacious D), or adamant boo's. But even those who usually aren't Black fans tend to gravitate to this film- it contains some of his wackiness and over-the-top zeal, but it also has him giving a good performance, like in his breakthrough in High Fidelity.<br/><br/>And Linklater, as with Black, is testing different ground here- working with kids. This is so tricky that it's very hard to explain it to some; having multiple children characters in a film can be OK if you're doing something typical like a 'keeping-hope-alive-in-a-school melodrama'. This time though there has to be enough personality to contend- and play off on- Black. It's here where there's some very good ground laid out; Black's character is meant to go through some sort of transformation through working with these kids, obviously through just being himself (and not through some incredible higher cause like in more self-conscious films), while still having fun. Most of the kids are given enough back-story to not be just cardboard cut-outs, and I liked that they took their roles with equal sincerity and coolness. They're are even a few laughs that come from scenes where the kids bring out some of their own 'wit' against Black.<br/><br/>But then it comes down though to two things in recommending this film- do you find Jack Black funny, or at least entertaining to an extent, and do you like him rocking out like a 70's party animal? There are some of the obligatory obvious scenes early on in the film, mostly as set-up, as he gets kicked out of his band, leading him to secretly take a substituting job with the kids at the school. And some little scenes of minor characters ironically don't work as well as the ones with the children, like the 'Edge of Seventeen' scene at the bar with Joan Cusack. And maybe being more of a casual observer of Black's work over the years seeing his work in a film like this once is enough for a while (I actually haven't seen the film in some many months, though fresh in my mind). But ultimately the film works as a mix of tongue-in-cheek with, what one critic compared to slightly Dead Poets Society touch of teacher-pupils storytelling, where even if you're not rolling in your seat with laughs you're probably grinning most of the way...and as one who is still heavily into the kind of rock that is played by the (talented) kids in the film, I can't help but feel some glee that songs by the Doors and Led Zeppelin get such prominence in a major studio film at a time when good rock music is getting harder to find in them.

","Jack Black is an acquired taste. At least for me he is. I saw him on a Conan O'Brien special once and became a little intrigued by the guy. So I went out and rented a movie called ""Shallow Hal"". I enjoyed it. After that I rented this one. This was even better. The guy is actually FUNNY. Black plays Dewey Finn, a musician who gets kicked out of his band just before they enter a Battle of the Bands contest. In order to make some money he takes a job subbing at a private elementary school and discovers that the kids in his class are pretty good musicians themselves so he starts his own band with the kids. It's funny and the kids in the movie are actual musicians. It really is enjoyable from beginning to end. Roger Ebert recommended it but mentioned that he couldn't understand the PG-13 rating.

","As we find out on the DVD 'extras', Mike White wrote this script for his friend, Jack Black, who is a rock music junkie, and who also sings in his own band. So Black is totally in his element here, more ways than one, and it shows with the ease that he carries this movie. He is probably playing himself before receiving big paychecks for major movie roles. In this movie, he is a struggling rock musician who gets a job as a substitute teacher to make a few bucks, then proceeds to teach rock music to the kids, his principal, played perfectly by Joan Cusack, oblivious to his daily routine. Of note is that hundreds of musical children aged 10 or 11, non-actors, were auditioned for the roles of the students, and they played their own instruments in the movie. As did Jack Black, who also has quite a good singing voice when he isn't acting too crazy. Good, entertaining movie. DVD has very interesting extras involving the selection of the kids and the making of the movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ABOUND in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, you may want to quit reading NOW!! Black is kicked off the band he started, is freeloading on his friend (played by writer Mike White), whose girlfriend is encouraging him to evict Black. So he impersonates his friend to get a substitute teaching job paying $650 weekly. Not interested in teaching, he realizes some of the students can play music, so organizes them into a rock band for a $20,000 prize 'battle of the bands' competition. When a check from the school shows up for his roommate, the girlfriend gets wise and calls the cops, who meet Black in his classroom. Busted, he evades jail but is sent home, the day before the band battle. The kids convince a school bus driver to take them anyway, they pick up Black on the way there, onstage when the parents all arrive, kids perform, are the hit with the audience, are called for an encore, but Black's old band win the prize."

But, then after hearing them in music class, he decides to form a band with the kids in order to enter the battle of the bands contest.<br/><br/>So, he assigns jobs for all the kids. And I ask, how could no one in the school hear a couple of electric guitars and drums being played several hours a day. Then the movie has the very stereo-typical students who are fat or not popular and being encouraged, in this case by Black, to go out and prove they are not losers.<br/><br/>Joan Cusak plays the rule obsessed principle, and Black sort of becomes friends with her. I guess they didn't have the two hook up since Cusak is so old. But, I found this film boring and not funny. It seemed sort of like kindergarden cop, where we have someone becoming a teacher who has no business being one.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I guess teens may like it and those who love rock.

Although you might say Black was over acting, I think it needed him to be on super acting mode to keep audiences interested and laugh along to the jokes. The children were on the whole fairly good and the concert at the end was enjoyable.

","SPOILERS AHEAD A very poor story, typical Hollywood film which is clearly inconsistent. For example, in that famous school, they do not check the identity of the people who try to work there. However, even a bad story can be turned into a good movie with the help of the characters involved, and, most important, the music. Two or three children play their part very well, and so does Black. Finally, a great soundtrack which includes AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Who, and the children learning how to play Deep Purple and The Doors (among others) make you want to jump into the movie and be part of the band.

Because its musical references were too much to expect in the city where I live, which is more prone to Sonar's experimental electronica rather than to sustain my eternal allegation to rock music. That's a fact.<br/><br/>I saw the posters for the movie last December, I think. I immediately tried to see it in the original version, but... no f'ing way. No cinema had programmed it in English. You're in Spain, my friends said. I was determined to not laugh with dubbed, dumbed-up gags, so I decided to download it from the 'Net which I did. I saw it four times within the four days that followed, and then I was ready to pay my ticket to hear a sorry local singer unsuccessfully committing the crime to dub Jack Black's incomparable witticism. I had the same laughs at the cinema, but only by remembering Jables' voice!<br/><br/>Yesterday I rented the DVD version. I saw it once with a bunch of friends and once again with another, extras included.

","In School of Rock Zack the 10 year old guitar prodigy steals the show. Joan Cusack shines as Rosalie Mullins. Cusack comes across as being lovably neurotic. Jack Black gets some unintentional laughs for his choice of albums to review. Yes and Rush are the mammoth like survivors of the 70s progressive rock era. Bands that kept their youthful exuberance come to mind like Van Halen or David Lee Roth as more appropriate choices to listen to. I had a teacher once who was posing as something more than he was. Warrant Mercer wanted to have a Reconaissance Course with the Irish Regiment of Canada but he didn't have enough instructors. So he started the course anyway and then cancelled it on the second day. The RECON training I got was wonderful and plus I got paid for the days I worked. I learned from the RECON course and my Military Intelligence Course that the Russians and Chinese are land hungry and will attack America in one big Airborne assault just like in the movie Red Dawn. WHEN the attack comes all Americans have a Choice to make about whether they keep a low profile or Join in the Resistance to the Occupation by Russia and China. As an outspoken critic of the Russian and Chinese expansionist militaries I would try to get refugee status in America and then help America legally as much as I could. Just ask the Dalai Lama of Tibet how much compassion the Army of the Peoples Republic of China had when they invaded and occupied Tibet. The answer is no compassion was shown by the Chinese. I think that Director Richard Linklater did a great job keeping the band the SCHOOL OF ROCK visible in low lighting scenes. School of Rock is a believable band by the end of the movie. I gave school of rock a 9 out of 10."

The reason i enjoyed this movie - are freaky and charming placements of AC/DC, Ramones, Led Zep, White Stripes and many many more heavy/punky rockin' bands. It's a charming movie experience in these times, when most of the screens stuffed with hip-hop, r&b and other doubtful stars performances.

Black's character Dewey Finn remaining unchallenged for several weeks in his purloined identity as his substitute teacher roommate Ned Schneebly is just too ridiculous. I realize a certain suspension of disbelief is often necessary to make a movie work; but if that's the case, why not just have him flash lightning bolts from his eyeballs? It's about as believable. Anyone familiar with Black's work in Tenacious D (where their tour bus popping oat Satan's asscrack is assumed to be high hilarity) knows this guy's managed to escalate a third-place performance in a local air-guitar contest into an actual movie career. And I'm so tired of major corporations (Paramount) promoting the idea that ""sticking it to the man"" is better than actually studying in school.

The movie was obviously made with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of love for the subject matter, and I have to say that the music is great.<br/><br/>That's were the good things end though. I take it that this is supposed to be a comedy, but there are little really funny parts, and most of them are in the first 30 minutes.

He is child-like and only temporarily childish; the students have much on him as far as intellect and deportment, even prep school savvy.  If you can suspend your disbelief that a Principal with a gloved ""iron fist"" would let the situation get so far away from her control, then you will like the movie for its appealing aspects (rock philosophy, history, theory, etc.).

"inzen19","7","0","1","28 February 2004"," a personal review
","School of Rock,is the latest from Richard Linklater. I have always felt that Linklater had a political undertone in the majority of his movies. If you look back at Newton Boys, Slacker and (obviously) Waking Life (even the discussions of Before Sunrise) a pattern develops. Rebels, social discontents, philosophical think tanks all pointing to dissent by any means to deconstruct an absurdly founded world. The man who brought back the art of conversation to film and managed to give the library hermits and coffee junkies something to talk about. Now the man takes a swim into the main stream. Some would say he has already but I don't know them. School of Rock is just that to the audience, a brief history of an idea. Rebellion is it's own form of justice and it's pointed towards anyone who finds no satisfaction in the money offered for the collar. I find it sad that in this age of Hot Topic and superficiality some people may get nothing out of this movie. Jack Black obviously has the message, his performance is convincing yet overly rambunctious at times. He was the mainstream lure but he is no poser. The 13 rating I felt was a limitation and could have been done with a solid R, but this was not a message for adults only. However for it to be kid friendly the price is it must be conservative parent friendly, hence the unsettling mind bending ending of smiling parents.  The kids are good actors for what of being. But what the movie is, is a reminder to those that know and a message for those listening that the revolution can still have a soundtrack."

","I suppose one could review this movie with a single sentence: If you like Jack Black, you'll like the movie.  Of course the flip side is if you find Jack Black unbearable, you'd be better off avoiding this flick and catch The Rundown or some other lightweight time waster.<br/><br/>I'm on the fence.  While I find Black humorous in a smaller supporting role, I don't enjoy him in large doses.  The campy eyebrow athletics, exaggerated over enunciation and spastic physical movements wear thin quickly.  For those of us old enough to remember John Belushi or even Chris Farley it's hard not to watch Black without a constant sense of deja-vu.<br/><br/>But, Jack Black not withstanding, this movie has a few other problems that kept me from enjoying it and has me baffled by the almost unanimously glowing reviews.<br/><br/>First, all of the characters are about as one-dimensional as you can get. Granted, this isn't a serious character study or a deep, dialogue driven set piece, but still, you could describe each character totally in one short sentence.  Loser, slack off rocker with a dream.  Mousy roommate who gave up the dream.  Shrewish girlfriend.  Uptight authority figure, etc.<br/><br/>Now here is where we get to the biggest frustrations, the wildly cliched and almost offensive stereotyping regarding the child actors.<br/><br/>Let's see, the Asian keyboard whiz (complete with glasses and accent), the portly 'soul singer', the rocker drummer, the brow-beat waspy guitarist, the pushy ""A-type"" manager and probably the most disturbing, the gay Liza Minelli loving fashion designer.  The kids' performances were good, with little of the smarmy precociousness you'd expect.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is as well-worn as Columbo's trenchcoat.  Screw authority, down with 'the man' who only wants to kill your dreams, rock will save the world.  Of course, I couldn't help but notice how ironic is was that many of the examples Jack Black's character used as examples of rock's ""true purpose"" were either victim's of their own excessive lifestyles or became boring old institutions themselves.  How can rock save the world if it can't save itself?<br/><br/>Of course, in true Hollywood fashion, everyone comes around in the end and embraces the loser and his posse of juvenile rockers.  Well, everyone that is except the token villain (Sarah Silverman in a wasted role) who disappears without fanfare once her function is fulfilled.<br/><br/>Is it a horrible movie? No, in fact it's a cute movie to see with your family, which I suspect is the reason for the glowing reviews.  (I have no idea why it's rated PG-17).  The kids will identify with the students and probably enjoy Black's clownish performance and the adults will enjoy some of the rock references and soundtrack.  But I wonder how much better it might have been with a little more thought and originality."
