","As a husband who has a wife battling for her life with recurrent ovarian cancer, this movie struck very close to home. We a both in our late 20's and I am facing the possibility of burying my wife far to young, so suffice to say we both went to the movie and had a hard time keeping the eyes dry. There is nothing worse then prospect or actuality of burying your lover and your friend. I know this movie got a lot of negative reviews but when you see your life mirrored on the big screen you can't help but be moved by her struggle to move on and his undying love for her. I see another reviewer said to keep the boyfriends/husbands home, these people obviously have not faced such tragic circumstances. Usually I'd be the first to tear apart a click flick, but this didn't feel as cliché as most and I liked how the ending wasn't as predictable as click flick movies usually are."
"CihanVercan","9","63","72","27 December 2008"," Helping Lost People Finding Where Their Hearts Are
","People change in time, relationships change in time; Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife, through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people, if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly. <br/><br/>Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt, but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan(whom we'll see him in ""Watchmen"" next year) playing as her second. As a novel adaptation, the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker, which I disagree; it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes, that's all. <br/><br/>There are 5 of my favorite scenes which I rewind each time I watch: 1*One of the greatest opening scenes for a romance of all time. In that scene just in 2 minutes, we get what type of personalities each character has. Lovers find a quarrel over a straw. They yell at each other, and Gerry leaves Holly getting out of the door. A minute passes or not, Holly comes back from bathroom and Gerry back from the door. Then they wildly lock in a close embrace after running towards to each other into the middle of the living room... 2*After the funeral of Gerry, at a time when Holly's longing of him hits the top, she can't help herself calling the home-phone from her cellphone just to listen to Gerry's voice from his answering machine record; while trying to sleep... 3*Holly's receiving of Gerry's first P.S.I Love You letter and his true guesses of what Holly is going to say in respond after his each time of gaffes... 4*Gerry's calling to memory of their first meeting in Ireland, from his words... 5*And best of all, my best favorite scene: Holly's return to karaoke stage singing ""Love You Till The End"" and imagining as if he is there forming a lonesome audience. This scene is the one I burst into tears. I don't remember myself crying because of a movie, or because of someone else's sadness ever; including the end of Dr.Zhivago or Love Story or The English Patient. Yet it just reminded me of a photo of my fiancée with whom we were parted away. In that photo she was standing on a step of an amphitheater watching my mockery of a stand-up show at the stage, forming the whole audience herself. <br/><br/>This is a therapeutic relationship movie. Watch it with your partner and you'll be able to see the missing, lacking or the incomplete part of your unity. Strongly recommended for couples who used to be in love before. Find out why love is eternal."
"segacs","7","147","184","26 January 2008"," Total tearjerker falsely billed as a romantic comedy
","I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.<br/><br/>But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it's sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues. Don't say I didn't warn you."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","188","245","26 December 2007"," P.S. Move On
","In a poignant scene Gerald Butler's spirit of Gerry confesses to Hilary Swank's Holly, ""I'm not asking you to remember me"" and to move on. Although being a little too long, Writer and Director Richard LaGravenese's ""P.S. I Love You"" is a whimsical and surprisingly touching romantic comedy about life continuing forward. Swank and LaGravenese have collaborated before on ""Freedom Writers"" as evidenced in the movie's comfortable and sturdy feel. Hilary Swank is great in this romantic comedy, an edgy departure for the actor. Swank thrives--she never forces the humor, completely natural. She embodies a humanity and spirit in Holly that makes her vulnerable and funny in the story's context. Gerald Bulter is boldly charming as Holly's late husband Gerry, the Irishman full of life and dreams. Swank and Butler have a wondrous chemistry that smooths out the rougher edges of LaGravenese and Steve Rogers screenplay based on the novel by Wendy Finerman.<br/><br/>Even with its over wrought indulgences, ""P.S. I Love You"" rewards the narrative payoff. Wisely on the part of LaGravenese and Rogers, the catharsis opts for the lyrical and realm of possibility. The performances are stellar. Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates is awesome as Holly's mother Patricia. Seeing fellow Oscar Winner Swank and Bates together is truly something special. There is a heartbreaking scene where Swank's Holly breaks down to her mother saying, ""I'm alone!"" Later Bates's Patrica says to her daughter, ""If you're all alone, we're all together with you in that, too."" So even with its intentional quirks and cheesy trappings-- all is forgiven, because ultimately ""P.S. I Love You"" is about the courage to love again and live life.<br/><br/>As ""P.S"" opens Holly is furious that Gerry told her mother at dinner that they are not planning on having kids right now. Although accurate, Holly is still livid. Holly laments that she is waiting for her life to start. Gerry reminds, ""We are in life"" Transparent to us: Gerry and Holly are soul matesthe great love of each other's life. Fast forward several months, Gerry has died of a brain tumor. After the wake, Holly discovers that Gerry has arranged for the delivery of his letters all making requests of Holly. Unable or perhaps unwilling to move on after her loss, this may not be the best thing for Holly. Or is it a way for Holly to discover life anew? <br/><br/>Much of the movie's charm derives from Holly's trip to Gerry's Irish homeland, and her loyal friends. Lisa Kudrow plays Denise, Holly's gal pal who is crassly determined to hunt down a single, straight, and employed mana crusade seemingly more difficult than it seems. Kudrow is at her scattered and hysterical best. Hot and sexy Gina Gershon plays other gal pal Sharon. Gershon is deceivingly strong and smart with the apparently vapid Sharon, who really possesses a depth of character. In a surprising moment in what initially feels like a frivolously long fishing scene with all three women, reminds Holly that her friends are moving on with their lives. Holly's trip to Ireland is a beautiful interlude that represents an eloquent return to the traditional and solid. Here LaGravenese brilliantly orchestrates his story of love everlasting and regret. Hilary Swank amazingly balances the suffering and resolute spirit in Holly. She too is brilliant and absolutely beautiful. Her smile just lights up your soul, and her anguish strikes an emotional chord. Gerald Butler is at his charismatic best. Butler also expertly tempers his charm with a touching and gentle compassion.<br/><br/>""P.S. I Love You"" is one of the best romantic comedies in a long while, that has a great love story. Richard LaGravenese tells a wistful and touching tale with amazing performances and chemistry by Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler. Take a chance on ""P.S. I Love You""."
"momdeafmd","10","83","108","2 December 2007"," Loved PS I Love You!!!
","I was lucky enough to get advance screening tickets to go see this movie. I loved it! It is very funny and very romantic. It stars Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (that gorgeous hunk of man who starred in 300, if you haven't seen it--go rent it).<br/><br/>At the start of the movie, Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) are married and they are having a marital spat, which, trust me, is hilarious. Let's just say they end the fight with him doing a very funny striptease. In the next scene, we find that he has died. Holly is so bereaved she is unable to function but soon letters start arriving--from Gerry. He spaces the letters about a month apart and in each letter he teaches Holly how to get on with the business of living.<br/><br/>Her ensuing adventures with best friends, Lisa Kudrow and Lisa Gershon are hilarious. Along the way, she meets Harry Connick, Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who played Denny in Grey's Anatomy). The supporting cast is wonderful (especially the hilarious Lisa Kudrow). The movie is very funny, much more funny than sad. And Gerard Butler is quite terrific in it (and I am not just saying that because I am a fan). He is romantic, sexy, and just plain sweet. The striptease scene alone is worth the price of admission. I never laughed so hard.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is very, very good. She and Gerry have really great chemistry. In the scenes they have together, you totally see how much in love they are with each other and why Holly is so bereaved when he dies. Although the movie does stray from the book at times, in my opinion it's an improvement. For example, Gerard Butler is not only in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie, but he is also in it quite a bit through flashbacks and such. Plus you get to hear him sing (which he has not done in a movie since ""The Phantom of the Opera"").<br/><br/>So if you get a chance this holiday season, go see this wonderful romantic, funny movie. You will love it! Amy V."

","(Synopsis) Holly (Hilary Swank) has been married nine years to a wild Irishman, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler), and her one true love. Unfortunately for Holly, Gerry is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. Knowing he only has a short time to live; Gerry writes Holly a series of letters that will guide her through her grief. The first message arrives on Holly's 30th birthday. Gerry has sent her a birthday cake and a tape recording explaining the letters that she will be getting in the mail. Over the next year, Gerry wants Holly to follow the orders in his letters by going on new adventures and to celebrate life by finding herself. Holly's best friends, Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon), accompany her on her journey. Gerry always signs off each letter with ""P.S. I Love You."" <br/><br/>(My Comment) This is definitely a chick flick that will not only make you cry, but make you laugh, plus the women will fall in love with Gerard Butler. Gerard was excellent in his part and Hilary did a fine job as well. At first I didn't think Hilary could pull off the romantic comedy role, but in the end you get use to her doing it. Hilary actually makes you feel her pain and how devastated she was when her husband died. I guarantee you that you will tear up during several scenes. Overall it was an enjoyable chick flick that you can take a date. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:06, Rated PG-13) (7/10)"
"AbadKitty","10","142","192","26 December 2007"," Great Movie, Must See Romantic Comedy.
","My most favorite romantic chick flick the last two years!! What makes this movie so great is if you have no expectation. Because of reviews and not thinking Hilary Swank could pull off romantic made this movie shine. She pulls it off and the movie is way better than the reviews. Tear Jerker! The shining happy moments are definitely the comedy relief Harry Connick Jr. brings. He is good in this movie... sexy... charming and hilarious. This movie has a great ending and just is so beautiful. I read half the book and wow, the movie makes the book look bad. The movie is better than the book!<br/><br/>Now I love seeing girly movies, mostly they have disappointed me or been just okay. This one was better than all the rest."
"KaceFace000","8","56","77","21 December 2007"," Awesome chick flick
","I am so glad I went against the many negative reviews of this movie... because it was fantastic! It has stuck with me in the several hours since I've seen it. Claims that Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler have no chemistry just are not true- the characters are different, and they clash at times, but this shouldn't be misconstrued. One can definitely see the love they have for each other, though the ways they express it are very different. Never has a movie pushed me to the brink of tears so many times! Sure, in Titanic we all (or was it just me...?) cried when we realized Leo's character had died, but P.S. I Love You brings that feeling several times over. It is so relatable- how would we act if we were completely grief-stricken with nothing to comfort us? I love this movie- both my friend that saw it with me and myself fully intend on buying it on DVD when it is released. Highly recommended. Don't forget Kleenex! *Kudos to Kudrow who is freaking hilarious!*"

","Okey ladies i went to see P.S. I Love You last night with a girl friend now that we are both back in the OC for winter break. I have to say this movie is all i hoped it would be and more. I sobbed for a whole 2 hours, not kidding. It was sad yet uplifting and made me really think about life.<br/><br/>I'm 19 and a freshman in college, i went to an all girl's catholic high school. So personally this movie really hit home, and made me think ""What if i don't ever find my Gerry?"" I mean I'm 19 and I've never been kissed or been on a date. It just got me thinking about the fact that life is short and i want to be happy. I want my Gerry (obviously he doesn't have too be this romantic) but someone to love me with their whole heart as Gerry loved Holly. It also gave me some hope, maybe there is a Gerry out there for everyone. My friend and i went to chili's for dinner after and i pretty much cried through dinner but like i said this movie really hit me.<br/><br/>It was absolutely perfect and even the scenes that our Gerry wasn't in, his presence could be seen and felt every step of the way. All i can say is that GB has moved me in a way i never thought possible with a movie. I think this one has actually changed my life for the better or at least pushed me in the right direction.<br/><br/>Even after seeing JDM nekkid bum i must say our man still wins my heart. His voice is so amazing, and many times that all there was in a scene, just his voice yet it had me busting out into tears every time. I am still letting this amazing experience sink in but all i can say is, if i ever could say one thing to our Gerry, it would be that, he has truly made me love my life and hope that the love of my life is out there somewhere.<br/><br/>Oh, and Gerry's singing is amazing too, as are all his witty remarks and comments.... i can still hear his voice in my head! Erinne P.S. I Love You.... Till The End"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","60","86","20 March 2008"," P.S. = Pleasant Surprise
","Generally speaking, I dislike the romantic American tearjerker dramas especially films like 'Titanic'. So i tend to avoid them. A few that I have liked include 'Far and Away' and 'The English Patient' (which was much more than the average movie of this genre). What interested me about 'P.S. I Love You' was the interesting ensemble cast. Now that I have watched the film, I must say that it came as a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>I found it very fresh: the cast which brings together talents like Lisa Kudrow, Kathy Bates and Hilary Swank; the idea of shooting in Ireland was very refreshing and the beautiful locations were so wonderfully shot that it just makes one want to visit the beautiful country; the screenplay, yes it is flawed as there are a few corny moments and some of the situations are a little too convenient but most of the dialogues are great, the comedic undertone is mostly welcoming and not misplaced, the ending is different from what one would expect; the soundtrack which adds more life into the moments.<br/><br/>It's ironic that just the other day I watched 'Reign Over Me' which also dealt with 'grieving over' lost loved ones. Both films were totally different but it was interesting to see how the central character of both films deal, or more correctly, fail to cope with their losses in different ways. Both the writer and director LaGravenese put a lot of heart into 'P.S. I Love You' and the film is strengthened by the chemistry of the actors.<br/><br/>Both Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent. The chemistry between them is electric. Swank gracefully shows Holly's transition from the whiny but loving working wife to the lonely widow. In a flashback scenes we see her brilliantly pull off the naive teenager. It's no surprise that the woman can act. Butler is terrific as the charming, lively and funny Gerry but his grasp of the Irish accent is disastrous. Lisa Kudrow provides comic relief. The actress gives a natural performance with shades of her famous Phoebe Buffay character (which I didn't mind as I miss Phoebe) but I wish she was given more screen time. Even Gina Gershon springs a surprise with a decent performance. Kathy Bates's acting is beautifully restrained. Harry Connick Jr. too adds some comedy (which might not appeal to all).<br/><br/>'P.S. I Love You' makes for a good rainy day film. It might not appeal to all as there are a few fluffy corny moments but the film does make its point well and for me it was worth a watch."
"DeadliestSin","7","34","48","13 December 2007"," Heartwrenching and hilarious
","I am often disappointed when I go to see a movie, and all the good parts that were shown in the trailer- were the ONLY good parts in the movie. This film, however, managed to live up to the trailer and many of the best moments of the film were left out of the trailer and for good reason, as to not ruin the surprises.<br/><br/>I found Hillary Swank's character, Holly, to be believable in her grief and her inability to function after loosing the man she had been married to for 11 years to a brain tumor. I recently lost my mother to a brain tumor as well. I was able to empathize with her character in the feelings of loss and confusion. Through a series of letters her husband, Gerry, wrote prior to his death, Holly attempts to pick up her life and learn how to go on living without her husband. The movie is filled with flashbacks that show the viewer the type of life this couple had, coupled with moments in which Holly believes her husband to be 'there' with her. I cannot go without mentioning the great performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who plans an Irishman that Holly meets while on a trip back to her late husbands hometown. He's pretty nice to look at too. Overall, wonderful performances by both Gerard Butler and Jeffery Dean Morgan. Hillary Swank managed to carry the story well, in a genre she usually does not venture into, but has done well in film."
"ayeluvyew","10","62","100","5 June 2008"," Drama? Romantic Comedy? Who cares? This is the best film EVER!
","I have never felt compelled to leave a comment about a film until i saw P.S. I Love You. The emotional journey of the story was engulfing and intense. The comical and dramatic aspects of the film were both nurtured and explored deeply. I've never cried and laughed at the same time. <br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend anyone to watch this film. In fact, after watching it with my mom I plan to watch it with my boyfriend!<br/><br/>Lastly, I would recommend that you watch the deleted scenes. The last one (showing the McCarthy couple - Gina Gershon and James Marsters) was truly touching, and I wish it hadn't been cut out of the film."

","Holly (Hillary Swank) has been married for a number of years to handsome Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish gentleman. Wed at 19, he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly, however, Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies, leaving Holly desolate. But, much to her surprise, letters start arriving from Gerry, under unusual circumstances, letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland, where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon), a hovering mother (Kathy Bates), and a good-looking new friend (Harry Connick, Jr.) looking out for her, also. But, can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but, I must confess, I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes, I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband, with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact, Butler is a new favorite among American women, thanks to Dear Frankie, and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow, Gershon, Bates, Connick Jr., and some of the Irish players are just right, too, breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course, the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful, as are the costumes and great camera work. But, the film could have used more careful direction and editing, in my view. However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around."
"KittyGrimm","9","58","99","29 December 2007"," Not just a chick flick
","To be fully honest, I'm not one for what we know as ""chick-flicks"" because of their tendency to be as predictable as a crystal ball or as cheesy as cheese. However, hearing that Gerard Butler and James Marsters were both in this film together, seeing as I adore both actors for many different reasons, I thought I might be able to stomach it and maybe even have a laugh. <br/><br/>By the end of the film, I found this film to be more than just a ""chick-flick""; it was instead a bittersweet story about a young widow, played by the strongly talented Hilary Swank, coping with the death of her husband through letters that he'd written for her teaching her how to live and remember how to be happy with herself. All in all, I'd say it was a great film. It was one of those film that can make you smile, scream, laugh and cry and the writers capture the audiences emotions beautifully. <br/><br/>The writer has clearly gone through the same situation of losing a loved one because if I'm not mistaken, I do recall hearing my grandmother going through the same emotions that Swank's character was going through after her own husband passed away. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is perfectly done. Butler, though he can't hold an Irish accent very well, plays the role of a goofball perfectly, especially in his striptease scene and when he was watching his wife sing a sexy karaoke tune (poor guy was trying to contain himself while covering Marsters' eyes). Swank is also hilarious and in a scene when she's crying in an emotional breakdown, she plays it more realistically than I have ever seen on film. <br/><br/>What is also great about the film is that it rebels against most romantic comedies by practically spoofing typical chick-flick events, which was a great relief to me, since the recycled plots that I see in too many films and books nowadays (*cough*Enchanted*cough*) gets more than just annoying. Out of ten, I will give it a nine because the only problem I had with the film was Butler's accent. Other than that, it was a great film with a well-chosen cast and a well-written script."

","I've felt the need to write the first movie review on my profile. If no news is good news, I have a lot of news. It started with some lame, god-awful song. The opening scene went from the characters, Holly and Gery, played by Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (who had absolutely no chemistry at all), fighting to having sex. The second scene? Gery's funeral. What?! Oh right, a brain tumor, I guess...<br/><br/>Because you weren't able to get to know Gery as a character, you weren't able to feel any emotion when he died. Then the whole movie focused around some letters he wrote before he died. He arranged them to be sent to Holly after he had passed. One told her to dress in a dreadful disco dress and sing some boring karaoke song at the bar all while being tone deaf. I didn't really understand the point of this.<br/><br/>Did I mention the acting? Gag me. Remember when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year? Hilary Swank should have received a Razzie for this acting. Her acting in this movie was unemotional and very lacking. I'm talking about crying with a scrunched up face and no tears. Near the end when she buries her face into her mom's shoulder is when she didn't even have any tears. The comedy was a big fail. Holly and her two friends were on a boat. Their oars fell into the water and were FIVE FEET from the boat, so what did they do? Started screaming for help in the middle of the deserted lake and let the oars float away.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for a laugh, kept waiting for something big to happen, kept waiting to be touched... Nothing. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie."

I just thought all of the plot lines were just way too unbelievable. I did not think Lisa Kudrow was cast well in this movie, nor was Harry Connick, Jr. Not even sure why that character was inserted into the movie. There was nothing funny or even sad about this movie. It left me emotionless. The love pursuit by Gerry was just so cheesy and non believable. I also cringed every time they did one of those cheesy flashback scenes to when Gerry was alive. I also thought seeing his friend sleep with Hillary and tell stories about Gerry when he was alive to be kind of morbid. <br/><br/>I want two hours back of my life for watching this movie.

Also, Gerrys marvellous 'letters from beyond the grave' scheme leads her to landing every girls dream career - designing beautiful shoes.<br/><br/>flashback, to when they first met, and our heroine expresses a vague desire to be artistic, but isn't sure how you go about it. she tries quoting Blake but doesn't remember it. ""i must create my own system or be enslaved by another mans"". does Blake's statement of artistic purity and integrity involve designing shoes? hmm, not sure about that, it means our heroine gets to be artistic (in a nice way) and everyone realises how deep and interesting she must be.<br/><br/>the end of the film sees her popping over to Ireland to reacquaint herself with the hunky shag. who, knows, perhaps his music career will take off and he'll be worth hanging onto.<br/><br/>best actors<br/><br/>1.

","I read the book last year and was really impressed. Ahern really got the characters and the emotions related to grief, spot on. It was funny, touching and very sad.<br/><br/>Even though I was a big fan of the book, I had reservations about the film, it looked too ""hollywood"" and to be honest trying to convert a very poignant story into a glossy romcom was never going to work.<br/><br/>so the film... it seemed to lack any real emotion, all the scenes of holly grieving was glossed over. Her friends and family did not appear very sympathetic. Also I couldn't understand why the film did not show Jerry actually being ill or dying, the film jumped from Jerry and Holly bickering, to his funeral which didn't make sense.<br/><br/>Other major irritations of the film where the shocking ""Irish"" accents, though this did cause much (and the main) amusement for me and my friend (who happens to be part Irish), which leads me to my next point.why were all the ""Irish"" characters so stereotyped? They were always drinking either Guinness or Jameson's, and both of them looked and dressed pretty much identically.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed as I really rate both Gerard Butler (in 300)and Hilary Swank (in Boys don't cry)but their chemistry on screen was non-existent.<br/><br/>So to anyone who is contemplating watching this film, I advise you to spend your money on buying the book instead!"

","As an American ex pat, living in the UK for 8 years, this movie was a total embarrassment. Who watches this stuff (in the USA?)? I only watched it because my 12 year old was having a cinema party and THEY wanted to watch it. The acting was atrocious, the story line was probably written by a cheerleader who likes Ireland or something. It was Hollywood at it's worst. Please, if you think you are going to do a film partly about a European country, have some Europeans on board who will advise you how schmaltzy a film can be for the rest of the world (and don't release it over here). The theatre was pretty empty and I can see why. Waste of 6 pounds for me. The main actress was so annoying to watch and look at, those teeth, my goodness.... Only redeeming qualities were the shots of NYC and Ireland and a rather good conversation between the mother and daughter towards the end. It wasn't worth watching for those reasons however."

","After watching ""P.S. I Love You"" for the very first time, I have to say that I hated it. Why would I want to watch a movie that I have to turn off halfway through so that I can stop to catch my breath from crying? But after some time had passed since I watched this film, I realized how great a movie it really was. When has a movie touched me so deeply? Never! <br/><br/>Yes, this movie may be just another chick-flick with some corny scenes and lines thrown in throughout, but for anyone who has lost anyone close to them in life whether it be through death, divorce or any other cause, it is a must-see. I never fall apart crying in movies, it just isn't my thing. But after going through my own parents' divorce (my father had an affair and left, just like Holly's) just a few years ago, and then finding the one and only amazing man (who is now my husband)who has been able to help me get past my grief and reassure me that he ""is not my dad,"" P.S. I Love You really hit home for me. To watch Holly go through such devastation after losing the one man who was perfect for her is heart-wrenching, and really makes you thankful for the loved ones you do have, whether they drive you crazy or not.<br/><br/>This movie is not a light, happy film with a storybook ending. It isn't something to rent and watch with your girlfriends for a getaway evening. But it is a beautiful portrayal of loyal love and the harsh reality life sometimes bestows upon us. I give it eight out of ten stars for its witty script, quality cinematography, ability to touch the heart and soul, the creativity involved in telling a story, and the humorous moments tossed in every now and then. I recommend watching it, at least once. Give it a try, you might like it!"

It is just sooo bad, it made me cringe. I only endured it to the end as I hoped this whole thing would at least have a good ending. But no - even that is non-committal and empty.

","I had been told by numerous friends that this was a great movie and about how they all nearly went through a box of tissues with it. so naturally I was preparing for an emotionally engaging tear-jerker. but that was not what I got. at the end of the movie I found myself sitting there with my unused box of tissues thinking ""jeez i really need to get some new friends with decent taste in movies!"". <br/><br/>I don't know what it was but I just found this movie unbelievably boring. all throughout it i found myself getting distracted and resorting to things like rolling around on the floor and sticking my finger in the pedestal fan to alleviate my boredom. I wish that I had stuck my head under that fan instead of sitting through the whole thing. I know, I could have turned it off, but I didn't want to. I suppose there was just some sadomasochistic part of me that wanted to continue, with a vague hope that it might get better even though deep down I suspected that it wouldn't and surprise, surprise - it didn't. <br/><br/>I also found the acting in this movie terrible. Whether it was the actors themselves or merely the characters they were playing I don't know, but the combination certainly wasn't good whatever it was. The filming wasn't too bad pretty straight forward. One thing I could not stand though was the opening scene it went forever before they actually put the title of the movie up and began the opening credits which dragged on as well. <br/><br/>the worst part about that opening scene was that it really didn't establish anything, except that they love each other which we might have figured from the title. it also set up the annoying character that Hilary swank was going to be for those painful 121 minutes. can't even understand why he loved her so much. I think a better start to the movie would have been the scene were jerry is dying, then the credits, then the funeral or something, I dunno. At least this way his death wouldn't have been so mysterious. <br/><br/>I mean one minute he's there then a few minutes and what felt like a life time of boring credits later he's died? what's with that? show us how he died. You think that us viewers aren't clever enough to figure out that in a film named ""PS, I love you"" the leads love each other, but we can figure out how he died. Yes I know we hear later that it was a tumor, but I just don't think it should have been done like that. <br/><br/>this was not the movie I expected, it was much, much worse than i could have ever possibly anticipated. it hasn't left me with tear stained cheeks or a desire for such a romance for myself as I suspect it intended to do. rather it has left me with nothing more than a full tissue box, an angry demeanor and a sincere wish that I had stuck my neck under the fan.<br/><br/>PS.

","If they were out to make a bittersweet rom-com in the style of Richard Curtis then the producers succeeded. This film is just as vapid, insincere, superficial, unfunny and as lacking in genuine sentiment as anything Curtis ever produced.<br/><br/>Holly, the shrew, falls for cartoon Irish romeo, Gerry, and persuades him (one imagines)to move to America where they marry. They live in a dump and he works as a limo driver while she can't hold down a job because of her ever present attitude problem. Oh, and then he dies of a brain tumor.<br/><br/>Cue the ever present soundtrack of mawkish folk-rock ditties that intrude at every opportunity. On the rare occasions they stop intruding we get the cheesy Celtic pipes tweeting away in their place. Whoever put this soundtrack together needs to be shot.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that Holly has no discernible income, she takes herself over to a Disney version of Ireland and by random chance ends up in bed with Gerry's childhood best friend who she apparently had never heard of. In the afterglow of their rumpy-pumpy he charms her with boyhood tales of his friendship with her dead husband --as one would.<br/><br/>Skipping over the rest of this garbage, the film's resolution again sees the penniless Holly take her mother to Ireland to ""hear her laugh once more"".

No class!"
"Danusha_Goska","1","34","65","22 December 2007"," Movie: Awkward, Artificial, Icky; Butler: Charming as Ever
","First, let's get this out of the way: Gerard Butler is one of the sexiest men alive. Throughout ""P.S. I Love You"" he maintains his irresistible charm and masculine grace.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, ""P.S. I Love You"" is abysmal. It is, throughout, simply, awkward. Scenes plod without apparent purpose or design. Characters and actors seem to be coming from different films. Lines of dialogue fall flat as suicide jumpers.<br/><br/>You don't know whether the filmmaker's goal was to create a heartwarming scene or a gut-wrenching fight. Hillary Swank is especially out of place. I felt she must be doing a film in a studio next door and just visiting the set of this film.<br/><br/>I spent the hour after watching it wondering how so many talented people could have made such a lousy movie. The stars are fine. We know these people and we know what they can do: Kathy Bates and Hillary Swank are Oscar winners, for example.<br/><br/>The biggest problems are the script and the directing. The script is hollow and incoherent. Not a single believable, consistent character emerges from this muddle. Holly, the lead, (Hillary Swank), is, by turns, depicted as a castrating, frustrated shrew, a nature girl deadhead hippie, and a high-heeled shoe fetishist. Kathy Bathes, the mom, is depicted as hating her son-in-law and railing against her daughter, and then is shown to have done something kindly that goes against everything we were told about her.<br/><br/>Not only does the script not make sense, there are scenes that are downright cringe-inducing. Characters that the viewer knows should not be kissing kiss; characters we are supposed to like behave like temperamental, wacko scum. The main premise  that a man dictates his wife's life after his death  is downright creepy.<br/><br/>So, what happened to Richard Lagravenese, who has written great scripts in the past? My best guess: neither he nor anybody else involved has any respect for the potential for excellence in a movie about women and for women, and so they just cut and pasted a series of scenes that they thought would get the ladies to cry and sigh. ""Oh, here we need a kiss. Ladle a kiss in here. Okay, here we need a catfight between girlfriends. One catfight, coming up. Okay, here we need a poignant mother-daughter moment. Let's rewrite a scene from 'Terms of Endearment' and spackle it in here."" Look  some people are saying that loving or hating this movie is about the difference between men and women. Don't believe them. ""P.S. I Love You"" is a simply awful movie, and an insult to its intended female audience. If you want to see a good chick flick, there are plenty out there that are as intelligent as anything made for men. Don't tell me that this movie's abysmal quality is the fault of women. Rather, it's the fault of treating women, and art made for women, with complete disrespect."

","I only give a 9 because I would have loved to be in the scenes with Gerard instead of Hilary!! This movie is getting mixed reviews, but I thought the truthfulness and honesty of it was totally on. When my dad died, I remember searching for any piece of him to hold on to. You definitely go through flashbacks in your head, so those were correct. All the men were amazing, but especially Gerard Butler. I have seen real bad movies with him in them, but he always shines. He seems to throw himself fully into every role he does, and his acting is superb. I'm a new fan - having finally, reluctantly watched Phantom of the Opera, but I was hooked by his performance in that, and can never believe how far he can stretch himself; whether it's the Phantom, a Spartan, a time traveler, a criminal, Dracula, whatever, the movie may get horrid ratings, but he's the gemstone in the dirt, no matter what. But other than that, go see this movie because it's a true analogy of life. You will be surprised when you don't cry and surprised when you do.<br/><br/>This is signed Christopher, but it's from me,his wife, Laura. I realized after reading this, that you might have thought this was from a man, but it's from a hot-blooded female who was not struck blind at marriage!!<br/><br/>P.S. My husband went to the movies to see ""I Am Legend,"" but came home and admitted that he went to see this movie. He really liked it quite a bit. I don't know if he cried, but he actually loves movies that are ""chick flicks."" What a mush! What a great guy!<br/><br/>12/31/07 - I wanted to add a comment. ""Sweeney Todd"" got lots of nominations for awards. I couldn't stomach this movie - I almost got sick to my stomach watching it. I get upset that such a violent movie gets awards, yet a sweet movie like this does not. However, I did note that other people must feel the same way cause this past weekend ""P.S."" was #8 and Sweeney"" was #9, so maybe there is hope for the human race.<br/><br/>5/17/08 - I know this movie is long past, and is out on DVD. The scene in the travel agency with Gerard Butler should not have been cut. That scene was beautiful, tender and funny all at once. My dad died of cancer, and that's exactly how he looked near the end - Gerard, my hat's off to you. Too bad the morons in Hollywood don't know that we've all dealt with death by cancer. In fact, in ""Philadelphia"" they dealt with dying - why couldn't this film maker realize that?"

I thought it was overlong, too wordy and too disjointed. The performances looked forced (except Kathy Bates) - Hollys friends were just annoying and Gerald Butler didn't come over as someone whose demise would destroy you - he was just a cartoon jolly Irishman with a song in his heart and a tear in his eye!

","This movie was physically painful to watch; I was compelled to leave the theater before the opening credits were complete. After watching the trailer, the very first time, I was supremely confident when I informed my significant other this movie would blow; however she asked nicely, so not only did I agree to sit through this borefest, I paid good money to do so. Although my wife absolutely loves this genre, even she tapped-out after only watching 30 minutes of this train wreck.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few beautifully filmed scenes of Ireland's countryside, this film has zero redeeming qualities. The overall production would have been much better had it been 115 minutes shorter. Although classified as a love story, there is no love and there is no story. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters, Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler. Every female feminist and traditionalist who dares to watch this movie should be both appalled and embarrassed by Swank's character's pathetic behavior. There is nothing romantic about this film, there is nothing comedic about this film. The acting by the entire cast is average at best. Hilary was miscast for this part; she doesn't look comfortable in any scene; she is neither funny nor believable at any level. Producers should have obtained the services of a comedian for Holly's character. Lisa Kudrow looks tired and ragged and she also brings the same facial expressions, voice and mannerisms from her ""Friends'"" character, Phoebe. What is the point of Harry Connick, Jr.'s part? The ending of this film was perfect, just as meaningless and uneventful as the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>If you possess an IQ above 60 or you enjoy romantic comedies, do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Also, when released, be sure not to rent this movie or buy the DVD. It will be the best four hours of your life you did not waste. This film should have never been funded or produced; it is one of the worst movies I have seen in the past year. I just want a refund."

Sadly, I was not able to connect with this film on any satisfactory level.<br/><br/>The film starts perfectly. The opening minutes show a dispute between Holly and her husband and this is well done, energised by hand-held, sometimes out of focus camera work. But the scene is far too drawn out and, after five minutes, starts to feel like a rough cut and becomes tiring.<br/><br/>In fact, the whole film is too drawn out and, at times, rather clumsy. Some scenes labour to be moving, smothered in sorrowful music, which only serves to distance the audience.<br/><br/>There's comedy in the form of Lisa Kudrow playing a supportive friend, a leprechaun singing telegram and an Asperger's suffering love interest (Harry Connick Jr.) who says exactly what he thinks without any consideration for those around him.<br/><br/>There's a certain unfairness to the late husband's letters. While they are well-intentioned, Holly develops an unhealthy dependence on them. And the subplot involving her father's separation from her mother (Kathy Bates) feels ""thrown in"" and makes the film uneven.<br/><br/>Equally poor is the use of coincidence late in the story and the final scene which involves a meeting.<br/><br/>P.S.

","One of the better romantic dramas that I've seen. P.S. I Love You has a storyline that's at the same time just outlandish and exotic enough that it keeps you invested and excited, yet it's still just within the realm of possibility so that you can reflect on how you would react in a situation like the one in the film. Plus it's a rather sweet and touching story about love, loss and sometimes being unable to move on.<br/><br/>The thing that impressed me to most, though, was the fact that the film actually acknowledged that we usually view our lost loved ones through rose-tinted glasses. Because we actually see Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) arguing before he passes away. And yet the rest of the film spends most of its time depicting Gerry as a saint. Thus it'd be so easy to call his character unrealistic and naive, if not for that arguing that turns the whole thing upside down, because in most cases it's Holly that's doing the depicting. And more often than not, we do like to remember our lost loves with fondness. So the movie nails that aspect of grieving rather perfectly. Though Gerry is still a rather amazing guy. I'd say a bit too amazing, but it's a romantic drama. It's wish-fulfillment.<br/><br/>So the story works. Add in good characters, some interesting locations, Ireland and a rather colourful visual style and you have film that's a very nice way to spend a few hours. It's not going to challenge your view of the world or anything that extravagant, but it'll make you feel better, I guarantee. It's heart-rendering, sweet, lovable, sad and uplifting, all at the same time and it certainly has scenes that will stick with you. Especially the first meeting between Holly and Gerry. I loved that scene. And you should check it out as well."

What happened here?<br/><br/>Hilary Swank looks uncomfortably miscast in this role, she turns in a flat, mediocre performance, and there is a palpable lack of chemistry between her and her on-screen husband Gerard Butler. They really are the most unlikely couple. Added to which, neither of the two supposedly Irish men (Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan) can manage a proper Irish accent. <br/><br/>The script is weak and pretentious and the storyline lacks authenticity. Billed as a romantic comedy, it is neither romantic nor funny. It simply does not work. <br/><br/>This film is coated with a wafer thin veneer of pathos, humour and romanticism; a veneer which cracks under the slightest examination to reveal the emptiness within.<br/><br/>If there were a category for ""cringe"" value it would score 10, but for spectator value it just scrapes a 2."

","P.S. I Love You is an amazing movie. It is just what a girl's night out needs to begin with. With the witty lines, and perfect songs, you cant go wrong! Each character truly engages themselves in each scene. The cast was remarkable, and the script writers did amazing. It's one thing to have good actors, it's another to have the most perfect lines to accompany them. Some people are saying that it is just a sappy love story and that, ""...it degrades a woman's place in the world by showing that they fall apart when the man in their life leaves."" Those people are wrong, it is a love story with a remarkable twist- they cant be together forever. This movie shows the best and worst side of people when the inexplicable happens. I would definitely spend the money to see this movie again, I cant wait for the DVD!"

","It has been a long time since a movie has moved me the way that P.S. I Love You did. My daughter enjoyed it as much as my friend did and my daughter is 30 yrs. younger, so its a movie for women of all ages. It is a great chick flick to see and stays with you long after you leave the theater. Just be sure to bring plenty of Kleenex with you. The casting was great. We all loved seeing Denny from Gray's Anatomy (can't remember his real name) and Gerald Butler. Also, we all like Harry Connick Jr. and anytime Kathy Bates is in a movie its good. We also liked Lisa Kudrow and her one-liners. Hilary Swank is also very good in this movie. The men in our lives were glad we went and saw it without them, but I guess there are some men who would enjoy it. I am telling everyone to go and see it and that it is not a waste of money like so many movies are. It is one that we will purchase for our DVD collection. So go and enjoy a movie that will make you cry, have you laughing and leave you with that WOW feeling as you walk out of the show."

","After reading so many good reviews, I was still apprehensive about taking my husband to see the movie P.S. I Love You. I knew the basic story line and the excellent actors to star in it so that was a plus but to my surprise my husband enjoyed it equally as much as I did. We both came out from the experience satisfied that for once it was money well spent and that the days of good movie had not yet ended. What a great movie! We talked about it almost all the way home. It was very hard to hold back from uncontrollable laughter and tears in this movie it was both very funny and very sad at times. Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent in portraying their roles as Holly and Gerry as are the rest of the characters especially Lisa Kudrow with her added touch of Michele reminiscent of Romy in"" Romy and Micheles Highschool Reunion."" This movie drew people from all age groups young and old and appreciated by most, confirmed by the applauding at the end. There was some human aspect of the movie that all could relate to whether it be a tragic loss, being alone or just striving for a happy existence in everyday life but all lifted with a touch of Irish humour and their way of seeing things. What could have been just another tragic love story was given depth by those who portrayed their roles so well. Colourful characters fitting their equally visually colourful environments.<br/><br/>After seeing previous movies of Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler, they are both wonderful actors true chameleons of their art, throwing their selves into any role they take on and this one no exception. If you a looking for a good laugh or a good cry then this will do it for you. I can't remember anywhere in the movie where I lost interest and dozed off.

"simonparker1990","2","12","26","10 January 2008"," P.S. It's Rubbish!
","Let me get this straight first, I had absolutely no desire whatsoever to see this movie, in fact had a friend not literally forced me to go with her I would no doubt have lived my days quite happily and never have had to endure this movie! The trailer looked pretty stupid, and the whole plot idea just sounded more creepy than anything else. But still this is all irrelevant, I went into the cinema today with my box of popcorn and prepared myself for a poor movie. Now you know every so often you sit and watch a movie you expect to be horrendous and come out pleasantly surprised, movie such as Alvin and the Chipmunks, well P.S. I love You is one of those movies that you go in expecting to dislike and come out absolutely hating. Now some of you will point out this got a 4/10 rating, well this has got that rating based partially on someone elses view, most namely a girls. You see in my eyes I would give this a 2/10 rating, but my friend liked this a hell of a lot more than I did, and because I am a fair person I decided this is a movie aimed at women, not me. Anyway P.S. I Love You is an overlong, over-schmaltzy, pretty unfunny, pretty well acted, predictable piece of trash that is just so eye gougingly annoying after a while you cannot help but get tired of it come the final hour. Hilary Swank does her very best, and she has a few scenes that are absolutely perfect, but Gerard Butler dons one of the worst accents in a long time and the movie takes a long time to get to an ending that was way too predictable in the first place. The other huge problem is that sometimes the comedy side falls very flat, in fact its not only unbelievable a widow would let some man crack jokes at her dead husband as he seems to do, but also seemingly the movie verges on insulting to a lot of widows out there.<br/><br/>So let me go into the performances with a little more depth. Hilary Swank as I've said is very good, sure the script lets her down, but she is such a good actress anyway that she seems to make the material work. Whenever it gets to the emotional stuff, or the more powerful stuff where she is dealing with being a widow, Swank delivers a killer of a performance. Just watch the karaoke scene, sure its cheesy as a result of the script, but if you watch Swank's face you can see she is acting her socks off and she's delivering a very good performance. A shame her performance in some of the flashbacks, especially the meeting sequence with Gerry, just seems poorly executed and leave Swank looking a bit silly more than anything else. Gerard Butler unfortunately just comes out of this movie looking a bit foolish. Sure he's a decent actor, and he seems a nice guy, but he cannot pull off an Irish accent for the life of him! He does decently in some scenes, in fact the smaller scenes work very well, but when he shouts and at the beginning, his accent just seems absurd and too silly for you to take the character seriously. Also sometimes you question why his character was ever with Swank's in the first place, she seems so unlikable at times and almost a bully towards him, so the relationship never seems to work. Luckily Lisa Kudrow is on hand to steal the movie and give the movie the comedic oomph that it needs. Unfortunately she's on screen all too briefly leaving the movie trying to find something funny way too often. Kathy Bates unfortunately is given nothing to do until five minutes towards the end where she delivers an extremely powerful sequence, but up until then she seems wasted. By far the worst though is Harry Connick Jr, a character that is supposed to be likable but just seems downright rude, in fact if I was Hilary Swank I'd have punched him within seconds of meeting him! <br/><br/>The movies major problem has to be the pacing and the length. This movie is simply way too long! There are so many irrelevant scenes, what the hell the point was in seeing how they met is beyond me, but it took up twenty more minutes! So much could be cut and by cutting it the movie might have at least passed average. Instead the movie droned endlessly on leaving you sick and tired with the characters and praying something exciting happens soon, it doesn't so before you see this movie don't expect anything even remotely like a thrill. The movie also aims to be sweet and tries to make you cry, it just makes you roll your eyes and makes you feel closer to depressed than anything else. The final huge flaw of the film just has to be the premise of thing. I have never read, nor ever intend to read the book this is based on. I just don't get how this is supposed to be a pleasant movie. This is about a grieving widow who receives messages from her dead husband, some people think its a sweet idea I just found it a poor way for the woman to get over her loss. <br/><br/>P.S. I Love You is a chick flick firmly aimed at people who love that genre, but for me this was too full of clichés and just too poorly made. This movie does have a bit of potential and at Swank seems to be trying to make this a good movie, but the movie is way too long and the storyline just too boring and unoriginal for the audience to care."

","Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) seem to have a happy marriage. Gerry dies of a brain tumor...but it seems he has arranged to have Holly sent messages AFTER his death telling her how to get on with her life.<br/><br/>OK--I love silly romance movies. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is one of my favorites. This is VERY silly--but I didn't like it. For starters there are WAY too many love songs in it--I was getting he impression they were trying to sell a soundtrack album and could care less about the movie. Also they (stupidly) keep using clips from classic movies that had nothing to do with the plot. Seriously--WHY is Holly lip syncing to Judy Garland belting out ""The Man Who Got Away""? Also the love ""lessons"" here are utterly predictable. It's far too long (over 2 hours), is flatly directed and badly staged. Also some really bad acting doesn't help--Kathy Bates looks blank, Lisa Kudrow is astonishingly lousy at the comic bits (that's inexcusable for someone who was on ""Friends"") and James Marsters is given nothing to do. Also Hilary Swank (a wonderful actress) can't do much with a horribly clichéd role. The plot rambles all over the place and there are WAY too many coincidences to believe in this.<br/><br/>The few good points: There's a trip to Ireland and the movie makes good use of the beautiful locations there; Gina Gershon is just great in a small role; there's a nice flash of male nudity; Jeffrey Dean Morgan is just great as William (a guy Holly meets in Ireland) and Gerard Butler is fantastic. He's not in the movie too much and he overacts, but his performance is so good and he's so likable and handsome that he gives the movie a much needed jump start.<br/><br/>Critics have savaged this. Now it's not good--but it's not a total bomb either. Butler made this movie bearable. I give it a 6."

"EUyeshima","4","5","9","22 January 2008"," Overlong Look at the Grieving Process Spotlighting an Uncharacteristically Miscast Swank
","Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy and co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.<br/><br/>The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their ""cute"" first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a naïve college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella's ""Truly Madly Deeply"" or even Jerry Zucker's ""Ghost""."
"ferguson-6","5","8","17","1 January 2008"," Not So Heavy Thinking in My Fort
","Greetings again from the darkness. Richard LaGravenese is a very talented writer and director. His credits include ""Freedom Writers"" (also with Hilary Swank), ""Paris, je t'aime"", and the documentary ""A Decade Under the Influence"" (about the impact of 70's films). He also wrote the terrific story for ""The Fisher King"" (wrongly forgotten). Here he takes on Cecilia Ahern's novel and his first real chick flick.<br/><br/>The premise for this one is very intriguing and with Gerard Butler (so great in ""300"") in a leading role, my expectations were pretty high. The good news is that Butler delivers the goods. He is remarkably charming and likable and proves to have a flair for quick wit and a boyish smile. Two other male actors deserve mention. Harry Connick, jr delivers his best performance since ""Little Man Tate"". Connick is usually so pompous on screen that he has become somewhat of a caricature. In the film, he is mildly afflicted with say-what-you're-thinking-aloud syndrome and has some of the best scenes in the film. Also, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (slow dying Denny from ""Grey's Anatomy"") is pretty believable as Butler's oh-so-charming best friend and replacement.<br/><br/>The bad news: for this film to work, we need to understand Butler's adoration of Hilary Swank. Maybe the best way for me to describe this is to say that Lisa Kudrow is not the most annoying woman in this film ... Hilary Swank is. Why did this great guy stick for 9 years with this ungrateful, narcissistic, loud, hateful, demeaning woman? Swank's character needed to be somewhat likable, not just aware that she loved him AFTER he's dead. The ""true love bond"" was just not on display, so it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I score the film so high (6) only in deference to director LaGravenese, Mr. Butler, music from the Pogues and a chick flick premise that could and should have delivered. At least it offered my mind the opportunity to re-write scenes and recast the lead with someone who I wouldn't hope would get tossed off the roof."

","PS I Love You isn't a terrible movie, it's just that it is not necessarily a good one either. The book I agree is better, much more coherent and emotional to the core. What I did like about PS I Love You was the gorgeous scenery and lilting soundtrack. Also Kathy Bates gives a beautifully understated performances that at least elevated the appeal of the film a bit. Also the film does start off really well, with some genuine emotion there. However, the story is rather disjointed with some awkward shifts, and the pace throughout is rather slow and dull. Emotionally, particularly in the middle it feels rather unfocused and hollow, and very few of the characters I cared entirely for. Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank are okay and are easy on the eyes but the chemistry doesn't quite resonate. Overall, neither bad or good, just verging on average. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

"sddavis63","3","3","5","11 February 2009"," A Combination Of Dreadfully Boring And Sugary Sweet
","The opening scenes of this movie portray a passionate and obviously comic argument between Holly and Gerry (Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler.) For a couple of minutes, the argument was humorous. It quickly grew old, but unfortunately it went on and on for about ten minutes. By that time I already had a bad taste in my mouth from this movie that never really went away. Yes - it's the proverbial ""chick flick,"" so perhaps I shouldn't have expected to really like it, but romantic comedies can still be fun - chick flick or not. In this case, however, the humour seemed to be forced and artificial - everyone seemed to be trying to hard to be funny; it wasn't coming across as natural. Combined with a rather lifeless performance from Swank as well as the ridiculous character of Denise (Lisa Kudrow) - surely one of the dumbest ""serious"" characters ever to appear in a movie - the whole thing fell apart rather quickly. It was at best a weak romantic comedy, with actors who didn't really seem to click and characters who didn't appeal to me particularly. The one exception might have been Daniel. I felt sorry for him when he ended up stuck in the middle of Holly's problem of not being able to let go of Gerry. Gerry (her husband) had died of a brain tumour, but before he died he had put together a plan to help her move on and begin to enjoy her life again: a series of letters and gifts being delivered to her from him, each of which pushed her a little farther along the path to healing. This just struck me as a generally lifeless movie that accomplished very little in the end, although I did appreciate one bit of philosophy found within: ""life is a great and short and terrible thing and none of us are going to get out of it alive."" I'm a minister. I think I might be able to make use of that someday. Aside from that, though, there was precious little here that interested me. 3/10"

","Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress, but light romantic drama with the occasional comedic inflection doesn't appear to be her forte. Here, Swank, forthright in all the wrong ways, is uncomfortably cast as a young widow who is surprised to discover her deceased husband (the victim of a brain tumor) has left behind a series of messages to help her onto the next phase of her life. This turn of events is surprising to us, as well; from what we are able to ascertain from their marriage, their union mostly consisted of petty bickering and childish misunderstandings (Gerard Butler's striptease notwithstanding). Butler and Swank are a mismatched pair of doomed lovers (Butler isn't light on his feet, either), while the star-studded supporting cast seem indifferent to all this he-she nonsense. Swank is mooned over by friendly barkeep Harry Connick Jr., but this casting gambit fails as well--with Connick far more likely to be Swank's brother than a potential love-interest.

I remember glancing at the DVD counter toward the end of this scene and vividly seeing the picture hit the 12 minute mark. ""Will this never end?"" I asked my wife.<br/><br/>I suppose this sequence was supposed to show the depths of their ""love"" (somehow demonstrated by minor issues becoming full-blown psychotic episodes). For me, it was just an exercise in patience.<br/><br/>And then, SPOILER ALERT, Butler dies. And through his protracted illness (I'm assuming), he has spent endless hours planning deliveries and letters to assist Swank with the grieving process. It's an interesting idea, but it takes so painfully long to unfold that even my wife lost interest. Swank drifts through a series of scenarios that add little to the plot. She bonds with her girlfriends. She bonds with her mother (Kathy Bates). She bonds with Harry Connick Jr., dates him, and decides they're not a great match.<br/><br/>Next thing you know, we're off to Ireland. Butler's character was Irish and he apparently thinks the best thing he can do for Swank is to hook her up with one of his childhood buddies.<br/><br/>All this is well acted. We'd expect no less. The thing that really grated, however, was how predictable it all was. Every time one of Butler's letters was delivered, some schmaltzy music would arrive and Swank would tear up. And once her girlfriends got into the act, including Lisa Kudrow of Friends fame, it was like someone flipped the melodrama lever and sent this chick flick into overdrive. Everyone gets a letter. It's like this guy had nothing better to do than concoct scenarios that would cause the music to swell and the main characters to tear up.<br/><br/>Kudrow demonstrates the only comic timing I saw in this movie, so I don't have any idea where it got the reputation of being a romantic comedy. This isn't funny, people. It's painful. My wife actually felt insulted that the movie was so pandering."

","I've seen this film a couple of times, over the past 5 years. I've always loved it - despite causing weepiness, I have always got a lot out of the storyline; that someone could love a person enough to plan the future, after their demise, eventually setting that person 'free' to love again, is mind- blowing. If i could replicate this, i.e. ever have this opportunity when my time comes, I'd be so happy (do it for my son, and if i ever got married again, my husband)<br/><br/>For some reason, watching it again last night (it just came on Film4) I could not reconcile with the misery that i felt, at the end. when the widow (played brilliantly) suddenly announced that 'He's no longer with me'. I wept and wept  still a bit weepy today when I recall it! My parents have been 'with me' since they died; my dad 17 years ago, my mum 4 years ago. I will admit to having that feeling on the 10th year following my dad's death - but mum was still alive, so i was able to 'let go'. Oh, I'm probably just being silly and female-hormone emotional today, but SOOOOO sad! I guess he HAD to leave her, so she could move on. But I can't help but wonder . where do they go  ?

","Annoying dialogue starts this movie off. It's the typical kind of dialogue written by somebody thinking they are clever, however the stale clichés they throw out just highlight their lack of imagination. So after Swank and Butler annoy me for 12 minutes, Butler dies and the film is a look at love, life and letting go. It's similar to other movies like this, there's a nice guy that is understanding of the widow's situation, but by the end he is an angry and unpleasant person. The biggest problem is that the message is obvious before viewing, and it doesn't unravel in an interesting nor original fashion. It certainly robs itself of any humanity by forgetting that life isn't this simple. There are some excellently hilarious lines, but this hits neither the tear jerking moments, nor the uplifting feel that it's aiming for."

"Lejink","3","1","1","1 December 2018"," Postal traumatic stress
","Friday night is movie night in our house and so my wife pipes up to say that she's found a nice movie for us to watch together. It's a modern day romantic comedy, although probably with more of the former than the latter, set at least partly in New York, where we happily spent our twentieth wedding anniversary last year and it even starts at Christmas time, ditto. I recognise the title as that of a fairly recent best selling novel written by the daughter of the then Irish President if I remember rightly so with all this to process I think I pretty much knew what to expect.<br/><br/>After starting with a deliberately unconvincing lovers' tiff, amorously resolved of course, the movie shifts gear briefly as we're suddenly brought up to date and transported to the funeral wake of the garrulous musicianly Irish husband. Unsurprisingly, the wife goes to pieces, not going out, locking herself away from her mother, sister and brother in law and her two best girlfriends and generally living like a slob.<br/><br/>Somehow her deceased husband has anticipated all this and to get her back into circulation has set up an itinerary for her, starting every new season over the next year, gradually revealing his well laid plans to her in the form of cryptic letters mailed to her, her family and friends which see her end up going out with her girlies to a gay bar and then further afield to his native Ireland where they first met (cue extended flashback!). In the background there's a faithful barman who's always had a crush on her but you know it's really just a matter of time before her heart comes out of the fridge and she resolves all her outstanding issues with her friends, mother and even her late husband by the end. Near the end I actually thought it was going to subvert convention with something less than a happy ending but of course I'm proved wrong within about 60 seconds.<br/><br/>So, a sort of Irish variation of ""Ghost"" then, but with a less consistent soundtrack (it's all downhill after the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl's ""Fairtytale Of New York""), less laughs but more cloying sentimentality.<br/><br/>It's all pleasant, undemanding stuff, but at over two hours, outstays its welcome. Hilary Swank is nice enough as the reclusive Holly, I must admit I was surprised in a good way at Gerard Butler in comedic mode with tagged-on Irish accent and Lisa Kudrow reprises her kooky Phoebe persona from ""Friends"" one more time as one of the friends (no pun intended). What else can I say, the Irish Tourist Board must have been happy at the depicted landscapes but I'm struggling to say much more.<br/><br/>At least my wife enjoyed it."

","I am usually not a fan of ""chick flicks"" and I absolutely avoid anything lumped under the category of ""rom-com"". But this movie defies all odds. I first watched a little of PS I LOVE you when it aired on TV, and got completely sucked in. Now, I cry every.single.time I watch it, and it's been quite a few times. May I also note this is NOT a romantic comedy, despite what it's categorised under. There are a few comic relief moments, but even those are usually ""smile through tears"" moments. <br/><br/>I think this movie works so well because of how well the actors played their parts. Hilary Swank! Wow! As the grieving widow Holly, she is absolutely fantastic. Her grief was so real, every time she cried, I cried. And it wasn't constant over the top ""I'm so distraught"" moments, it was moments of silent tears leaking out of her eyes as the pain of never seeing her husband again and missing him so much, shatter her heart over and over again. And with minimal expression, you can see this in her face. And then when the letters start arriving and she reflects on their past life together, and all around her friends and family and the world are moving on with life, and she is stuck, consumed in grief feeling so alone. In one scene she actually does run to her mother in hysterics, unable to breath and gasping how alone she is. It was truly heart-breaking, as it's the one moment she actually cracks and all the emotions just come tumbling down on her. I don't think anyone could have played this role as well as Hilary Swank did. She made her character so realistic and believable. Gerard Butler who plays the husband Gerry also does a pretty good job as the sexy Irish man who loves his wife so so very much, and out of his irrevocable love for her, wants to make sure his wife moves on with her life after he is gone. You truly invest in their relationship, presented to us by the letters, ghost memories and flashback scenes to how Holly and Gerry first met. And made stronger of course by how powerfully Holly grieves the loss of Gerry. <br/><br/>Cathy Bates also does an astounding job as the tough, yet loving mother, who even though she has been through her own pain in the past, still stands as a rock for Holly. I also really enjoyed Lisa Kudrow who plays the funny and loyal friend to Holly. The only actor who annoyed me was Harry Connick Jr, or more so his character. He had a part to play in the story I suppose, but most of the time I wish he wasn't there, as some awkward and not funny scenes could have been avoided. <br/><br/>All in all, I recommend giving this movie a go. There has been numerous negative reviews that you should avoid and just watch the movie and make your own judgement. From someone who loves her slasher and thriller films, and thought the popular sob-fest love story The Notebook was corny and unimpressive, P.S I Love You left me pleasantly surprised after the first of many viewings, and always with tear stained cheeks."

","This movie is one of my all time favorite movies, I could watch it over and over and still laugh and cry just as much as I did the first time I watched it. The basis of this movie is about a young couple that meets by chance while Holly (Hillary Swank) is backpacking Ireland. Holly and Gerry (Gerard Butler) fall in love and get married quickly, starting their lives without a plan. This causes an argument between the two that ends with Gerry performing a ""striptease"" to apologize. The couple have a fun, romantic relationship that ends way too quickly when Gerry dies and leaves behind a grieving wife. He pre-planned letters and surprises to come periodically to help her get over him and move on with her life. You will laugh and cry with Holly and her girlfriends as they help Holly grieve and move forward. This is a must see movie whether it be alone, with your closest friends or with your significant other."

Before watching the movie I personally didn't like the lead casts but the on screen chemistry between Swank and Butler is good. The soundtrack is cool. A special mention to 'Fairytale of New York' song played at the start (Lyrics not suitable for children). Even though the movie carried some comic scenes, it is sentimental in most parts which are lovable, in my opinion. It is difficult to see characters in Hollywood like Holly who is a loyal wife to Gerry. The conversation between the mother and the daughter at the end is my favorite part. Must appreciate the camera shots in Ireland and were good. The bottom line : many of you who read the review may not agree with my ratings but this one is heartwarming and you can watch it once with your loved ones."

"sandover","Null","1","1","30 January 2010"," An earjerker, rather than a tearjerker
","The life of a chick flick is hard in the post ""Sex and the City"" world: it is rather on the chick than on the chic side, unless we are talking about the chic commodities that at a certain point start stalking, to the detriment of people who are feeling un-chicly constrained. I mention this because the creative urge that appears in Holly, namely the creation of her own line of shoes in the end comes off like an advertisement, and not like, say, a scene where we witness her enjoying her work. I think this is crucial, because that would mean that we are witnessing the work of real mourning, not the work of a real product.<br/><br/>For the film, paved with good intentions (the French say that hell is paved with good intentions) smells like a product in the end. The ""Sex and the City"" vein was not brought in vain, if you will; and not for a trivial aspect. Combine this with another hit of the era, ""Friends""; Lisa Kudrow does not appear here for nothing (unless one takes the reenactment of her usual persona as nothing); she is here for her usual brand of ludicrous, I would dare say dangerous, concoction of cynical-deadpan-slightly hurt female that comes of like some sort of absent-minded sprite, and is usually employed for releasing some tension. For this, as the film informs us, is a case of love and loss.<br/><br/>Who would want to lose Gerard Butler? He has an irresistible and subtle charm, above the average jolly Irishman consensus. Why is it that he is so popular? He portrays something of a really contemporary masculinity. Sargent, the 19th century painter, notes that a portrait is a picture where there is something wrong with the mouth. Look how twisted, boyish, wrong his mouth is at times; perhaps this is why.<br/><br/>Then, as soon as the two actors appear on screen, you cannot but wonder, even if it is for just a moment, if they actually match. At first it seemed to me awkward-but-why-not, then it shone on me: this actually begins like a gay movie. I am serious. Bette Davies, Judy Garland, gay club??? The climax of these three things in a widow's circumstances is blatant! Then I thought that even casting the of ""Boys don't cry"" reputation Hilary Swank, was taken into consideration by the producers. For I agree with some of the reviews here: she is not a terrific actor, and she lacks the charm the role should have been fleshed out with. Is it the strong jaws, the boyish looks? <br/><br/>And then the gist of it. How long could one go on sending letters from the grave, and how should he/she handle it? Here I think that the people involved in the scenario should have seriously thought what a letter actually is. At the point Holly visits Ireland after Gerry has arranged for it and she falls for a singer named William who goes on to unfortunately perform a song Gerry did perform for her, and she goes out in the street in panic, she asks a central question: why is he doing this? why does he want me to remember? it is cruel. The funny thing is this is the one instance it is not prearranged. So why this misplaced judgment? It is just that at that one coincidence the cruelty of memory arises in full gear, without prearrangements. Gerry actually is not cruel, he is humiliating. One cannot consider in advance another's mourning, so the whole endeavor, coming full circle at the end in the figure of the mother, seems like narcissistically motivated. Gerry is excruciating in his letters because it is actually about him mourning himself via another person. In no instance does he mention why he is writing the letters, what's in there for him. I would definitely say to a beloved, I am writing to you because I just want to talk to you and going on talking to you (and not decidedly help you get over me!). Wouldn't you? But one should have known better: love is not a mellow post-scriptum; it is written in the course of things."

Every time I have watched it on DVD since I still manage to cry at least once. Although it is drastically different from the book, which I found AFTER watching the film as I have only just finished the book, and although there may be holes in the plot and a dodgy Irish accent from Gerard Butler, the film was truly heartwarming and compelling throughout. This being such a different approach to a tragedy with the death at the beginning you would think that it could not be dragged out for 2 hours keeping you both interested and crying at the same time.

","As a guy, I can say parts of this movie were just painful to sit through. Don't be turned off by that first sentence thinking this is going to be a biased review, there's reason why it was painful and it's not just because I'm a guy.<br/><br/>There were some entertaining points, but as a whole, it was far too sentimental to feel genuine. Just about every other scene is a flashback to the dead husband where all the girls in the audience are supposed to let out a sympathetic, ""Awwww,"" but if you're a movie buff that can tell when a movie is just overdoing it, those scenes become incredibly tedious. Some of them seem to go on forever, and all they do is show something we already know: She misses her husband.<br/><br/>Well DUH! We get it, already, let's move on with the story. The problem is that half the story is that one fact. The main character misses her husband. Each letter brings about a similar flashback which is again tedious if you're looking for something to actually happen in terms of plot, or some further realization about the characters. The flashbacks don't reveal anything of significance- When they met isn't really that important by the last fifteen minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>The whole time I felt like I was watching a movie made specifically to get sentimental feelings from the audience, but it kept harping on the same points so that those points got in the way of the story and slowed things down to a dull shuffle. Most ""chick flicks"" have some redeeming qualities for men dragged along by their girlfriends-- A sense of humor that they can laugh along with or a plot that includes a decent male character that has a role other than to bring jealousy out of the female audience. While this movie has a sense of humor, it's far too ""cute"" to be redeeming for the typical male population. The plot is centered around women, and I think it's safe to say that the movie is aimed only at women.<br/><br/>At two hours and six minutes, the thing just drags by the end. I found myself studying my watch a good half an hour before it was over.<br/><br/>So in summary, if you're a guy and you're girlfriend wants to take you to this, you'll probably be trying not to let out snide remarks the whole time, so tell her she should bring her girlfriends to see it instead, as you'll just ruin it. And girls, if you're looking for a sad movie that has a decent sense of ""cutesy"" humor, go with your girlfriends, but please, spare your man the trouble of trying to sit through it."

A few main characters were left out, along with a few scenes added on that should not have been in the movie at all. Overall, though, I liked the movie a lot.<br/><br/>I do not think that Gerry should have been made as big of a part in this movie as he was portrayed as. In the book he was only briefly mentioned when it came to the letters.

The budding of the romance shown in a flashback was cringe worthy. There is nothing believable about how the ""natives"" of Ireland are portrayed. Really, there was nothing about the movie that I can say something positive about, and normally, I can salvage some element or two. Normally, I put watched DVDs out in the open for whomever might be interested, but in this case, I'm going to save everyone the mistake of checking it out. IMDb's star rating is often reflective of my view of films, but this is obviously an exception. The only one in my history of relying on IMDb ratings."

","Now I understand very well that when a book is turned into a film, changes are going to be made. A little bit of artistic license is going to be used. However, this is not what happened in this case. Apart from the characters names and the very bare bones of the story line, this is a completely different story. <br/><br/>Okay, so Gerry still dies. He still leaves Holly letters (although they're delivered in horribly cheesy ways). She still goes on holiday (although she goes to Ireland - where the book is set!). I didn't get why Holly's family was changed? Richard (Holly's brother) was a lovely character and the story of how he and Holly became close was touching. I also don't understand why the book was moved to America. As we see from the scenes on holiday in Ireland, the place has a lovely landscape compared to the streets of New York. William was not present at all in the book and I thought it was crass of her to fall into bed with him (especially as he was basically Gerry reincarnated). The plot lines with Declan (and the documentary) and Jack (helping Holly clear away Gerry's stuff) was both great, although I could almost understand if they were missed out due to timing. <br/><br/>Even the things that was the same were awkward. The friendship between Holly, Sharon and Denise felt forced and badly acted (The scene in the boat was just painful). In the book you could understand Holly's feelings about Sharon's baby and Denise's wedding, and you could understand Sharon and Denise's reaction, but in the film this was glossed over. <br/><br/>The relationship between Gerry and Holly is stiff. Gerard Butler plays Gerry wonderfully and you cannot understand why he would be with Holly in the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed with the movie. Like I said, I could understand why things have to be changed when a book is changed into a film, but in some cases they can still be well done (the Harry Potter movies for example). This film was just plain bad. If you watched the film and thought it was good, either grow a brain or read the book and see how wrong you are. <br/><br/>I'm not going to give it a rating as it's not possible to give a 0."

Where did this come from? Did we even know he was sick. He certainly looked fine in the last scene.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a bunch of letters sent to Holly mysteriously from Gerry (written before he died)which guide her and encourage her to release her fears and live life to the fullest. These scenes plod along and are mixed with flashbacks and I didn't care about any of it. Gerard Butler and Hillary Swank had no chemistry. Gerard Butler basically is so cheerful and buoyant in every scene that the scenes just didn't ring true. Hillary Swank did her best, but with a weak leading man and poor script, she has little to work with. The supporting characters had little to do in underwritten parts, especially Harry Connick whose part could have been cut without it being missed.<br/><br/>I still like Hillary Swank, but she's treading on thin ice now."

Otherwise, with Oscar winning female talent and a handsome Tom Jones /Richard Burton hybrid in Gerard Butler we end up with a very likable small movie that has outsized femme talent crammed into it..... this is a film that should have been made with no name female actors. In a GHOST meets TRULY MADLY DEEPLY way P.S. is charming and utilises travelogue imagery to make itself 'international'. But over all it becomes what is sadly described as 'chick flick' instead of ""romantic comedy"".. er, drama.... Hiliary Swank is gorgeous, of not a bit masculine and Kathy Bates is her usual self."
"frich71-1","4","3","7","29 December 2007"," please tell me
","why Hilary Swank is so highly regarded? She's a good actress but she isn't a great actress. She was very good in Boys Don't Cry but it helps that she looks like an anorexic boy. But other than that she's been very average or less than average. Million Dollar baby was a good movie but neither the direction nor the acting was outstanding. Morgan Freeman was good as the haggard old boxing teacher/custodian/friend. No way Eastwood should have gotten a nod for directing that predictable tripe. No way Swank should have won another Oscar.<br/><br/>Freedom Writers was a good movie but switch Swank out with any other average actress and its still the same movie.<br/><br/>Now this movie is the same thing. The difference between an average actress and a great actress? A great actress makes the role her own, a role that you know cannot be played by another actress to the same ability. Swank can't do that, not now and probably not ever.<br/><br/>So while the movie is OK Swank is once again, average. But you've got to give credit to her agent for getting her roles in movies that have good scripts and decent crews from directors on down because she could no more carry a film on her talent or looks alone than could well, Lisa Kudrow for instance, who should have called it a career the day Friends wrapped (of course that could be said about the entire cast of Friends.)<br/><br/>PS I CAN'T STAND YOU"
"blanbrn","6","3","7","22 December 2007"," Funny romantic comedy with flashbacks that makes us all want to figure out the world of love, life, and relationships.
","""P.S. I Love You"" is certainly a pretty funny and touching romantic comedy that leaves the viewer with laughs while mostly the story of gone love is told by flashbacks. Yet the film proves a point that love, relationships, and happiness is always a constant search. Really the big negative on the film is that really no chemistry is developed or so it seems with the central characters. You have Hilary Swank in a decent performance as Holly Kennedy a woman married to hunky Irish singer Gerry(Gerard Butler). Holly is depressed because her big hobby is collecting shoe heels while she desperately wants a baby, yet her hubby is playing hard yet both still passionately and strongly love one another. Suddenly despite Gerry's good looks and life the films take a massive twist all of a sudden switching to his death brought on by an apparent brain tumor? Then for the next year the theme is love only by love letters that were written by Gerard before his death, the chemistry of the present is so little as Holly daydreams so much getting much of her pleasure by remembering and flashbacks. Yet the movie has much wit and funny one liners the acting from Hilary was well done and Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon provide witty laughs as Hilary's best friends Denise and Sharon one a husband hunter and the other an expecting mother respectively. The biggest and most hidden strong point of the film is the direct and caring performance from Kathy Bates as Patricia which is Hilary's mother. And Hilary provides some sexy and funny scenes and just to mention Harry Connick Jr. gives a likable performance as Holly's potential love interest. Overall nothing special not really enough chemistry or enough deep character development, but still watchable proving that in life and love the unexpected happens and that one should try and cherish every moment especially when one has it. As the film proves when one is searching and trying to rediscover love it's many times an ongoing search that we all just try to still figure out and search for happiness and new discovery. With most importantly breaking away from a gripped love hold past."

","Are you kidding me? How could they even come up with such a trashy film? Totally ruin the novel. First of all, Hillary Swank is not fit for the character. Second thing is, obviously the movie was done and edited in a rush and not polished properly. So rough, so raw so undone. No depth of all the characters and everything in the movie. I am so surprised to find the rate is 7.0! I expected it to be like 4 or below than that. If you are queuing outside shopping malls, restaurants or public toilets and got bored, I recommend you to watch this movie.

","On paper this should have worked. A Hollywood A-list production with talent to die for. Swank, after an oddball role in a Karate Kid movie (not joking, look it up) sort of exploded onto the Hollywood scene and by and large has delivered nothing but great performances since. Don't think Connick has ever been less than great in a movie. Butler is usually superb as a dramatic or action lead. Supporting cast that includes Bates and Kudrow...? To mess up this film would itself be a feat but LaGravenese did it.<br/><br/>Let's be clear. This film falls apart from the first few scenes and then, remarkably, just gets worse. There is no chemistry between Butler and Swank. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. And if you don't buy into the initial chemistry, then the rambling and erratically edited scenes which follow -- about a dead husband who keeps sending mail to his widow -- is not romantic or fun or engaging, it is just plain creepy."

It is not the first time happens that a team of really good actors make a really bad movie.<br/><br/>While reading a book I imaged wonderful (unfornunately never been there) Irish nature and countryside. I hoped to see it in the movie. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The movie seems to me be a very long music video.<br/><br/>Regarding score by John Powell. Very good! Do not watch it, waste of time.

","When I first saw the trailer for P.S. I Love You, I was so thrown off and knew that I did not want to see this movie, it looked so typical and like it was an over blown chick flick. But I heard some great things about the film and decided to just wait for the rental, I got it on Tuesday and watched it today, I have to say that I am so glad I gave this movie a chance, it was such a pleasure to watch. It had great actors and a very touching story, something that really hasn't been done before. What happens when you have to start your life all over again without the love of your life? How scary is it? I think the reason I love this film is that everyone could relate to it, wither you've been: widowed, divorced, left by a relative or friend, or had a bad break up, this movie expresses all the emotions and hard times that you'll go through, but to remember that it's OK to live again.<br/><br/>Holly had a wonderful husband, Gerry, even though they fought quite a bit, he was the one love of her life, and due to a brain tumor, he was taken so quickly from her. At the young age of 30, she has to rediscover what it is to go on without him, but to her surprise, she receives letters from Gerry that he wrote to her before he passed away. Leading her to have the courage and strength to do what she didn't think she could do before, and most of all love and live again.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler have this dead on chemistry that makes the film work so well. Gerry's letters to Holly were so touching, I usually hate the sappy stuff, but this was just a sweet movie that will touch anyone's heart and also make them laugh at the same time. Kathy Bate's speech at the end with Hilary Swank was so true about how hard it is after being alone and having to learn to live again, it's a strange feeling, it's almost like learning to breathe again. P.S. I Love You is a great movie, I do recommend it, it's just a decent movie that is more than worth your time, it doesn't over kill on anything, just makes you feel good.<br/><br/>8/10"

"scotcarver","5","2","4","19 January 2008"," Good film, brilliant book - almost completely different from each other!!
","After reading the book I was excited there was a film coming out on it. The book was so powerful i was expecting the same for the movie. When I was watching it the first 15 minutes of the film I was really fed up but soon realised the film was much different from the book.<br/><br/>Some of the characters and themes of the book is the opposite of what Ahern was going for in the book (ie talking about the morality of the notes), but it worked for the film. The only similarities between the book and film is the characters' names, and that Gerry dies. The additional Ireland holiday was brilliant and made me want to visit it, however the events in the book was simply classic and i do feel they should have kept more to the book.<br/><br/>It was a good film, easy watching, funny, predictable - a typical chick film. I love the role of the mum in the film but once again it is predictable. Lisa Kudrow is fantastic, they changed Denises' character well. I absolutely hated the character of Daniel, he was just so different and annoying!!However, I love the book, there's just so much more to the story, and would recommend people to read it as it is just so different; powerful, emotional, hilarious yet a tear-jerker too.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie but it took me a while to get into it. But I do think that the movie is disrespectful to the book, as they are so different yet when the movie starts it says based on the book, i think inspired would be a better word for it."
"Moviescot","Null","2","4","12 January 2008"," Such a shame
","I read this wonderful book a few years ago and thought it was fabulous. Both hilariously funny and very sad at the same time. Most of its charm was down to the fact that it was set in Ireland. I thought the film was watchable but was overall disappointing. A major problem I think was that it was that it was set in New York and not r Ireland. A lot of the books charms is that it is set in Ireland and most of the actors were Irish. the characters in the book are Irish and of course the humour is Irish and therefore very funny. The book is definitely far superior to the film, but perhaps I think that because I am Scottish and get the jokes and the humour. Anyone that thinks the film is better than the book has obviously either had a sense of humour bypass or is American! I do hope that Cecelia herself isn't disappointed with the film as I would be if I were her.. I did think it would have been much better if it had been made in Ireland or UK - sorry but its true. Anyway I am going back to reread this book and remind myself how great-it is and how much Hollywood have trashed it to make a substandard film. Such a shame."
"Ishallwearpurple","9","2","4","31 December 2007"," Previews were misleading
","So here is the thing. I don't watch many regular television programs so have never seen some of the supporting cast and their trademark 'acts.' I have never read the novel, P.S, I Love You. Or any other Ahern writings. Never have seen any of the actors except Hilary Swank, Gerard Butler and Kathy Bates. I don't know anything about walk-up apartments in New York. (Seemed to bug some people.) I'm not an 'expert' on Irish accents.<br/><br/>I caught the film for the second time 12/30 at the 10:35 a.m. showing; there was an amazing crowd for a Sunday morning. The projection was perfect. No microphones (complaints on some boards) on view. The sound was great. That end song over the credits is a winner! And I loved it more that I did the first time on the opening Friday morn, the 21st.<br/><br/>Holly is a real person, imperfect and annoying at times. Hilary Swank is perfect. Those who want a 'babyface"" child/woman to play Holly are not living in the real world. There are more look-a-likes for Hilary than the usual cookie-cutter cute young things Hollywood usually casts. And Hilary has the chops to make us understand this childish woman and how she starts the healing and growing up, with her Gerry's memory to help.<br/><br/>I loved Lisa Kudrows questions to potentials. Very funny. I loved Holly's quirky sister and thought she brought energy and sunshine to her scenes. The boat scene is clichÃ©' but funny all the same.<br/><br/>I still say the ballpark scene was not needed. They could have cut it and the expense, and had the reading of the letter as voice-over. Daniel and Holly 'were over' in the restaurant, and the audience knows it. Daniel is an interesting ""other man"" and a new type. More interesting than usual. But did anyone really think they would end up together? Not me.<br/><br/>Bates is always good, but I just don't see that her part is 'wonderful' as others keep saying. It's a part Bates can do in her sleep. The Mother had never reconciled to the marriage and seemed waspish. Holly had to overlook her disapproval while trying to find her way with her husband.<br/><br/>I wonder how many scenes with James Marstars and Gina Gershon were left on the cutting room floor. They were hardly in the film.<br/><br/>And Jeffrey Dean Morgan, although good looking in a grinny-goofy way, hardly has any lines to say. And they are one-note. So not a great impression.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous, from the streets of New York to the Irish countryside.<br/><br/>Our audience today clapped when the 'Mustang Sally"" scene started. More energy and excitement there than in all the rest of the film. Gerry Butler is Mr. Wonderful. Singing, flirting, great body language, and a delicious deep kiss, at last. *sigh* I've upgraded my rating to a 9 from a 7. <br/><br/>Postcript: I didn't read this book and I have promised myself that I will never buy a book thinking I will see it on film. Never happens. I have promised myself I will not see every preview and teaser of a film before I go to the theater.<br/><br/>The previews of PSILY were clips chopped up from 5 to 10 seconds and did not show what the scenes they were from were about. I went thinking I was seeing quite a different film, just from all the clips we were able to see online and on TV. My first viewing was clouded by that fact. I did not see what the preview seemed to say I should be seeing.<br/><br/>From now on I will go in like I did for ""Phantom Of The Opera"" - knowing nothing, never having seen a preview. But I knew I loved the music.<br/><br/>Or last years ""The Departed."" I had never even heard of it and went because I wanted to see the ""300"" preview on a big screen. But I loved it.<br/><br/>This has taught me a lesson. I've seen one preview of ""Nims Island"" - the next Butler film, out in April, and love what I see. Don't want to read the book. I'll not be watching or reading about the film. Don't want any more information than I have right now. That way, it is just me and what's on the screen - and that's what it's all about. One person in the dark, reacting to what the director, crew and actors have made for them. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. :) Jane"

","When I decided against watching Atonement again and for this movie I bought myself a coffee in case I needed it to keep me from wasting my money but when the film started I did not resort to it at all, instead I found myself needing it to restore body fluid lost as a result of the flawless storyline. The start of the film really captured the picture of this madly in-love married couple. It reflected how people can be at each other's throats but really, they just want to do whatever it takes to make each other happy. The flashbacks of Gerry and Holly's relationship made the viewer realise that their love was extraordinary and felt the pang of heartache for her loss. Swank's performance was exceptional, in fact all the actors contributed to the heart wrenching and warming moments of the movie except maybe Jefferey Dean Morgan's. Hmmm. I think it was his flawed accent that ruined his performance. I think the trailer under states the film and if you're looking for a good cry. Watch it. I did... 3 times. Oh yeah and its heaps better than Atonement. The love in Atonement seemed not as genuine as PS' and seemed just a bit exaggerated."

If any are wondering how to get the book, I got a used copy off of amazon for only 1 penny ( 4 dollars with shipping ) or you can go get yourself a brand new one at Target for about 6 dollars.<br/><br/>I went and saw the movie on the opening day and I was crying by the second scene. It was such a shame that Gerard's character had to die in the beginning, but I was happy to see him in the flashbacks and the hallucinations.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic movie. Many things changed for the movie, seeing as Daniel isn't a scumbag in the end like he is in the book... and there is no dreamy William in the book either.

However, just like Jerry tells Holly in the movie to not figure out how the letters are coming because it would ruin the plan. It was fun seeing all the adventures that she went on.

It could have been morbid,but who better to push the one left behind to begin to live life again but the person who knows them best?<br/><br/>Much has been said about Hilary Swank playing the grieving widow, but I found her quite believable in her grief. She represents all the ordinary people out there and I found myself appreciating her acting.<br/><br/>I appreciated the writing as well. I am one of those who believes this movie is better than the book. To me, the movie was more true to life.<br/><br/>In the end, I rate a movie based on how much it gets me to ""feel"" with the characters. In this case, I laughed out loud and I sobbed. And then, I would laugh again. I did care about these people and all the actors were naturals for their parts. 3 different men you couldn't imagine and the 3 women also were perfectly cast. I think Gerry Butler stood out as the most versatile actor of the 3.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't too long nor too short.

","With the announcement that a sequel was coming for 'P.S. I Love You' I thought I'd better finally get around to seeing the original so that I was ready for it. Just reading the imdb synopsis for this movie makes me sad. There aren't many more somber concepts for a movie than this one. Interestingly I didn't find the actual film anywhere near as sad as I expected to.<br/><br/>It's hard to put my finger on exactly why that was the case. I found some of the characters a little hard to get on-board with. Lisa Kudrow's character for example could be downright nasty. I feel the film went more for realistic characters who are flawed, than your usual whimsical characters that typically possess films. I actually respect that they did that even if it was to the detriment of the film.<br/><br/>I think I was expecting more of a fairytale for adults type film, and instead I got a more gritty, pragmatic style. I'm okay with that, however if I had to choose I'd probably prefer the fairytale. I'm rarely as ambivalent towards a film as I am towards 'P.S. I Love You'. For me it was a touching story, that I'm glad I saw, however it is unlikely that it will stick around in my mind."

"rooprect","Null","0","0","26 January 2020"," If you're going to invest 126 mins of your time you should be prepared for a few things...
","Is it a ""romantic comedy"" as the DVD box advertises? Dear lord no.
Is it a hard hitting drama about love, death and loss? At times it flirts with the idea, but ultimately... no.
Is it a sappy Hallmark Channel melodrama of the week? Sort of. But the A-list actors and impressive cinematography seem to demand more respect than that.
So what is it?<br/><br/>Ultimately ""PS I Love You"" is a decent way to spend 126 minutes of your time if you're in the mood for light romantic fare. The story is about a 30-year old woman (Hilary Swank) attempting to navigate the troubled waters of being a young widow after her perfect husband dies. Complicating matters, she begins receiving mysterious letters that had been apparently penned by her dying husband to be sent to her in regular installments, sort of leading her on an adventure of rediscovery. Yes, the plot is excellent, based on the novel by Cecelia Ahern. But as you may have guessed by my opening points, the execution is a bit uneven and ultimately disappointing, given the tremendous potential here.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank definitely delivers with both breezy scenes as well as powerful, emotional scenes. But the film felt like it didn't want to showcase her dramatic talents as much as it wanted to keep things light-hearted and uncomplicated. I would have loved to see this film directed by someone like maybe Lasse Hallström (Chocolat, Cider House Rules, Safe Haven, Dear John) who really shines at these sorts of emotionally charged yet uplifting stories. Instead, directed by Richard LaGravenese who doesn't have much experience with feature length romance, ""PS I Love You"" doesn't really have a strong identity. Watch it for the story, not for the presentation.<br/><br/>One thing I definitely could have done without is the presence of Lisa Kudrow recycling her typecast role: a ditzy, 2-dimensional airhead with a bit of a mean streak, probably intended to make her edgy. Set against the excellent calibre of Hilary Swank and Kathy Bates (both of whom play deep, emotionally complex characters), Lisa Kudrow's ""Phoebe from Friends"" character is way out of place and unnecessary. Her bizarre speech about how she's entitled to objectify men because they objectify her is way, way, wayy out of left field and should have ended up on the cutting room floor."

","1 July 2008. An interesting premise though not quite as smooth and flowing as possible. The humor and serious drama seem to flow unevenly in this romance drama of a widow receiving periodic letters or messages from her dead husband. There is a feeling of forced as well as time lags in the plot that make the movie ebb and flow. Somewhat different in its plot script device, the movie moves forward with its entertainment, different cultures, and sometimes blunt character intentions. Overall, this movie doesn't quite have the gem star quality of Ghost (1990) or even the striking intensity of Heaven Can Wait (1978). Seven out of Ten Stars."
"Benslie","8","0","0","12 January 2019"," Perfect Valentine's day film
","First of all, usually movies like this aren't realistic or able to make people relate to the characters or situations but this film actually did the opposite. There were situations in this film that certain people could easily relate to. Of course, nobody has received letters from their dead significant other but they can at least relate to what Holly is going through. It depicts how somebody might react to losing somebody that is very close to them. The acting done by everybody really helped with that. With every scene, you could easily tell how they were feeling in that moment even if they weren't speaking. You could just tell through their faces and body. The acting between the two leads had to be good because you needed to feel like these two really loved each other and they succeed. In every scene that you see Holly and Jerry together, you believe that they are a happy couple and would do anything for the other. There were some problems though. One was the pacing of the film. Now this one mainly is affected by the scenes in this film and how they didn't really connect anything. They just jumped around with zero transitions at all. There also was a bunch of time jumps so you couldn't figure out what was going on and where Holly was in her life. Some of the side characters were annoying and unnecessary. In the end, they really were just there to be her ""support"" during this rough time. Finally, as much as I loved the couple I wish we saw them more. You see them together for a bit but I think it would have hit home if they showed them together because then the audience would be more sympathetic to Holly. In the end, this is a great Valentines day movie to watch either by yourself or with your significant other."

","I just had to write this 11 years after its release: So, maybe... being a woman, in the midst of all the ""attempts"" at romantic movies because, let's face it, there just aren't enough of them, you really have to acknowledge the films that you are most assuredly going to have in your DVD collection. This is one of them. I never tire of it. Why oh why doesn't the movie industry understand that there is a whole world of single women out there, of all ages, maneuvering through this crazy world of relationships? And that makes for a genre that will ALWAYS be supported. Make them good, make them relatable, and figure out how to present a truly romantic moment, or moments. Where, you can put the film in, go about your business, but you stop everything, when you say to yourself, ""this is my favorite part!"" - and you watch it...all the way through, every time. This movie has that, trust me. The best Romantic Movie Paradigm includes two opposites (don't get me started on THE BEST romantic movie of all time: The Way We Were), the seeming ""impossibility"" of the union, the presentation of obstacles that prove the impossibility, only to finally have love win out in the end. That's it. Why PSILY does it so well is the great acting - Kathy friggin Bates, come on! Swank is lovely, neurotic, and wonderful. Gerard Butler is so delicious you wonder why he didn't do more of this genre (hint to GB: do another one, watch Our Souls At Night, for instance). THE GIRLFRIENDS, Gershon and Kudrow. I have these girlfriends, that's how believable they are. And the magnificently underrated Harry Connick Jr. (we need to see more of him in films, PLEASE). The believability of being loved and never truly appreciating it while you have it, understanding that you were worrying about all the wrong things- who hasn't felt that? And the fact that a dead character can be so alive throughout the film reminds you why she's going through all of this in the first place. Did they know when they made this film that it would be so deeply loved, so many years later? I for one, am glad they did."

Lisa Kudrow is very funny and gives a witty enjoyable performance as the best friend. The script is cute sometimes, dramatic when it wants to be, and then funny when it's appropriate. The beginning of the movie is well done, showing their raw marriage, both the good and the bad side of it. The little striptease by Gerard butler was funny and well placed. Then going from that to the funeral service at the bar was good, showing the grief and emotion. The movie isn't too slow or too fast in pace, I think it's just right. I really did like how the movie had a good range of emotions, rich in both humor and seriousness. The Ireland trip with the best friends was entertaining, and indecently where something good happens (I won't tell you what).

I actually want to see more of how her family and friends helped her through the journey in the movie, because I think they also have major roles in making Holly realized how she had so many people that were more than willing to support her through anything and that they also had a special connection with Gerry I'm also disappointed because the story didn't stick truly to the novel because it has a better plot.

","""Love is a Rose Forever after.""<br/><br/>Even after death of Gerry, Holly finds herself holding on to his Love & refusing to move on. It is a romantic comedy picturing young widow Holly Kennedy (Hillary Swank) going back to life after suffering the loss of her life; death of her husband and best friend Gerry (Gerard Butler) Based on Cecelia Ahern's Bestseller 'P.S. I Love You' which was originally set in Ireland, the screenplay was Americanized for the satisfaction of director Richard LaGravenese.<br/><br/>The movie starts with happy and contended young couple having a fight over not having a baby soon & transforms into a scene where a gloomy young widow is attending her husband's funeral. Holly has just lost her husband and is re-living each and every memory of past and has refused to let go anything belonging to her late husband. She remembers the fights they used to have over little things & how they were an asset. Her family & friends are also disturbed with her condition & want to bring her back to life. For that they plan to celebrate Holly's 30th birthday by paying a surprised visit to her place and are quite surprised by her appearance in Gerry's night gown without having bathed for days. While they are trying to talk some sense into her and improving her as well as house's condition condition a parcel arrives for her with an audio tape recorded by Gerry, promising to send her letters (all ending with 'Ps, I love You) for each month of the year & helping her to rise up to life once again. Gerry has planned a whole journey for Holly to rediscover herself starting with a holiday trip to Ireland (where they first met) with her girl friends Sharon & Denise. There she gets to know about big happenings in their lives and feels lost and shadowed by solitude. Arriving home, Holly again withdraws from family and friends. As she continues to become more and more lost, she discovers she has a flair for designing women's shoes and enrolls in a class that teaches how to actually make the shoes she has designed. A new found self-confidence allows her to emerge from her solitude and embrace her friends' happiness. While on a walk with her mother, she learns that her mother was the one whom Gerry asked to deliver his letters after his death and receives the last letter. As the film ends with Holly taking her mother on a trip to Ireland, we see that Holly has opened herself up to the journey beginning with the next chapter of her life, and wherever it takes her she has the hope of falling in love again.<br/><br/>With a heartbreaking beginning this movie takes us to the unique quest of finding true meaning of life after losing Love of our life. However Americanization of novel has brought a change in details and feel of the story but the magic remains the same. Unlikely to the other romantic comedies this one leaves a bittersweet effect after which you won't think twice about making up with your partner. With its magical soundtracks and uncommon storyline this movie will leave you dumbfounded. Now for those who like to read books first, this movie has some major flaws regarding the cast. Not much effort can be seen on director's side as cast was wrongheaded to some extent. Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler could have been considered best choice for the lead but even their part wasn't flawless. Soundtrack 'Love you till the end' unveils the true soul of this magical tale and clings to your mind for a long long time. But after all that effort it won't make you think that movies can be better than Books."

","Okay, so this movie was way worse than I imagined it to be. Hilary Swank as the main character did not fit, and seemed to be a horrible actress. The romance was cheesy. The Irish accents were so bad they actually made me laugh. It seems like they all tried too hard to make the movie good, but in my opinion, they failed miserably anyway. The notes she received were stupid and weird. The characters just annoyed me though it may have been the fact that I disliked most of the women in the story.

","PS I love you draws the audience in, then loses them along the way. As the first scene opens, the viewer sees a young man chasing a young woman through flights of stairs, as if they were in an argument, clearly over something the man did wrong. Then the director, Richard LaGravenese, leads you into a scene that happens in most typical relationships: family talk. The couple then kisses and makes up five minutes later. What an attention grabbing introduction. He leads you right into a brawl between Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) when you're supposed to assume they're madly in love, hence the title. After her husband's death, Holly encounters numerous letters written by him, leading her to different locations which are meant to help her overcome this tragedy. Along the way she goes to the bar where she first met him, and instantly it flashes back to him singing on stage and meeting her eyes. However it isn't clearly stated that it was a flashback, so it became quite difficult to distinguish the differences between present and past. The film then proceeds to jump back and forth from present to past without as much as a hint or warning. One minute you assume Gerry is deceased and the next he's up on the stage singing an old Irish tune. There's no clear transition through scene and plot. While the plot was a little difficult to follow and the list of cast members could have been thought out more thoroughly. Gerry's friend from Ireland, William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was as close to a lookalike of Butler as you could get. In one of the letters he wrong for Holly, he instructed her to return to Ireland. As she was visiting, she ran into a guy and they have a subtle relationship. If you're at least going to set a widow up with someone new, make sure he doesn't have any resemblance to her ex. It's difficult to distinguish the two apart when they have the same accent, smile, personality and hair color. I'm thinking the director purposely made the two lovers of Swank to be quite similar, however it didn't seem to work out so well in his favor. There might as well have been only one of them with a costume change. Holly drags her best friends all around to the different locations where these letters lead her to, and you could tell each of them were getting annoyed. They were moving on in their lives and she was still holding on to her memories and old life she shared with Gerry. Holly shuts herself out from everyone else and gets consumed in her own life issues. P.S I Love You doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat or grasping on to the last word being said. The plot is mediocre and loses the audience constantly throughout the movie. The whole concept of the husband not telling his wife he's been suffering from an illness, and only leaves her with thoughtful letters that lead her to all the places they met, is a slap in the face to Holly. If someone did that in reality, hearts would be more than broken. They would be torn apart."

","I had watched the movie when it first came out, and the only thing I remembered was that I didn't particularly like it and found Gerard Butler miscast. Recently I read the book which I thoroughly enjoyed even though it has some flaws. So I decided to give the movie another try. It didn't improve in my opinion. Changing parts of the storyline and removing characters is understandable and I don't mind that the movie did it. But except for the names of the main characters and the basic idea (husband lets his letters deliver to his wife after his death) they changed too much about the story. They should have made use of the strenghts of the book's story, which are in my opinion on one side Holly's deep grief and her friends' and family's struggles to bring her back to enjoy life, and on the other side the characterization of Daniel as compassionate, funny and cool friend to Holly. The movie shows how Holly remembers Gerry in many situations, but it does not succeed to convey her pain and the desperation of her friends to get through to her. I also missed the character of Daniel from the book. In the movie, Daniel is an awkward guy who says the wrong thing in every situation, and Harry Connick Jr plays horribly monotonously without conveying any emotions. And why was Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character added? What does he do except for looking handsome? By the way, I didn't dislike Gerard Butler as much as the first time I watched it, but I still think he doesn't fit in romantic roles. I give the movie 3 stars because I liked Kathy Bates' and Lisa Kudrow's performances and Hilary swank was okay. But it's sad to see how much potential for a good story and proper character development was wasted."

","Based on a bestselling novel by Irish Author Cecilia Ahern, P.S. I love You is the story of a young widow Holly Kennedy coping with life after her husband's death as a result of a brain tumor. To her, Gery was her ""soulmate"" and they were happy together despite many problems. On her 30th birthday not long after his death, a letter from Gery arrives from beyond the grave with the intent of helping her back on her feet. A total of 10 letters, one every month, is delivered to Holly,always ending with ""P.S.I Love You"" Of course, Holly's mother & friends are worried that these letters might make Holly retreat into herself more & tie herself to the past and this forms the ""conflict"" part of the story.<br/><br/>This movie certainly deals with a very delicate issue. The loss of any loved one is not something you ever ""get over"". You will only learn to live with the pain. As life takes over, it dulls a little but it always will be there as a reminder of what you have lost. Many a time, people become half of what they once were as a result of such loss. Thus, as far as the portrayal of the ""grieving widow"" goes, Hilary Swank does a great job. Gerard Butler also does a passable job as Gery and the rest of the cast are okay.<br/><br/>Despite all that, this movie does have flaws. For one thing, the general attitude of nearly all the supporting characters seems far too irrational with regards to Gery & Holly's loss. There were plenty of sequences of how holly saw Gery but they could've at least done one or two conversations to show what the others thought of him. Reading between the lines, you could see that he was not very popular among Holly's family & friends but no satisfying explanation is given. In addition to that, some characters like William & Daniel don't seem to contribute anything of note to the story to a point where some people might consider them a waste of space.<br/><br/>Overall, while not the greatest movie ever made, it's not the worst either and I would prefer to watch this over the alternative of a predictable, cheesy romantic comedy(taking this particular genre into consideration) My score-7/10"

I've been wanting to see this movie since it came out but I never got to it till tonight and it was so good I had to find my old IMDb account just to write a review. It is the best movie I've seen. Allot of romance movies are shallow and don't really seem to show true love. This one is so pure and you can feel Holly's pain and how much she loves Gerry. I cried during most of the movie and I'm sure that if you ever cried during a movie you will cry during this one! What's going to happen next isn't usually predictable This one I just borrowed from the library but I have to go buy it! A great movie for re-watching and I recommend this to anyone who likes romance films but who also likes true love <3"

","I loved and hated this movie all at the same time. I thought it was cute but too sappy. I thought the acting was good, I liked the actors but I hated the characters. The only characters I liked were Gerard Butler's and Hilary Swank's. I absolutely love Hilary Swank. She is my favorite actress and I try to see all of her movies because they are always amazing. I am glad she did this movie because I like seeing her in different types of roles but this wasn't the best movie she was in. I liked the plot but I didn't like Hilary Swank's strange and pointless romances in the movie. I felt the mourning period of her late husband was rushed and disrespected by the other characters, this made me dislike them and they ruined the movie for me. I did love the idea of the plot, I loved Swank and Butler's relationship in the movie, I felt their chemistry. Gerard Butler is a great actor. I loved his character. I wish he was real! I also thought that the flashback's were done very well. It was a well made movie. But it had a lot of potential to be even better."

","Hilary Swank is probably best known for her somewhat masculine Oscar-winning performances in the 1999 transsexual tale Boys Don't Cry and Clint Eastwood's boxing movie Million Dollar Baby (2004), so it's good to see her in distinctively feminine roles for a change. In the film adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's novel PS, I Love You, Swank plays a married 30-year old woman Holly Kennedy whose dear husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) suddenly dies of a brain tumor at the age of 35. Numb and alienated at first, Holly starts getting a grip on her life again when she begins receiving letters that Gerry had written before his demise, guiding her to open up to joy again. With her friends Denise and Sharon (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) and sister Ciara (cute Nellie McKay), Holly follows the letters' instructions leading her to Gerry's home in Ireland among other places, eventually overcoming her sorrow.<br/><br/>Romantic drama-comedies have frequently been aimed at the most undemanding of female audiences, but not often this obviously. The Gerry character has been written so ridiculously dreamy that it is impossible to think of him as a real person: he's self-confident, humorous, musical and even speaks with a sexy Irish accent. Since none of the other men, like Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a handsome Irish musician-lifesaver (!) or Harry Connick Jr. as the ""adorably insecure"" potential love interest Daniel, are any better characterized, all of the responsibility is shoved on the shoulders of the women. Unfortunately, the clichéd best friends, their man-hunting tips and the subplots about their relationships provide nothing even remotely fresh or interesting. The always charismatic Kathy Bates helps a little with her performance as Holly's skeptical mother Patricia, but of course her storyline is also concluded according to the conventions of the genre. Hilary Swank herself delivers a decent performance too, but like the other actors, she isn't given much of a character to work with.<br/><br/>If the plot is just as cheesy as the plot description above implies, so is the execution of it. Neither the score nor the song choices on the soundtrack ever even attempt a new approach to the age-old feelings they are supposed to illustrate; I mean, I like The Pogues but the filmmakers could really have picked something more surprising than ""Love You 'til the End"" and ""Fairytale of New York"" from the band's catalogue. The scenery is pretty to look at though, especially during the Ireland scenes, even if constantly gorging on the beauty of the green pastures often comes across as heavy-handedly emphasizing the irritating perfectness of Gerry's loving plan for Holly.<br/><br/>I admit that I am not part of the target demographic of this type of movies and that they're only meant to be taken as light escapism, but I really think either a more credible, less predictable story or less hackneyed comedy would have been needed to make P.S. I Love You an entertaining romance romp. If stereotypical guys' movies objectify women as sex symbols, romance weepies like this one can be said to objectify men as unrealistic daydream teddy bears. Sure, both kinds of films are good to have at hand when you want to just unplug your brain and pass some relaxing time, but personally I was just writhing in my chair hoping for the two-hour movie to finally end. Only for the most sentimental romance fans."

","Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in ""Dark Victory"" - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave. He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he's gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life. You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not). But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew? And does this ""Ghost"" knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death classic? <br/><br/>Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, ""P.S. I Love You,"" based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision. Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end. And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well. And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple. The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.<br/><br/>A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way. Well, at least the Irish scenery is lovely."

","I always get annoyed with people who say something is a brilliant book when in actual fact they have n't actually read it , they have seen the film .<br/><br/>The very fact that the film for some reason takes place out of Ireland with one Irish person in it is enough to send this down the point scale from ten. Why not just put a different title on if it's not completely faithful to the book in every detail.And characters added who were n't there in the book .<br/><br/>The remarkable Kathy Bates as always understatedly carries every scene and film she appears in.

","I'm so surprised to see that so many people hated this movie. I personally thought it was great. A lot of people complained that it was not faithful enough to the book. I read the book and, of course it was great. But it's understandable that the people who made the movie left some of the details out. It 's a MOVIE! I mean, as amazing as it was, I don't think the book was really meant to be that comedic. It was a little depressing to be honest. The movie was definitely lighter and ended on a happier note (yet still quite touching). After all, it is meant to be a romantic comedy ( more ""romantic"" than ""comedy""). Loved it."

","Yes, I know I'm probably too old to appreciate anything about this movie. There's too much corn and stereotypes and all that little girl fantasy that can be squeezed in to the overlong two (yes two!) hours. The corny Irish accents (what young girl doesn't love the Irish lilt); the predictable screenplay, especially when guitar hero Gerard appears on the lake so 'save' the damsels in distress, who have conveniently lost both of the boats' oars. Oh please, come on! God, even Hilary Swank has a go at the accent in some scenes. I usually can't be bothered to write reviews, but the truth about this waffle has to be told. Apparently this movie is based on a book. Well it's a book I will probably read, just to see if it is as badly written as this tripe."

","I have seen A LOT of chick flicks, when I say a lot I mean basically every possible you can thinks of... From very very good till B,C, and D movies, if that even exists! Seriously, no joke. I've seen them all!!<br/><br/>I wanted to watch this movie for a while but never got around to it. Then a friend insisted it so I thought I give it a shot. And i have to say, I really really liked it! Very enjoyable..<br/><br/>You have to understand that this isn't the standard chick flick, if it even is considered in that genre. It's not the kind of movie you can predict the ending of it after watching for 15 min! I found it intriguing for a change to not know what was gonna happen next. It doesn't have the chick flick cute ending also but it doesn't have to be. I am a HUGE sucker for love and I loved this kind of ending, so that's gotta mean something. <br/><br/>You see how Holly is trying to cope with the loss of her husband at a very early age. She is trying to deal with it, unsuccessfully might I ad, and then she gets these letters from her late husband. Although they might seem cruel and useless, as the movie continues you understands what the reason is. He is really trying to get her to see the girl he fell in love with in the first place. <br/><br/>I read a couple of reviews beforehand and a lot said that it would be a huge tearjerker. Now i'm proud to say that I cry very fast at movies and TV-shows. But this movie nothing, maybe a tear or two but that was about it. I expected ""the Notebook"" but nope. I had a couple of times that were very said, but no waterfalls for me.<br/><br/>I just would like to add that I loved the (flashback)bar scene, that was one of the cutest moments in the movie! It the kind of movie that makes you happy afterwards!Thats all i'll say about it, see it yourself! And enjoy!"

","I tend not to watch these kind of movies as they never seem to really tell what it is like to be widowed at a young age. The only one that does spring to mind is Sleepless in Seattle which pretty much mirrored what it is like moving on after losing a partner who you have expected to spend many, many more years with while more recent ones are just romantic bilge. I can identify with these movies as I was widowed very young over a decade ago and although every in my position has different experiences these are some things that the movies sugarcoat. One recent exception, which surprised me was Ghost Town, but, we are not talking about that movie here.<br/><br/>For this reason I avoided PS I love You for a long time, but, I have a thing for Jeffrey Dean Morgan (and Gerry Butler is jolly darn hot too) So I thought I would give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised as it was a very nice well acted movie. The chemistry between the leads Swank and Butler was good and I liked the fact Holly didn't go barrelling into a relationship with Daniel straight away. I liked the relationship with the friends as I relied heavily on my best friend after my loss and that felt real. Holly's mother tantrum about being abandoned by Holly's father and feeling her loss was just as great, if not greater was actually similar to what happened with me and my mother and I felt the character was given too much sympathy, but, that is a personal view and don't criticise me for it.<br/><br/>As for JDM, he wasn't in it too much, but, I saw plenty of him too keep me happy *wink wink* However, please never let him do an Irish accent again! Holly falling into bed with William seemed to fit,but, not knowing their personal relationship with Gerry was stretching it too say the least, after all how many Holly Kennedy's with an American accent would be in a little Galway village, Holly might not have realised William's relationship to Gerry, but, William would have known who Holly was unless he was incredibly, incredibly thick.<br/><br/>All in all a nice way to spend an afternoon and shed a few tears. The performances were good and the cast worked very well together, even Harry Connick, who I normally find annoying was good. A sweet little chick flick."

","If you like Literature and Movies you should go for the Book.<br/><br/>Out of the actor(Gerard Butler) there is nothing good, You will find yourself watching how much time there still is left and there is really much more than you want.<br/><br/>Out of the Title there is really less in common with the book. <br/><br/>Sharon, a really good Character in the book, who tried to make everyone happy , was a moody Character in the Movie. Denise seemed to be a very fascinating Character with depth ,in opposite in the movie, her character didn't fit to the story and made the story only borer.<br/><br/>Daniel is only rude and nothing else.<br/><br/>I highly discourage You to watch the movie, while you could read a very interesting and amazing book."

","There are days when I wonder why I punish myself by going out for these gushy, romantic films when I know deep inside that I rarely will like them. I blame it on the trailers who keep insisting THIS ONE is different! THIS ONE will be mildly insightful! And while I do find PS better than the other recentish dead-husband film, Catch & Release, the amount of tears being poured out in the theater by actors and audience members alike was enough to give me a headache, and I didn't even shed any.<br/><br/>Now admittedly, I guess I really wasn't in the target of this film, namely, women who like crying a lot because it gives life meaning. I was feeling pretty good about life in general up to the point of watching this film, and had no real need to make public displays of tissue-blowing. If you, however, are one of those fortunate folk, this movie is for you! Put it at the top of your Netflix cache and settle in for a good 2 hours of boohooing!<br/><br/>If you are anything that does not fit into this category, well, you might find the pickings on the slim side. I do like Gerard Butler, but he's not in the film a whole ton. Hilary Swank isn't really my favourite actress, which is compounded by 2 hours of her moping on screen. And yes, I get that grieving is traumatic and ugly and emotionally stunting- so why exactly do I want to watch a film entirely devoted to that one aspect of a person's life? What do I really gain from watching an emotionally stunted person painfully grovel in the grieving process for a year? The knowledge that death happens and life goes on? Pretty sure the audience had grasped the concept before they entered the theatre. So basically I sat through a grueling, uncomfortable film that brought nothing new to the table and rung true to no universal truths other than if your spouse dies, life will go on. Bummer. At least the film had impact: namely leaving me in a funk for a couple hours after it ended."

","I am not going to write about this movie as a film but as a loving tribute to a wonderful young woman by a grieving family. At the end of this movie, there is a dedication to Windland Smith Rice, the late sister of the producer Molly Smith. For those of us privileged to know Wendy, this movie will never be just a movie. It will always be an indication of the great love she elicited from others by giving so much of herself. Wendy died suddenly & unexpectedly; the book was so comforting to Molly Smith that she was inspired to make it into a film to help others in perhaps similar circumstances. Judging by many of the comments, she was successful."

","One of the best movies to watch if you got yourself the sentimental kind of girlfriend (which at that moment i did). Gets her into your arms immediately (one should only imagine what would come after). But let's get back to the movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the end is not predictable. Most movies go for that these days, mostly failing to achieve it tho.<br/><br/>As i expected this film to fully deliver, it did. Wonderful charismatic actors -i bet girls would find Gerard's accent pretty appealing - outputting a nice play, sweet lines every now and then, marvelous script. Inovative and romantic idea. One of the best dramas to hit the screens lately.<br/><br/>You will be watching a love story with its ups and downs, its passionate moments and its difficult challenges. While not all relationships end this kind of way, its a good suggestion on how to appreciate more what you got(supposing you got anything)while you still got it. Its an exercise of both sentimentalism and romanticism.<br/><br/>Go for it, you won't regret a thing."

","This movie is my favorite movie ever! I say that based on the fact that i could (and have) watch it over and over again. It's just so sweet it went right to my heart and stayed there. It does fall in the romantic comedy category but it's so much more and I definitely recommend it to everyone although I'm sure it will definitely find more fans among the female population. <br/><br/>Reason number 1 for loving this movie: the story. It's just such a lovely combination of funny, love and drama that it just brings a rainbow of emotions that not many movies do. I cried and laughed and cried again and so on...Although it's a love story I don't find it cheesy, it's quite refreshingly realistic in some aspects (as shown in the many little fights Holly & Gerry have). I wish maybe Holly was less bitchy at times but I think in the end that would have hurt the story a little and stolen from the humour of the situations so I guess it's for the best she was as she was portrait. <br/><br/>Reason number 2 for loving this movie: the cast. Gerard Butler is funny and handsome and just overall adorable and after seeing this movie I instantly became a fan (you should watch ""Frankie"", by the way). His singing and dancing are just the cherry on top amounting to a pretty dreamy leading man. I could go on and on but this is not about my crush on him so I'll just stop right here. Hilary Swank was very adorable too and I think it was a great choice. Wonderful performance, funny in all the right places and dramatic enough to make me cry. I definitely enjoyed the supporting characters as well: Harry Connick Jr. was so cute and funny, Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon as well. Jeffrey Dean Morgan I knew from Grey's Anatomy and he was just as charming as I had remembered but when Gerard Butler is around there isn't any competition really.<br/><br/>Reason number 3 for loving this movie: the soundtrack. I looked it up after seeing the movie and have been listening to the songs ever since. Personal favorites: ""I love you till the end"" by The Pogues & ""Galway girl"" by Steve Earl. <br/><br/>Last but not least it was made after a book so that was a nice surprise - I usually prefer the book in comparison with the motion picture but in this case since the movie came first into my world I preferred not to read the book. The movie was perfect and it was enough. (*sigh and thinking of watching it again...)"

","I want to ask Richard LaGravenese, the director of this film a simple and straight question? What genre did he want to make in 'P.S I Love You'. Romance, Darma, Art-house or Bland Cinema. If Bland was his motive, then he sure has succeeded. 'P.S. I Love You' is as bland as it sounds. I mean, its a really good concept but unfortunately it turns out to a disappointment. Why drag a wafer-thin concept till you get exhausted? Why delivering unwanted scenes and why letting such a great idea go to waste. This film disappoints and how!<br/><br/>Lets go with the pluses first: The film's idea is beautiful, A guy who dies in the first ten minutes of the movie, continues to be is protagonist. The films first hr is commendable and interesting. First-rate performance by Hilary Swank. Gerard Butler's cameo is fantastic. Lisa Kudrow is hilarious. Others are also good.<br/><br/>Minuses: Why drag a wafer-thin concept? Why put the vacation track? What's Jeffery Dean Morgan's character? Why not adding Sex Scenes? <br/><br/>'P.S.

","Although I have always meant to get around to it, I have never read the book P.S I Love You, so I didn't really have any preconceptions of what this film was about, what the characters should have been like, or any changes to the actual storyline. Perhaps that's one of the reasons I love this film so much (I know that fans of the book are not so keen on the film), and in my experience, films based on books will never fail to disappoint, unless of course the viewer hasn't read the book first.<br/><br/>As you can tell by the 5 star rating, I loved this film, and I really wasn't expecting to! Reading the story line, I thought this would be dull, boring, full of moaning, grief and tears, no real action, full of the complaining of a mourning widow which, to be honest, didn't really interest me. But the film is so much more than that. From the opening scene where you see Holly and Gerry fighting, yet still feel their strong love beneath it you get a sense of what this film is about - real love, not the fairy tale type you see in most films, but real, genuine love despite knowing each others faults, and what to do once you have your 'fairy tale', but your prince charming dies and you're forced to go out into the real world again.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank's performance was faultless, she really conveyed the emotion Holly was feeling to the viewers and was incredibly appealing as a character, not making Holly too miserable at all. Gerard Butler wasn't in this film as much as I would have liked, but his parts where played incredibly well, though there wasn't really much to Gerry's character to play, mostly a lovable, loving, funny, warm, Irish guy. I wasn't a fan of Lisa Kudrow as Denise, but having not read the book am not sure whether that was what Denise's character was really like, or whether Kudrow just portrayed her poorly. Finally, Harry Conick Jr as Daniel deserves a mention too, and I would have liked to see more Daniel and Holly scenes.<br/><br/>I feel like this film is perfect in many ways, though there are a couple scenes I wasn't a fan of. The one that springs to mind was the sex scene between Holly and William. The film had kept my attention without fail the entire way through, but the 10-15 minutes where the three girls get stranded on the lake to where William is telling Holly story's about Gerry were at least in my opinion, a bit flat and weird, and I felt the film would have been better without them.<br/><br/>Overall though, I really do love this film. Maybe not for the fans of the books, but for everyone else, especially fans of chick-flicks, give this one a shot, but don't be put off by the thought of it just being a chick flick as it's so much more, heart-warming + heart breaking at the same time, it's funny, intelligent, and a beautiful story. One I won't forget in a hurry."

Although Lisa Cudrow was good she played the same kind of character as she always does the dippy blonde who will go for any guy but eventually finds the right one i.e phoebe from friends. This film is well worth watching for anyone because it was so refreshing to see something new for once as this kind of film as far as i know hasn't really been done or at least if it has its not stuck in my mind.

","I, too, was pleasantly surprised. I went to the movie because Gerard Butler (the preview showed him taking off his shirt - a real temptation to go see it, in itself) was in it (I'm female!) and a bonus was the actor who played his buddy from Ireland (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, I think.) The NYC location shooting was authentic; a plus and the Ireland scenes made me want to visit Ireland. The title of the movie may make one think it was sappy. It is NOT a silly, sappy movie. It kind of reminded me of ""About Schmidt"". It was sweet, funny, sad, poignant. Swank and all the actors were great.

","very well written and acted making it a touching yet uplifting story. You don't know what will happen next, it's not predictable. The sexual energy between Hilary, Gerard, Jeffery and Harry was believable. The romantic scenes were not corny or over the top and the end was the cherry on the top with Hilary meeting up with Jeffery again. The healthy flirting between all of them is welcome and reminded me of the storytelling that made my heart flutter when I watched old films. I will recommend this movie to all my friends of different ages. The filming in USA and Ireland was beautiful and necessary to enhance a romance. The conversations even touched on life issues like when they noticed the elderly couple enjoying their time in life and also when Hilary and Harry kissed and both admitted that it felt more like brother and sister - that realization was very accurately expressed: congratulations to the writer(s)"

","I was so surprised to read some of the negative ""chick flick"" comments about this movie. Of course, it's not an action movie, but a really deep treatment of love and death. I thought they did an amazing job of treating death with sensitivity and humor, while avoiding the pitfall of being over-dramatic or a soap opera. This movie did well what ""Love Story"" did not (sorry, ""Love Story"" lovers). I actually think the most interesting relationship was between Holly (Hillary Swank) and her mother (Kathy Bates). The movie was funny and sweet and sad and haunting, and rang very true. I find myself still thinking about it days later."

","P.S. I love you is a great movie. This is the first film I've seen Gerald Butler in, and I have to say, I'm a huge fan, and I just found out that it's the same guy as in 300. Also, I'm a huge fan of Kathy Bates, loved her in Misery, and I haven't seen her in really any great roles in a while, but I loved her as Hilary Swanks mom, very believable.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is incredible, she's the perfect widow. I totally felt her pain and suffering and yet, I'm happily married. I have seen this movie about 10-20 times, and every time I watch it, I still cry at the end.<br/><br/>The story is wonderful, the music incredible, I've never been Ireland, but after watching this movie as many times as I have, it makes me feel like I've been there. I've always been a huge fan of Celtic music, and it's wonderful.<br/><br/>I have to say I love Gerald Butler's voice, that song, I Love You Til' The End, was amazing, it moved me. I'm not sure what that song is called, but it's great.<br/><br/>Anyways, I gave this movie 8 out of 10, because it's not quite perfect, however it does have a great story that moved me in many ways, who knows maybe it's a woman thing. The acting and sets were incredible. I love Lisa Kudrow, I've loved her since the first episode of Friends, and I was delighted to see her play that lovable character with humour and wit.<br/><br/>2 Thumbs Up!"

","After somewhat reluctantly agreeing to watch this movie on a girls-night-in, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This film is intelligent and well written, though perhaps a little long. It contains elements of drama, comedy and tragedy, and shows the journey of recovery of a grieving woman after her husband, the man she had envisioned growing old with, dies too young and too early.<br/><br/>If you like chick flicks, you'll love this, if you don't, you'll probably still like it anyway.<br/><br/>It looks gorgeous, the actors are all charming and perfectly cast - Hillary Swank is great and Gerard Butler is both gorgeous and lovable. You never think ""Get over it Hillary"" because you see enough of the two as a couple to see just why she misses him so much. The film has a good balance and you will laugh as much as you will cry, it's not too sappy or silly which seems a rarity in the rom-com (although I would call this film rom-drama-com) genre these days."

I usually like Harry Connick Jr. (who can forget him in Hope Floats?!) but I was really disappointed with him in this movie. He was just plain weird. Hilary Swank was great, Gerard Butler was ruggedly handsome and charming, but I was hoping for girlfriends that were a little more realistic.<br/><br/>All-in-all it was a good movie.

"TxMike","Null","0","0","13 June 2008"," Much good, some mediocre, but overall a good movie.
","I went into viewing this movie without any idea what the summary was and I recommend others do too. It is more interesting discovering it as it happens rather than know what will happen. So, if you are reading this and haven't seen it yet, read no more and just see it.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is Holly Kennedy, very happily married to Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera) as Gerry Kennedy. They had met maybe 10 to 12 years earlier when she was visiting Ireland. But their relationship has hit a big snag, he is ill and dying. Except for flashbacks, he is only in the very opening scene.<br/><br/>But he left an intricate plan in place after his death, one that Holly knew nothing about. It involved letters, a cake, some gifts, and a plan to help her get past his death and on with her life. It even took her to Ireland and her in-laws.<br/><br/>Both Swank and Butler are good in their roles, as well as Kathy Bates who plays Holly's mother. <br/><br/>However Lisa Kudrow as Denise and Gina Gershon as Sharon, both good friends of Holly, were very annoying to me, especially Denise. <br/><br/>Opposite to that sentiment is Harry Connick Jr. as Daniel Connelly who works for Holly's mother. Daniel is a good person but by his own admission has a social defect, he cannot filter his thoughts and says just what he is thinking. This causes some uneasy moments. He gets sweet on Holly after Gerry dies, but she just finds him to be a ""good friend"", the kiss of death. However, they do get to kiss before the movie is over, and both agree it feels like kissing a sibling, so both are happy with the friendship. Connick Jr.'s role is my favorite of the movie.<br/><br/>Also very interesting is an extra on the DVD where the author of the book recounts how it came about. She wrote it while she was still in college, only because she had this idea in her head. There was no thought of a ""best seller"" or an eventual movie. As one might imagine she is very articulate, but also a very attractive young woman, with movie-star looks. Her own story is great."

","My husband and I both thought it was just OK, yet lots of people in the theater loved it. The basic premise was fine, with the husband, Jerry, sending notes after he passed away to the mourning wife. My husband did not find that too believable though. One part in particular, about how they met in Ireland, seemed draggy, could have been shortened and should have been placed earlier in the movie because it may have cleared up some things and would have made the movie flow better. The acting was good, Hillary seemed real yet with the problems that they had at the beginning, it was a bit difficult to feel sorry for her. Kathy Bates was good but again, you don't find out until later in the movie, why she doesn't like Jerry; you keep wondering why she is so unsympathetic to Hillary. There were some teary-eyed moments, but it is not a tear jerker. The scenery is beautiful in parts."

","It's not about me not liking the chick flick/ tearjerker sub genre, actually I've seen a number of such films that I actually like, but this one is unnecessarily too long and boring. I suspect that the novel is good, but not very filmable. Or that the writers didn't do the job properly. Otherwise, it appears to follow the genre demands well: you have Gerard Butler, a chick magnet, you have Hillary Swank in an atypical role which she handles pretty good, you have Gina Gershon- always likable and sexy, but when the most interesting character is Lisa Kudrow reenacting her best ""Friends"" moments, than you have to ask the question: why? This film has no point. It drags itself for 126 minutes to tell you ""Life goes on."""
"mcmiller53","2","2","5","18 December 2008"," Appalling
","My point of view comes from being a new widow and having spent a great deal of time with other widows. I waited 5 months to see this movie because I was told the plot and didn't feel ready to expose myself. Tonight I finally watched it and the only reason this movie is getting two stars from me is that, not even once, not even close, not ever, ever, ever will it make me cry.<br/><br/>The reason is, this movie is a completely and utterly unrealistic portrayal of losing a spouse/loved one/SO. I won't belabor the point by beating up the actors, although what a waste of some real talent, but it's the story that deserves my disdain.<br/><br/>For starters, there is NO mention of how courageous it was of Jerry to have spent his dying time setting this whole incredulous thing up. Also no mention of the amount of time spent care-giving on Ms. Swank's part. He just DIED of a brain of brain tumor, and that's all we know. Nobody gets an concept of how much that affected everyone during that dying time. The cancer spreads to all involved. But, not this group.<br/><br/>My husband battled melanoma for three years and most of that time he felt pretty well. I spent a long time with other cancer victims and the uppermost thing on each and every person's mind was spending every waking moment WITH the person they were going to leave, not concocting some way to control afterward. There are far more practical matters that take up your time and you are exhausted beyond belief when it is 'over'. Trust me on this one.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie makes me very angry by supporting the long-held belief that grief is to be surmounted on anyone's time-line. I was guilty of this until it happened to me and it's a very large lie. Until you've been there, don't write stories, or books, or fluffy movies about something so intensely painful."

","Everybody: Oh, please.<br/><br/>For what this film sought out to portray, it did an excellent job. Kudos to the actors, the cinematographer, et al.<br/><br/>I do wish that nowadays all men who merely look what we used to call ""nice"" (i.e., not ugly, almost attractive) are suddenly anointed with being GORGEOUS. Well, yeah, gorgeous if you compare them to most of what's out there in the way of heterosexual males. (Males often feel it is their God-given right to ""let themselves go,"" to walk around with huge paunches, balding pates, grease-stained togs, foul breath, etc., and still be considered ""real catches."" Why? Because they're MEN! There's this inordinate male pride going on in our society now, along with a sense of entitlement (are you SURE this isn't 1955?), and all women are expected to bow down to the ""obviously superior male"" of the species. That includes calling them GORGEOUS when they are, in fact, what we used to call just ""nice"" looking. Nowadays, there are a million films out, starring guys who could only be called very unattractive in anyone's book, and their love interests are always played by truly gorgeous females. What's with that? I am not the only one who noticed this. A reporter for the L.A. Times, plus many other reporters online, have noticed this trend, too.<br/><br/>The guy in the film who played the deceased spouse? He was nice looking. But ""gorgeous""? I don't THINK so! Try looking at Alain Delon in his 20s! Now THAT is gorgeous. And there's nothing out there even remotely like him nowadays.<br/><br/>I tho't Hilary Swank did well in this film. I do take issue with the screenwriter, though. That big fight that Hilary had with her spouse early on in the film that most people here loved? Horrible!!! Hilary's character was being whiny and just looking for a reason, it seems, to be angry. She was not angry for any valid reason. Luckily, by the time a female gets more mature, she realizes the folly of starting fights over little itty bitty things such as were portrayed in this film. Hell, had I been the character married to the character played by Hilary, I would have told her precisely what I thought of her pettiness --- before walking out on her and slamming the door! Still, all in all, a nice fantasy (that men can really be as considerate and loving as the guy in the film). We who have been around the block awhile know that, of course, these guys do not exist in real life."

","Who would have thought Hilary Swank could be dolled up to look like Audrey Hepburn? I can't remember exactly what made me want to see this movie. Or to be honest, I do. It was the prospect of two hours filled with good looks and fancy dresses. Sadly, the divine Gina Gershon and ""Friends"" regular Lisa Kudrow have aged very badly. But Hilary Swank does indeed deliver on the poster's pretty girl promise. Everybody knows she isn't a natural beauty with her angular jaw, big teeth, and overly athletic physique. And, by the way, she *really* can't sing. Yet she is totally adorable in her preppy skirts, tailored coats, and designer shoes. And the Alice band! The Alice band gets me every time. Needless to say, the plot is laughable. Go see it anyway if you liked ""Local Hero"", ""The MatchMaker"", ""Dead by Monday"", ""Serendipity"", or ""Prime"". Or if you simply like the idea of Hilary Swank with an Alice band. Guest appearance by singer-songwriter Nellie McKay in the part of Holly's quirky blonde sister."

While the filmmaking is genuinely competent and well thought-out, the script is predictable and essentially every rom-com cliché is thrown in. The performances are as good as they can be, what with lazy and contrived writing; particularly Lisa Kudrow and several one-scened background characters. And I can say I wasn't bored throughout the movie. Personally, I think this kind of story would work much better in a one-act play.

","One of my pet peeves is when somebody writes a film review and says ""It's not at all like the book"". Well, guess what?? That's because it's NOT the book!!!!! It's an adaptation that must condense a story premise, introduce and develop characters, create story arcs and climaxes in 90 minutes based on a book that takes many hours or days to read. If you like the book so much, maybe you would be better off NOT seeing the film. <br/><br/>Now, for my review of this film. It's quite formulaic and predictable, has a tremendous amount of dialogue that has been stolen from classic novels and films, contains many pretentious and contrived scenes, and the casting of Hillary Swank was a huge mistake. On a rainy evening, this is a decent film to watch with your wife or special friend when it comes on HBO but strictly from a film perspective, it's not very memorable."

I haven't read the novel but I guess my tryst with this tale had to wait until 2014. I am absolutely thrilled to see a love story being played with such humor surrounding it. Gerard Butler plays the Irishman with natural ease and Hillary Swank follows up on her part by being that girl in love, hung over by the death of her husband and yet lively enough to do everything that he asks of her from the afterlife. Planning ahead for all the letters being sent at the right time and how they are encountered seems a little too much drama but ohh well it was very believable and doable too.. all it needed was the feeling of caring for someone beyond the time when they can possibly care for you. Simple words to read but not so simple to adapt in reality. The open mindedness of Hillary's character is very appreciably put forward and she is willing to go follow the path of mutual happiness that her deceased husband has planned for her. Best scene...

The opening scene treats us to crackling dialogue between the two loving spouses in the form of playful fighting, rapier barbs flung rapid-fire at each other containing equal bits of tease and biting truths. In other words ... marriage. It's a genuine delight to see these two fine actors in action. The salvos feel so pure and real it recalls similar in-fighting from another classic film you may have heard of, ""It Happened One Night,"" and the snappy duels between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. <br/><br/>Indeed, the film pays direct homage to the romantic classics of yore, Holly a film buff watching Bette Davis films and singing aloud to the Judy Garland torch song ""The Man That Got Away.""<br/><br/>Back to the letters.

Later during the extended healing process, Holly befriends Daniel, the male parallel to Holly who's heartbreak is played exquisitely on his sleeve by Harry Connick Jr. Holly prefers to mourn alone, sulking in her apartment where her grief borders on mental illness and Gerry is resurrected in her mind like Harvey the rabbit. When mom and friends surprise her with a birthday cake, the real-life Gerry comes back into her life, first in the form of a recording he made before he died to wish her a happy birthday, knowing he won't be there.

Holly Kennedy is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry, always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother or her best friends, Sharon and Denise. But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning.

With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: ""P.S. I love you."" Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank may have two Oscars, but P.S. I Love You proves she has plenty to learn about romantic comedies.Too bad that she was miscast in this film.Aside from that,it also happens to be just a standard romantic comedy that is clichéd,formulaic and average.It adds nothing to its genre and the screenplay has already been told many times in other movies."

","Well, the movie begins well with an incredible scene of domestic quarrel between Hilary and her husband. Then, come the credits, next the grieving. That was tastefully done because we know that they are deeply in love and we don't have to live the dreadful period of his illness and death. Then, the letters arrive and i found that it was a very original idea that a terminally ill could plan his support. To my knowledge, it was the first story of this kind. The moments Hilary shares with his ""ghost"" are moving and i thought it would be a great movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the cast is not great: Bates is a dull mother, Kudrow is a pathetic man-eater, Hilary's future landlord plays too much the playboy. Only Connick is funny but their relationship is a bit absurd. Furthermore, the story drags a lot and the letters lead to nothing fundamental. The Ireland journey is exotic for the colors (i understand why it's called the Emerald Island) but nothing really happens! <br/><br/>And the ""coup de grace"" for such an Irish movie is the absence of a U2 song, especially when the title song of Blunt copies their chorus of ""in a little while"".

Then the husband sends letters to her after his death. That's not to say the acting in the movie was horrible, in fact it was fine, but the storyline was VERY pore.<br/><br/>They invented a character into the movie, gave a character a syndrome when he wasn't meant to, made characters American instead of Irish and deleted many of my favourite characters out!

","I may have seen clips of this film featured in Great Movie Mistakes, but that wasn't going to stop me wanting to see it, as I has wanted to since I liked the two leading actors and sounded like something to be tried. Basically the beautiful Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and her good looking Irish husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) may have had a small squabble or two sometimes, but they were a happily married living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. It is only after the tragic death of Gerry, from an incurable brain tumour, that Holly really realises how in love with him she really was but may not have shown it enough. So it comes to Holly's thirtieth birthday, and she only has her friends, Denise Hennessey (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon McCarthy (Gina Gershon) to offer some comfort, but she gets a shock present. Obviously no-one knew Holly better than Gerry, so when she gets a surprise cake, she is shocked to read that it is from Gerry, he says that this is the first of a series of letters he arranged to have delivered for after his death. Holly is now hoping everyday to receive a new letter from Gerry, from beyond the grave, and every one details a surprise he had prearranged, and all end with the meaningful words ""P.S. I Love You"". So through the passing seasons she gets details of shopping days, going to a karaoke night, and a holiday to his home country of Ireland, where they first met, and we see other flashbacks of the experiences he has given to do all over again. Patricia Reilly (Kathy Bates) is concerned that Gerry has done all this to keep Holly living in the past, but in fact they are leading the way towards her future, this is a journey of self discovery. After Denise reveals she is engaged, and Sharons reveals she is pregnant, Holly slip back into a hard feeling of sadness, but she picks herself back up to become a professional shoe artist, designing and making a new line. In the end Holly does receive the final letter Gerry made before he died, not long after almost getting close to friend Daniel Connelly (Harry Connick Jr.), and it basically says she can let go of the past, move on, and try and fall in love again, and she may do that. Also starring Nellie McKay as Ciara Reilly and Dean Winters as Tom. Swank is reliable almost all the way through, it was especially nice to see her get her great belly out, Butler in the flashbacks and voice-overs is a nice guy, and the supporting cast get their tiny moments of humour. It is funny in some moments, but the film is dominated by more of the feeling of sympathy for Swank reading these very sweet but overly reminiscent letters, also, I found the first half more interesting than the second, it is a pickled but near enjoyable comedy drama. Okay!"
"toots81","6","1","2","30 January 2011"," PS the book was FAR superior..
","I absolutely LOVED the book but the film did not do it justice. I found the characters, in particular Daniel and Holly's mum to be obnoxious. They were all incredibly unsympathetic to someone who had just lost the love of her life. Gerard Butler's accent was dreadful but I can forgive that man pretty much anything! I agree that the Gerry flashbacks were cheesy and cringe-worthy, also the depiction of their relationship at the start didn't do them justice at all. It didn't show the love they had for each other. And using 'Fairytale....' for the funeral. Talk about a cliché! I expected to cry buckets at the film, like I did with the book but it didn't happen."

","Gerard Butler does a great acting job in this movie. It's too bad that this movie is really more about Hillary Swank and her failure to come to grips with reality than it is about him.<br/><br/>In the first scene of the movie, Gerard and Hillary are having a squabble. They've been married for a few years, have what seems to be a nice life, but Hillary is upset because she doesn't think that life will get any better. She carries this pessimistic attitude throughout the movie. They wind up making up and everything seems great.<br/><br/>Next scene, life changes drastically when the scene is Gerard's Irish Pub style funeral. Boom, what a transition. How did we get from point A to point B? I was left pondering what was the purpose of that first scene. I've discussed this other friends and each one has a different theory.<br/><br/>Anyway, the rest of the movie is about Hillary Swank's reluctance to get over Gerard's unexpected departure. She has a great group of friends and a mom who is very supportive, but Hillary would rather be depressed than move on. She gets letters from her departed husband and in his letters he gives her great advice... move on with your life. Yet she seems stuck in a rut that she has no desire to get out of. When she finally meets a man she's attracted to (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), she finds out that he's an old mate of Gerard's and that kind of ends that.<br/><br/>Well, eventually, after 2 painful hours of watching her struggle, the movie finally wraps up. There's a guy who really likes her, but she's just not interested.<br/><br/>There's no real ending here. Life just goes on and we all can hope that she gets over her loss. There's hope at the end, but we're really not sure.<br/><br/>I give this movie 6 stars for the acting, which was superior. The story was fine and the characters were interesting. There just wasn't a happy ending here that I was hoping for."

","could something like this be possible. The whole story just didn't sound very plausible to me. It was too sappy, too dramatic. In the movie Holly's husband Gerry, dies from a brain tumor. They had been married ten years, and were still in love. She doesn't know how she will get through this. Then after several weeks, a birthday cake and letter arrive from her deceased husband. He said he planned all of this out and will send her letters throughout the months to help her get over his death. Such as want her to go sing karaoke, take a trip to Ireland and visits his parents, and fall in love again. Holly finds out in the end it was her mother whom was helping Gerry do all this.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like is Gerry would just show up and it wasn't flashbacks. Also, that was just creepy having Holly sleep with Gerry's best bud in Ireland.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Those that love the date/romance movies will probably like this more. I thought it was decent, but not great and I just didn't buy this as something that could really happen."

","Some of my favorite authors are women, but here we have one of those female writers with Zero Life Experience doing a tearjerker in full compliance to the junk-book formulas they teach in Creative Writing. The sad result is a tragic romance devoid of any tears --- devoid of any contact with either real life or real people. Despite several good scenes and able acting by the cast, the film is emotionally dead.<br/><br/>To begin with, a man dying from a brain tumor -- if anyone cares -- is not likely to be disposed to think up cutesie wootsie letters and gifts to leave behind to follow his death. No, brain tumors are painful and depressing; just not the Big Motivator for romantic thoughts. Double that if the man is a struggling artist with no excess money.<br/><br/>I confess I often cry in the movies; but nothing in this mess motivates a tear. One final complaint: I like having movies take me to interesting places where I might like to go on my own later. For example, Dublin, Ireland. That's fine, but I'm not interested in being Shanghied into a trip to a Manhattan gay bar. Like the characters in this movie, I'm strictly heterosexual (and proud of it). Anyway, gays are in these places for the serious business of finding a hook-up. They don't need or want sightseers invading their turf."
"alzanden","4","1","2","10 September 2008"," Read the book!
","We had rented the movie a few weeks before, and while a few parts did jerk a few tears out (no biggie, a lot of commercials can make me cry) I pretty much hated the movie. The characters had no depth, no real emotion. Holly seemed more bored and inconvenienced at her husbands funeral than sad, she had one major break down in the beginning and then the rest of the movie (from what I can remember between naps) was her and her girlfriends going off on escapades that her husband instructed her to partake in via monthly letters that he left her. The letter thing seemed like a horrible, horrible idea to me in the movie....like how do you ever accept someones death when they are somewhat still alive to you by getting a monthly letter from them? What will happen once the letters stop? But the book was so different from the movie, which in comparison was so...crass. The book had real emotion, real feelings...I cried several times reading the book because you could feel for Holly, you could identify with her grief and her happiness and her guilt for feeling happy, her nothingness, her hope, her lack of hope, her inability to even get out of bed some days. Somehow the letters seemed to work much better in the book, I viewed them as one last keepsake, a slower way of letting her still hang on to her husband in the year that she needed him the most, it was a way for him to teach her to live on without him over the course of a year, rather than learning this all at once. While doing much better with a job and new friends by the end of the book and nearing the one year mark since his death, she was still obviously absolutely lost without her husband and her mix of good and bad days reflected that in the book.<br/><br/>Her friends and family were also much more loving and sympathetic in the book, but they also had their own feelings. You could identify with her friends hurt feeling when Holly wasn't supergeeked about her friends upcoming wedding and her other friends pregnancy knowing that they were embarking on lives that she no longer had.....but at the same time you could totally see Holly's side of it that just because it had been almost a year and she appeared to be doing better, it was all still very raw and still hurt and while she was happy for her friends, she couldn't stop feeling the pain of jealousy that they were experiencing happiness that she didn't have anymore, or at least wouldn't have again with her husband. What Holly went through was the very real, very true emotions of losing a loved one. Once the funeral is done and when you appear to have begun to pick up the pieces, people think you are fine, they think you have moved on because they have, because that persons death, while sad to them, doesn't affect their daily life as much, their every waking second. Their life wasn't altered 100 times over by the loss, so they forget the pain you are going through.<br/><br/>I almost want to pick it up and start reading it all over again. It is a good book on its own, but after enduring the pain that is watching the movie, it makes the book that much better. If you like to read, do yourself a favor and check out this book. I will definitely be looking for the other books Cecelia Ahern has written. And to think she was only 21 when she wrote that book and to my knowledge had not experienced the loss of a husband or significant other....but I think she HAD to have experienced some kind of loss, either that or she can somehow very easily identify with how someone must feel in that case."
"Sanou_san","6","1","2","8 September 2008"," An average date movie, very mistaken.
","I've been a fan of Gerard Butler in chains of movies that showed his talent and it was recently a surprise for me to found out that he made a project with Hilary Swank featuring a date movie of romance and comedy genre. However the reviews I thought so convincing and very much true to depict what the movie was really about. A lot of people says that it was instead a dramatic love story rather than a romantic comedy, they were wrong, and others also shared that it was a tear-jerker movie since after the advent of ""The Notebook""and exactly they were wrong again. My anticipation for this film was half-thwarted. I thought that it was a movie that would sincerely pinch my heart and make my eyes go tear-falling unnoticed but I was wrong, truly this film is half-disappointing. It was mostly drenched with tedious conversations, which had bored me most for the first 30 minutes then the next 30 then another next 30it seems that the remarks of people concerning this film was so overstated or exaggerated, and they dare to compare it with ""The Notebook""? please give me a break! It did not even moved my heart and my feelings to feel for a moment Holly's despair and resentment over her husband's death, but honestly a littleabout that scene where Holly keeps on calling Gerry's cellphone until she fell asleep, that was a vestige of a good drama flick. But when the movie progresses it wasn't at all that ""progressing"". It saddened me that, Gerard Butler, whom according to my findings wanted to call him Gerry instead of Gerard due to pronunciation conflicts, and whom I loved so much for his excellent acting career and real life achievements, was ineffectively utilized in this film. I believe I'm not the only one alone with this estimation, but to compensate it was still a capably nice average date movie."

","Any movie that has a romantic comedy label is one that I will see-- anything in the 90's with Meg Ryan in it was on my hit list. I rented this one because I had heard so many great things about it and it seemed like a good choice. Instead of being uplifting and funny, I was bawling through the whole thing! My main problem with this film is the casting-- Hilary Swank does not gain my sympathy in the role of Holly at all. In fact, I didn't like Holly very much-- she seemed spoiled, whiny and vapid for the whole movie to me. I guess I just don't find her attractive and her voice sounds too masculine to me. Gerard Butler was great, as was Kathy Bates (as always!). I loved the premise of her husband-- his deep love for her and his ability to see her as she didn't see herself-- but Hilary Swank didn't do it for me. I would have cast Ginnfer Goodwin or Maggie Gyllenhaal for this role."

The Irish scenery was nice and the accents were OK, just the words in the accents, oh my! And the part about the Yankees being on the road but the stadium ball field being lined as if for a game . . . oh, the director is the same guy who wrote it, no wonder.

","I've generally read that people don't like/don't care for the movie and I can see why.<br/><br/>I've marked this the Spoiler warning, so you are warned. I would like to state that the movie is enjoyable as is, I tend to think that people take movies to seriously and think that every movie has to blow them away. . Which is always a leading factor as to why a good movie can fail. . some movies weren't meant to blow your mind, or be the best movie of all time, some movies just want to set out and be a nice 2 or so hours where you don't have to worry about stress and other life complications.<br/><br/>The movie was enjoyable, the acting was. . passable. Gina and Lisa do well with what little they are given, JDM was charming. I found Swanks character to be selfish, and didn't care for her at times. . its hard to feel sympathy for a character when she doesn't feel joy when her friend declares shes pregnant, or getting married, yes her husband died, its okay to feel sad that hes gone and you'll never have a baby with him but be a friend and at least smile at the news.<br/><br/>The movie felt way to long, the movie could of done without the sometimes lengthy flashbacks, Connicks character could of been removed entirely, and the sister could of been easily removed to. .neither of these characters did much besides add extra, unnecessary time to the movie.<br/><br/>I would of gotten to the plot a bit sooner, we don't need to see Swank being sad for half an hour before the plot of the movie is revealed.<br/><br/>If the movie was just shorter it would be better, if Swanks character was just a bit more sympathetic the movie would of been better.<br/><br/>Do not go into this movie expecting a masterpiece, to believe this will be the best movie ever, go into the movie expecting to watch a movie, to smile at some parts, to be sad in others. Besides the over long scenes the movie isn't bad."
"gradyharp","8","1","2","11 May 2008"," A Nice Little Surprise Film
","Marketing P.S. I LOVE YOU was a hit/miss situation. The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief. <br/><br/>Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets. But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago. In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew. While in Ireland Holly reminisces on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her. And she ultimately finds closure to her loss. <br/><br/>The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and Gershon. They make the implausible plausible and deliver a love story that goes beyond the level of superficial to join the ranks of warm and tender memorable slices of life. It is surprisingly good!

"Benjamin_Cox","7","1","2","3 February 2008"," An emotive, implausible romantic movie with real chemistry - 76%
","My Better Half had been bugging me to go and watch this since it was released and yesterday, I finally relented. Mind you, I wasn't completely reluctant - this film has been receiving a great deal of good praise heaped upon and frankly, I was surprised it was still on at the cinema after being released ages ago so it must have been doing something right, I figured. And it does - this is a real emotional roller-coaster of a movie and is the first film I've seen in ages that has a real tangible chemistry between the two leads.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler play Holly & Gerry Kennedy, a happily married couple of nine years struggling to make ends meet in a tiny apartment and limited income. When Gerry passes away due to a brain tumour, Holly's world falls apart and she becomes increasingly isolated and withdrawn from her mother (Kathy Bates) and her friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon). But a surprise letter on her birthday arrives from Gerry and it's the start of a long healing process as each letter arrives and helps her overcome her grief.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt that the plot was too convoluted to be believable - whilst undeniably romantic, the timing of each delivery was simply too convenient. The camera also had an annoyingly shaky temperament, reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"" although nothing like as bad, which also put me off slightly. However, what cannot be denied is the powerful performance from Swank as the grieving widow failing to cope with her loss. Butler is also very good, totally different from his bare-chested machismo in ""300"". The scenes between the two are far and away the most entertaining and the most plausible - my Better Half was laughing during the opening moments, claiming that they were just like us! And she was right - the chemistry between Butler and Swank is incredible and really makes the movie far better than it has any right to be. But away from the romance and tragedy, there are several lighter moments that also work well, though nothing gut-bustingly funny. Harry Connick Jr has the best lines, though Kudrow pushes him as the man-eating Denise.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting that much from this but ""P.S. I Love You"" is a real gem of a film, providing laughs and tears in equal measures and is thoroughly recommended. It isn't often that a film can cover multiple genres and do them justice (""Shaun Of The Dead"" is probably the best example I can think of) but this is a happy surprise. It's unconventional, brilliantly written and wonderfully shot - viewers not used to sweeping shots of rural Ireland are in for a treat. It's a shame the camera-work is unnecessarily wobbly and the supporting cast are largely anonymous - Gershon is barely noticeable next to Kudrow. But you'd be quite daft to miss this movie which deserves every bit of good praise heaped on it due to terrifically emotive performances from the leads, a romantic (if implausible) plot and genuinely amusing scenes. Maybe I should start listening to my Better Half a bit more..."

It's been warmly reviewed in the IMDb, and is the winner of a dozen international awards.<br/><br/>P.S. I Love You has the indestructible Hilary Swank, but it's also terribly strained.

","The plot of this movie is about a young widow who discovers that her late husband left her 10 letters to help ease her pain and start life all over again .Hilary Swank who plays Holly Kennedy and her husband Gerard Buttler who plays Gerry are the main characters. Other characters like Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) and her two sisters Denise and Sharon (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) appear later in the movie. This movie starts with its first setting at the couples Manhattan apartment in New York City. The director does a good job by using his camera's high angle position which makes the apartment appear very small and crowded as he introduces us to their life. He also uses a Low angle camera position making the couple appear larger in a small apartment to put emphasize on how small the apartment is. The second setting events take place at Holly's mother's bar where their friends and family meet often. This is also a setting that the director uses for Gerry's memorial ceremony as we see all his friends and family gather to bid him goodbye.<br/><br/>The director shows us their love by focusing a close- up shot not once but many times as they kiss each other and all there is, is their faces on the screen. After suffering from a brain tumor and later dying from it, Gerry leaves behind the 10 letters distributed to different people (his friends) instructing them of when to dispatch them to his wife. The letters would come to her in an organized manner instructing her of what to do when, how and with whom. She forgets everything and starts living for the letters. Here the director focuses on her emotions as he brings to us close-up shots again when she cries lying in bed.<br/><br/>This movie will make you smile, choke up or even wet your eyes. No drama or romance movie has ever hit home like this. You will be left appreciating life and mostly the people you care about.

Ill admit that I am not finding it difficult putting into words just how dreadful this ""Romcom"" actually is. The actors and actresses in this movie ,apart from Lisa Kudrow & Kathy Bates, really should know better than to subject an audience to such MISERY (maybe a curse was put on the film seeing as Kathy Bates got such a paltry role.) The Irish accents are just painful to listen to as is usually the case. The plot seems to have been mauled to death by a pitbull, its as if the director was aiming for some grand romantic tragedy and ended up with a tragic flop. There is no spark between our two love birds at the start of the film and the male lead will hopefully have ended is acting career as I for one would never want to watch such pitiful acting again. Some reviewers have been kind and said that if the film were in the hands of another director, then this film could have been good but i personally don't believe this to be the case as the only thing right and good about this film is the when we finally reach the end.

","Yes, it's a chick flick. Yes, it's a tear-jerker. Yes, it's not the most 'creative' writing ever on film. Yes, it's predictable. <br/><br/>However, if you're up for a chick flick, tear jerking, bittersweet, warm and fuzzy couple of hours, this is a great choice. <br/><br/>Gerard Butler is the star, but not given nearly as much time on screen as he deserves, or as one would be lead to believe considering he's on the movie poster! <br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow is essentially ""Pheobe"" in this film, with simply another name. Great comic relief. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank for this role? Hmmm, I didn't sense the chemistry between her and Butler. Perhaps Amanda Peet would've been better in the role? Cameron Diaz? Yes, Swank is a great actress, but she just didn't seem to fit the role of grieving widow too well. She was flat. And seemingly only two dimensional. <br/><br/>Bates is fabulous, as always. <br/><br/>So, Butler and Bates are the reasons one should watch this film. It's a heartwarming tale about the love of man for his wife. (who happens to be similar to a stick in the mud, & if that was what's intended, then Swank did a great job)<br/><br/>The reason I rated it so highly is because of Gerard Butler. He really shows his acting chops. He's the multidimensional guy to watch. Very funny, very endearing, very lovable, charming...and sweet. Not only when you get your 15-20 minutes of Gerard eye candy in the start, but when you hear his voice via the letters...his voice over is enough to bring you to tears...<br/><br/>Ireland was captured wonderfully by the DP. Definitely helps to market it as a place you want to see. <br/><br/>I gave it such a high rating not only for the laughs, the quirkiness of 'Gerry', but because it fit it's bill as a romantic comedy that delivers. <br/><br/>Me thinks it would have done better had it been casted without the dull Swank as it's female lead? Without the chemistry between her and Butler, you will have to suspend your beliefs for the movie and pretend.....<br/><br/>But don't we always pretend when we're watching warm and fuzzy, bittersweet dramatic romantic comedies?"

","This review contains a possible spoiler concerning the book of the same title. This movie was so wonderful! I have watched it a dozen times in the 5 days I have owned it & still can't get enough. I fall in love with Gerard Butler & Jeffrey Dean Morgan over & over again in this movie. Every scene with either of these two heartthrobs melts my heart. P.S. I Love You is a touching, romantic, funny tearjerker. I laughed, I cried, I was smitten, then did it all again. I really recommend this movie to everyone. My 3 teenage sons even loved this movie. They found it exceedingly funny throughout. This is one that I will never tire of! WARNING!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER!! I've heard that the book is very good as well, but I haven't read it & don't think I will. I accidentally read a spoiler about the book that makes me think that the book may be quite different from the movie. This movie does your heart good! It reminds you to hold on & let go! Now, I just have to go see Ireland! Now, more than ever!!!"
"Aprodia","9","1","3","1 May 2008"," Resurrects more than a grief-stricken widow
","To say I am not the romantic type would pretty much hit the mark. The usual flick would make me at the most willing to take an unpleasant phone call for the idea of it. But I must say, as it is not five minutes after the credits of ""P.S. I Love You"" rolled over my screen, that I am impressed and surprisingly hopeful.<br/><br/>I read in the synopsis that Butler's character dies pretty much in the beginning of the movie, so I was a little disappointed, since he was the source of my interest for ""P.S. I Love You"" . He, however, graces with his presence during the entire movie, proving right its main idea with talent and incredible presence. Furthermore, Swank's acting was amazing. After her all-consuming popularity I was downright sick seeing her face everywhere. But she managed once again to give a unique and capturing performance, making a bond with everyone around her so that the scene works naturally.<br/><br/>The movie itself was a pleasant surprise and worthy addition to the already bulky flick genre. What caught my fancy was these moments when the drama gets a bit over the top, or a silly detail at first sight slipped by mistake sets it, and the main character pinpoints that exact thing, loosing the tension and making you feel a part of the action.<br/><br/>The music, too, was not corny, and not walking a single line of thought. A slight, gentle tune here, a wild and hilarious 'funeral' song there, set the mood right.<br/><br/>And Ireland... well. There is a famous saying, and I am pretty convinced it's not a nationalistic propaganda. You're either born Irish, or wanting to be one. So don't miss the chance to catch a glimpse of that breathtaking nature... and population.<br/><br/>9/10, and you better not miss it."

","I don't know where to start really?! The people that made this movie are genius ! It is the best romantic movie that i have ever seen !! It is well played with GREAT actors and script very well worked through ! Hillary Swank is very good in this movie (her best role ever) and i don't really like her movies otherwise ! But Gerard Butler is far better then good !! finally he is in serious American/Hollywood movie were he belongs (not in tiny parts in crappy mini-series or B movies). This a movie that us ""normal"" people can really relate too ! It is not all happily ever after and stuff but it deals with big issues such as death and life and love ..etc !! It is one of the few really genuine romantic movies out there !<br/><br/>This movie made me both laugh and cry, and i don't cry that easy so this just shows how good it really is !<br/><br/>It is worth 10 out 10 because it is so genuine and unique and very very good !<br/><br/>I hope to see much more of this kind of movies in the future with the same genuine feel to it ... a movie that is really thought through and is pure quality !!<br/><br/>If you wanna see a really good movie see this one !!"
"jeromec-2","10","1","3","24 February 2008"," PS I love you is a controversial Film. I give it a ten, but
","I've read perhaps two-dozen reviews on this film. People either like it or they hate it: very few are in the middle.<br/><br/>There are those who have lost mates and those who are going to perhaps and those who have not lost anyone, or have not said they have. There is no clear pattern although I would have to say that those who lost someone had the most decided feelings whichever way they felt about it.<br/><br/>I have lost someone (my first wife). I know that this film avoids the reality of watching someone suffer pain and anger and not being able to do anything about it.<br/><br/>The movie is only 2 hours long, a fact we often forget when watching films. Life can make us live through events that take months or years.<br/><br/>Mourning is not easy. It is full of remembered joy and love, regret, guilt, loneliness, confusion, rage and a whole gamut of ugly and beautiful emotions almost too numerous to list.<br/><br/>One lady I read said she hated the film because she found reminders everywhere: she would be completely unhinged by letters from the grave. I completely respect that point of view, and believe hers was a very real response.<br/><br/>I do not share it. I wish I could send letters the other way. I wish I could tell her how much I miss her. I wish I could say some of the things she deserves to hear that I could not tell her while she lived. I wish I could thank her for the education she gave me just by living with me.<br/><br/>That's what I think this film is about. Gerry (Gerald Butler) loves and is married to Holly (Hillary Swank). The opening scene before the credits shows them having a terrible fight where all their unspoken fundamental differences are shouted at each other. Then the credits. Then a new scene where there is Gerry's wake. Then a series of 10 letters, each one with another request and another part of the plan which he intends to heal her and lead her from mourning to health and perhaps to celebration.<br/><br/>He knows her well. He suggests things that she would not do on her own, but that she needs to do. She needed to clean up the apartment, not because it would give her more room, but because it would give her emotions more space. There's quite a difference. She needs to get out and do things she was not good at (like sing) because singing is the language of the soul, and hers needed awakening. (Don't look for Swank to sing well. She doesn't.) She needed to go to Ireland, because it was not America and she needed to make contact with not only his body and mind, but his very essence.<br/><br/>Slowly she finds her own talents, her own expressions, her own feelings, and her own way of celebrations. Kathy Bates is wonderful as the mother: tough as a steel girder, soft as pliable as paper. The two friends are a delight (although many people who saw this movie did not think so.) The hesitancy on my part only depends on how we can be swallowed not by what is, but what we wish to be true. Remember to read as many reviews as you can. Some people liked it; many did not. I am easily won over because I like Hilary Swank. Even her so/so movies get a good rating from me (like The Freedom Writers.)<br/><br/>I saw this film in the same audience as 6 ten year old girls. I would have thought that this film was totally inappropriate for them. However when it was over, one of them said to one of the others, ""I really liked this film. It was so sad. I cried three times. How many times did you cry?"" <br/><br/>The sadness struck me as well. I could have answered her question if asked. She would have given it ten out of ten. So would I, but I understand those who would not."
"jimpowellsf","8","1","3","25 January 2008"," A good film...catered to adults
","For anyone past their mid-20's this film has plenty. Life can throw all kinds of unexpected stuff at you, and this film has tenderness, honesty, the good & bad, the laughter & tears, and a couple of good lessons, too. The actors do a fine job of making what could have easily been a hokey film into something far better than hokey.<br/><br/>Watching this I was reminded of another Richard LaGravenese film, ""Living Out Loud"". That movie is one of my all-time favorites, and it also seems to be aimed at a more adult viewer. Granted, there are parts of the film that seem contrived, but that's what movies are for, eh? Escape, entertainment, and suspension of reality. :) I found poignant moments throughout the film and not necessarily at the parts that most would expect. Just like life, I found that some of the most moving times were with the smallest of gestures. That being said I didn't ever feel manipulated; but having lived a good number of years, I could certainly relate to a number of moments in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it was money well spent at the theater which is more than I can say for a lot of other crud out there."

","After reading a lot of the comments here, I was considering withdrawing a comment, but figured I would comment nonetheless.<br/><br/>Having read the book last year (of course) I was disappointed - the books are always better than the films. The film seems to have taken some of the best bits of the book and shoved them into the film, missing out other stuff which I thought was important to the storyline.<br/><br/>Strange to see Swank play 'a girl' for once, but she did it well. Harry Connick Jnrs character was highly annoying, which in the book he isn't, he is a total rock and less annoying. The mother too, Kathy Bates is wonderful, but I wanted to smack her in the face.<br/><br/>I didn't shed a tear and kept saying to my girlfriend next to me 'I can't remember that happening in the book?!' <br/><br/>For those who have read the book - don't expect too much from the film.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the film... read the book! <br/><br/>M"

Then you'll find yourself sobbing. I was touched. There were moments that I wanted to stand and clap. Then the theater would fall quiet and you could hear a pin drop.

"earderne","7","1","3","11 January 2008"," Wonderful Film, with outstanding Music.
","I really enjoyed this movie and cannot understand its trashing by some critics.Perhaps they didn't like the fact that it doesn't fit into the usual rom-com pigeonhole,and many also seemed to disapprove of Hilary Swank's change of acting genre. The film is romantic and touching but also shot through with astringent humour - just like life itself, which can be disjointed and unpredictable. The music all through the film is excellent, with a variety of artists and moods and the 'P.S I love You' CD that has been released brings it all back to you - the only regret I have is that 'Mustang Sally' and 'Galway Girl' sung by Gerard Butler in the film, are not included. (He really can perform a song well and you can see his rock singer background.) I liked Hilary Swank very much as Holly and admire her for taking on the challenge of such a different role. She had depth suited to her character. Gerry Butler was wonderful and completely nailed the rogueish,charming,mischievous Gerry Kennedy. The chemistry between them was palpable and produced the best screen kisses for some time - especially in the Irish scenes. They ranged from tender,tentative first kisses in a country lane, to the scene in a pub where he sings to her,circling her, moving in closer until he abandons his guitar and sweeps her into his arms in a passionate embrace.(No wonder Mr Butler has the female following he has!) The chemistry was also there in another scene where Holly sings just for him and all his feelings for her show in his eyes. The other members of the cast were also excellent - Jeffrey Dean Morgan as sexy, gentle William: Harry Connick Junior's Daniel, the bartender with problems of his own:Kathy Bates, wonderful as Holly's protective,practical mother:the two best friends,Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon who brought much of the humour to the film. The locations were an additional plus. New York looked great, especially dressed up for Christmas, and Ireland was stunning and probably reminded Gerry Butler of Scotland and the country walks near his mother's home. One further comment on this actor's amazing range and the gallery of such different characters he has played so convincingly, even in films which were not box office triumphs. I had watched '300' on DVD the night before I saw 'P.S. I love You' and after seeing Leonidas cutting a bloody swathe through Xerxes' army, it was comical yet bizarre when Holly scolds Gerry and he asks plaintively 'Do I have to sleep in the bathtub again?'<br/><br/>So I hope you go and see the movie and judge for yourself - I am sure you will enjoy it."
"babybluetn","Null","1","3","9 January 2008"," My thoughts
","I personally think that this is a perfect date movie it'll make you love the person you're with even more. After Gerry dies and holly(Swank) just goes into his deep depression you feel it, I mean it's so intense and sad. I think it really hits you when she's dancing in his shirt and suspenders and boxers, with the house totally messy. It's so sad. But over all this movie makes you want to fall in love and experience the kinda love there's a possibility for all of us to feel. Throughout the movie and the letters you really get to see the bond of love that they shared.If you want sad/romantic/ comedy P.S. I love you is a great choice. Either go see with your close girl friends, or go see it with the love of your life. Don't go see it alone."
"cooldubgirl","10","1","3","9 January 2008"," loved the movie
","i thought that a previous comment on saying the movie was offensive to people who had lost people was completely ridiculous. I have lost two very important people very close to me and if one of them had done something like gerry did in this movie i wud have bin so grateful,,,the letter are not cruel reminders,simply letters letting holly know that he is still watching over her and helping her on her way to achieve the life she always wanted to plan. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, i laughed i cried and laughed and cried some more,,,a superb movie . i wud recommend it to both men and women,,,it also really made me appreciate my partner. If such a tragedy was to happen to us some day i would love more than anything to feel he is living on thru his letters until i am ready to move on and let him go"
"Yorkie06","7","1","3","9 January 2008"," PS I Love Gerry!
","OK - first off I admit I would go watch Gerard Butler read a telephone directory in an empty room. But going to see him play a part where he can let his good looks, charm, masculinity and acting skills (yes the man CAN act) is a bonus. So did it please and entertain as much as it should have? Well for starters, I had read the book - and have to say I wasn't overly impressed. But that wasn't going to deter me overmuch, given the Butler incentive. The ensemble cast were impressive, plenty of fine actors present, and I would say most did justice to their roles. Hilary and Gerard had wonderful chemistry, a believable relationship.<br/><br/>The (thankfully) long opening scene whereby we are given an insight into Holly and Gerry's marriage is wonderfully amusing letting us know how much in love these two are and just how much they live for each other, despite the arguments (the making up looks fun! - *sigh*) However, as the opening credits role, you realise that something BAD has happened - and when we re-open the movie Gerry has died. As someone previously pointed out - it was a bit abrupt - but then it is a romantic comedy so how much time would you give over to the lead up and horror of someone so young dying? And so to getting on with what the movie is really about - Holly unable to pick up the pieces of her shattered life - until she starts receiving letters from Gerry guiding her how to move on.<br/><br/>From that point the movie splits between the present - and the challenges Holly has to face, and the flashbacks to her former life with Gerry - even back to how they met, which keeps it bittersweet. You long for her to be able to embrace life again - then a flashback brings back the sadness of a life lost. I wouldn't call it an all-out tear-jerker - but you'll definitely have a lump in your throat.<br/><br/>The casting was great, Kathy Bates as Holly's mum particularly good. The scenery (no I'm not back to Mr Butler just yet) in Ireland was beautiful, the soundtrack great - brilliant to see and hear Gerry singing once again (although apparently NOT on the soundtrack?????) Of course the moral of the story was always going to be that Life Does Go On - we know that - so in that respect it hit the mark.<br/><br/>It was never meant to be a deep, serious look at life and death and lost loves, but a light hearted tale of a woman coming to terms with a tragedy (if that's not too much of a contradiction) not sure I like the term chick-flick, or if it really is, but it's a movie worth seeing and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>Oh - just go see it and see why Gerry has a huge, and growing legion of fans! Hot, Hottt, Hottttttt!"
"cjvelasquez","9","1","3","9 January 2008"," Absolutely Superb!!!!
","This movie has once again reinforced the idea that Hillary Swank is a undeniable force in cinema. The relationship established between her character and her husband is very powerful. In my opinion such on screen chemistry has not been matched since the Notebook. This move was a emotional ride that really made me think about my own life as I left the theater. Judging by the reactions in the movie I could tell that everybody was very much into the film.It is very refreshing to see that quality films are still being made that can stimulate ones emotions. I would strongly recommend this movie to anybody that appreciates the power of film."

","Finally saw PSILY this afternoon. I went in with fear & doubt as this movie was savaged to bits on Rotten Tomatoes (33% out 100). At the end of the day, those bad reviews came from overweight, divorced journalists who've forgotten the art of romance. PS is supposed to be sugary sweet, what's wrong with that? Whatever bad points there were in the film (Butler's Irish/Scots brogue - why not just set it in Scotland??)and forced comedy in places, you cannot escape the charm of not only the 2 attractive leads (no way is Swank ugly)- but the supporting cast, too. Jeffrey ""Supernatural"" Morgan was great & look fwd to seeing him in The Accidental Husband. I could also relate to Harry Connick's character where he quotes ""repelling the women he wants the most"".<br/><br/>Plus points of PSILY: <br/><br/>1. The reality of Holly Kennedy's situation, that neither she, or her hubby, have enough money to support a future baby and secure a bigger apt.<br/><br/>2. Gerry's singing: Why has Galway Girl not been included on the soundtrack??<br/><br/>3. Swank being as endearing as ever and showing to be adept at comedy. But where are those highlights in her hair that we saw in the poster?? Saw Phantom of the Opera as well. Plods along but would've been a far different affair if Tim Burton was directing. Gerry was amazingly good in the role & displaying the heroic qualities that would make him the ideal Leonidas in 300. A good singing voice, but given the operatic tone of Phantom, somehow doesn't fit in with everything else. However, in PSILY, that's quickly forgotten."
"mkochajda","10","1","3","5 January 2008"," P.S I love you...what can I say?
","Overall I loved P.S I love you. Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler had ton of chemistry and really were believable as a couple. I thought that this was a great romantic comedy that really made you think about your life and love in general. While this movie was extremely emotional and made me cry the rest of day, I would continue to watch this movie over and over despite the emotional roller coaster it put me through. I really love the fact that unlike many other sad tear-jerker movies you are able to see the emotions and pulling of life back together after the death of a loved one. I really hope to find a love like that shared by Holly and Gerry. I loved the flashbacks of their relationship and the emotions of Holly. I loved Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character and he did a great job. I did not like Harry Connick Jr.'s character at all but he played it well. Holly's friends, Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow were awesome and really added to the feeling of love in the movie. Overall while this movie was mainly about the love lost between Gerry and Holly it also held a lot of humor, wit, love of family and friends, and the journey of finding yourself again. I would recommend that if you cried through the whole thing the first time go see it again and you will catch all the humor and other lovely parts of the film. This movie was very different from the book, but I liked the movie more than the book.<br/><br/>Overall I give it 10/10 and it really is great to go see with your girlfriends. :D Check it out!"
"lgauntt89","Null","1","3","5 January 2008"," No resolution
","First off, I enjoyed the movie. I am always up for a good quality chick-flick with a few tears and a great soundtrack. I thought Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy was sincere and portrayed her part well. There was one major disappointment however; her character was unlikeable. As an audience member, you think you are going to like this character and be rooting for her, but instead I was rooting for the great men, opportunities and friends that she was just passing up. I understand that grief is an intense emotion that is hard to get over, but after the very first letter, she should have understood life was precious, not to wait around for anything or anyone thing to happen to you. <br/><br/>At the end of the film, Holly is basically in the same place as she was a year ago when Gerry died. She is still living just for Gerry, not for herself. In his letters, he even says she is independent, strong and should fall in love again, but the character does not possess those qualities. Instead, she is needy and only really thinks about herself. <br/><br/>I think the film was cast amazingly well, especially Gerard Butler as Gerry, he is so precious and loving. Harry Conick Jr. is the character I was rooting for the most because he was so genuine. Kathy Bates character grows on the audience, especially at the end. Jeffery Dean Morgan makes everyone smile, especially when we see his butt! And Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon are great supporting actresses. <br/><br/>Overall I would give the film a 7. Bring tissues if you go!"

","P.S.I LOVE YOU is a wonderful Christmas ornament to be hung on the tree when you want a warm and very entertaining love story with a solid cast and writing from Richard LaGravenese that is well constructed and from the first act when the characters are introduced with humor and issues between them, you are immediately drawn into the couple's world and the challenges in their marriage. Wendy Finerman has produced a winner with tremendous charisma between Hilary Swank as Holly, and the attractive Gerard Butler as Jerry. New York's lower east side is a location which adds to the story and to the characters' journey. Lisa Kudrow, per usual, adds such tremendous humor in lines which are well written and delivered. However, act three did seem a bit long in having Holly's journey come to a conclusion, but Hilary Swank and Kathy Bates deliver final scenes which make P. S.

I for one prefer open ended stories that allow the viewer the freedom to imagine and write the ending how they see fit this movie allows for this.<br/><br/>The entire movie is focused on the journey that a newly widowed woman undergoes along with the people closest to her.<br/><br/>Can a long dead husband through help and the time machine that written words represent help his wife's journey? Is his passing similar by accident or purpose to her father's sudden disappearance? Is the journey through life we go through always fraught with possibilities forks in our paths?

"mrjoynes","7","1","3","30 December 2007"," Good, but not as good as it could have been.
","I have been lucky enough to have seen 'P.S. I Love You' twice since it came out, and now, finally, I've come to review it.<br/><br/>I wish I could say that 'P.S. I Love You' was one of the best movies I've ever seen, but sadly, I can't. It was a good movie, yes, but there could have been so much more done to it. It's as if the people who wrote the screenplay didn't even bother to read the book.<br/><br/>In case you haven't read the novel on which this movie is supposed to be based, don't read it until after you've seen the movie, because you'll be sorely disappointed, as I was.<br/><br/>However, if you've read the book and haven't yet seen the movie, the following are elements of the book that could have/should have been in the movie: 1) Holly is given all ten letters from Gerry at once. She keeps them all with her and reads each new one at the first of every new month. The letters coming to her ""all sorts of ways"" just didn't sit well with me.<br/><br/>2) Flashback scenes in which Gerry is shown to be sick (going to the travel agency, writing the final letter, etc.). I felt that Gerard Butler was robbed of the chance to shine by doing some really emotional acting and not just be funny and silly all the time. If they'd at least put in a scene where he goes to the travel agency, I would have been fine. However, no sick Gerry is ever to be found. I mean, Gerard Butler's characters die in quite a few of his films, and in this one, he couldn't even play sick? How annoying.<br/><br/>3) Setting: Ireland. This movie, in case you haven't been able to tell by the trailer, is almost entirely set in New York. In the book, the story is mostly set in Ireland, and the trip that Holly, Sharon, and Denise take is in Spain. This movie did NOT have to be Americanized. It would have been fine to be mostly in Ireland. I wouldn't have minded lesser-known actors who are actually Irish or people who can pull off Irish accents. (Not that I didn't like the cast, mind you, but all the same.) It bothered me that Gerry, his family, and a few others were the only Irish people in the film.<br/><br/>4) Holly's family members. WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO HOLLY'S FAMILY? The vast majority of them are missing in the film, and I feel that they are quite important to the storyline (Holly's brother, Richard, at least, is quite important). And the fact that Holly's father has left in the film? Completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>That's all I can think of, but I'm sure there's more missing.<br/><br/>I know this review makes it seem like I didn't enjoy this movie, but, in fact, I did enjoy it. I'm just saying that it never reaches its full potential. However, I highly recommend it."

","P.S. I Love You is an OK movie. Definitely 100% chick flick. girls, do not bring your brothers, boyfriends, husbands, etc. they will be bored out of their minds. It was a very cute movie, it will make you cry at some points and make you laugh at others. I found that the whole thing overall was a little hard to follow time wise, but Hilary Swank did a nice job and the friends added comedy relief to what could have been an even sadder story. There are a few make out scenes, but the only nudity that is shown is William's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan's) butt. I give it an 8,only because it got a little confusing when Gerry started showing up after he died, and it was hard to tell what was flashback and what was her dreams."
"gpall","9","1","4","7 April 2008"," Great movie! One of the best I have seen this year.
","What a great story,somewhat original which is hard to find these days. Although perhaps a little predictable it still kept my attention through to the last line. The story was developed very plausible and had a feel good quality to it throughout the movie. it is refreshing to watch drama unfold with the feel good theme and not have things blowing up or action hero's winning the day battling against evil.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, Hillary Swank does a great job, what a class act she is. It was great to see her win an award for her efforts. Suppoting roles where strong and believable. The only weakness was in Harry Conick Jr.'s character. I am not sure what it was, the script or the actor failing to deliver but some small thing seemed to be missing.<br/><br/>Unfortunate the Academy did not see fit to give this movie any credit. Over all a job well done by everyone. I will buy this one for my collection when it becomes available."
"rawrsthetiger","9","1","4","7 April 2008"," What a tear jerker
","I'm only 17 years old, but this movie moved me in ways I could have never imagined. The first ten minute seen had me wishing my relationship was just like that. After the opening credits, I was in tears until the very end. I highly recommend this to anyone of any age. If you can stand a liiiittle bit of cussing, and some brief nudity then this is prefect for just about anyone. This movie had me cursing life wishing death could never happen. I was happy, I was sad, I laughed and I cried, and in the end, I called everyone I knew telling them to watch this movie. Hilary Swank, though not one of my favorite actors does an amazing job of playing the widow of a relationship destined for greatness, (and Gerard Butler has an amazing voice in this movie :) Please see it if you haven't already, and while watching, hold on to those you love."
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","4","17 February 2008"," emotional romantic tale
","Based on Cecelia Ahern's novel, P.S I love you tells the story of a young widow, who receives messages from her late husband, to help her move on with life.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank (Million dollar baby) stars as central character Holly Kennedy, who is struggling with the loss of her husband. Swank portrays the character extremely well. I really felt for her character as she portrayed Holly in a depressed and lonely way.<br/><br/>The story itself is very calm and sweet, with the occasional joke thrown in for light heartedness. It's a slow moving romantic drama which will make you feel for the central character in many different ways.<br/><br/>It's a story about love, loss and other strong human emotions. I personally thought that the film covered the issues very well. The issue of betrayal was an interesting perspective to cover given the situations put forth.<br/><br/>It's not as sad and emotional as it could be, but however is still emotional thanks to the wonderful dialogue and direction.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow (Friends) is the funniest of all the characters with her quirkiness and sophistication playing well to the situations.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler (300) is fantastic as late husband Gerry, who's actions after his passing are wonderful and so kind and generous for his wife, which are strong and passionate.<br/><br/>The use of flashbacks is very good in capturing the emotions of the character's and the setting. One great moment comes when the couple first meet in Ireland, which is slightly cliché but I personally think it's a very sweet moment in the lives of the characters.<br/><br/>I've never read the book but after seeing the film I would like to."
"DICK STEEL","7","1","4","9 February 2008"," A Nutshell Review: P.S. I Love You
","P.S. I Love You is a no-brainer for it to be released this Valentine's Day here, though the challenge of course will be putting couples into seats. Nonetheless everyone's in need for some form of love story, and this will likely fit the bill, although the story's as cliché as love stories can be, and it's not exactly new material for the screen, given that there's a Thai movie called ""The Letter"" (Jod Mai Rak) which likely had took a leaf from the source material, the novel P.S. I Love You written by Cecelia Ahern.<br/><br/>Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) Kennedy are a yuppie couple trying to find their footing in their married life - you know, the usual disapproval from their respective in-laws, Gerry's eagerness to have children, and Holly's perpetually sense of loss in her career, not knowing exactly what to do. We spend the first 10 minutes of the movie listening to typical couple bickering, before all of a sudden, Gerry bites the dust. Yes, you might think that given such a development, it's highly unsuitable as a Valentine's Day movie, but I'd say not to count your chickens first. Thankfully it doesn't dive into what Asian romances do - which is an extended hospital sequence with plenty of scenes to milk those tears out of your ducts - he goes, and that's it.<br/><br/>But of course Gerard Butler's name is not on the marquee for nothing, and he's not gonna earn that paycheck so easily. In Shattered which was shown few weeks back, Pierce Brosnan had to opportunity to flex his natural Irish accent. Here, it's Butler's turn, and that probably fluttered the hearts of many females in the audience from the audible sighs of falling in love with that, a great departure from his yowling and screaming for blood in 300 which he is now synonymous with. As the story goes, his Gerry finally comes out with concrete plans, one that is to continue the romance and to help his wife tide through his loss, through letters, instructions and the likes, nothing short of what Keanu Reeves did with Sandra Bullock in The Lake House, although that one had a time sensitive element involved.<br/><br/>I've always likened Hilary Swank to tough cookie roles, and Million Dollar Baby helped cement that fact. So to see her here, as a leading lady in a romantic movie, really took some time to get used to. Not to say that's she not pretty enough, but those biceps really complemented Butler's. If there's a weakness in the casting, I'm afraid to say that she's quite miscast because the role calls for a sense of vulnerability, and the inability to move on, and dwelling in one's loss. Hilary Swank doesn't project that, and unfortunately I thought that she could have picked herself up at any one point early in the film.<br/><br/>For the most parts, the narrative replays and recounts the love life between Gerry and Holly, taking us to places where their romance started and blossomed, with a host of characters on the side, such as Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon being her great girlfriends, hunters on the side with Harry Connick Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan the potential suitors, and of course, Kathy Bates being the mother. You can't deny though that there are some truths about relationships being communicated throughout, and those in reality are the gems the movie provides, and make great conversational pieces after the movie to discuss with your loved one. There's a nice, touching element of a surprise to it all too, though one can probably see it coming a mile away.<br/><br/>There are definitely some flaws in the movie pertaining to coincidences of events, but hey, falling in love itself does take some believing in the flawed cosmic logic of the heart. While it's not a great romance movie, you'll probably be floored by the little thoughts that go a long way, and the transient notion of course to appreciate every moment with your loved one, and not wait for things to happen for the worse, to start reminiscing the loss."
"cal1946","8","1","4","9 January 2008"," Delightful
","As I have never read the book, I was not disappointed. I loved the story as it played out on the screen, Gerard Butler was astonishing, a real breath of fresh air, Jeffrey Dean Morgan saw too little screen time but what he had was marvelous, and Harry Connick Jr. was amazing, his character so pitiful yet likable. I loved the idea that someone loved another so much and understood them so well that he was able to set up the whole letter trick and have it work. All in all, it was a very enjoyable film. I am looking forward to more Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The Irish scenery is beautiful and the end excellent. When it is released on DVD, I will be adding this to my collection."

","Well all I want to say is that I am a great reader and read this book in about 1.5 days. It is absolutely brilliant and have not had the chance to see the movie yet (due to children.......) but I cannot wait to see that such a fantastic book can be created into this mind blowing film. You have to relate with the characters to relate to book for film. I just hope the picturisation and production of the film is as excellent as the book. Definitely a film to watch with your man. I think Gerry would open up a few male eyes as to how women really want to be loved or should I say need to be loved. I sometimes wonder if some men around and involved with us ladies forget how we really need to be looked after and loved.......... All I can say to all girlfriends in the world is see the movie and if you cant then definitely read the book. PS. I love you..................... Kay"
"dewi_r_0202","6","1","5","5 February 2008"," I prefer Hilary and Harry
","I think Hilary Swank and Harry Connick Jr. make a better on-screen couple than Hilary & Gerard and Hilary & Jeffrey. Their chemistry is so sweet and funny. Harry makes me laugh with his geeky acting and somehow Hilary acts as comedic as Harry every time they have scene together. They should do a romantic comedy movie together as a couple. Lisa Kudrow is always hilarious, gotta love her! I also love Hilary's wardrobe in the movie. So chic in a retro style kind a way. What else do I like? Hilary & Gerard's apartment. So homey and looks fun to live in. She is not satisfied with their apartment? In my country (Indonesia), their place is considered one fancy place."
"Robert_duder","8","1","5","8 January 2008"," Critics strike out with me again...PS I Love You is a romance to write home about
","I wanted to see PS I Love You and I knew my girlfriend would love it too. The critics scathing reviews immediately scared me although I try not to listen but it seemed that they were pretty certain it was a dud and the few people I spoke to that had seen it seemed to agree. So it was with caution and perhaps low expectations that we went to see it and I am so glad I once again ignored their bad comments. PS I Love You is a very down to business, cute romance with a beautiful story, touching moments and YES it actually brought some tears to my eyes...just once...briefly...and it's really something for a film to do that for me. Certainly the film is not your traditional love story because the main characters' romance begins with one of them dying. But the film makers still weave this beautiful, touching story with some great performances and a new romance blooming in the background without ever infringing or depreciating the original romance. In some ways it could be described as a little shallow and without a lot of content but it's meant to make you feel good in a very dark comedy kind of way. They poke fun at death a little bit and come out with some seemingly crude off color humor but it fits into the story just perfectly.<br/><br/>Multiple Academy Award Winner Hilary Swank plays Holly Kennedy, the happily married, financially struggling wife who finds herself a widow before too long. Devastated and depressed she finds herself on an obscure adventure set up by her husband before he died. It's really a self discovering trip and Swank has a certain likability and it works really well for this film because she carries a lot of the story and the romance single handedly. She does very well. Gerard Butler is handsome and adorable as her husband Gerry. Butler and Swank do have terrific chemistry which is absolutely pertinent for this type of film obviously. Butler does a lot of voice work and his deep masculine voice works well for the film. The supporting cast around the couple is really the soul of this film because even though their parts are small they all work really well together and they are a terrific ensemble cast. Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon, James Marsters (so cool to see him on the big screen---been a big fan since Buffy days) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan is terrific and equally as great a presence as Butler is. Honestly I could have done without Harry Connick Jr. as Swank's first love interest. I thought he was kind of goofy and out of place in the film although he redeems himself a little later on in the film. And finally an honorable mention to the incomparable Kathy Bates as Swank's mother. She has her own little back story and she is really terrific and just ups the ante of the cast immediately. I wish she'd do more on screen!! <br/><br/>The film jumps around from flash backs (including some beautiful Irish scenery), to voice over letter reading to karaoke scenes, fishing, and some very good physical comedy. The one liners and some of the comedy is a little dark and you almost wonder if you should be laughing at it but they deal with love and death in a very open and unhindered way and its very refreshing and a different approach to the romance genre. The cast is great and the romance is well dealt with and considering how they set up this intense and passionate romance between Butler and Swank they still make you enjoy her new romance in the horizon and not feel any animosity for her moving on. I also have to give them HUGE kudos to the ending because I was thoroughly disappointed with what I thought the ending would be and they completely surprised me and I loved it. So ignore all the harsh critics and enjoy this really cute and fun and a little dark date movie that anyone can have fun with. And if you're wondering when my eyes welled up it was the scene when she doing Karaoke and everyone else faded away and her husband was sitting there listening to her...got me...right here. Go see it. 8.5/10"
"janstep","9","1","5","8 January 2008"," P.S. I love You
","I absolutely loved this movie. I had not read the book (didn't know there was a book frankly, until I went to work on Monday and found out from a friend there was) I went to this movie by myself as I am not privy to single girlfriends, all married or going with someone. Thats my luck. Anyway, I wanted to do something for me and said I was going to go see it. Boy am i glad I did, it was just what the doctor ordered. I went in with no preconceived ideas of what this was about, even though I really wasn't jazzed about seeing Hilary Swank, because I did not see Million Dollar Baby (not my type of movie or anything else she had done has ever moved me) but I thought her and Gerard had the greatest chemistry together and he is so hot in this role that girls can't help but fall in love themselves with him. I have not stopped swooning over him or this movie and I have now seen it three times and can't wait until it comes out on DVD because I will definitely be buying a copy. I loved this movie for so many reasons, namely that it was true to life. In real life, Couples love each other but they fight over sometimes many insignificant issues and some times they are significant. Hiliary Swank was just an ordinary woman, no 42-24-38 super babe in the sense that a lot of movies are after, just ordinary and that was GREAT!! Her smile makes her very beautiful in her own right,very believable and in real life most Handsome men have ordinary wives and vice versa. He (Gerry)was so sweet and tender with her and yes she was a little spoiled and unkind at times, but the love was there. I loved all the characetrs in this movie, Kathy Bates, always a winner, Lisa Kudrow for comic relief and Gina Gershon, the friend that will tell it like it needs to be. Jeffrey Morgan was handsome as ever, as was Gina's (Sharon's) husband and Harry Connic Jr was wonderful as the guy that says what's on his mind without thinking. I give this a nine because after suffering from the dissolution of a 27 year marriage myself and the abandonment of a husband, I could relate to all the pain and bitterness that Kathy Bates felt. I also related in the first few months to how Hilary felt trying to find her way to get out of bed, much less trying to figure out what to do with your life. At least she had Gerry helping her with his letters, it was good therapy for me, made me laugh, which was rare in my life and made me tear up over Hilary thinking how she was always angry at Gerry that she realized too late for What? He taught her things about herself and he knew she loved him through it all, he wasn't afraid to lay it on the table when he needed to, which is a very manly man, yet tender. As he said, ""I don't fear you will forget me Holly, I just don't want you to forget the person you are"" The writers are to be commended, and if you didn't like the movie then there is definitely something wrong with you and you just need to go watch war movies or something. The Only complaint and the 9 rating instead of a 10 is Why would the mother not come to the funeral of her only son, even though the husband was sick, that was her only son for gosh sakes, unless it was to stress her undesirables attitude towards him marrying so young along with her mothers feelings,but come on, they were married for 11 years, seemed like it was more of a cut the nose off to spite your face reality, but other than that, I thought it was Fantastic"

","Interesting idea doesn't quite achieve its goal for me, Swank is a better actress than this material that attempts to milk the audience for every tear-drop. A bittersweet story of a widow who continues to receive letters from her dead husband (Butler) that enable her to reflect on their marriage and to close its door and embark on the possibility of a new relationship. Harry Connick, Jnr is one of those possibilities, while in the midst of his ""Grey's Anatomy"" mini-fame, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his five-o'clock shadowed dimples is another.<br/><br/>Gina Gershon (""Cocktail"") and Lisa Kudrow play Swank's girlfriends, Kudrow on a mission to find Mr Right who predictably ends up cracking onto only homosexuals and unavailables in a clichéd sub-plot. Gershon was (and still is) an attractive supporting actress, once an action-man's muse (""Red Heat"", ""Out for Justice""), but has much less to do here, and seems out of place. Kathy Bates plays Swank's apparently unsympathetic mother who wasn't a fan of her daughter's rocky union with Butler.<br/><br/>Probably too much a 'chick flick' to satisfy most blokes, it's somewhat over-indulgent in the treatment of the themes, aiming for maximum sympathy without doing enough to earn the damp eyes. More than an awkward moment or two at which to cringe and Swank shines through in a dedicated performance, but one wonders whether it was living beyond its means."

","This movie is soo depressing, but not because of the story, but mainly because the storyline is so unbelievably slow, and it keeps running in endless loops. The acting is average at best, and the script is a hodge podge of romantic-comedy clichés. It really is poorly executed, and the editing leaves a lot to be desired. About 3/4s of the way through I realised the only reason it hadn't ended at the recognised Rom-Com hour and half, was because they were trying their hardest to create a movie with substance, but it failed miserably in the end, and in all decency, an hour and a half should have been the limit with this one. Do yourself a favour, and don't watch it. The only people praising this movie would have to be associated with it (ie. producers etc.). Put simply, it's awful and long winded."

Gerard Butler and Hillary Swank are perfect together, which is no surprise to anyone who knows their work. The supporting cast members could all be swapped out for the leads in this case, since you have a cast of seasoned professionals with their own followings. Of particular note are Gina Gershon and James Marsters, two underused and powerfully good character actors with enough talent to carry off a film by themselves. Toss into that mix the incredible Kathy Bates and Lisa Kudrow, and for icing on the cake add Nellie McKay and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and you have the perfect cast for any romantic comedy you would want to watch. Next you take some incredible scenery and photography, mix in a wonderfully romantic plot, and a director who understands the limits of his necessity, and you have the perfect Valentine's film to watch with your lover tonight.

Sadly, nothing did really happen. Others who have given reviews for this movie said it was fantastic, or a major tearjerker, this movie was neither. This film is horrendously dull, though I will say that it did have potential, much potential. Too bad no one rewrote the script, it would have been a lot more enjoyable.

"fwomp","7","0","1","23 December 2008"," Unusually Formulated Chick-Flick
","P.S. I LOVE YOU is one of those films that falls firmly into the ""chick-flick"" category. The story surrounds the grieving widow, her mother, and her friends, and how they all come together to help heal after the death of the studly husband. Sound schmaltzy for you guys out there? It might be.<br/><br/>But it is unique for a couple of reasons...<br/><br/>First is that one of the main characters, Gerry (Gerard Butler, 300) is dead. Although we meet him for a brief moment early on and during a series of flashbacks, he is, in essence, not there. We also don't get to watch him die. The death is startlingly quick, and it jerks the viewer to full attention because it is this sudden loss we see and feel via Gerry's wife, Holly (Hillary Swank, FREEDOM WRITERS), who also senses the loss of Gerry as extremely sudden  due to a brain tumor, or so we're told.<br/><br/>The other interesting thing is that Holly learns more about her husband after his death than during their short marriage. She travels to Ireland (where they initially met) at the behest of Gerry who, during his illness, arranged for Holly to have a life after his demise. He does this post-mortem trickery by arranging for messages to be dropped off to her at various times and from various people around New York. Initially seeming to be macabre, the story rapidly evolves into ...something more. Holly's trip to Ireland with her two best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) reveal to Holly that there's a lot more life out there after losing your soul-mate. And she finds it in unique and disturbing places.<br/><br/>Another unique quality was that Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates, THE GOLDEN COMPASS) turned out to be an accomplice within the entire story's machinations, something that took even me by surprise. Pleasantly. I also enjoyed the eventual dead-end relationship Holly ended up having with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr., THE IRON GIANT) that I thought would turn out very differently. And Holly's Ireland love interest, William (the hunky Jeffrey Dean Morgan, WEEDS) figures heavily in Holly's past and, possibly, her future.<br/><br/>But even with all of this uniqueness, the story as a whole turns out fairly predictable. The grieving widow heals (albeit unusually), friends help her, mother helps her, and new friends and lovers make her grope for reason and what her life now means. It is schmaltzy, so just be prepared for that. Your wives and girlfriends will probably love it if you rent it for them, though."

","Well, this movie has a lot going against it  the dialogue isn't all that realistic, the friends' interaction has the same artificiality, the plot is a little too cute. And when you throw in a slighty paunchy Harry Connick Jr, who has a 'syndrome' that makes him just a little bit obnoxious as he woos the widow Hilary, you really have a formula for a dreadful little film. And I don't know what it is with Scottish (or many other) actors who affect an Irish accent  most of the time they come off sounding like the 'lucky charms' leprechaun, but I guess most Americans do too, so I can't really hold that against anyone.<br/><br/>Some scenes are painful, and forced  most notably the Lisa Kudrow scenes as she 'auditions' men she meets at social events, the drunk scenes with Hilary, and the bedroom chatter of the two main actors. And why they have Hilary walking on the Yankee dugout towards the end of the film, while Harry reads to her at the end is simply so contrived I could hardly pay much attention to what Harry was saying.<br/><br/>But I like Hilary Swank, who at least has a film where she is a bit more feminine than we've seen her recently. And I like Gerard Butler and Gina Gershon, and most of the others  esp Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the man Hilary meets while visiting Ireland, who actually does sound Irish, although I'm told he was raised in Seattle. And there is one really effective plot surprise as well.<br/><br/>And I like some of the lines, and some of the scenes, and all of the Irish countryside, and Kathy Bates, who plays Hilary's mother who urges her daughter to move on with life, and and andso despite knowing better, I did enjoy this film. But it's really not all that good. But it sure is likable; even Harry is most of the time."

","Considering the cast, ""P:S I love you"" was fun and flagrant! The marriage of Hillary's character comes to an end and a series of goodbye/slash/ Have a little fun in starting your new life letters start to pour into her life as her wild and crazy Irish husband has dropped dead from a brain tumor. <br/><br/>Sadly enough, the acting is not deep enough even with a great storyline, to carry this feature through to the end. In many movies that are stories of love or dying loved ones,lost loves etc, this one seems to not get to the point quick enough, the interaction between the characters is in it's best view simply a feeling of not being real, but just 'artificial'. Hillary Swank is swank,no doubt she is hot stuff and would be great to be married to. Hillary is, well she, what can you say she is beautiful. The only thing that held this together was her in the lead as the sexy young wife, with no kids. Even though the director didn't try to 'force' a new romance down the the viewer's throat by the end of the film, it still just goes at a non real rate. There are moments here and there but the 'real' feeling of love and loss are lost. I had no water welling up in my eyes, no teary moments at all.<br/><br/>Not like other movies that at least you feel it coming...this was sort of a 'dud'. <br/><br/>Sorry to those excited about this one, not everyone thinks this is a great story.<br/><br/>All in all....not really recommended with all the other features available. If you long for this Hillary to be elected, then you are like me and she gets my vote. *"

","Gerald Butler is charming enough, and the Million Dollar Baby, Hillary Swank has charisma to spare. Still this movie with all the acting talent on hand is a clunker of a romantic comedy. It's buck up and move on theme is over done with bad dialog to spare. Especially unfunny is how much the in-laws hated her, and how much her mother didn't like him I'm a guy who loves a well done chick flick. And this isn't one of them. My advice to all you nice women who are wanting to see something sentimental and sweet: watch ""Return to Me"" or ""The Princess Bride"" again instead. And for all you girls who love your boyfriend's and husbands consider letting them walk the dog instead. Let us off the hook, we watched Sex in the City with you and were happy, but this show really is for women only. P.S. i love you has it's heart in the right place, but goes on and on, and we wonder what was Harry Connick Jr thinking taking the part of such a loser?"

","Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank, 'The Gift', 'Million Dollar Baby') is a widow who's trying to move on with her life after the sudden, but unpreventable death of her husband, Gerry (Gerard Butler, 'Phantom of the Opera' and '300'), with the help from her family and friends; and of course, letter's from her late husband, which are always signed off with ""P.S. I love you"", hence the movie (and book) title. About three weeks after her beloved husband's funeral Holly mysteriously receives a cake and audio tape from him, which has come from ""beyond the grave"", which kick off a whirlwind of a year of letters (one for each month and special event), adventures, misery and a period for Holly to find herself. Gerry sends Holly, Denise (Lisa Kudrow, 'Friends') and Sharon (Gina Gershon, 'What Love Is') to Ireland where they planned to have a wonderful but quiet time but instead meet William Gallapher, Gerry's best mate, and without realizing who he is, Holly ends up sleeping with him. Holly also goes to see her in-laws and learn a bit more about them and how they felt about her and her relationship with their son. She also finds out something a bit unexpected: the messenger of all those letters from Gerry.<br/><br/>Most of all, this movie is the most moving movies of all time! And it's a *MUST* SEE!<br/><br/>It also stars Kathy Bates ('Rumour Has it'), Harry Connick Jr. ('Will & Grace', 'Bug') and James Marsters ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Angel', 'Smallville')<br/><br/>Great story, movie and stellar cast!"

","Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) are the perfect married couple, planning great things for their future together until Gerry is struck with Cancer and later dies. Gerry has made sure his wife will get through her grief with his help after he has gone. Holly starts to receive letters with many exciting adventures planned. With a little help from her friends Denise Hennessey (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon McCarthy (Gina Gershon), visits to Ireland and a bit of karaoke help Holly get her life back on track. Like all good romantic comedies, there is always a good looking man to help ease the pain and this film is no exception. Daniel Connelly (Harry Connick Jr.) becomes a new friend for Holly, helping her at her time of need along with causing many problems along the way. This is a definite film for the girls, no doubt about that! The book was amazing but the film just puts the icing on the cake. The use of an Irish character (Gerard Butler), makes the film a real romance, especially the scenes between Manhattan and Ireland. These give it some depth and breaks the film up. It is a real tear jerker and crying will be a must. Cecelia Ahern (author) has done a superb job turning a book into film. I hope to see much more of her work. Bring on the DVD!"
"lothlorien909","9","0","1","5 April 2008"," Beautiful and touching
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* I was initially very skeptical about seeing this movie. So many people who read Ahern's novel claimed they were disappointed by this adaptation. Well, I have read the novel and I love this movie! Many things that appeared in the novel are changed or left out, but just as many are kept and this forms a very well-rounded, touching, beautiful movie about love, loss, family and friendship. The spirit of the novel is very much present! I cried a lot during this movie, which is a good thing, actually. It has moved me in a way no other movie has moved me in a long time. It's definitely worth seeing. The cast is great, especially Gerard Butlar, who is a wonderful, wonderful Gerry, and Hillary Swank, who proved how very versatile she can be. You will laugh, you will cry, you will think. This is not your usual love story, it's so much more, so very real and unique. It's a great movie! I give it a 9, it's not perfect, there's a scene I would leave out, because it doesn't seem right (Holly+William), but otherwise, this is an admirable 9. Enjoy watching P.S. I Love You!"

","I really enjoyed this movie; I thought everyone in it was good. It was funny, charming, and touching. Good Irish scenery (including the hunky Irish men -- if I were younger and single, I would take a trip to Ireland based on this movie!). I went to the theater hoping to see something that would cheer me up, and I was not disappointed. I did indeed feel better after watching this movie. I had never seen Hillary Swank in a movie before, and thought she was good (everyone else was, too). Holly's friend Denise was hilarious in the bar scenes, I was doubled-over laughing. Smart Denise -- she didn't want the kind of trouble that so many of us have had in our love lives. I could empathize with poor Daniel's bad luck with his love life, even though I'm a woman and he's a man."
"gddysunshine","Null","0","1","29 January 2008"," a little warning: NOT a romantic comedy, NOT a chick flick (not typical at least)
","I did really like this movie, but I'm not going to write all about which elements I liked and which I didn't, because they've been covered before, and by more than one poster usually :-). <br/><br/>However, in light of the many posters calling this a Romantic Comedy, a chick flick, or describing it using words such as 'lighthearted', 'entertaining' or 'hilarious', I wanted to reiterate that it is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. <br/><br/>To expand: yes, there are romantic elements and scenes, there is amusing banter--flirtatious and between friends--and there are a couple of funny scenes. But for your sake, as well as to be in a position to do this movie justice by watching it when you ACTUALLY feel like watching this kind of thing, don't expect:<br/><br/>-to laugh-out-loud like you might have in Bridget Jones' Diary in the 'getting ready for the date/party' scenes, or any makeover scene in any comedy of the past 15 years or so :-) . Here you get more of a chuckle, along the lines of what is sometimes called, in plot analysis, 'comic relief'--a little giggle to stop you loosen the lump in your throat.<br/><br/>-Sleepless In Seattle/You've Got Mail style romance--this is more substantial stuff, more of the Titanic brand of romance (only without the epic element--it's just late and I can't get a better example :-))<br/><br/>-any situation comedy like the karaoke in My Best Friend's Wedding<br/><br/>-any characters that are only there to make us laugh<br/><br/>-a 'lighthearted' movie means you don't seriously care much what happens to the characters. you mainly care what happens with the plot. Here, the plot is character-driven: you care about what happens to the characters.<br/><br/>One last thing: no, this is not a movie to bring your pre-teen, even if they are mature-- certainly not without making sure they know they're gonna see a sad movie. Not because you see a bloke's rear end for all of two seconds some time in the movie, but because the themes this movie deals with are adult themes dealt with in an adult manner (for adult, read emotionally complex). A younger kid would just feel the sadness in it without having the benefit of knowing how to handle those feelings. Fair warning!<br/><br/>All in all though, this is a good movie; I only object to it being classed as a RomCom, because it makes people go in with the wrong sorts of expectations (and probably keeps away people who would have liked it, because they generally don't enjoy RomComs). I think a more useful label would be what Hillary Swank (I believe) described it as: a dramedy. I mean, she should know, since she stars in it, right?!"

","I have only seen this movie once at the theater about 4 hours away from me, (our town is too small for it to play here) and I would actually consider going that far again just so I could see this beautiful film one more time. The acting is right on target and the writing is superb. It has a different idea for a story line, and it just keeps you interested. The characters involved have excellent chemistry, and it flows so well, you almost forgot you are watching a movie, and not real life. It's a heartwarming tale that I could watch over and over without growing sick of. Truly a film that you should see at least once in your lifetime, with a good friend and a box of tissue. I can't wait till this one is available on DVD, I like it so much, I would pay the usual $25 or up price, just so I could have my very own copy."

","I have read & enjoyed the book and for the first 5 minutes of watching the film I thought it was going to be very disappointing but I was pleasantly surprised. Gerard Butlers Irish accent is all wrong but how can you fault him, he played the lovable character very well. When I heard Hilary Swank was playing Holly, I was not sure she could pull off the grieving widow but she did this very well, she certainly pulled at my heart strings! I think if you go to see this film with the anticipation of it being 'exactly' like the book, you will be disappointed. The concept is the same but some big characters in the book are not in the film and I personally do not think this matters as the film works! Forget the book and enjoy this film for what it is - a funny, tear-jerker!"
"nachalainne","7","0","1","13 January 2008"," Good Movie Based on Awful Book
","THE BAD NEWS: After I finished reading Cecilia Ahern's novel ""P.S. I Love You"", I was disappointed. The story was a great idea, the perfect chick-lit topic. Unfortunately, Ahern didn't manage to pull off the charming, touching and very human story she intended. The main character, Holly Kennedy, ended up a pathetic whiner and by the end of the book I was thinking ""just get over it already!!!"".<br/><br/>THE GOOD NEWS: I can count on one hand the similarities between the novel and the film. The screenwriters (Ahern was, thankfully, not one of them) took the fresh, interesting idea and ran with it. Other than names and basic plot points, the film is totally different than the book. The characters are sympathetic, Holly is charming and funny - someone us girls would hang out with. Even the setting is different (book: Ireland, film: New York City.) When a friend dragged me to the movie (yes, she had to drag me - after that awful book, I had no desire to waste 2 hours on the movie), I was not hopeful. Five minutes into the movie I was hooked. I loved it.<br/><br/>Cheers to author Cecilia Ahern for her great idea... and for not participating as a screenwriter - she did us all a favor there.<br/><br/>See this movie, you'll love it!!"
"SamanthaPrice","6","0","1","13 January 2008"," Life isn't a fairy tale... so live every minute!
","I'm giving it an 6 only because it's a romantic comedy and not an Oscar winner but as a romantic Comedy it deserves a 9/10.<br/><br/>I read the book and loved it and i think the film kept the message of the book. I do agree though with the people that felt the film had changed the book, it isn't the book more based on the book... let that be a warning, if you are expecting an adaptation of the book you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>It's mainly set in New York and that didn't actually bother me, i thought it would but at least the is an Irishy feel to it. I'm glad the ending was the same, i would have been upset if they had tried to make it fairy tale and Hollywood.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank did a good job as Holly, she wasn't afraid to produce snot when crying or make a fool of herself and she came across as real, the fact that she really couldn't sing (at the Karaoke) actually won me over. Lisa Kudrow delivers a few cracking lines, although her character is a little stereotypical. Gina Gershon is great but she wasn't used enough. Kathy Bates, is Kathy Bates, she puts in a flawless performance as Holly's mother.<br/><br/>Now onto the men, Gerard Butler is fantastic as Gerry, his accent is a little dodgy in places and you can occasionally here his Glaswegian accent push through but the colourful, energetic, charming performance he puts in as Gerry makes any of that insignificant. He made you understand why a woman would fall in love with him. The strip tease was great and all his musical performances will make you smile - loved his rendition of Mustang Sally! And like many i am very upset Galway Girl isn't on the sound track.<br/><br/>Harry Connick Jr as Daniel is OK. The Character isn't meant to be instantly likable and i think he was good at what he delivered.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Dean Morgan was FABULOUS! and not just for agreeing to go naked... he managed to make sure his character didn't fall on the side of smarmy and shallow, he was charming, gentle and funny. His Irish accent was steady.<br/><br/>I went to see it with a girlfriend of mine and she was seeing it for the second time. Watch it, it will make you laugh, cry and appreciate what you have.

Though I must say I didn't care too much for the mother. I know her intentions were good but she just didn't seem to come out as being that nice or great of a person. You can tell that Hilary and Gerard had really good chemistry between them in the scenes and could really pass as two people who were in love and married. You don't always see that in movies. It was a very heartwarming and touching movie. But it has also moments where you almost forget about the sadness cause you're laughing so much. Great movie. I highly recommend it."

","While to be honest, I find the movie more than a bit lightweight and predictable, one shining star emerges from the film - Gerard Butler. He is oozing with sex appeal and brimming with personality - an appealing dollop of ""man candy"" for the ladies!<br/><br/>I think the problems with the movie stemmed from the dialogue/script more than the performances. A little more substantive dialogue could have been interspersed between the over-the-top ""romantic comedy"" scenes which frankly wore thin. <br/><br/>But truthfully, its hard to know what is more appealing about the relative newcomer Gerard Butler - his appearance or his personality.

"Kristinartist79","10","0","1","23 December 2007"," I recommend this if you like drama comedy
","Spoilers This was a great movie if you like drama comedy; it was sad, funny and interesting. It was totally different from the book. The book took place in Ireland; as somebody said, they ""Americanized it."" I think it would have been better to keep it in Ireland because this changed the story a lot. Not only was the scenery different, but she was in a different country with her husband from Ireland, who live in the USA; that changes the movie so much! She takes a trip to Ireland in the movie, but that also changes the movie as well, because in the book she lives there. Also, this movie was not very realistic. The way they met, when Holly was on a college trip, was very unrealistic and just plain ludicrous! In the book they were high school sweethearts. But on the positive side, Swang is such a great actress with great talent and beauty. I do not think the Jeffry Kenedy was all that hot looking as others have said, but yes he is talented at acting and singing. Still, he is definitely NOT that gorgeous.I thought the character from her late husband Gerry's band, whom she met in Ireland was better looking. At least Gerry and Holly complemented each other.Jeffery was more laid back whereas Holly was the more responsible and serious. There marriage life is not perfect; they have fights, but their love is strong enough to keep it together. In the book there fights do not seem to go beyond the petty fights such as who left the light on, contrary to the movie, where the movie begins when they arrived home from a family event, fighting because Jeremy wants to have a baby and Holly feels that it is not the right time. She is mad that he told the mother that Holly said they are not ready yet. They are also fighting about various other issues related to money, (due to the fact that Holly feels he is not saving enough for a bigger place to raise a child, something Holly felt they must do.) They fought over the fact that Gerry wasted money trying to start a business without discussing it with her. That kind of made me not like Gerry as much! What grown adult would do something so irresponsible without discussing it with his wife. But, overall I did think he had a nice personality. I guess making them fight over deeper issues added drama and made it more interesting. Seeing people fight over a light switch in a movie might not interest everybody.<br/><br/>After fighting, they make up. I know others thought the strip tease was funny but I thought it was a little gross! Then, the next scene is at Jeremy's funeral. That part was very sad; his parents did not come because the father had medical conditions, but it was never explained why the mother did not come.When holly decides to visit him, on a trip to Ireland planned by her late husband, they kind of seemed to imply that the mother was worried-that the husband (who cannot walk would come along) but she is her son for gosh sakes! That is no excuse! And the part where she admitted that when they first got married she wanted to kill Holly made me hate her, even if she got over it and was nice at that point. I mean she didn't want her grown son to get married? Give me a break! Even if he is young, so what; in her day people got married young. I did not like Kathy Bates' crabby personality, but Bates played it very well. The mother in the book, whose name was actually Elizabeth, was a lot sweeter, more tender, sympathetic and supportive, which to me was a lot nicer, even if it is not as realistic. I love Lisa Kudrow and she did an excellent job! She was funny and charismatic. I got such a kick out of her when she interviewed every guy she met; asking, ""Are you gay"" ""Are you married,"" ""are you-working?"" That was hysterical! I did not like Sharon in that movie; she was obnoxous! She just lost her husband and already she is sending her to work! All in all, great acting and a great movie! Just so you readers know, I am not putting the movie down; overall it was entertaining, but the book is far better."
"bopdog","7","0","1","22 December 2007"," Strained to NOT be sentimental, but the clumsy attempt at ""realism"" was unconvincing. Should have just followed the genre. Overall, was good though
","""P.S. I Love You"" deals with the trickiest of movie subjects. Think about it. It COULD be complete treacle, and nothing but cheesy sentimentality. Overall, though, while the movie has its flaws, and is a BIT soppy in parts, it actually does a decent job.<br/><br/>Where it did well, in my view, was in its portrayal of the relationship between the main characters, Holly and Gerry. It is no secret that Gerry dies (it's in every trailer and poster), and Holly is faced with having to cope, whilst moving on. The clever bit is that while his health was fading, and he knew he would die soon, Gerry arranged for a series of communiques and other messages to surprise, delight, and inspire the woman he knew would soon be his widow.<br/><br/>All of that is plausible enough. Hey, it's a MOVIE, for goodness' sake, and this plot is not any more implausible than any other fiction.<br/><br/>I found myself actually believing and enjoying the first third of the movie, then. I LIKED Gerry, and I ""bought"" Holly and Gerry's marriage. Where it fell apart a bit for me was the middle third, where Holly dealt with her friends. These three or four women were some of the dumbest, most annoying characters I have seen this year. What slags! Selfish, short-sighted, and shallow, every one of them.<br/><br/>The final third was almost as frustrating, although things ended on a better note. However, it was painfully obvious that the director was straining overly to avoid any ""pat"" or too happy an ending. As if he was afraid of his genre, and was desperate to appear ""realistic"" or something. The movie's forced sense of nonchalance was strained, and was worse than if it had just given in and given the main female character the happy ending the genre demanded, and we were all expecting.<br/><br/>Life DOES work out for people very often! People DO find happiness. There is nothing wrong with a bit of cinematic ""happy ending for all"" from time to time. It would have been more honest, easier to film, and more satisfying to watch.<br/><br/>But, overall, not bad. Maybe because I'm a bloke I missed some subtlety or nuance? Maybe women will be more appreciative? Dunno... I thought the girl-gang was lame, and the false ""non-sentiment"" was unconvincing. But truthfully, I DID enjoy, mostly, the movie, and gave it a 7 out of 10."
