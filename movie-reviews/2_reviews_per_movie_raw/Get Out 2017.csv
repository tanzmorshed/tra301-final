","From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.
Rather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.
As I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10"
"Impartial-Critic","7","46","61","28 February 2020"," Slow Burner Insanity.
","Interesting movie about an interracial couple who decide to go for the weekend to visit the girl's parents, the boyfriend Chris starts noticing odd behaviors from the African Americans house workers and what started as a fun relaxing weekend slowly turns into a living nightmare for him.<br/><br/>The idea is original and interesting, the acting was good by all but I felt that Daniel Kaluuya was not emotional enough and his reactions was too cold in many scenes! but generally speaking the movie is well paced from all aspects yet I won't call this a horror in anyway, to me it's no more than a psychological suspense thriller...it gets tense but never scary.<br/><br/>The movie has its share of racism that can't go unnoticed but it's not too much, mainly stereotypical yet I believe that the concept of the plot can executed on any race, which clearly hinted in Stephen Root's final scene. An open minded audience can go throw it, enjoy it without any care for its racism."

","""Get Out"" takes the initial premise of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and then twists it with ""The Stepford Wives"" to create a compelling, thoughtful critique of white power. Peele, of course, isn't arguing that white people are out to hypnotise black people. Instead, Get Out is a stinging criticism of the white liberalism that carries itself as empathetic towards blacks, but that empathy only extends as far as white control. Peele isn't taking aim at Neo- Nazis and other whites who would angrily shout the n-word. They're a lost cause. Instead, he's looking at those who profess their lack of racism, but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people in the most insidious manner possible. As Chris pointedly notes to Rose at party full of white people, ""Has anyone here ever met a black person that didn't work for them?""<br/><br/>The film is genuinely creepy. Instead of cheesy music and grotesque torture porn, Peele relies on the unknown to draw you in. What is happening here? The plot builds like a slow boil to a terror explosion. Clues to the outcome are evident from the first second, but it takes the entire run-time to pull everything together. It's such a joy to be surprised by a horror outcome. I don't think I've seen a genre film this inventive since Cabin in the Woods. The resolve is truly satisfying.<br/><br/>My favourite aspect of Get Out is the intelligence of the characters. There's a lot to like, but beyond the deeper themes; the characters aren't morons. I cringe every time I watch a genre film and the characters don't behave logically. Chris and Rose are not fools. Something is amiss, enough to warrant wariness. Anyone in this situation would be unnerved as events play out. Credit again to Peele for writing characters that act rationally.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" doesn't replace the scares with humour – Peele is too smart to do that. Instead, he balances the fear with laughs and then laces everything with social comment and that unsettling tone. The fact that Chris is so eminently likable just underlines it. It all adds up to something of a treat – for everybody, not just horror fans."
"ramair350","9","531","926","6 March 2017"," Lives up to the hype
","I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).<br/><br/>Well, I can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man (and really the worst nightmare for us all). This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel ""sorry"" for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!"
"dre64-2","9","372","667","12 May 2017"," Best debut from a first time director in years
","Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves."
"Brew_Swayne","5","672","1227","10 March 2017"," I Don't Get The Hype
","Cookie cutter suspense/thriller/horror flick that isn't very suspenseful or thrilling or scary. The only real change from the norm with this movie is that it features a black man as the lead actor, and early on in the movie it touches on some of the problems of interracial dating from a black man's perspective. I found some humor in the way that the white family (and later their white friends) interacted with the lead character...going out of their way at times to either talk about how they voted for Obama or loved Tiger Woods...basically doing and saying the things that white people say to black people in an attempt to prove they aren't racist. <br/><br/>The movie was fairly well acted despite not having exceptionally strong material to work with. I thought Daniel Kaluuya turned in a really strong performance and he really saved the movie, imo. I don't recall seeing him in anything else prior to this, but he gave an excellent performance and I hope this serves as a spring board to bigger/better roles. Seems very talented. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is that I don't know what it was trying to be. It kind of hit a little bit with the satire and humor elements, but all in all, the movie just doesn't really have an identity. The ""mystery"" behind everything was not well concealed and the twists and turns you'd expect from a movie like this just never developed. I had this movie pretty well figured out before the halfway mark, which made for a less enjoyable second half of the movie. I'm pretty amazed by all the rave reviews it's getting. <br/><br/>It is a bit groundbreaking in it's own right strictly for the cultural/social/racial aspect - as that has been largely neglected in movies, especially this genre - but once you get passed that and just look at the movie for what it is, I can't really give this movie anything more than a middling grade. Not the worst movie I've ever seen by any means, but also not really worth the price of admission either. Wait for it to come out on Netflix and enjoy from the comfort of your own couch."
"kayleighlaylaparker","5","422","763","28 March 2017"," The audience reaction caused me to second guess my opinion on this...
","The premise for Get Out is interesting and makes for an unusual horror. The premise, although good, deteriorates into clichés by the end, never fully fleshing out any of the characters and injecting humour where it doesn't really fit. The opening credits (and song) are haunting and evocative but the film itself portrays the characters as one dimensional. All of the white characters are evil and all of the black characters are victim. As usual, in Americas depiction of race, there is no middle ground, only white and black; no biracial, no latino, no Native American, only one Asian character randomly thrown in.<br/><br/>Although the film itself was fine if not rewatchable, what disturbed me most was sitting in an audience of black movie goers who cheered the deaths of all white people and made horrible comments.<br/><br/>As a horror lover, I have never seen even the worst killer or on-screen murder cheered, and yet the audience lapped it up because white people were being killed (even if they were the villains). This unsettled me. I'm not American and so my countries issues with race are not on par with Americas. To see the audience react this way felt odd, as if I had been transported to America. I almost feel like the film set race relations back! Ultimately, an interesting horror but more of a 'cheap shot' at evil ol' Whitey. The depths are never really explored."
"jaredpahl","3","167","292","3 March 2018"," Regressive Racial Politics Infect an Otherwise Interesting Horror Flick
","Get Out has proven without a shadow of doubt that in today's Hollywood, critical praise has less to do with traditional cinematic qualities like strength of story, richness of character, and technical craftsmanship, and more to do with a film's relative scale of ""wokeness"". The blackest, gayest, most leftist movie wins. Jordon Peele's directing debut hits high marks on the traditional criteria. It's a refreshingly original horror movie with some good performances, and it's staged well by the less funny half of the comedy group, Key and Peele. In a sane world, that would be all the movie is. But... and it's a big but, Get Out is a race movie. A race movie whose regressive views on black/white relations made it a sensation with critics, and a frustratingly divisive ordeal for me.<br/><br/>The biggest strength Get Out has is that it is an original piece of work. Underneath all the flashy racial business dominating the conversation around the movie, is a very cool horror movie premise. A family kidnaps young, virile strangers in an attempt to ultimately live through their bodies. It's interesting as written, and when things heat up towards the end of this movie, it leads to some electrifying, sustained tension. I wish that that was all the story had on its mind, but it's not. No, the movie has to bring race into things. The evil family doesn't kidnap just any young, cool, or physically superior bodies. They only kidnap black people.<br/><br/>The message of Get Out can be debated. Is it a critique on standard white racism or the subtle racism of white liberals? Who knows. I read it as the latter, but any way you look at it, Get Out ultimately concludes that ""Black people ought to be scared of white people"". And there lies the reason this very well done horror movie has to get a thumbs down from me. The portrayal of the relationship between black and white characters here is the dictionary definition of 'regressive'. Every black person in the movie is distrustful, and scared of white people, and the white people in the movie... well. The white people in this film are all irredeemably evil, which is deplorable in its own right, but Peele undercuts even his own metaphor by having them behave unlike any human who has ever lived. These are an alien's version of what evil white people are like. They gleefully discuss their love of black bodies (which nobody has ever done), and their dialogue is so tin-eared, performed with such rote formality that it's impossible to take them seriously as characters. They aren't characters. The white people in Get Out are evil aliens, every single one of them. Most troubling about this is that these are meant to be stand-ins for society at large. <br/><br/>Jordan Peele wants to make a point that even though overt racism has settled down in modern society, subtle racism is worse than ever. It is a decidedly ugly view of people, one designed to stoke the flames of fear and distrust; to drive a massive wedge between whites and blacks until we share no common ground. When it is revealed that this evil white conspiracy stems from their jealousy of black people, I just about lost it. This has to be the most ass-backwards anti-racism movie ever made. It's not a call for understanding, it's a paranoid revenge fantasy, and it made me sick to my stomach. White people leave the theater hopeless (There is nothing they can do to redeem their evil ways. They just have to be killed), and black people leave the theater more fearful and distrustful of white people than when they walked in (Even the people who don't seem racist are out to get you). <br/><br/>The racial politics of this movie are borderline reprehensible. For all Get Out has going for it, and that is a lot (Daniel Kaluuya delivers a great, subdued central performance, LilRel Howery provides some fun comic relief, and Jordon Peele keeps the tension high), it's all ruined by the very thing that is responsible for the movie's absurd critical fawning. What really sucks is that had this movie been a straightforward horror mystery, it would have really worked. The race angle, as it is, provides nothing of substance, and worse, it's malicious. What could have been a terrific horror flick is strangled to death by a message movie that actively preaches fear. Of course critics love it.<br/><br/>35/100"
"totalwonder","8","226","403","23 September 2017"," Jordan Peele debuts in style
","Get Out provided me with something I long for. The debut of a new filmmaker that makes you look hopefully into the future. Jordan Peele has done just that. He wrote and directed this smart, elegant film and even made us find a new way to classify it. Horror, comedy, drama, social satire. What matters really is that it's a first of sorts and then some. It introduced me also to a major talent in front of the camera. Daniel Kaluuya is sheer perfection. As an actor he projects and provokes empathy. Whatever your race or races you will be in his shoes, feeling what he's feeling. I was him, throughout. The gasps of fear mixed with the bursts of laughter from the audience - me included - made Get Out one of the most rewarding film experiences of 2017. Kudos also to Bradley Whitford and the phenomenal Catherine Keener. They are terrifyingly recognizable and what about Caleb Landry Jones? Menacing enough and comic enough - he reminded me of Peter, Chris Elliott's character in Everybody Loves Raymond - to be all the things he needed to be. Perfect. As is the human relief provided by the wonderful Marcus Henderson. As you may gather I'm celebrating. So, Mr Peele, thank you very much."
"aamajor","4","426","789","27 March 2017"," Racism is Scary, Get Out is Not
","I finished watching Get Out over 2 hours ago, but something has been bothering me since the credits rolled. A sort of unpleasant, irritated feeling that I couldn't really put my finger on until now. My biggest complaint about this horror film is that it's not actually as scary as the real life social problems it constantly hammers the viewer over the head with. It's campy jump scares and unbelievable premise, drown out the anti-racist message it could have had. In that way, it fails both as a horror movie and constructive social commentary.<br/><br/>Most quality horror movies take real life events and intensify them to create something terrifying but relatable. The Shining was much scarier than my trip to Colorado. The Blair Witch Project was more intense than my last hike. Psycho was slightly more unnerving than my last stay at a motel.<br/><br/>Modern racism and the history of slavery are among the most disturbing and evil aspects of the human experience and something countless people suffer from daily. It is real and it is scary. So why add B-movie brain swaps and fortune-teller hypnosis? Why base the story on a cheesy fictional premise instead of something that actually happens? Why make all but two of the characters completely one dimensional? (Keep in mind, that Chris and his friend are the only characters in the film with both a conscience and their original brain, all others are lacking one or the other). Why does a flashing light reverse brain transplants? Why would a racist white family, lure black men to them by using their own daughter as a sex object? The answer to all these questions is lazy writing.<br/><br/>If you want to create a jarring horror movie rife with social commentary about racism at least root it in reality. Sadly, past and present, there is no lack of inspiration. I get that this movie is a very heavy handed allusion to slavery, but of all the awful things white people have done to black people, goofy brain swapping business isn't one of them.<br/><br/>I don't get why this movie has such overwhelmingly positive reviews. The cinematography and acting were good, but the plot was trite, compared to all the different directions they could have taken it. The idea of a racially charged horror movie with a black protagonist and white ghouls sounds really interesting (why I wanted to see it), but Get Out just takes that idea and slaps it onto a 50's B-flick."
"zacfil_607","1","60","100","13 December 2018"," Race baiting, hyped and oscar for what?
","This movie is absolute garbage. The only acting worth mentioning is the main character's and the overall plot seems to be written by an angry black teenager. The ""racism"" theme you find here isnt anything related to the real world like 12 Years a Slave or Django Unchained. I have no idea what granted Peele an Oscar for this film. Ive seen B movies much better than this and seeing someone go from comedy to Director you'd be 100 times better off watching A Quiet Place directed by John Krasinski. This movie left me feeling annoyed in the fact that ive wasted money and time on it; even The Emoji Movie is more entertaining than Get Out.
Save yourself and read a synopsis and skip the actual watching part. 0/10 if i could give it."
"pauldaguirre","1","108","189","27 February 2019"," Best ORIGINAL Screenplay????
","In this era of disposable entertainment where we have no cultural memory (and, I fear, no cultural future), and people are living only for the next best thing, is there no one who recognizes that this movie is almost a head-on remake of Ira Levin's The Stepford Wives (1975)? Substitute racism for sexism and mix liberally, no credit given to the original author. The fact that not even the Academy could recognize the wholly derivative plot shows how far we have fallen as a moviegoing public. In all likelihood, even Jordan Peale probably believes he wrote an original script. He didn't. And that's what's terrifying about Get Out."
"kfgfktflytghflg","1","118","208","29 April 2018"," Ripp off
","A rip off of The Skeleton Key. The fact that Peele stood there at the Academy Awards all emotional in his speech, acting like he wrote the script is ridiculous. Universal made both pictures, that's why there's no plagiarism law suit. It's a good story (TSK is a much better movie though) and with the gender and ethnicity of the main characters switched (white girl vs black family doing vodoo in the Skeleton Key) and after Oscars So White, it hit the Zeitgeist. That's fine. But Best ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY for Peele? What a joke...."
"Tweetienator","1","387","725","25 April 2017"," Over-Hyped
","Someone remembers the movie Skeleton Key (2005, with Kate Hudson!)!? Well, Get Out is basically the same plot, whereas in Skeleton Key the transferring of the soul or whatever is done with black magic in Skeleton Key a neurosurgical procedure gets the job done. So the plot is mostly (besides the well-done clash of black and white folks culture) a copy cat (as Skeleton Key plays in the deep South we got also a little of the element of black/white culture contrasting).<br/><br/>If I would have to choose one of both movies for a cinematic night I would watch Skeleton Key again - the dark atmosphere is far more superior and the suspense also. Also, the end is far more delicate.<br/><br/>Get Out has some strong points - good actors, good production and especially the strange circumstances and the growing paranoia of our hero are well done. <br/><br/>On the other side, the movie has some weak points too - imo the (re)solution is hasty done, also there are some (important) mistakes - how our hero got the stuff into his ears, as he was bound to the chair!? And the brother didn't see the stuff in his ears - he was clearly checking if the ""sheep"" is asleep and knocked out. Also didn't our bad girl see (in darkness!) the blitz of the phone - she should know that the possession/control or whatever of the host is broken, so she would never give the gun to her ""grandfather"". Also the comedy- element is a mixed up experience - some of the subtle comedy elements I liked, tiresome for me was the black buddy stuff cliché: comedy Kitsch zillion times done before - it was (partly) funny with Eddie Murphy in the 80s and maybe you got away with it in the 90s but now...<br/><br/>And whereas a good horror-movie mostly has a bad end for the hero (Kate Hudson loses in a certain, surprising kind of way the struggle for her life), the director didn't have the guts to make a ""good"" end - ofc our hero should be shot by a cop or ride the electrical chair. <br/><br/>Why!? Because the mad comrades of our good evil family would ofc ""delete"" all pieces of evidence of crime there will be just one solution left - our black guy would be sentenced for mass murder, or who would believe his story, as many ""decent"" white folks would testify against him!? Btw - isn't that the point of a racist society!? ;)<br/><br/>This p.c.-ending is imo too much of fishing for compliments or sucking up to the common mainstream agenda - and a good horror movie should everything but be p.c.<br/><br/>In short - I was entertained and I like many aspects of the movie (especially all the actors), but in my horror collection Get Out won't make it into the top 100, maybe top 250 but even that's not for sure. The script/the story just is not good enough. Get Out: a little ""horror"" snack (the horror-elements are just a few, it's more a comedy and thriller). Not more but no less. Because all this biased overrating I rated 1, my real rate is 5.<br/><br/>note:imo the political agenda or bias of many of the reviewers and the votings (with black actors as main characters) is ridiculous - masterpieces like Blade Runner got a rating of 8.2 or Apocalypse Now one of 8.5 and Get Out got 8.1... I've become accustomed to subtract 2 to up to 3 points (deciding if I watch or not) if a black actor is involved as the main character(s) - not because of racism but because the ratings are f***ed up and I can't trust them (like all those fake reviews and ratings in the beginning of any movie initiated by the studios) - Get Out is just another proof of this hysteria."
"greenmemo","10","460","868","25 February 2017"," A deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor
","I was totally blown away by ""Get Out"". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited ""fish out of the water"" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. ""Get out"" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick."

"brandonrobison-17242","2","94","165","30 May 2017"," If the roles were reversed..
","Short review. If the races were switched as to whom was the predator and whom was the prey, there would be national outrage and this would be a boycotted and hidden film. There are limits, in my personal opinion, when you become too psychological, too propagandizing, in narratives that are inappropriate for society. With an age that is strongly pushing an anti-cop, racist, and white-privilege tone I could not get past the obvious intentions to shape, or at least strongly influence, public thought towards problems that back-room backers seem to spare no opportunity to not be involved in to achieve societal perceptions. I get tired of the double standards that exist where for some, it is OK to unfairly demonize a race depending on which race it is. I largely reject the anticipated arguments of lavish praise for efforts based on history that simply is not the present, or simple artistic expression. When America is a place where all methods of ""artistic expression"", or religious expression for that matter, are equally protected and not shut up based on threat of violence, advertiser boycotts, or ""hate speech"", perhaps I might change my views. This movie, to me, was as clear of an attempt to hide anti-white propaganda under a guise and found the film to be disgusting and racist. Racism towards white people is not ""reverse racism"" (the term alone being another evidence of how skewed society has become) or somehow different than any racism towards any race. This is racist. Plenty of films have been banned, boycotted, and protested for doing much less than the rampant anti-white themes throughout this film.. and yet, due to prevailing voices, racism is indeed alive and well as the film broadly wishes to convince viewers of.. only not in the way intended by the production team."

","I regret paying for this on blue ray. The hype gave more to this movie then it deserved. As it was from the makers of Insidious and conjuring, I thought this might be something enjoyable, since those movies are campy, fun, roller coasters horror movies, that are set in a less then believable world, so you can suspend your suspension of disbelief for them. <br/><br/>This movie has none of that element to it. While the acting and cinematography is fine in this, much like the conjuring and insidious, that however is all the good I can say for this, similar cinematography.<br/><br/>The plot however ruins it. And I'm just gonna spoil the ending of the movie for you so you don't waste money on this. <br/><br/>The big surprise of the movie is the family, including the daughter who's in on it, use hypnotism to break any black people they make friends with slowly, so they can prepare them for operation to remove most of their brains and have it replaced with white peoples brains, so they are white people walking around in black peoples bodies.<br/><br/>The main character gets away in the end BTW.<br/><br/>I cannot help but feel that the reason why this movie was given so much more hype then it actually deserved, was because despite how the movie went along, the writers made effort to make every white person in this movie into a villain, and every black person to be innocent victims. If they made a movie like this but did the reversal of skin color on all the cast, there would be screams from racism from social justice warriors today, but its okay to make every white person in this movie evil. Thats why this movie got all the hype it did, because even if its a bad story, as long as all white guys are vilified and all black guys are saints, its perfectly fine. And no, I'm not racist saying that, this is one the fault of the movie makers awful storytelling. <br/><br/>Do not buy this movie based on the hype it was given.

","Get Out is the directorial debut of comedy writer Jordan Peele who has taken a page out of the Quentin Tarantino wish fulfillment fantasy playbook. Unlike Tarantino, Peele operates in the much more lucrative horror genre, his film grossing $184 million worldwide against a mere $4.5 million budget.<br/><br/>Peele's protagonist is black photographer, Chris Washington, who agrees to visit his white girlfriend Rose's family (the Armitages) in an upstate suburb. While driving up to the house, there is a bit of foreshadowing of even stranger things to come, when Chris and Rose unexpectedly hit a deer and then have an unpleasant encounter with a state trooper where Rose can't conceal her contempt for law enforcement in general.<br/><br/>Before even meeting the parents, Chris is unnerved by the almost zombie-like behavior of the black groundskeeper and housekeeper, Walter and Georgina. Rose's parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon and Missy, a psychiatrist/hypnotist are depicted as white liberals, with Dean proudly telling Chris that he voted for Obama twice. Rose's brother Jeremy is unable to control an ingrained hostility and has little to do except attack Chris later on when it becomes clear the entire family suffers from a malevolence usually associated with typical horror film tropes.<br/><br/>As for the plot, somehow Chris (due to losing his mother in a car accident when he was a kid) is susceptible to Missy's hypnotic commands, sending him to ""the sunken place"" where he appears to not only lose consciousness but finds himself at the mercy of the creepy Missy. Soon a coterie of Armitage family friends show up at an annual get-together and it becomes clear that all these white folks are part of a conspiracy to subjugate black people through a series of actions that defy all logic.<br/><br/>For example, when Chris takes a picture of Logan, a recently kidnapped black man from NYC, the camera flash causes him to become hysterical and yell at Chris to ""get out."" Quite conveniently, the flash isn't enough to break Logan completely out of his fugue state nor is Chris able to simply walk away and call the police, as the mere tapping of a spoon on a tea cup, causes Chris to fall back under Missy's spell.<br/><br/>Peele's universe proves even more ridiculous when Rose is exposed as part of the family conspiracy to grab Chris and plant the brain of Jim Hudson, their older blind art dealer friend, into Chris' head. Somehow, this time, Chris breaks free of the hypnotic command and is able to contact his TSA agent friend, Rod, in NYC, who all along suspected that there was something very sinister afoot with these ""crazy"" white people.<br/><br/>The wish fulfillment is on display when the stereotyped white liberals get their comeuppance at the hands of the noble Chris. Peele does a great disservice to true victims of racism by reducing the tormentors to a group of straw men and women who are easily set aside. In real life, of course, racism is a far more complicated affair and sometimes the victims turn out to be as bad as their oppressors.<br/><br/>Get Out marks a new low in race relations with Peele setting a poor example for impressionable youth. Instead of trying to mend fences, Peele is content to present African-Americans as perennial victims at the hands of stereotyped white tormentors. No race or ethnic group has a monopoly on benevolence despite Peele's lame and misguided outlook to the contrary."

","There is no way this movie could have a rating over 6. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW in this movie, no new concept, a fest of cliches, even the twist was almost a copy of another movie ""Skeleton Key"", which I did not enjoy even. And if a movie calls its own genre ""thriller"" or ""horror"", then the movie should keep some level of atmosphere, to make the audience tense up to some point. Not saying that the atmosphere was even there, it was made even worse by inserting some random jokes in between the movies, which of course wasn't even humorous. And the character development was the worst thing in this movie, as some character shows passionate caring attitude and all of the sudden he/she turns into a complete psychopath. It was so abrupt that he/she would even change the way he/she speaks to a person that's not even supposed to know something happened. One of the key evidence that this movie was made without brains. <br/><br/> Let's just be honest. The movie makers only cared about making profit. Mixing horror, comedy, and not forgetting to insert white-is-evil rich-is-evil theme inside with a black person as main, so that you can call all negative reviewers ""racist"" (and sorry, I'm not even white). Then using some way to make people spam positive reviews, most of them which I highly doubt even saw the movie. I honestly think more effort, money was spent on making positive reviews rather than the movie itself. Hence the ""low budget"" movie."

","This movie is sort of mocking liberal elite who love black to an obsessive level and yet most of the positive review for this movie are by white guys who think anything made by black people is gold. The movie is not scary it lacks tension Jordan Peele should go back to writing terrible sketch shows on un-comedy central. For instance most scenes where the main character is under duress he is constantly narrating giving out exposition so the audience can understand rather than let the scene flow naturally like something a film student from kansas and they don't even have a film school, film is about motion and visuals not dialogue if you want that go read a book. Everyone who is white in this film acts like a weirdo jerk for the most part and the main character doesn't pick up on this until near the end of the movie because he's an idiot and if he wasn't the plot wouldn't work. Jump scares don't make something scary any idiot on youtube and windows movies maker can make a jump scare. Does it have any meaning? No. Does it make a horror movie good? No. Don't rely on jumpscares to make your movie even remotely scary because it's just momentary and after a few times the effect wears thin and just gets annoying. You should create an atmosphere slow build up the horror make the music tense, or have no music at all just silence with graphic imagery, visually stimulation, or dark and foreboding. There are many ways to make a horror movie scary jumpscares and stupid characters aren't one of them. This film is more of crime drama with some fantasy elements and a blatant political message anyway. If I go to see a horror movie I don't want to be hit over the head with a political agenda if you're going to that at least be subtle about so it doesn't ruin the film make it a black mess. Long story short the black guy kills all the white people and when the cops show up doesn't get arrested is hailed a hero and his fat ugly friend who is a ringer for peele jokes about how stupid and evil white people are.

","First of all, in order for you to enjoy a horror movie, you need to relate with the protagonist. The main character in this movie keeps on the same dull and lifeless expression throughout most of the movie, like he is constantly lost in his own thoughts. Even when someone comes out of the woods running at him full speed, he remains there frozen, staring into the void.
The plot twist is easy to anticipate early on. This makes the second half of the movie boring and tedious. Actually, you know who the bad guys are half hour in the movie, it's really easy since there are no good guys apparently.
Finally, this movie took the concept of Skeleton Key and replaced magic with science and blacks with whites.<br/><br/>And if you ask why this movie has high ratings, is because of modern politics. Every single white person is portrayed as evil and envious of black people, in every aspect. Skin colour, muscles, talent, even eyes. Thus, critics gave it high ratings."

 I always try to treat everyone I meet the same, with consideration, but I do not get the same in return. As innocent as this movie portrays black people as such benevolent heroes, the truth is far from what this tries to make you believe. 
 Overall it was very well made, with really great actors, I just felt very uncomfortable while watching this that this is just part of the continuing racial war being fed on both sides. Regardless of the past, which shows that every country (including Africa) has had slavery, we need to really work on moving past this. I believe that black filmmakers are trying to keep awareness of the past alive, even though most people in the USA are not racist, its only a fraction of the most ignorant and hateful that keep this up.
 But the fact that this movie so blatantly makes whites look evil, only furthers the truth as to who is really the most racist in this country."

","I just wasted nearly two hours of my life watching one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, I had heard great things about it, it sounded like an interesting concept, and to be fair, it does start off very well and draws you in. Young Chris Washington, an amiable fellow who's a professional photographer goes to spend the weekend with his white girlfriend's family - he's nervous, as most young men are when meeting their girl's family and that his girl hasn't disclosed his race to her parents puts him even more on edge. At first blush, her parents are typical upper-middle class professional pseudo-liberals - even without what follows, they're not at all likable - the young woman has a brother who looks like white trash, gets drunk at the family dinner that evening and, in his passive-aggressive way, really wants to kick the crap out of Chris. There's an extended family gathering that weekend - which makes poor Chris even more anxious, but he outwardly calm and unflappable and is a good sport, if only to please his girlfriend.<br/><br/>I won't disclose what happens next - but the story just devolves into abject stupidity. Pointless, in my view, violence and a denouement that is anti-climatic. I couldn't wait for this film to be over - for a film that got off to such an interesting and promising start, I was greatly disappointed.<br/><br/>If the message here is that white people have a desire to continually subjugate Blacks, meh - as a white man, I can't even take umbrage at that because A) I'm not sure that's what Jordan Peele is trying to assert and B) in its execution, it's just plain silly and mindless.<br/><br/>Nota bene - I rented this from Netflix on Blu-Ray - there was a very clear message that if you WANT to see the bonus features, which looked very interesting, you had to OWN the DVD - the Netflix copy was a no-frills, movie only copy - really? Is this something new or Universal being withholding and just plain idiotic. Speaking for myself, I can't recommend this film - it's a cut above a made-for-television feature - it tries, in its way, to bring a ""Rosemary's Baby"" suspense to it and it just fails miserably in that regard - perhaps they were aiming a bit too high."

","Can't think of a good reason to recommend this.<br/><br/>A black guy visited his white girlfriend's family estate only to discover the family's dark secret. What would happen? Could he survive? That premise drew me to this movie.<br/><br/>The movie seemed suspenseful, but concluded poorly. As the dark secret unfolded, I noticed some similarities in concept between a movie released over 10 years ago and this one. After I finished watching this one, I realized that a movie released over 10 years ago could wipe the floor with this one. That movie released 10 years ago is called The Skeleton Key.<br/><br/>The Skeleton Key has a perfectly dark ending, whereas this movie has a happy and funny one. Happy ending? OK. But being hilarious is a big Nono. It completely ruined the horror built up during the first 1 hour of the movie! What is the point of having the black police officer coming to Chris' rescue? What is the point of having this funny character in the first place? The movie would have been 10 times better without him!<br/><br/>Instead, the ending the audience got was rushed and underwhelming. The black police officer out of nowhere appeared and rescued Chris. When asked how he had found Chris, he simply said he had relied on transportation network to track Chris. Situation handled! Really? How funny.<br/><br/>Perhaps the filmmaker ran out of ideas and didn't even know how to conclude the movie. Personally, I would have loved to see a dark ending. The white police officer who appeared earlier in the movie would arrive and arrest Chris. Rosy lying on the ground with gunshot wound in her belly would scream for help, framing Chris for murder. After all, Chris touched the gun and his fingerprints were on it. The movie wished to express the oppression of black people in a white society, right? Chris getting locked up and prosecuted would suit the theme perfectly. Nobody would believe his story. The ending would be even better if Rosy was rescued and set free, continuing to ensnare black people for her cult white secret society's harvest and sacrifice. Wouldn't that have been darker, more logical and exciting?<br/><br/>The current ending is awful. It completely ruins the story. This movie is awarded 1 star for decent acting. Recognized the lead from Black Mirror. He's really good."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","181","353","12 May 2017"," A rare triple-threat genre film
","Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in ""Get Out,"" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele"" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern. <br/><br/>In the tradition of ""The Stepford Wives"" with the twist of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,"" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.<br/><br/>With a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.<br/><br/>Peele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.<br/><br/>Kaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.<br/><br/>When a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.<br/><br/>Not everything adds up by the end of ""Get Out,"" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

The ending is as expected - the man gets his revenge and kills the entire family.<br/><br/>Aside from its reasonably decent storyline of a black man in the process of being subjugated by white people, the movie had few things to offer.

Overall this movie is decent on a technical aspect, but what ruins it is the script.
Full with plot holes and clichés and nonsense, the movie is just stupid. It tries to be more than what it is introducing social and political commentary. First of all, i'm not american, i'm mexican.

","Fantastic! I would not call it ""horror"" but certainly ""thriller"" with some comedy thrown into it.

Lots of faces I have never seen before and they all did a stellar job.

"Java_Joe","8","51","93","12 January 2018"," Creepy, unsettling and very well done.
","I'll say right off the bat, I didn't really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn't know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out. <br/><br/>Get Out surprised me for a number of reasons. The first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that It truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is.<br/><br/>And secondly this was the work of a first time director. It's rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park. <br/><br/>And lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? No it isn't, but it's damn good especially if you're in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones."

To all who regard the movie as racist - I don't think so. Any modern day theme be it racism, sexism, disability issues anything can be used in this movie to highhight the issues being faced by individuals. It is for most part a unique genre in its own right.
Take dusk till dawn mix it with some eugenics and a pinch of humour and bingo .
Yes it does make you feel uncomfortable but not in a serious way. It's funny in places and very clever in bits. Some beautiful shots and filming and menacing score keep it simmering brilliantly. Watch it make your own mind up. Personally one of the most enjoyable movies from last year. Bravo."

"tharris190","10","194","401","22 February 2017"," Get Out is impressive and awesome. Best horror I've seen in a while!
","People will be talking about this one for a long time.<br/><br/>Get Out is an extremely powerful, poignant horror movie with some humor. Whatever elements of action or schlock that are present take a backseat to the real human drama that plays out when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his white girlfriend's eccentric family.<br/><br/>The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date, and Caleb Landry Jones in an appropriately, intensely creepy role. But Kaluuya is the star here, and he delivers with zeal a shocking depth and range of emotions. In fact, more often than not its what he doesn't say that delivers the most impact... which is all to say that this masterpiece could not have been accomplished without the masterful direction of Jordan Peele.<br/><br/>Peele builds atmosphere and tension like the Big Bang, dunking you into the mind of the main character while he navigates through very visceral danger.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that sets out to entertain first and foremost with shock and terror, but also with poignant social commentary and real philosophical meat to chew on, Get Out is the movie you need to see. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>This isn't Cabin in the Woods, Peele isn't interested in subverting genre conventions. What he has crafted is entirely original and unique, and thankfully free of clichÃ©s or stereotypes. <br/><br/>There are no ""monsters"" here. The real villains are entitlement, egotism, and objectification, and g.d. they are scary!"
"julesfdelorme","1","131","266","3 March 2017"," Stay out from Get Out
","Get Out, no really, Get out...<br/><br/>So, I went to see the movie Get Out with some friends yesterday. We had a choice between Leggo Batman and Get Out, and we chose Get Out. We're still arguing about who should be blamed for that choice. They list it as a horror. What they don't tell you is that the horror is that someone would even make this movie. I've never seen any of Jordan Peele's movies before this. I will spend the rest of my life trying to avoid ever seeing one of his movies again. The thing strives to be one of those Sixth Sense ""What a twist!"" movies, but the so called twists are so obvious, unrealistic and just flat out lame that you find yourself rolling your eyes in the dark and just praying that no more twists are coming. And they always are. If you were to take the racial premise in this movie and reverse it, there would be pickets and riots. But apparently it's perfectly acceptable to have a white people are evil and black people are good movie. Just for the record, I'm only part white. But I'm fully offended by the premise of this movie, not to mention in the clumsy and lazy execution that doesn't bother to try to make its plot points make any sense. To be fair, the trailer to Get Out does hint that this could either be a very good movie or one of the worse that you've ever seen. It comes far close to the latter and is too lazy to ever even approach the former possibility. This movie really does suck. It sucks despite some very good actors, including Catherine Keener, who has been superb in indie films like Your Friends and Neighbors and Bradley Whitford, an Aaron Sorkin favourite. The lead actor Daniel Kaluuya was even in the wonderful British series The Fades and Skins. And yet the net result, the only result is just flat out stupid and predictable. Maybe the title, Get Out, is meant as a warning to any potential audience. But probably not. That would require too much effort and self awareness. But the rest of us can try to help each other out in these days when going to the movies is more expensive in most places than drugs, and gives you far less pleasure. When in comes to Get Out, please, please, for your own stakes... Stay out... Go see Leggo Batman. I haven't seen it. But I wish I had."

"RLTerry1","10","122","252","24 February 2017"," The epitome of the American horror film
","Jordan Peele's Get Out is an outstanding work of horror cinema, in that the American horror film is the best genre for creatively commentating on the various social, economic, and psychological constructs of life in such a way that can be visually thought-provoking. And the best part about this film is Peele does not pull out any of the usual horror tropes or clichÃ©s until the showdown. Before you begin to think that Universal Pictures and Blumhouse are pulling a bait-n-switchâ€“selling you a psychological thriller when the film is really a heavy dramaâ€“think again. Get Out is every bit a horror film as its more traditional counterparts. In terms of its contribution to the library of horror films, the movie is flawless. From the writing to directing to acting and even the score, editing, and cinematography, Get Out is a film that you should definitely ""get out"" to watch. With a current 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, this film is certain to grab prolific attention from movie patrons, film studies, and social studies professors alike. It's a brilliant film to discuss in future American horror film classes. Never before has a film been used in such a creative and visceral way to comment on how one culture appropriates the best of another for purposes of exploitation or simply because it has something that you want, and then attempt to change, assimilate, or remove altogether because that which you want is seen as wasted on the originator. ""A mind is a terrible thing to waste.""<br/><br/>It is difficult to explore some of the themes and subtext of this film without giving too much away, but I'm going to try my best to analyze what I can without spoiling anything for those who plan to see the movie. The first element I took note of in the film was the choice of music. Not so much a score (although, there is a score to the film), the music selections in the film serve as an allusion to the overall message and theme in the film. For those who know a little something about music history, you may pick up on the strategic selection and placement of the various songs and musical scores used throughout the film. There are moments in which the music does not seem to match up with the mood or tone of the filmâ€“at least, at face value. However, as you delve deeper into the film, you will realize that the music fits in all too well with the plot. I'll give you this: think about the origins of the music in the film when you watch it. Before music, such as jazz and hiphop, became popular amongst a predominantly white society, it originated amongst the black community.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that hints at the big reveal in the turning point just before the third act is the physique, athletic talent, and sexual stereotypes of black males. You'll notice that clues are dropped here and there, albeit subtly, at the relationship between Rose's family & friends and members of the black community. The worship of Chris' body by many of Rose's family friends makes for an incredibly uncomfortable sequence of encounters at the outdoor picnic. The unsettling weird encounters between Chris and all the people he meets at Rose's family home each work to grow the level of tension and terror in the filmâ€“the fear of something dreadful looming on the horizon. Without relying upon a proliferation of jump scares and visceral horror, Peele successfully increases the level of anxiety to terrifying levels in the film. Reminiscent in the ways that Hitchcock or Kubrick may have directed this filmâ€“in terms of relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eyeâ€“Peele incorporates the feeling of uneasiness every moment he can without over saturating the plot. Perfect amount of all the elements that make up the American horror film can be found in this deeply disturbing narrative.<br/><br/>This is social commentary on how back males are often exploited for economic gain in areas such as football, basketball, track, and even music and fashion too. So, Peele was using this horror film to comment on how many in the white community have stolen from or appropriated elements from the black community in order to further their own gain or develop ways of entertaining the masses without proper acknowledgement, formal recognition, or even payment. For example, the jazz music at the beginning of the film. That style of music came out of black culture before it was rebranded high class white music for nightclubs, shows, and weddings. Further evidence of this social commentary can be found in other areas of talent that many want to steel for their own and then reprimand the black community or not being 'more white.' I could go on and on. Fascinating stuff! As it is a horror film, do not plan to see it alone. Horror is the one genre that is best experienced in a group setting."
"intelearts","9","88","178","29 April 2017"," 600th Review: As Lingering and Effective As You Would Want It To Be
","Get Out is full of touches and surprises, strong acting, excellent direction, and above it, it's a ride, a trip to a place Hollywood doesn't normally go - it offers a unique experience - and in this age of copycat, cookie cutter safe choice cinema, it stands out by a mile.<br/><br/>Get Out is that rare beast - a film that leaves you satisfied yet pondering. We objected to its constant referral as a horror film - it's an effective thriller with mild horror elements - but it is not a gore/slasher movie - this is more about getting under the skin, and inside the mind, of the viewer.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home. Home is not what home seems to be. Fun ensues. The genius of this is the way it plays on both white and black perceptions - we asked how the film would be if you reversed all the roles (pretty darn effective) etc;<br/><br/>Get out and see it."
"vert2712","8","97","198","25 February 2017"," A surprisingly subtle and effective horror film for our times
","Producer Jason Blum is the new Roger Corman: he's making a fortune producing smart low budget genre films that make a ton of money at the box office. Since his costs are low, he can afford to take chances on riskier edgy fare that studios wouldn't touch, and on relatively unproven talent. <br/><br/>There's no better example of this than Get Out, a truly surprising film by first time writer-director Jordan Peele. Better known as one half of comedy due Key & Peele, Jordan Peele isn't a name you would normally associate with horror/suspense films, which makes his effort all the more impressive. Get Out feels like the work of a very experienced craftsman who has seen a lot of classic horror films and truly wants to pay homage to them without slavishly copying or ripping them off.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer, you know the basic ""Meet the Parents/Stepford Wives""-mashup storyline: rich white girl Rose (Alison Williams) brings black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) back home to meet her parents Dean and Missy Armitage (Bradford Whitford and Catherine Keener) for the first time. Although mom & dad (who were not told beforehand that Chris is black) seem friendly enough, things immediately look weird: the house is very isolated, the basement is off limits due to a 'black mold problem', and the only other black people are a maid and a caretaker whose robotic behavior doesn't seem to be noticed by anyone except Chris. It's clear something's off but is it just racial awkwardness or something more sinister? This being a horror film (with some comedy elements of very black comedy), the audience knows Chris' suspicions are likely correct, and the hints and strange events keep piling up (Dean is a brain surgeon and Missy is a psychiatrist whose expertise is hypnosis) but we don't find out exactly what's going until very late in the proceedings, and this guessing game (and its ultimate answer) are part of the film's power.<br/><br/>I mentioned ""The Stepford Wives"" earlier, but the film actually has more in common with Rosemary's Baby (not coincidentally, another Ira Levin adaptation): without going into spoiler territory, Chris's situation and his relationship with Rose's parents is clearly inspired by Rosemary's predicament and relationship with her new neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet, who also appear to be caring and doting but turn out to have a very sinister agenda. Those who are familiar with Roman Polanski's masterpiece will notice how entire scenes in Get Out (particularly a party with a lot of oddball guests, almost all of whom are white and older than Chris) pay direct homage to the earlier film.<br/><br/>But whereas Rosemary's sense of alienation came from being a first time expectant mother (in itself a disconcerting experience) transplanted into a new environment (the Dakota building and its assortment of strange tenants), Chris' predicament has the added layer of racial conflict bubbling under the surface. He's the only black person in the entire place, save for the domestic help, and although everyone is nice and courteous, he (and the audience) can't help but feel that it's all the phony facade behind which something very unsettling is going on. Chris' suspicions are fueled by his occasional phone conversation with his friend Rod (LilRel Howery), a TSA agent who is house-sitting for Chris back in New York. Rod know something's up and keeps telling Chris to 'get out' of there because he's afraid the Armitages will turn him into a sex slave, but Chris is too polite (or intimidated by prospect of outright social/racial conflict) to take his advice.<br/><br/>Get Out's narrative is straightforward enough once you figure out where the story is going, but getting there is where the fun is. The cast is uniformly fantastic: like many actors turned directors, Jordan Peele gets great, nuanced performances by everyone, especially lead Daniel Kaluuya (in a star-making turn).<br/><br/>The racial aspects of the story are what makes Get Out so effective: without them, this would have been yet another installment in a long series of films where a seemingly nice family or close-knit suburban community turns out to harbor unpleasantness under the surface.. But the race conflict isn't an exploitative gimmick: Chris's race is an integral part of the story <br/><br/>In this day and age, it's safe to say a film featuring a black lead being victimized by a group of white folks could have been very incendiary, but the fact that Jordan Peele is black adds an extra layer of credibility to the film and helps deflects accusations of being exploitative. Rather than being brash and confrontational, the film is surprisingly apolitical and doesn't hit the viewer on the head with blunt racial allegories and heavy-handed caricatures.<br/><br/>Rose's parents are not the stereotypical racist old white folks: they are affluent, liberal intellectuals who (in her dad's own words) would have voted for Obama a third time if they could have. For most of the film, their courtesy and hospitality towards Chris feel unforced and genuine, if a bit stilted, which makes what happens in the third act a lot more believable and creepy.<br/><br/>The twist, if you can call it that, is effective because it's completely logical within the context of the film. The villains of the story have a very good (twisted) reason for their behavior, and are very civilized and professional about it. Not unlike the 'good Germans' during Hitler's regime, they think they're acting in pursuit of a greater good (listen to Dean's story at the beginning when he tells Chris of his admiration for Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where his own father also competed)<br/><br/>Get Out is the best kind of socially-conscious horror film: like Dawn of the Dead's anti-consumerism and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre pro-vegetarian stance, you don't need to notice the underlying message to enjoy the film, but it's there in plain sight, and surprisingly effective."

Big flaw: in a world where many white people are racists the rich white people want ""black skin""!? Sorry, that makes no sense at all. A scene where a young black guy is walking the streets and recognizes a car following him and we hear him talking to himself that he wants no trouble is really a good one where I was able to emphasize with the troubles and feelings a young black man could have in a society where they are often regarded as dangerous etc. - why should someone want to have such troubles!? Ofc such people (if they would have the chance of ""bodyswitching"") would get the skin/body of a beautiful white man or woman. This imo is one of the very big flaws in that movie (the story line provides some more major flaws) and it shows hard one fact - the makers of Get Out didn't know what kind of movie they wanted to make: a satire on today's society, a horror movie, a comedy, a thriller, sci-fi, a buddy movie!? In the end we get a big mixed up cocktail which in some parts works well and in others it doesn't - Get Out is not a cocktail created by a master bartender but by an apprentice, the sum of the parts doesn't add up to a very good taste but taste too sweet, too sour, too whatever. Because of all that super-hype I give this movie a rating of 1, real rate is something like a 4, maybe a 5. The acting is good but nobody will remember that movie in the years to come.<br/><br/>+ every reviewer who calls Get Out a horror movie should get his a** spanked by his mom.

","Jordan Peele's directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues. The cinematography, tropes, and soundtrack echo horror, but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isn't racist by claiming, ""I would have voted for Obama for a third term."" Before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy, it mines the horrors of racism. The social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense.

Why did she revert to her weird cereal-eating, pulled back ponytail self after months of acting ""normal""? Her real self was never detected by Chris?? After 5 months??

How was she able to hypnotize all those people? Why was the red box left readily available for Chris to look in and see the pictures? Why were all the ""friends"" in on it?

Especially after they saw the results of the surgery?? Everyone who undergoes the surgery turns into a zombie! They wanted that?? They bid on that?? The grandfather only wanted the body to run?? Why were the victims afforded an opportunity to see a video of what's about to happen to them? Why was a video made? The siblings were about ten in the video, where are the multiple other victims since this has been an over ten year serial crime? Just like Lost? The Dharma project? Skeleton Key?? Whew. After the hype settled, I hope people can reevaluate their praise for this one-dimensional fluff, that is, if they're honest and strong enough to do it, no matter what race the director is. Cowards all around. Cowardly critics for lauding a truly mediocre film and cowardly filmmaking for pussyfooting with the racism. (If they're gonna go there, they should have gone all the way there.) The ""Crash"" and Marisa Tomei of the Oscars: this will DEFINITELY not stand the test of time.

If nothing else, black men will think twice about heading off to the countyside with their white girlfriends. On the other hand, I can totally relate to the protagonist in this film. I once attended a Christmas party with my friend Albert and I was the only white person there - except for an accountant, an orthodontist, and a cardio-thoracic surgeon. Just kidding, there were no other white people at the party. It was uncomfortable, not intolerable, but I could feel the tension. Racism is real... all races are capable of it.

","Jordan Peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, so when I first heard the news that he'd written and directed a horror film, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little surprised. Then came reports that Get Out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and, after horror having a solid year in 2016, I was hoping it'd live up to expectations. Believe the hype guys because Get Out is as good as you've heard.<br/><br/>Black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) visit Rose's parents for the weekend, where they will meet Chris for the very first time. Staggered by their behaviour from the very off, Chris begins to think all is not right in the home of Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener).<br/><br/>I absolutely loved Get Out as both a psychological and satirical horror, Jordan Peele's imagination bringing us something quite unique within the genre and showing that he has such a big future ahead as a filmmaker. Right from the opening sequence, which is one of the best openings to a horror I've seen, I knew this film was going to be special. It felt almost as if I was watching a film from a seasoned director and not a man making his directorial debut, Peele exuding confidence more and more as the film rises through the levels of paranoia.<br/><br/>The writing is spot on as well, Peele's background as a comedian coming into great use to blend the satire so perfectly with the horror. Peele has clearly made Get Out as a form of social commentary but he does so by keeping the audience on their toes, wondering where the film will turn next, which is one of the most important aspects of a horror film. As well as being genuinely creepy, Get Out also has some hilarious moments up its sleeve, leaving the audience in the palm of Peele's hand.<br/><br/>Peele's confidence as a filmmaker is seen further through Toby Oliver's swift cinematography, akin to work seen in The Shining, and both Michael Abels haunting score and songs picked by Peele to accompany his twisted film.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Get Out excels above many horror films with a talented and strong cast. Daniel Kaluuya leads the film with a quite exceptional performance as Chris Washington, impressing with each passing minute as the paranoia within his character grows. Expect to see much more of Kaluuya in the future.<br/><br/>Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are both devilishly charming and unnerving with their performances as Rose's parents, who take an immediate interest in Chris' life, both past and present. Get Out gets its truly unsettling performances from Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson as Georgina and Walter, hired by Dean's father. They both have a stand-out scene where it becomes clear that all is not well with either them or the house they tend to. Lil Rel Howery deserves a mention too for being genuinely funny in the role of Chris' best friend, Rod, who doesn't just feel like the comedy relief shoehorned in for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Get Out brilliantly continues the resurgence of the horror genre and, as a directorial debut, has to go down as of the best I've seen from Jordan Peele. He's already stated that this is the first of a number of horrors he has planned which will act as social commentaries and, if they continue to be as good as his debut, I cannot wait."

","This movie is derivative drivel, but a couple of actors tried even while acting uphill against the material. See below. I had heard good things about it when it first came out (reviews, not word of mouth.) I also would not have rented it if I had realized that the tailor's mannequin Allison Williams was in it. She's awful, and obvious, which is a good descriptor of the film in general.<br/><br/>Spoilers: In case you've had a head injury.<br/><br/>There's a family in the woods with a secret. Who saw that coming? The movie is pretty racist and stupid from beginning to end. Basically, black people have become so cool that old money is ""upgrading"" their old firmware the into a cooler case, but the idea that the entire house of cards can be brought down by a bright flash of light is pretty lame. I guess we better keep all the brainwashed black people inside during THUNDERSTORMS!<br/><br/>I felt bad for Daniel Kaluuya. He tried really hard to maintain a sense of suspense, and try to suspend your disbelief that his character wouldn't have figured out what was going on long ago. He almost looks like he wants to peer at the camera in an apologetic way as if to say ""I'm sorry this insults your intelligence, and wastes your time, but I can only follow the script (if such a thing exists.)<br/><br/>Lil Rel Howery provided some much needed comic relief, and he was very good, but it says much about the poor script and story that he figures everything out OVER THE PHONE!<br/><br/>The entire movie was irretrievably racist, stupid, and unapologetically raids the genre for material. He should have thrown in an actual zombie. Nobody's done that in a while. Peele includes both necessities of truly good diabolical schemes. 1.) Reveal the entire scheme to the victim (even though in this case I'm sure he knew.) 2.) Leave the victim completely unattended. What could possibly go wrong? (See every James Bond/Indiana Jones movie ever made.)<br/><br/>However, and this is important, Peele has so little respect for his audience that not only does he include an even WORSE and more racist ending, but it has the DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY over the top of the alternate in case you still hadn't picked up on the rest of his cinematic subtlety. Peele's point is that he made it ""during Obama"" (his words) but people were sufficiently ""woke"" (also his word) by the time he finished the ""film"" so he felt he could use the primary ending, and the rest of us knuckle draggers would get it anyway. What a pseudo-intellectual, self important, buffoon.<br/><br/>Jordan if you ever read this, which I doubt since your script doesn't suggest a reader, the only surprising/cool thing in your movie was the scene with the mounted deer head. Thanks for insulting me again during the ""alternate -basically the same as the other -ending"" though. The flash thing was really stupid and I want my money, and my life back. You should consider making commercials or something where subtlety isn't required."

","A Black man named Chris goes with his White girlfriend Rose to visit her rich parents in the country. Chris finds tension in the situation. The White people are too ingratiating (Obama was the greatest president ever). The few Black people aren't ghetto enough (shaking hands instead of fist bumping).<br/><br/>Rose's mother is an expert hypnotist who puts Chris under just by tapping her spoon on a saucer. Rose has lured Chris there so that rich White people can bid on his Black body. Rose's father is a neurosurgeon who attempts to transplant some old, blind, White guy's brain into Chris' body. Chris foils the hypnosis by stuffing cotton into his ears. He basically kills all the evil White people.<br/><br/>Get Out is just a mediocre grade B thriller with a political axe to grind that tapped into the current anti-White zeitgeist. It really isn't clever. Or creative. Or even entertaining. Much of it doesn't make sense. Why is the hypnosis even necessary? Why not just drug the Black victims in preparation for the neurosurgery? Once the victim's brain has been replaced, how can their consciousness still be present as a ""passenger""? Why did Rose's grandparents want to be servants after they commandeered the Black bodies? Why choose Black people specifically for the transplants? Wouldn't the old, decrepit, White people want to have a young, White body so that they could keep their White privilege?<br/><br/>Get Out is an insight into the confused psyche of Writer/Director Jordan Peele. Paranoia and narcissism. White people want to enslave Black people because of envy. From the words of the blind guy that wanted Chris' body : Black people are faster, stronger, and cooler than Whites. Inversion of reality. Blacks live in a constant state of fear of repression and violence at the hands of Whites. Crime statistics show the opposite to be the truth.<br/><br/>If you want an example of what a sorry state that present day Hollywood is in, this film was actually nominated for best picture."

","Hmmm....yeah... I mean where do I start here? I mean I haven't seen Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? - although I am aware of the basic plot mechanics of that film. So I expected Get Out to kind of deliver on the same basis, but with some kind of weird horror twist. Well to be fair Get Out partly delivered in this respect which also meant that it was only a partial success..<br/><br/>OK. Let's kick off with the giant elephant in the room that is kicking and stomping its feet around here - is the film racist? This film on the surface purports to being about a cultural divide between black and white folk, but it doesn't delve deep enough into this aspect leaving the storytelling feeling a little shallow and superficial and it is leaving this viewer rather undivided at this stage so I'll crack on. On this front, the elephant remains in the room albeit sedated for the time being. <br/><br/>OK so if you take all of this away what are you left with; erm... well... erm.. not a lot. The protagonist and indeed many other various subjects are seemingly part of some crazy assed experiment - it seems that the Armitage family have naturally selected seemingly perfect individuals to re-populate. Whilst it kind of works as a storyline, I really didn't understand why it needed to have a black/white divide? I mean why not just have a crazy family trying to create a perfect master-race from white or black people? It's a very controversial way to set up a story which understandably may have upset some people.<br/><br/>Yet still there is something about this film that still draws me in; perhaps it is the superb acting from the principal cast, perhaps it is the creepy nature of the story and the overall creepy vibe of the film. These things do go a long way, but they don't make Get Out a brilliant film.
 
However, taking everything into account, I found Get Out weird, but strangely captivating. It's the sort of film that you should probably check out for yourself, but just be prepared for one messed up ride."

","Get Out is fantastic.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for Get Out, I laughed hard. I thought it looked awful because the trailer was so weird and strangely cut. I was wrong.<br/><br/>Here's what the movie did well.<br/><br/>Get Out is the best movie I've seen so far in 2017. The story follows an African-American man visiting his white girlfriend's house, but there is so much more than just that. The story is incredibly entertaining. The dialogue kept the audience entertained, it was funny, witty, smart, and kept a constant pace. The movie blended horror and comedy perfectly, neither taking center stage. The film has a lot of dark humor which I'm a huge fan of, it worked very well with the setting and tone of the film. The story has twists and turns that are very original and catches the audience off guard. The story has fantastic social commentary, commenting on subtle racism throughout which is very effective. The story keeps the audience on the edge of their seat throughout. When the comedy hits, it hits hard, each joke hit and were well timed. The horror hits hard as well, making the film disturbing and creepy when it needs to be.<br/><br/>The technical things in this movie were amazing. The lighting was consistent and gave the film a dark, stylized, and disturbing vibe. The cinematography was fantastic, each shot giving off a certain feeling which helped move along the story. The music that played in this movie helped with the vibe, fitting whatever scene it was in.<br/><br/>Most everyone who acted in this movie gave a fantastic performance. Daniel Kaluuya, Bradley Whitford, and LilRel Howery particularly giving great performances. Everyone embodied their characters perfectly and put a lot of effort into making sure their characters were believable.<br/><br/>This film was Jordan Peele's directorial debate, if this type of quality holds up in his future films I can see him having a long and successful career in directing. The film is well paced and makes sure to keep the audience on their seat. Peele made sure to get fantastic performances out of his actors and did a great job creating the tone for this movie.<br/><br/>Onto the bad, which there aren't a lot.<br/><br/>There was, out of the whole movie, one shot I didn't like. There was a shot with fire in frame. The fire didn't look real which took me out of the story for a split second.<br/><br/>Caleb Landry Jones's performance was a little over acted. If he acted less like a cartoon character it would have been better but it doesn't effect the movie in a major way.<br/><br/>Overall, Jordan Pelle's Get Out is fantastic,keeping the audience on the edge of their seat when they need to be and made them laugh when the jokes hit. The film is beautiful looking and the story is unique and will surprise many audience members. I highly recommend Get Out if your looking for a quality horror/comedy movie."

If a movie has racial themes white critics go out of their way to say how amazing it is, and sometimes the movie is actually amazing, but here it's nothing more than white guilt. The movie is so lacking is subtlety when it comes to it's race themes that it induces eye rolling, and it depicts a society so uncomfortable with black people that its a wonder they can even co-exist. It's as if the movie has an agenda that it has to constantly point out. The premise is too idiotic for even a horror movie, and I could forgive these things easily if it were the least bit scary, tense or funny.

From the awkward dinner to the 'OMG I forgot the annual family get together is this weekend' to the slightly unhinged brother who just happens to swing by,the scene is set for a journey into ham fisted am-dram of the very worst kind.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into much detail here, but there are two elements that ruin the entire story. The first one being the under, or over used comic relief, depending on your POV, and the absurd hypnosis plot device. This put the film firmly in the Billy Drago world of bad movies. In fact, his inclusion might have made it better. Thats how bad it is.<br/><br/>So blah blah blah, white people are evil and insane. we get it. If this had been at least a little bit funny it might have worked, but its just...bad. There was a very funny idea in here, but it was completely wasted. If somebody with a sense of the absurd had taken this idea it could have been a classic, but instead it was stilted, dull and flimsy. The idea of young black guys bodies being taken over by old rich white folk should have been a rich seam of farcical situational comedy. If it had been made in the 70s with Richard Pryor then we would likely be using it as the touchstone of racial comedies today. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and what we get instead is a mish mash of half baked and poorly realised ideas that are never used properly.<br/><br/>Its long been a criticism of IMDb that it doesn't filter out the obvious paid for reviews. Until now I've never given that much credence, but after reading some of the reviews posted Im beginning to think that maybe there's something to it.<br/><br/>1/10, but only because I can't give a zero"

","Nervous about meeting his Caucasian girlfriend's parents, a young African American struggles to work out if everyone is acting strangely around him or if it is just his imagination in this unusual mystery thriller. The film is very deliberately paced with lots of malice foreshadowed but exposition only revealed in tiny chunks along the way. In fact, utterly unsettling as the pre-credits sequence is, it is hard not to wonder whether the film would have been better without it since it is the only scene for quite a while that spells out the horror slant of 'Get Out' beneath its quirky façade. That said, there are enough elements that remain elusive here that the film stays enticing until the end. The final quarter also comes off as a very clever homage to the horror movies of the 1970s, complete with appropriate furniture for the period. What really elevates the film though is its social satire. The racism agenda is a little on-the-nose, but the protagonist's anxiety at being a 'token' African American really clicks, forced to enter into awkward conversations with several houseguests at one point who have no idea how to talk to him without sounding racist. It is actually quite a universal predicament and aside from being a captivating mystery movie, 'Get Out' also pinpoints how strange it can be to interact in an environment when one is a minority, whether it be by race, religion, gender, age or other factors."

","7.7, what is WRONG with people these days.
Ok lets get this through. Only writing this review to try and lower a ludicrously high score that'll con people into wasting their time with this idiotic garbage.
PRO : the lead actor is pretty good, not overplaying the whole black guy cliché and probably the only one in the entire crew that gets the meaning of the word ""subtlety"".
Allright lets get on with the CONS :
this is the most idiotic, heavy handed and predictable movie I've seen in a while. Movies like that are the reason I don't watch movies anymore.
I was foolishly drawn in by the hype and the REALLY HIGH grade on imdb...I saw bad news coming right at the beginning, when we get that close up of the spoon going ""tingtingting"" (HEY LOOK IDIOTS!! THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT LATER ON!!). I was aware that the movie revolved around hypnosis, so that shot i found extremely OBVIOUS. BTW : everybody's quite aware that you can't force people who are hypnotized to do acts they wouldn't do in the first place. And as far as I'm concerned, hypnosis is bullcrap, it might work on some people but it didn't work for me, AT ALL. I see a hypnotherapist and she tried it on me 3 times. She couldn't even make me raise my arm, and even though i was doing my best to do what I was told in order for it to work, she gave up after 3 tries because it really, really didn't work on me. But enough with my personal experience, and enough of common sense (you won't be getting a lot of that in this idiotic trash).
Let's tear through this insult to intelligence. As said above this movie is EXTREMELY predictable, you see everything coming from a mile away (safe for the deer at the start). The director HAMMERS in clues and it really feels like he thinks your an idiot that needs to smacked in the face in order for you to get things. ""OK, I GET IT"" is a sentence that popped in my mind at least 5 times in this film. Peele thinks he's being so subtle and unconscious that he needs to make things that should have stayed implied REALLY OBVIOUS. In other words, he thinks his audience are clueless. I hate when directors treat audiences like moronic children; it's disrespectful and an insult to intelligence. I don't think he was doing it on purpose though, Jordan Peele is just a superficial moron that thinks he's much smarter than he really is. OK enough of that.
I have to say this, get it off my chest : the lead might be good, but OH LORD was that redheaded moron playing jeremy annoying. He redefines overacting, he made me think of an edgelord version of early Brad Pitt. Someone get this dude out of the movie industry. And how did Cathereen Keener end up in this garbage?? I'd rather think she did it for the check then have her lose points in my esteem.
I could go on and on about everything I predicted correctly in this movie (""she's gonna use that sound to hypnotize him -bingo; he's gonna get jumped in 3, 2,1 -bingo; TV's gonna turn on -bingo; he's not really dead -bingo; she's gonna wake up and strangle him -bingo, etc etc etc), but the most annoying part of this movie is its sheer idiocy. White racist people are jealous of black guys because SOME OF THEM are physically better built? GTFOutta here. A TSA agent has a cop car and a badge? GTFOutta here. I'm trying to remebember all the stupid, borderline offensive things this movie through at my face but I can't be bothered.
Stupid movie made by a very stupid person (and for a black guy, jordan peele's really full of racist clichés) that's thinks he's waaaay smarter than he really is. But hey : look at the IMDB score : he might be just right, problem is he's smarter than the morons who gave this POS more than 5, but that doesn't prove anything, given the average MINDLESSNESS the web is teeming with.
Stupid movie made by a stupid guy for a stupid audience. Absolutely terrible, and the worst part of it is I'm going to be EVEN MORE CAREFULL with internet ratings from now on. F you jordan peele, you stupid moron, go back to black clansman and stop treeting your audience like they were 12 years old.

So as a fan of horror and mystery movies I was totally excited! And that was about it. I have never experienced before such a big difference between ratings and my personal opinion.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes were just boring, full of clichés about white and black people. Then it continued with the clichés. The sentences were like ""we are trying to make a film about racism"". They did not even try! And things like ""oh you smoke, this is bad, you have to quit"", ""Oh you are black, show me your ID even if you were not driving"", ""what do you think are the physical advantages of being black?"".<br/><br/>Horror movie?

I looked eagerly forward to seeing it and now that I have; I can honestly say that I am very disappointed with the film. After 20 minutes I was going to turn it off but I kept hanging on to see ""when"" and ""if"" anything interesting would happen and what the fuss was all about. It took a long time for anything of ""note to happen"" (most of the plot action takes place in the last 15 or 20 frenzied minutes).<br/><br/>More Spoiler Alerts!!!! Spoiler Alerts!!!! Spoiler Alerts!!!! READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT RUINED FOR YOU.<br/><br/>If anyone has ever seen the classic Universal Studios 1948 horror comedy Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein then you'll know the plot for ""Get Out"" (coincidentally released by Universal Studios) borrowed liberally, (i.e. was ripped off from that A&C movie). This time, instead of Dracula wanting to transplant Costello's simple mind (brain) into the Frankenstein monster so the monster will be malleable and compliant; we have rich, old, white folks wanting to have their brains transplanted into young, healthy, black people's bodies with stronger bodies so the white folks can live longer and be healthier. I guess it's some kind of twisted, sicko old, rich, white person's idea of the fountain of youth or fantasy utopia? (Duh!) Go figure. The idea makes you wonder what the families of the old, rich, white people do about their elderly family member's death certificates and how they cover up the missing old, rich, white family members in the outside world. No one seems to ever miss them or question the ""new"" black family members.<br/><br/>Get out clocks in at a slowly paced one hour and 45 minutes but if you watch the first 15 minutes and skip to the last 20 frenzied minutes (where all the IMPROBABLE action takes place and I mean VERY IMPROBABLE); you'll save yourself 1 hour and 10 minutes of snooze time. Virtually nothing happens for that long stretch in between.<br/><br/>ONE MORE SPOILER ALERT: The ending you can drive a MACK truck through the improbable happenings and ridiculous overkill. It would be one hell of a messy situation to clean up and walk away from. <br/><br/>The biggest peeve I have is the guy's ""loving, white girl friend"", i.e. kidnapper who lures young, black people to her parents home in secluded upstate NY. She actually leaves the light on in her closet with a shoe box (lid ajar) for the suspicious black boyfriend to find. It's smack dab in the middle of the closet floor, light shining on it with nothing else around! The contents - oh just many photos of his girl friend with every black boyfriend and one girl friend she has lured to her parent's home. There must be at least 10 to 15 of those victims each pictured lovingly with her. A very busy family industry they've got going there. Why would she do that? Answer: As a plot device to hammer it home to the boyfriend/victim and to the viewing audience. In case you couldn't figure out what was happening already.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Get Out"" is an inferior horror movie that would have made a poor 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone way back in the day.<br/><br/>Social message??? I don't think so, unless you want to read one into it.<br/><br/>More likely it exploits the racial divide in some parts of society to garner ticket sales for the studio.<br/><br/>In the end like so many other poor horror movies, ""Get Out"" seems like the idea one gets from a crazy mixed up nightmare after eating too much greasy pizza late at night.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Skip ""Get Out"" --- pardon the pun, it is a ""no brainer""- ha ha ha."

","Once in a while a movie comes along that takes a genre by the scruff of the neck and vigorously shakes it into a new shape.<br/><br/>This is so with Get Out, a horror movie (so the marketing blurb says) that lobs a few horror tropes into a lean and mean 104 minute thriller. But it is really a social observation on the insidiousness of racism. It comes out the other end as a unique movie offering.<br/><br/>It borrows from Pacific Heights, Psycho, Michael Haneke's astonishing Party Games and sub-horror-porn like Saw without ever being any of them.<br/><br/>Without resorting to spoilers its one gigantic twist from start to finish that realises the fears of a young black American guy on a trip to the country to meet his wealthy WASP girlfriend's family on a celebration weekend. Every sentence uttered by every character becomes a retrospective clue as to what the outcome will be.<br/><br/>Given it's described as a 'horror' you can expect a deal of nasty stuff in a climactic ending. What director and screenwriter Jordan Peele (amazingly a debut outing) most cleverly does is apply Hitchcockian tension so that 89 minutes of tension are realised in a mere 15 minutes of terror in such a way that the nasty bits don't (as so often is the case) outstay their welcome.<br/><br/>Superb performances all round from the five principal actors, but especially boyfriend and girlfriend Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams (Girls).<br/><br/>It's should be no surprise that this has been both BAFTA and Golden Globes nominated, but it is because this genre rarely reaches this level of critical acclaim.<br/><br/>It'll get Oscar nods too."

"ironhorse_iv","8","28","56","21 February 2018"," This horror movie is worth getting out to see! It's mind-blowing!
","Pour some milk and get yourself, a bowl of Froot Loops, because it's time to go to the sunken place. Written and directed by Jordan Peele; ""Get Out' chronicles a 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' series of unfortunate creepy twist and turns, that befall a good-hearted, an African American photographer, Christopher Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), while visiting his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams)'s family in rural America. Without spoiling this satire/horror movie, too much; the film was a massive success; financial and critical. It even won awards. Not bad for a first time director. Still, as good as this film is, it's not without some flaws. The biggest one, is how it portray, all Caucasian people in the film as untrustworthy evil buffoons. Don't get me wrong, people should remember, the harm cause by racialized slavery and unequal social status, in which ethnocentrism, somewhat create; however, this film felt a little too reverse racism. After all, the film's controversial, negative prejudices is somewhat, discouraging minority groups from intermixing cultures, by ridicule their peers for engaging in behaviors perceived to be characteristic of white society. In truth, it isn't a betrayal of culture, by wanting to get into an interracial relationship nor should it be warned. All, this is doing is creating various expressions of hostility or indifference toward one race; which isn't good; as there should be, any animosity between races. It was a huge mistake, not having one decent light-skin person in this film. It fueling a negative stereotype of a certain race. Another problem with this piece, is how, it didn't take full advance on making some of the villains, a little more believable. All that backstory of them, belonging to an ancient secret society descended from the Knights Templar; trying to seeking eternal life promised by the Holy Grail, and finally achieved it with the Coagula procedure, wasn't really needed, nor was it explain well. In short, it should had been cut down. After all, a little mystery is better than over explaining it. Another problem, with the film is how the villains talk. I get that, Peele was going with something, very creepy, in the way, the 'Stepford' type-characters, robotic talked & how, out of touch, these elderly characters are to certain dialect, slang, and gesture. Nevertheless, it come across as too jarring; because these folks, should know, everything, how young minorities should act. After all, the film's concept is built upon, the notion, that they're obsess with black culture. So, seeing them, not know; certain simple things, like the word, 'snitch' or the gesture, fist bump, makes them, look clueless than sinister. Also, the way, they act, gave away the big twist toward the end, way too soon. Much of the twist and turns of this film, are pretty easy to predict. Despite that, the movie does make great use of most of the language that they were going for, through the use of double meaning & calls backs. Scenes like Rose talking to the police & Chris talking about Judo shows that. Even seemly out of place comedy scenes with supporting character, Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery) felt like it deserve, another watch; even if it's not that funny, as it shows, maybe the cops are not as incompetent as it looks. It is intricate part of the movie's fabric. Howery still gave, a great performance, regardless. The same with the other performers like Betty Gabriel, Catherine Keener, Lakeith Stanfield & Allison Williams. They all gave deeply unsettling performances. As for the main lead, Kaluuya delivers a very compelling dramatic performance. I do like the character arc that Chris goes through, even if it's not much. Seeing him, come from, observe type-victim to a more, hand-on survivor is somewhat believable. Nevertheless, some of the aspect of Chris's character, should had touched upon, a little bit better, such as his addicted to cigarettes. That concept really has no pay-off. As for him, being a skill photographer; it does pay off for him in the end, however, it does beg, the question, why he was chosen in the first place. After all, it seems like camera flashes, apparently undoes the procedure, at least temporarily. So, why risk it? Well, the only thing, I can gather, is that the villains, didn't know of that. Still, even if you roll with that, why did they still go with the surgery, knowing full-well, that the beneficiary, deals in the photography industry!? It just doesn't make sense. It's going to fail; like having a much older brain in a younger body. It really not as sound, as the film makes it out to be. After all, where is the other victims? Maybe, not all the brain transfer doesn't actually work. Regardless of that, I still like the deer in the headlight, metaphor toward cultural appropriation. By exploring 'the bystander effect' it make for an incredible experience. Nevertheless, some of the key moments that led off to action scenes could had been better explained; such as why Rose's photos, were just lying around, and why the girlfriend could not hear, all the noise, happening downstairs, while she was in her room. Despite that, the movie had assured fine rhythms, great camera placements, and amazing editing. Barely any sloppy shaky-cam work or dumb jump-scares here. Even, the alternate depressing endings were powerful. Still, I kinda glad, they went with this one. It's more crowd-pleasing. As for the music by composer, Michael Abels. ""Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga"" AKA Swahili whispering, ""Redbone"" by Childish Gambino, & ""Run Rabbit Run"" by Flanagan and Allen; it really does adds to atmosphere of the film. Overall: 'Get Out' is more than just a standard-issue horror movie, this brutal, smart film is impeccably made, as well as surprising, shocking, and funny, while also offering a compassionate, thoughtful look at race, without getting too preachy or heavy-handed.

","This movie seems to have gone viral and has gotten an inordinate amount of views and praises, and there is indeed a lot to like, especially in its atmosphere, some little horror details, and how it was filmed in old-school style, but in the end it is just another sloppily written brainless modern movie with huge plot holes.<br/><br/>It is also unoriginal and predictable. It is basically a black version of The Stepford Wives with an added twist.<br/><br/>A black guy and his white girlfriend go to meet her family, and gradually uncover very strange goings on, especially with the very bizarre and creepy behaviour by the black people working for the family.<br/><br/>*spoilers* <br/><br/>First there is the idiotic and obviously ego-driven concept that all white people in this movie worship the black physique enough to want a black body for themselves. I'm sure I don't have to point out how this is untrue and awkwardly egotistical on the part of the film-maker, not to mention the well known statistic that black people have a much higher number of health problems. On top of that, this movie drives the point once again of how badly black people are treated in society, so why on earth would a white person want to become one according to its own logic? <br/><br/>Then there's the head-scratching plot point where they transplanted their grandma and grandpa into black people's bodies, except they turned them into brainwashed slaves. Obviously someone switched plots midway through the movie and didn't think things through...<br/><br/>These aren't just plot holes, they kill the whole backbone of the movie.<br/><br/>Not to mention the happy ending that is in denial. The very next day, obviously he would be arrested for mass murder.<br/><br/>P.S. Those of you blindly repeating the complaint about the cotton and how he managed to get it in his ears... This is actually NOT a plot hole. His hands were tied, but his head and upper body clearly weren't and he even visibly bent down towards the cotton at the end of the scene."

","First of all, ""Get Out"" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the best either. I heard all these great things about it, and surprisingly it was really slow. Nothing major really happened until almost the end, although most of that was pretty predictable. I do appreciate the eerie feeling you get regarding the characters, which is so creepy that it keeps you wondering about what is really going on with these people. <br/><br/>Secondly, as a Black woman in an interracial relationship, I get exactly where Jordan Peele was going, and seeing as how he's also a Black man who's married to a White woman, I think a lot of people need to lighten up. The film was a satire, so it's not that serious. It's supposed to be full of stereotypes since he was poking fun at his own relationship, and the old Hollywood cliché about the fact that Black men never make it out alive, much less to the end of horror movies. <br/><br/>I don't need to rehash a lot of the plot, but I just couldn't get pass the whole ""Stepford Wives with Black people instead of robotic clones"" feeling I got while watching this movie. That's exactly what it reminded me of. <br/><br/>At any rate, I think it was a decent effort for a directorial debut, but definitely not all it's hyped up to be."

","Let me just say straight up, I'm not a fan of horror but this film directed and written by Jordan Peele is very original in the storyline and themes within the movie. It is really a fresh take on the genre weaving a social message without any heavy handedness. Without giving away the story line, the movie is about an African American man with a white girl friend going home with her to visit her white parents. He has the trepidation any African American would face in this situation. Is the family racist? If so, how racist? Will there be lots of awkward conversations about African Americans? The tension builds in the film as the main character played by Daniel Kaluuya finds things getting stranger and stranger. Daniel Kaluuya gives an excellent performance playing the lead. He provides a wonderful low key performance with great deft and subtlety.<br/><br/>This film really deserves all the accolades."

","I gave this movie 8 stars, which for me is high praise indeed. On my first watch, I would have given it 2. That said, now that I have viewed this title several times I can truly appreciate what Jordan Peele is going for. It's not just a ""black and white"" film, and if you think it is - you miss the point.<br/><br/>Peele captures much of the ridiculousness of modern American society while also playing to those that think everything boils down to race. Is this is an oscar contender (little o intended) - who cares? All the film awards do is help already narcissistic overpaid morons celebrate themselves. <br/><br/>Does this film look at some serious stereotypes while making fun of so many of things we preoccupy ourselves with? Yes! To appreciate the humor and ""thrill"" of the film you must watch it more than once. Again, I consider myself a very conservative individual but still appreciate the humor to be found throughout this film. <br/><br/>If you didn't like it the first time, try it again - you might find some very clever things you missed.

The final scenes are just generic chase / escape / not escape and say nothing or bring nothing new to this or any other genre.<br/><br/>The best aspects for me are certainly Daniel Kaluuya who has a wide eyed innocent about him throughout which was very good and also a smaller part by Lakeith Lee Stanfield that felt resolved unlike most of the other characters.<br/><br/>Hey I actually just read a brief article by the Director and he cites The Stepford Wives, well..there you go Get Out, imitation is the best for of flattery..."

","Get Out gets a lot of credit where it doesn't deserve and not enough credit where it's due. Many have labeled it as a comedic commentary on race in contemporary American society, but it's really far from that. Yes, LilRel Howery is quite hilarious for most of it but Get Out really aims to thrill not to get laughs or cause a larger discussion on racial politics. The topic of race relations from Jordan Peele should be no surprise considering his past comedy sketches and personal mixed-race background and marriage. But his use of this material is to mainly work as a vehicle for tension and a tool to twist audience perception of what is really going on at this estate visit. A blatant example of this is Peele's smart directorial decision to change the original ending to one that tampers with our expectations and keeps political implications as an underlying subplot rather than the crux of the film. This works very well, drives the plot, our imaginations, and always has us wondering if our protagonist is justified in his paranoia or simply overreacting and misjudging the situation. As a horror/thriller Get Out has a refreshingly original premise with a skillfully witty and tightly constructed narrative plot but failed to evoke enough necessary fear for its own good. Peele makes a decent debut as a director but predominantly (and rightfully so) shows off his creative storytelling chops and attention to detail. But just as Chris misinterprets many people's interactions with him, audiences seem to misinterpret the ultimate point of this film."

"makleen2","9","29","59","27 September 2017"," An Honest Assessment of Get Out
","Written and directed by Jordan Peele of Key & Peele and MADtv, Get Out (2017) is the story of a young interracial couple, Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), meeting Rose's parents for the first time. By all appearances, Mr. and Mrs. Armitage (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) have no idea Chris is black. They seem to be friendly and progressive, if not awkward, but all is not what it seems.<br/><br/>This is Peele's first film, and it has gotten nearly universally positive reviews, which I'll admit, perplexed me at first. When I saw the preview, I thought it was a joke, like the horror movie spoof ""Ghost Tits."" It looked like something from MADtv or The Chappelle Show, which makes sense since Jordan Peele is mostly known for sketch comedy. Critics said Get Out was ""the smartest horror movie in ages,"" ""fresh and sharp,"" and ""masterfully and subtly crafted."" I had to see if it lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>Critics love to exaggerate positives and negatives, and there's definitely some of that going on with these reviews, but Get Out is a solid, well crafted horror film. The preview doesn't do it justice. The music, scares, characters, editing, foreshadowing, actors and actresses–all of it works.<br/><br/>The characters are genuinely creepy. We've all walked into situations where we had to meet people for the first time and they were a little odd or off putting. Get Out ratchets up that feeling and adds a racial element into the mix to make it more believable. The audience second guesses themselves along with the main character. Is there something wrong with these folks, or is it just culture shock? Many critics have chosen to focus on racism or subtle racism as a theme in Get Out, but I think Peele is doing something more clever with this. <br/><br/>It's nearly impossible to make a film without reflecting the society in which it was made or the values of the filmmakers. In that sense, yes, Get Out speaks to African Americans who experience this kind of subtle racism. And it's interesting because it's not a perspective you usually see in horror films. But most moviegoers are white. Does the white audience identify with the protagonist and his struggles to be accepted by his girlfriend's family? I'm guessing not.<br/><br/>In my review of A Cure for Wellness (2016), I argued that in a good mystery, the audience discovers clues alongside the protagonist. The thrill comes from an ""ah-hah"" moment, as the clues begin to fit together. The mystery in A Cure for Wellness didn't work because it was too obvious what was going on. It needed a red herring to keep the audience on its toes.<br/><br/>In Get Out, racism is the red herring. Chris' friend Rod Williams (LilRel Howery), a TSA agent, basically gets at the truth long before anyone else, but his theory is so outlandish, you're predisposed to dismiss it out of hand. There's a great scene when Rod takes his theory to the police, and they laugh him out of the room. This sends a signal to the audience not to take it seriously, even after Chris disappears.<br/><br/>The movie preview and opening scenes had me so fixated on race, I was sure the family had some secret racist past. Right up to the big reveal, I was convinced Chris would find a KKK hood, or old photos of Mr. and Mrs. Armitage at a Klan rally. I won't give anything away, but the ending comes as a complete surprise, and I think that's what delights audiences so much. The Sixth Sense (1999) is the last time I remember a horror movie beguiling audiences so well.<br/><br/>Peele himself said, ""What I'm going for is more the human demon that is inherent in the way we interact Humanity is the monster in my films."" So maybe it is about more than race, although it's hard to find a horror film where humans aren't monsters in some way. Whatever his motive, Peele produced a fresh take on an otherwise warmed-over genre. I went into the movie with a skeptical eye, and came out a fan."
"bob the moo","Null","13","23","26 December 2017"," Enjoyably creepy and tense
","I heard good things about this film, but beyond that I really didn't know much about it - comedy or horror or a mix, that was about it. What I got reminded me of Black Mirror in terms of its tone and dark but yet slightly comic material. The plot starts with an oddly racial situation, where the family are well meaning and accepting, but at the same time not in a way where the black/white divide is not clearly present in some way. From here it starts to add gentle shifts of tension and a creeping sense of unease and dread across the plot. It is this element that works best because it provides engagement, leading to a reasonably short period of reveal and resolution - this final section working best because of the investment in the mystery side.<br/><br/>The film is well paced to do this, and the plot is satisfying in the way that it uses race, but at the same time stands on its own feet without it being a theme if you don't see it or want it. First and foremost it is a horror, and it is an effective one. The cast work really well from top to bottom. Kaluuya leads the film well, and is convincing in all his moments. Williams is good, and holds her own alongside Whitford, Root, and Keener. Howery gets his performance just right - he could easily have been too much comedy, but he hits his marks importantly.<br/><br/>Get Out is a smartly created horror/chiller where race is used as a strong foundation, but not in a way that the film forgets what it is trying to do."

And what a fantastic performance of the protagonist!"
"ianhiggs","8","22","43","16 March 2018"," Well-paced, suspenseful horror with a touch of humor...
","Jordan Peele's cinematic debut is an astounding accomplishment for a genre that is commonly maligned as formulaic and inaccessible to broader audiences. What may first smack as a homage to the blaxploitation horror tradition, ""Get Out"" proves to be much more than any cliche attempt to elicit fear and unease purely through racial tension, gore, or cheap jump scares. Through the eyes of Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, we get a small taste of what it feels like to be truly uncomfortable in one's own skin. The tension is authentic, building into peaks of anxiety broken by stabs of humor, and sometimes the absurd (as can be Mr. Peele's inclination). Twists, turns, and a rousing climax complete an experience that wills surely engage from the opening scene to credits.<br/><br/>I can only think of a handful of moments where I lost immersion due to clumsy dialogue or clunky cinematography. Overall this film is highly deserving of it's Oscar and I will enjoy watching it again in the future. Mr. Peele and the entire cast obviously have incredible talent and I look forward to seeing more of their work."
"Councillor3004","Null","22","43","16 October 2017"," So much better than your average horror movie.
","The big surprise break-out hit of 2017, ""Get Out"" has received a lot of critical acclaim and still should be considered to be an underrated movie; that's how good it is. The movie does not necessarily use the most original concept (we have seen similar things with ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" before), but the movie mainly benefits from its clever storytelling - because sometimes it's not about which story you are trying to tell, sometimes it's about how you are trying to tell it.<br/><br/>The brilliant actors (Allison Williams was surprisingly good, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford were as good as was to be expected, and boy, was Daniel Kaluuya amazing) added to the film's success, as well as its better-than-brilliant directing. Jordan Peele easily deserves an Academy Award nomination for his work as an director; and it's easy to see how much effort and lifeblood flew into the making of this movie. ""Get Out"" is a horror movie, but not necessarily a horror movie in the original sense of the word; you won't find much blood, just as you won't find many jump scares - in this movie, it's all about the tension, meaningful dialogues, more tension, tension, tension. And it's incredibly well done. Not a single scene has been wasted, every little aspect of the movie has a purpose, and ultimately, that's what movies should be about: telling a story with so much love for its details that a viewer can simply sink into the movie and forget what's happening around him. Jordan Peele has already mastered this art in his directing debut."

","So, expecting this wonderful horror movie by Peele everyone is raving about.<br/><br/>About 1 hour in, I'm bored out of my mind, checking my own phone more than Chris did in the whole movie.<br/><br/>It is sooooooooooooo slow... And WTF is with Chris' facial expressions on so many occasions?<br/><br/>Foreshadowing is done in a rather ""in your face so you get it"" manner. Nothing clever. And also, easy to miss.<br/><br/>When the ""horror"" comes, it's sooooooo weak, it's not even horror. One bit of jump-scare via a musical cue.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it's just boringly tedious. Even when Chris escapes, you think, well that's easy. There is no tension, none.<br/><br/>In comparison, a likewise laid out movie like Texas Chainsaw Massacre is smarter, as it gets under your skin.<br/><br/>This one doesn't. The whole plot is explained by a short TV presentation. There's supposed to be all kinds of clever references towards that but those are too vague. Foreshadowing works when you as the viewer get an ""Aha"" experience. Never happened.<br/><br/>The movie is trying too hard to be too clever, and in doing so gets ahead of itself. It's trying to be a representation of black Americans being silenced by the white Americans. Well, it does shove that down your throat by the extremely stark white versus black setting. The way it tries to be clever about it is in all kinds of gimmicky, yet failing signs, like the ""in a sunken place"" hypnotism being a synonym for blacks feeling powerless in America. This could have been a much, much better movie if it hadn't put more emphasis on trying to be this kind of Black is Best presentation, and had been more mixed. And mixed as in racially mixed. Even Saw did this better. Get out puts the pieces like a chessboard, painfully contrasting. Had it been, for instance, a group of young people of several races, it could have worked so much better. If Jordan Peele wanted to send out an anti-racism message, he should have done it that. Not in this Black is Best fashion. A mixed group of protagonists triumphing over racist antagonists had been perfectly suited for the basic theme of replacing your own aging, decrepit body with that of a younger one by transplanting your brain. That whole premise would have been kept and the end result so much better. Oow, and that funny end Too stupid to end this kind of movie that way."

","This film was sadly lacking in every way: the story was thin and relied on cheesy 'explanation' set ups to try and condense some sense from the slightly drunk narrative. The dialogue was spare and dull; I didn't hear a single laugh in the half full cinema I saw this turkey. Also, the acting was in keeping with the story & script: awful. Daniel Kaluuya has always appeared in good things (Psychoville, Black Mirror) but he can't save what ends up being a film as intense as 'Scary Movie' without any laughs.<br/><br/>Get Out has been described as a genre-busting film but I found it to be a Sundance version of that. When I say Sundance, I mean a cheaply made film shot in the northern US states, usually in winter or fall, (autumn for us Anglos)with a dialogue driven narrative and therefore nothing of cinematographic interest nor musical.<br/><br/>My idea of a genre-busting film would be Shaun Of The Dead: it uses the genre of horror to drive the narrative but still has a very good script, distinctive characters and an equal blend of audio & visual highlights.<br/><br/>Get Out feels like a boring group of people made a film and then kidded everyone they were cool."
"PyroSikTh","8","12","21","22 March 2017"," How had No-one Thought of this Before?
","When I first saw the trailer for this, my first reaction was 'how had no-one thought of this before?' A black guy meets his white girlfriend's family for the first time and finds himself wrapped up in a Stepford Wives situation where every other black person he meets acts really dodgy and he suspects something untoward. That premise was enough to get my bum in the seat, but it's near 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes sealed the deal.<br/><br/>As explained, Chris is a black man; a detail crucial to the underlying unease of the whole movie. His girlfriend Rose is white, and they're off to meet her rich, white parents in the middle of nowhere who have no idea of his skin colour. On the way Chris suffers microaggressions from a policeman (to which Rose acts his protective white knight), and her parents treat him nicely enough, but overcompensate a bit so as not to appear racist. ""I would've voted for Obama for a third term"" is an oft repeated phrase in the movie. There's also a social gathering of family friends inbound, again, all of which are white and middle-aged at the youngest, and none of which are obviously racist in the typical way. They're very accepting and nice of him, and yet the questions they ask highlighting his skin colour makes him feel increasingly uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The whole race debate aside, Get Out is undoubtedly a solid piece of filmmaking. It's story is quite simplistic in it's execution. We meet Chris and Rose, they travel to her parents house, they spend a day there hanging out, Chris starts to feel uneasy, the party guests arrive and things get more uneasy to the point where Chris wants to leave, and then there's a small series of twists and revelations that lead directly into Get Out's third act. By the time the credits roll, you realise how conventional Get Out's story really is. Race aside, it follows many of the same beats as a lot of thrillers, and doesn't hold too many surprises, but it executes it all so well it doesn't even matter.<br/><br/>As they say, the devil is in the details, and Peele has obviously put a lot of work into the little details. There's almost no filler in this movie at all, and every little thing is important to one degree or another. For instance it's no coincidence that Chris uses cotton wool to avoid succumbing to what basically amounts to modern-day slavery. There's other odd little moments and details that I missed the significance off initially until I looked back on them and figured it all out backwards. There's just a lot to keep an eye (and ear) on. Tied into this is some really good cinematography that's used to great effect. There honestly was a moment where I felt so overcome with tension that I was tempted to walk out because I couldn't take it any more. I didn't, obviously, but I felt like I needed to leave thanks in most part to how everything was framed and each scene composed made me feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Get Out is also actually quite amusing at times, which is no surprise coming from one half of Key & Peele. The scenes with all the guests at the party are obviously satirical genius, turning what could be completely ordinary conversation into something both simultaneously hilarious and uncomfortably awkward. But the other big source of laughs comes in the form of airport security Rod; Chris' best friend, who basically amounts to the movie's comic relief. Every scene he appeared in resulted in some fantastic audience participation in my screening. Crucially though, Get Out is never a comedy. It's humorous moments are used to heighten the uneasiness of the whole situation more than anything, offering brief respites from the uncomfortableness.<br/><br/>Acting is top-notch from everyone as well. Daniel Kaluuya is a revelation as Chris. He holds a charisma that makes him incredibly likable and easy to empathise with, and his ability to show a strength and put up with the way he's treated, while also showing how uncomfortable he is with it is the backbone of the entire movie. Allison Williams is also really convincing as the black sheep of her family (excuse the phrase) as the most genuinely accepting member of her family, while Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford definitely seemed to have a lot of fun as the parents. They're charming and liberal enough that they're really easy to like, and yet suspicion is never fully lifted from them. Their performances are the perfect slow burns. Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel, and Lakeith Stanford are each on a level-playing field with their oddly- behaving personas, while as I've already briefly mentioned Lil Rel Howery is effortlessly the comic relief of the movie providing genuine moments of humour.<br/><br/>In all Get Out is a solid film in almost every regard. It's full of tiny little details that enhance the experience exponentially, and creates an atmosphere that's incomparably hard to stomach. It genuinely made me a little anxious watching it at times. While it's not jumpscares every ten minutes, and wouldn't fill a swimming pool with blood, it's undeniably a horror movie in the most cerebral sense, and for that it gets endless praise. It's intrinsic racial aspect is both it's saving grace and it's downfall though, proving a genius concept worth exploring, but maybe wasn't quite executed as good as it could have been. I give Get Out a solid 8/10 and would definitely recommend it."

","Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" is a fresh and creative modern-day classic. Tackling heavy themes of racism and slavery, Peele transforms a seemingly simple drama into a crazy, heart-stopping, and supremely funny thriller that consistently leaves you wound up. Daniel Kaluuya plays a black man who has to meet his white girlfriends family, and as many black men would feel in this situation, is uncomfortable and nervous. The instant this film starts ticking, you won't be able to escape and get this out of your head (no pun intended). Jordan Peele shines a a new director and embodies a spectacular style and wit into his storytelling methods. ""Get Out"" is a total knockout and an awesome work of original cinema."

","Get Out in short: An African-American man meets his white girlfriend's parents, and their friends, and notices that there's something a little strange going on.<br/><br/>Racial undertones surround this really good horror-mystery film directed by a guy who has a (mostly) comedy background, Jordan Peele. Peele wades into deep waters filled with many horror greats swimming about. The question is, does he manage to stay afloat in this pool of great talent? Get Out is not without a little satire, but it's not the cheese comedy and clichÃ©s you sometimes see in bad horror films, it works here, it's smart. But it is a horror film, after all, and a damn good one too. So yes, Peele's floaties are working just fine.<br/><br/>As a viewer, you instantly pick up the vibe going on right from the start. Director Jordan Peele, whose mother is white and father is black, sets the mood early and keeps reminding you of it. Chris, a black man, is dating a white woman, Rose. Nothing unusual about that, but for reasons that soon become clear, a big deal is made from it. Rose brings Chris home (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-esq) to an affluent neighborhood filled with old money and old white people who ""act as if they've never met a real black man before."" Suddenly, the geriatric's are referring to black stereo types, like, ""I'm a big fan of Tiger Woods,"" or, ""Is it true what they say about black men in bed."" People are getting creepy, if not rude, looking him over - sizing him up almost like cattle at an auction. Chris' best friend, Rod the TSA worker (and proud of it) ominously warns, ""You don't go to a white girl's parent's house!"" Even I began to feel sketched out!<br/><br/>Two things you'll LIKE about Get Out: 1) The story is brilliant. Peele also wrote the script (2018 Oscar nominee for both Original Screenplay and Director). It's unique and unexpected. 2) It's the best horror film since The Shining (1980).<br/><br/>Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) You may be a little uncomfortable with the racial undertones at first, perhaps even embarrassed for your entire race (if you're white). Give the move a chance to make the point of it all. 2) It may be a few more years until you see a horror-mystery like this one again. Soak it up while you can."

","Now I dont think this film is the kind of film you'll stay up all night cowering in fear wondering about what evil is lurking around the corner. At least it wasnt that kind of horror film to me. It's more psychological. And it does make you think about what its like to be black in this world. And for all those saying this film is ""racist"", I dont think that was Jordan's intent. He is married to a white woman, I dont think he seriously thinks all white people are evil. I see it more as ""Not everything always appears to be as it is"" cautionary tale. And also a bit of social commentary on those who think racism is long and dead just because there arent public lynchings anymore. Yes, we have made strides since the Civil Rights Moment. But its still there. And thats what I think the film was trying to say. Everything might look rosy and cheerful on the outside, until you get into the thick of it. And I think it was an interesting topic to handle. Jordan Peele did a really good job of tackling it and in an new, exciting way. <br/><br/>Also from a horror point, ""The Sunken Place"" is really creepy. The score also is on point. Its more of a slow burn. But that doesnt mean its boring. Jordan does a good job of leaving you little clues here and there that somethings not quite right and it helps to build up to the climax. <br/><br/>In terms of comedy, Lil Rel Howery (who plays the best friend role) is the comic relief. He is the one that gets all of the funny lines. That being said, I definitely dont really consider this a comedy. It never felt a comedy to me. So for those that are expecting laughs, you might be disappointed. <br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya though is phenomenal in this film and I'll be rooting him on during awards season.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this film and Im impressed that this was Jordan's directorial debut."
"patboldt","9","17","32","22 February 2018"," A Welcome Addition to the Horror Community
","For a while I was becoming pretty convinced that it was impossible to make a movie that focuses solely on being a good movie. Not trying to throw in political themes or the director's private views so he could please people, no, just a damn good movie that's fun to watch! <br/><br/>Get Out is that movie, one which I have throughly enjoyed watching. It's a damn good horror movie because it has psychological horror about being powerless and trapped in a world you can't escape. That's really powerful and it's great to see a movie focus on this often unexplored psychological aspect of fear. It felt like watching a really good Twilight Zone episode that just so happened to have a black actor in the leading role. Daniel Kaluuya kills it as Chris Washington, he is such a cool everyman. You can really relate to this guy regardless of who you are, he seems like an average chill dude who you want to hang out with. This perfectly helps you relate to a character. He's our outlet into the story and our way of becoming immersed in the horror. <br/><br/>One thing that kinda frustrates me though is how everybody sees this movie. For those who call it politically correct nonsense about evil white society, I almost want to punch these idiots in the face! This isn't something like Mudbound where you instantly realize what the movie is about without even having to see it, Get Out pushes racism and white prejudice in the background so it can focus on the story, not the political climate it happens to be in. People who praise or hate this movie on the grounds that it tackles racism are people who didn't get the point of the movie. This movie is not about political themes but everybody thinks it is because it has white villains. For those people, leave your damn politics to CNN and just appreciate a movie because it's great! <br/><br/>Get Out is great, and if you like horror movie and want a good modern horror movie, give this a watch. I love the classics and I will adore movies like Frankenstein and Bram's Stoker's Dracula to death (literally), but sometimes I wanna watch a modern movie where the real villains are the monsters inside the people we think we know. It's a great movie. It's really fun! Go watch it! <br/><br/>9/10 great movie that holds up well and a welcome addition to the horror community!"

","I'm not going to say that this is necessarily a movie that most people should see, but it is very good and doesn't seem likely to turn anybody off. Part of the reason for this is the fact that people can't really seem to agree on what genre of movie it is. It's been called a satire, a comedy, a drama, and a horror movie, but it doesn't quite fit the bill for any of them. Regardless of what you consider it to be, it is an original movie that is great without drawing attention to itself. I was glad that Get Out got as many Oscar Nominations as it did, particularly Daniel Kaluuya's best actor nomination. Both his performance and Jordan Peele's writing and directing do an excellent job of giving a sense of normality to an absurd world. From pretty early on, the audience should expect to see some abnormal and possibly messed-up stuff in this movie, but everything else in the world is normal and the dialogue is impressively realistic.<br/><br/>Chris Washington is definitely one of the coolest characters of the year, deflecting every uncomfortable comment and situation with impressive grace. The passive-aggressive racist comments that are directed at Chris add so much tension to every scene, especially as the Armitage family starts saying increasingly uncomfortable things. I watched this with a group of friends, and people were audibly reacting to some of the lines in the family reunion scene. Regardless of race, I'm pretty sure everyone has had to tolerate lesser versions of what Chris has to here, which is part of what makes this movie so good to watch.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the whole Armitage master plan going on throughout all this. As I recall, it has a couple of plot holes, but people seem to be pretty tolerant of these. Plus, it's pretty impressive how logical the plot is considering how crazy the premise is. This aspect of the movie had far less of an impression on me the second time I saw it, but it was pretty striking the first time I saw it. I don't know if the whole thing with swapping black and white people's brains was meant to make some kind of statement, if so I couldn't figure it out. <br/><br/>I really recommend that people see this if they haven't. There are so many cool things about this movie, namely the fact that it was made with a $5 million budget, which is far lower than I would have guessed it to be. Jordan Peele and Daniel Kaluuya are now among the names that will automatically pique my interest in a movie if they are attached. It isn't exactly a work of art, but it is an undeniably solid movie. Overall Rating: 8/10."

","The acting in this film especially by the main lead is phenomenal no question. <br/><br/>That being said the comic relief cop was so out of place in this film it wasn't even funny neither was he in general for that matter.<br/><br/>I respect what this movie attempted to do to put a magnifying glass in the faces of those that espouse racism in this country and act as if that's RIGHT as if there is nothing wrong with it when there is clearly so MUCH WRONG with that even more so nowadays in this country.<br/><br/>The movie was creepy as well as unsettling there was a sense of dread throughout knowing that something sinister was happening you just didn't know what that something was just yet.<br/><br/>The movie definitely had some startling and jolting moments as well and the villains in the film were satisfyingly sadistic and unsettling especially one that I did NOT realize was a villain the entire time.<br/><br/>It was an enjoyable thriller no question and I respected as well as appreciated the social commentary regarding racism throughout the film.<br/><br/>However as I said the actor playing the main characters best friend who felt something was off from the very beginning was simply too obnoxious,stereotypical,and obnoxious for me personally.<br/><br/>Not to mention this film started off creepy and progressively became more and more unsettling yet the ending completely destroyed the momentum that the film had made up until that point.<br/><br/>To end the film on such an unrealistically triumphant and cheery note knowing that for so many African Americans in this country that they rarely and sadly do not receive or get that much deserved happy ending the way they should was mind boggling to me it just did not add up to the creative,chilling,masterful,creepy,and unsettling vibe of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>It lost all of its momentum when they tacked that ridiculously unrealistic ending on to it to end the film on a more realistic note would have left the audience with a more thought provoking and cathartic reaction.<br/><br/>If it had ended with Chris going to jail being persecuted for the color of his skin and knowing the last villain standing got away with it...again it would have had a more lasting impression that probably would have opened closed minds and eyes that had originally refused to acknowledge the kind of injustice that those actions are that are committed against African Americans daily in this country.<br/><br/>Highly recommended nonetheless the film is brilliant and truly unsettling despite my reservations about certain aspects of this film."

","The amiable Daniel Kaluuya gives an enjoyable breakthrough performance as Chris Washington, a young black artist dating white girl Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Five months into the relationship, and it's time to meet her parents. They live in a back of the beyond universe populated almost exclusively by whites, along with a few black people who behave quite strangely. Chris will discover some nefarious doings by Roses' mom and pop (Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford) and these other members of the white elite. Will he be able to ""get out"" of this situation before it's too late?<br/><br/>Overall, the filmmaking debut for sketch comedian Jordan Peele is a respectable, if not great, effort to blend some commentary on racial relations with a tried and true, formulaic Hollywood thriller. This viewer could point out the film that seems to have inspired Peele the most, but that would be along the lines of a spoiler. While the film is technically well made and well paced, and builds towards an appropriately visceral finale, it is troubling in some ways. Its ""mystery"" is easy to figure out (Hell, Chris' seemingly paranoid friend Rod (LilRel Howery) may actually be on to something), and the characters are pretty ""black and white"", if you'll pardon the expression. Undoubtedly, the film is perfect at being manipulative, with villains whose violent comeuppance is the ultimate catharsis.<br/><br/>The cast provides most of the value. Williams is good as the girlfriend who, at first, tries to have you wondering ""is she or isn't she"". Old pros like Keener, Whitford, Stephen Root, and Richard Herd do as much as they can with cliched roles. The lively and profane Howery is quite amusing. Caleb Landry Jones dials up the seediness to 11 in his role as Roses' loutish brother Jeremy.<br/><br/>As this viewer said, the scenario is likely to get the blood of some audience members boiling, but it could have used a bit more restraint. It's certainly entertaining to a degree, and clearly it did hit a nerve with the movie-going public, even garnering some Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."
"richarddillomes","8","20","39","18 February 2018"," If Black Mirror was a movie
","When you think of the Oscars, you think of big, sweepy dramas like Saving Private Ryan, or big, extravagant musicals like Chicago, but when was the last time you thought of a Horror movie for Best Picture? If you can't remember any, it's because horror movies rarely made the cut, much less win the Best Picture award. Past nominees from this genre includes The Exorcist, Jaws, Sixth Sense, Black Swan, The Silence of the Lambs (the only winner so far), and now we have a new addition to this prestigious list: Get Out.<br/><br/>Get Out tells the story of Chris who's whisked away for the weekend by his girlfriend so he can meet her parents. His nerves are understandable because aside from the possible awkward and tense first meeting, factoring in their interracial relationship, he doesn't just worry if they'll like him for who he is but also for what he is, an African-American. The feeling of uneasiness never escaped him as later his nervousness is converted to fear for his life when things start to unravel as to what the true purpose of the trip was for.<br/><br/>I browsed the reception of the movie and it's praises all around and is one of the most buzzed about nominee this year. Of it's four nominations (Picture, Actor, Director, Screenplay), I would have to agree most with the Best Actor nod for Daniel Kaluuya who I remember and loved from one of my favorite Black Mirror episodes: '15 Million Merits', and just yesterday hated (in a good way) as W'Kabi in Black Panther. While he won't probably win (there wasn't enough that can be done with the role compared to Timothee Chalamet's Elio or Gary Oldman's Churchill), those scenes were he cries on point just takes your breath away. As for the rest of the nominations, it might just be me but I don't get the extreme love for it, which includes a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I get that it's breaking barriers, the symbolism (some of which I got only after reading up on the movie) but to me it's just another horror movie. Maybe I've seen too much of Blumhouse Production movies such as all Purge installments, Insidious, Sinister and Paranormal Activity that's why I'm lumping it with the rest of them. It might win due to it's popularity but if we're talking overall production, it doesn't hold a spoon (pun intended for those who've seen it) at least against CMBYN and Darkest Hour."
"PotassiumMan","8","20","39","15 February 2018"," Not really a horror film, more like a thriller with a very insolent sense of humor
","Having heard nothing but raves about this film and how scary it is, I caught its return to the theaters. For starters, I'll say this. Get past the first 15-20 minutes, because initially it comes across as cartoonish and obvious and gives no indication of how clever and brash it's going to become. But a sharp soundtrack early on gives a hint of something to come.<br/><br/>This mystery story of a young couple, black man and his white girlfriend meeting the latter's parents in their suburban house quickly sheds its cookie cutter aura and becomes something brazen and ominous as the family members are introduced. The film pulls no punches in landing one stereotypcial gag after another. If you're a politically correct individual who cannot stand any kind of racially-charged digs, this film isn't for you. I found the jokes to be so shameless and the satire so biting, that it made a film about race relations in this day and age seem almost carefree. And although it does have some isolated horror elements, this is a suspense film through and through.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The humor aside, this movie is not afraid to get its hands dirty. But the outrage is really on mute. This is not the kind of film that should stir up strong emotions for the simple reason that it's so escapist and cheerfully juvenile. At the same time, despite its sheer style and witty screenplay, I don't see this film winning Best Picture. Happily recommended."
"framptonhollis","8","20","39","4 February 2018"," intelligent, humorous, scary-a whole lot of fun!
","When I look beyond the obvious race related message the film offers us, I still see an excellent and entertaining modern day movie masterpiece. ""Get Out"" is a creative, unique, and witty movie that I am so happy has gotten Oscar recognition (it's sort of what ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was in 2015 in terms of an unexpected Best Picture nominee) as it will likely lead to more original voices being heard within the mainstream cinema (I can also say the same about many of the other nominees this year, ""The Shape of Water"" and ""Three Billboards"" both being primary examples). The subject matter the film tackles is clearly pretty heavy handed stuff, and is worked into the movie quite well once you get used to it. Racism has almost been used as a cinematic convention at this point, every year there's the new ""racism is bad"" Oscar bait flick, but ""Get Out"" pleases with its subversion of convention, as ""Get Out"" plays provocatively around with genre. At once it works as a mystery-thriller, a horror movie, a comedy, and a drama, and never does a tonal shift feel wrong or out of place. Everything in this movie serves a genuine purpose, which I have to applaud Jordan Peele on as I know that's not easy for a writer to really do. I mean, this is a brilliantly planned out film, scene by scene it stuns and entertains and the 100 minute run time feels more like a 50 minute run time. Really impressive stuff, and a directorial debut no less!"
"Marc_Israel_365","8","20","39","31 January 2018"," Genre ""Mash Up"" Satisfies
","As one who loves mixing it up musically, such as when ska blended both punk and reggae, I love genre mixing when done with bit of sophistication. In Get Out, you know that you are starting with a horror flick base line by the title. I don't know what other conclusion you could draw from that title. But we rally get more racial tension, relationship arm-twisting, family over-compensation, in a forced racial acceptance plot that are our horror droppings. The fun is that it is supplemented by the reality comedy of the overtness of it all. We go from awkward to uncomfortable to jolted in a round robin of social uneasiness called out by our TSA Agent whom we and his authorities just can't take seriously... until the secret is out. <br/><br/>As in the horror genre, the mythology is what carries the film and that actually suffers here in the exposure scenes. We never get a clear explanation of how the big secret was discovered and how it can actually be accomplished, so save some of the salt from your buttered pop-corn, because you'll need more than a few grains to get past it all!<br/><br/>Most of the acting was rewarding once you figure out what's going on which lets you see the racism to the point of absurdity, which is a main point of the film. Many of us have been the blemish in a white room and the gross conversational techniques to attempt compassion and acceptance can feel like horror movie. Take away that portion of the film and it still holds up.<br/><br/>Random left over thoughts: <br/><br/>Surprisingly, I haven't read any ""Being John Malkovich"" references, and that is besides Catherine Keener, who remains quite a talent here! <br/><br/>How odd that white old folks in bad health look to African Americans as physical specimens yet see them as beneath them in all other ways.<br/><br/>The Director took on a lot and entertained us despite non-traditional ingredients!"
"southdavid","7","20","39","19 January 2018"," Smart genre mingling effort.
","As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing ""Get Out"" several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to. <br/><br/>This is not to say that it's not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it's his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be ""unpeeled"" (pun intended) on repeat viewings. <br/><br/>The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance. <br/><br/>So, what doesn't work as well? Essentially, it's the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It's an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there's been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons. <br/><br/>Provided you're not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, ""Get Out"" is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film."

","Get Out<br/><br/>This movie is a prime example of originality and how to do something fresh with a particular genre.
After viewing this surprisingly good horror flick I proceeded to recommend it to friends and family.
However when asked what it was about I found myself fumbling for an explanation.<br/><br/>Young African American Chris Washington is about to meet his white girlfriends parents for the first time.
Sounds really terrifying doesn't it?
The typical ingredients for any good horror movie?
The blank expression on the persons face as I tell them this proves I'm not doing the film justice.
But perhaps this is the greatest compliment that I can give this film. It is so refreshingly original and unexpected that you will find yourself completely engulfed in the story and how the whole thing plays out.
The film burns slowly but despite this it is never boring. 
Characters are wonderfully developed and each scene subconsciously links you to the next before bringing everything together by the time credits roll.
Whilst this film is never truly terrifying, it is unnerving and uncomfortable to watch.
This is the movies strong point. It is irresistible, you are unable to tare yourself away from the events unfolding onscreen.<br/><br/>There's a good dose of satire here and a strong sense of humour that blends surprisingly well with the more macabre tone of the movie.
Everyone involved puts in stellar performances. Daniel Kaluuya as Chris is a strong lead and LiRel Howery as Rod is fantastic comic relief.
Writer/Director Jordan Peele has crafted a supremely satisfying piece of entertainment.
One that creeps up and grabs the audience without them knowing and never fails to let go.
I think this is one be of the better horror movies of recent times.
Unlike the franchise horror flicks that are continually churned out this movie has a level of intelligence, wit and humour that most horror movies can only dream of."

I know the ending may be too convenient for some - but the moment it happened it was forgiven given the genre he was in. There are indelible scenes in this movie, and that takes a special skill and certainly some luck. I can't imagine how hard it would be to go from an idea and a dream to a grueling work schedule worrying about money and everything else and end up with a massive data base of footage - and then to start working again to create an authentic manifestation of that original idea - just amazing, especially for a first time director.

His usage of facial expression and body language played so well to his character, and in a movie with plenty of good qualities about it he shines.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele also uses a lot of subtle imagery that contributes well to the themes and tone of his story, which is notably impressive especially for a first time director and make for rewarding second, third and maybe even more repeat viewings.<br/><br/>This movie is not without faults however, as there is a handful of times where characters inexplicably act strange seemingly just for the audience, and like most horror movies coming out recently it has it's pointless, shrill music stabs to emphasize a silly jump scare. <br/><br/>Despite it's faults, I would still highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an intriguing story."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This was a unique mix of director intentions. Thriller, comedy, horror, racial views and overall it worked for me. I understand why it doesn't work for some. The suspense and of plot was intriguing. Yes, the social commentary was bop you over the head obvious, yet it was tied into the plot enough I rolled with it. The story kicks off with an interracial couple going to meet the gal's parents for the first time for the weekend. Plot points arise around, what will my parents think? And gosh they have African American servants. How awkward! From there, creepy things start to happen and there are lots of strange racial commentary from assorted characters. Things escalate to the finish with some decent twists, blood and interspersed comedy which is actually amusing. The acting is solid. The main actor is a quality Oscar nominee but the movie is by no means worthy of a Best Picture nod. Overall, it is a fun quality thriller with some gore, well-timed comedic rest moments and an interesting and likely divisive social commentary."

"ryan-bfd","7","16","30","28 May 2017"," A horror movie with a satirical edge.
","Get out is the first movie, that I've seen at least, to take the racial paranoia that is present in our culture and exploit it to make a horror film. And while I was watching this film I began to realize how well Jordan Peele can blend comedy and horror when I was laughing and getting nervous at the same time throughout the film. Jordan does a fantastic job of building tension while also layering the film with his humorous point of view. So that there is an atmosphere of satire all throughout the film. I also have to respect that this is not an easy film to write, given the touchy subject matter. It could have very easily come out as racist or ignorant, however the comical undertones gave the film a tongue-and-cheek sort of vibe. And the paranoia I experienced in this film is actually one that is prevalent in our culture today. And even if the racial subject matter is very touchy, horror is not supposed to be kind towards our sensibilities, it is supposed to take something that scares us in real life and escalate it so that it can horrify an audience for around two hours. This one just happened to have a nice satirical edge to it. However, the film did feel short to me. There were some major plot holes in the film. One phenomena involving a phone that contributes to the plot in a big way is never explained. The twist in the film is very entertaining. However after the twist the story feels kind of rushed. There does not seem to be any sense of patience or building tension. It is more of just a transition from a horror movie to, all of the sudden, an action movie. I would have liked it to be longer. There is a lot of potential for more material in the film. The directing in the film is really eerie and well executed. I get kind of a Hitchcockian vibe from his directing style. There may be some influence from John Carpenter in there, which is hilarious given the satirical nature if the film. I did not expect Jordan to come off as such a seasoned filmmaker. He proves that he has a knack for bringing work to the big screen and I look forward to seeing more work from Jordan in the future. Less Keanu, more of this!"

","'Get Out' is billed as a horror film, but - no spoilers in this review! - it's really more of a mystery/tense thriller. It's shot really well and looks great (nice effort from first-time director Peele), with some smart use of the Alabama location and a good score. The premise is purposefully cryptic: ""African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate"". Chris (Kaluuya) is meeting Rose (Williams) parents - Missy (Keener) & Dean (Whitford) - for the first time, and they welcome him with open arms, even if the servants seem off.<br/><br/>It's not all about race, but it is a key aspect of the film and handled quite well. The two leads easily carry the film, both having some great scenes. However, the best bits are probably whenever Chris' friend Rod (Howery) is on screen, being hilarious and boisterous, even though often by phone. The humour and some slow bits do well to make the surprises seem even more shocking.<br/><br/>The twist isn't as big as 'Cabin in the Woods' or 'The Sixth Sense', but the final 20min is certainly one of the better endings to a thriller/horror film you'll see for a while! Bit of a slow build up in parts, but a very exciting finish and it's all over in 100min."

","Get Out Directed by Jordan Peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story, surrounding an African American man meeting his girlfriend's Caucasian family. The first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension. The start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown. I really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off. All the performances were great, particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion. Also the cinematography was very nice, containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts. As for negatives there are quite a few. The tone of this film is very messy. I wished the horror really got under my skin. Although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief. To me this broke all the tension, and really made me question the type of film I was watching. There are also quite a few plot holes, and scenes which really don't have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience. Once the film reaches the third act, I was really let down by the direction they took. I was expecting a smart and unique revelation. But all I got was a standard messed up horror movie ""twist"". I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket. I really thought this movie would be insanely smart, but honestly it's really not that special. It didn't impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have. It's a solid and enjoyable film. But it's far from groundbreaking, so therefore I give Get Out a 6. I feel like many will disagree with my rating. If you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead. One thing I still don't see is why African Americans were targeted in the film. When it was asked the question was just brushed off..."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are a mixed race couple, who are travelling to meet Rose's parents, Missy (Catherine Keener) and Dean (Bradley Whitford), a retired neuro-surgeon, for the weekend. While they seem fairly nice, Chris can't help but pick up loads of subtle little knocks at his African American heritage (most notably, learning Dean's grandfather was robbed of his dream at the 1936 Olympics by Jesse Owens.) One night, Missy puts Chris under a teacup induced hypnotic trance, and from there he finds himself plunged into a series of increasingly twisted events, from which he ends up battling for survival.<br/><br/>The horror genre is in a pretty desperate state of affairs at the moment, certainly not a patch on its heyday twenty/thirty years ago. When they're not remaking old classics, they're just making films that rely on cheap jump scares in place of anything that really gets under your skin. And so, it's a really nice surprise when something like Get Out comes along, which gives you faith that there's still life in the old dog yet. First time director Jordan Peele gets back to basics with what traditionally made the genre so great, in a film that's also from the producers of such hits as Insidious and The Gift.<br/><br/>Peele understands that a creepy air of mystery and a foreboding sense of the unknown are far more effective tools than cheap shocks and gore, and what works in Get Out's favour so well is a genuinely intriguing and exciting story that really leaves you wondering what is going on, when it will kick off and how it will all work out. It's brave, as well, tackling the themes of an inter-racial relationship in the modern world, and constructing one of the most paranoid and outlandish reasons for what could be behind it. There's some light and humour, as well, with subtle little digs and nods thrown in that few will be unlikely to pick up on.<br/><br/>As a horror fan, this emerges as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner. *****"
"siderite","10","22","44","24 January 2018"," Whatever you do, do not watch the trailers or read the reviews before you see it
","There was enormous hype surrounding this film, which is the main reason I watched it, but also the main reason why I felt uncomfortable watching it for a long time before that. If you are reading this, it's probably too late to not watch the trailer or read the commentaries on it, but I am warning you anyway. Because it is a racially loaded film, there are a lot of people who focus on that for some reason. Also, while I gave it a full ten stars, this is compared to other thrillers, not movies in general.<br/><br/> That said, the film is a slow paced thriller. Things start cool, then they get weirder and weirder until the final climax. The story is ingenious, but nothing you haven't seen before in such movies. What I found interesting was the acting, the direction and the script, so all the qualities that I enjoy in a movie. Jordan Peele obviously did a good job, but Daniel Kaluuya (my man) hit all the right notes. The hallmark of a good thriller (perhaps of any genre) is that it has a main character that you can relate to, and ""Chris Washington"" did all the things I believe a normal person would do in that situation.<br/><br/> What this film did not have: jump scares (well, they had one, but it was at the beginning and I can forgive it), group of friends building fear off each other, people that behave dumb, hysterical or malevolent just to make the story less boring, a predictable script. Well, it was kind of predictable, but I'd read the reviews, hence my warning. The story also lends itself to nice prequels and even sequels, but I think it said what it was set to say. I also liked that they didn't try to explain it too much: stuff just happens and it's the point of view of the lead character that takes precedence over everything else, while the role of the viewer is to interpret it as they see fit.<br/><br/> What could have gone better: editing out the scene at the beginning with the other black guy. <br/><br/> Bottom line: a nail-biting success. Worth watching. Also, check out the alternate ending of the movie, that is roaming the Internet out there."

Once the pieces come together, it's easy to see why the film was given its title.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is not without its comical moments especially stupid comments from well-meaning ""good, white liberals"" which peak at a massive garden-party-from-hell. As a modern psychological horror-thriller with an unique perspective on racism, it's easy to see why ""Get Out"" has earned so much recognition during the current awards season.

"lasttimeisaw","7","15","28","5 June 2017"," a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting
","An unheralded cash cow in its domestic revenue and also a succès d'estime, USA black comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut GET OUT rides on the coattail of the racial powder keg in the current USA soil, conjures up a well-conceived conspiracy theory married with an aroused scenario taking the leaf from the time-tested suburbia genre book, a close cousin is Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIFES, and enlivens its central story with robust horror tropes pulsating in a bracing beat. <br/><br/>Our virile hero is Chris Washington (Kaluuya), a black photographer who is going to meet his white girlfriend Rose Armitage's (Williams) family for the first time. What Chris encounters is not the hostile racism usually presides within uncouth hillbillies or religious-poisoned happy clappies, instead, in this close-knit WASP community, what lurks around is something much more sinister and beyond one's wildest imagination. The overt clue is the aberrant behaviors of the black servants living with the Armitages: the housekeeper Georgina (Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Henderson). At first glance, Peele seems to dangle viewers with a more conventional reference of slavery, but correlating with the film's unsettling prologue of abducting a black man Andrew Hayworth (Stanfield) in the same neighborhood, a sober mind suggests that we cannot take the situation for granted, certainly, something is wrong with the black people on the lot, they are not themselves, but the voodoo in the mix hits more on the mark of deep-rooted illusion of immortality than the ostensible white supremacy, there is a nuanced overtone even eulogizing black race's vitality as the perfect human specimen, meanwhile the main trope vouchsafes what lies beneath is the turpitude of extreme selfishness which deprives others of their identity (brain) for one's own sake, a metaphor of power-abusing from those privileged few, which is part and parcel of the film's runaway success, viewers cannot help but paralleling it with the current political affairs in the Trump era - life can be a sick joke. <br/><br/>Artistically speaking, Peele rounds up a coherent (albeit improbable) story arc within its suburbia milieu, an estate is quietly ensconced with quaint Americana, a retro luster contradicts the young couple's modernist urbanity. From that symbolic deer-in-the-headlight accident to the para-psychic hypnosis, to a superbly and literally devised sunken place (evoking the murky other-worldliness in Jonathan Glazer's UNDER THE SKIN 2013), until the mandatory but still engrossing bailing-out killing spree, GET OUT treads circumspectly through the familiar ground without overdosing in the wantonness of its cock and bull story. <br/><br/>Credits should fairly given to a capable cast, Daniel Kaluuya makes for a straight-up hero with gaping intensity, and Allison Williams capitalizes in Rose's about-face veracity to a bone-chilling effect. LilRel Howery as Chris' best friend, a TSA officer, stands out as the comic foil and a mouthpiece of inappropriate one-liners, and an openly hearty Bradley Whitford, a beguilingly frosty Catherine Keener and a delirious Caleb Landry Jones, rounds out an unsettling dysfunctional family, last but not the least, Betty Gabriel, arguably leaves the most bizarre impression perfectly in line with the thematic out-of-body creepiness. <br/><br/>For all its hype and buzz, GET OUT benefits greatly from its timing and present-day context, plus a genuinely appealing wheeze of identity-swapping. A miracle-maker borne out of an above-average commodity that no one should begrudge for its success, because it excels as a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting, which is dishearteningly wanting in most wide-opening theatrical staples, especially at a dejected time like this."

","'Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.<br/><br/>High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.<br/><br/>It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread. <br/><br/>That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes. <br/><br/>Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively. <br/><br/>Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still. <br/><br/>While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most. <br/><br/>My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note. <br/><br/>Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

"Coventry","8","24","49","2 March 2018"," What's happening here? This doesn't feel right!
","I've been a fan of horror movies and thrillers ever since I figured out how the TV worked. Always preferred older movies but also always kept my eyes and mind open for new instant classics. The problem is that so very few REALLY good horror movies come out nowadays, and when I read exaggeratedly praising and positive reviews about an alleged new masterpiece, I automatically become skeptical. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" was such an example. Literally everybody, acclaimed critics as well as ordinary mainstream audiences, was mad-raving enthusiast about ""Get Out"" and now it's even nominated for several Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay! I honestly must admit I never expected that a film like this would ever become nominated for the most important categories in such a hypocrite and predetermined contest for the elite. It'll never win, of course, but still. <br/><br/>It must be underlined that ""Get Out"" isn't groundbreakingly original, extremely intelligent or a genuine masterwork of scripting. There are, however, many things that the film - and the debuting director Jordan Peele in particular - does exceptionally well. First and foremost, the atmosphere! Although not featuring any graphic violence for the largest part of the film, the atmosphere is continuously ominous and hinting at something dreadful that can occur at any given moment. There's only a very selected number of classic horror films that uphold the ""there's something terribly wrong here"" sentiment for so long, and it provides ""Get Out"" with the same unique vibe as pure classics like ""Seconds"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""The Stepford Wives"" (the 1975 original, of course, not the idiotic Nicole Kidman remake). Secondly, you just cannot surpass Peele's truly unsurpassable approach of racial differences! Without explicitly mentioning about racial tension or introducing obviously racist characters, Peele shows that racial segregation is irreversibly integrated in our modern day social culture. This aspect of ""Get Out"" is indescribably unique, in fact. The harder the protagonists try to profile themselves as anti-racist, the more uncomfortable you get with them. Equally brilliant in this domain are the setting, costumes and tiny little details. The word ""slavery"" is never said out loud, yet look at the Armitage mansion, the style of their household staff and the crucial role of cotton at a certain point. Thirdly, and this is a joint effort with the ensemble cast, the performances in ""Get Out"" are extremely high standard. Atypical role or not, Daniel Kaluuya truly deserves the Best Actor nomination for his depiction of the insecure, skeptical and visibly petrified Chris Washington. <br/><br/>What's the story about, then? Well, I'm convinced that ""Get Out"" is one of those films for which they invented the rule of: ""the less you know the better"". Personally, I think that even rudimentary elements like the title or the cast list already reveal too much. If I was Jordan Peele, I would have named the film ""What is happening here?"" or ""This doesn't feel right"", but of course I respect their choice from a marketing point of view. I'm well aware of the fact that most reviews provide at least a brief synopsis or hint at vital twists in the third act, but my advice is to know as little as possible before you watch. I can't finish the review without mentioning that ""Get Out"" isn't flawless. Notably the comic relief aspect, provided mainly by Lil Rel Howery , isn't the least bit impressive and even somewhat misplaced. In a way, Jordan Peele is guilty of racial stereotyping himself with this, although I reckon it was a deliberate choice. He's a comedian, after all."
"liamsroberts","9","24","49","12 January 2018"," A Great Debut Film
","This film is a great example of a debut film. The director and writer of this film, Jordan Peele, originally worked on the show Key and Peele that was a sketch comedy show, so this film was big step for his career and I won't be surprised to see more of him in the future. What makes this film stand out is the take on the subject. It is a subject that many movies focus on but the way that this film presents it makes this film different. The lead performance by Daniel Kaluuya is excellent. It is a very subtle performance and when you learn about his backstory you really latch on to him, which is why the ending is a very satisfying end. The side performances by Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford and LilRel Howery are also very good. This film also has small details that you don't get the first time you see the film. Like the main theme of the film is sung in a different language but translate to lyrics like ""Brother, listen to the ancestors, run!"". Or when Chris and Rose are talking to a police officer and when the officer asks to see Chris' ID Rose rejects the officer so that she doesn't get questioned after they find out that Chris has gone missing. There is also an alternate ending to this film where the police arrive instead of Rod and so he gets arrested. Then it cuts to 6 months later and Rod visits Chris at the prison that is in. When Rod talks to Chris about how there is not evidence, Chris responds ""I'm good, I stopped it."" What he means is that he stopped his inner demon from overtaking him when he hit Georgina with the car. He didn't do nothing, instead he went out and took her into the car. He also tells Rod to stop asking him about the incident at the Armitage's house. I actually like this ending more than the theatrical ending, it gives you a feel of catharsis where the other ending, which is also very good, is a more happy ending where Rod picks up Chris on the road. My only issue with this movie is that there are times where it goes from a comedic tone to a very serious tone very quickly at times. Like at the end where Rod gets Chris and the thing that he says is for comedy, and I wish he acted more serious because Chris was just shot at, witnessed a suicide and tried to choke his former girlfriend. Other than that this movie is great and I wish I had seen it back when it was in theatres."

"indioblack117","10","18","35","28 February 2018"," A movie to watch cold
","Excellent film if you're coming at it cold. Fortunately, a friend recommended it to me, but warned me not to read anything about it beforehand. Good warning. Essential warning because the IMDB page has it's own spoiler in plain sight: ""Plot Keywords: hypnosis, brain surgery "". 
The movie is beautifully shot; pleasant laid back opening about boyfriend going to meet girlfriend's parents. Then it starts to get a little bit unsettling. So basically, all been done before, but this is nicely done, and has a crowd-pleasing finale, which would have pleased me even more if he'd caved her head in with the rifle butt, but that's just a personal observation.
So, after watching the film, I decided to read the IMDB trivia and was stunned that I'd just been watching a movie about white oppression of blacks, and never realised. Oh yeah, the lead guy is black. I was still rooting for him. That's what you do when watching movies, you root for the lead guy. So when he goes to meet her parents (she's white, by the way) he's a bit nervous. A bit nervous, like any guy is when going to meet the girlfriend's parents, and then the rest of the family come round and some are a bit weird. We've all been there; Black or White. I might have thought the boyfriend was being a bit racist when he sought out the other black guy at the garden party, but then people tend to gravitate to people they feel they can connect with, rather than to people they can't, so no racism there.
Apparently most white people think the girlfriend must have been drugged or hypnotised to do what she did. Hell no: she's evil. That's why I wanted the boyfriend to stove her head in.
Anyway, if her folks are white supremacists (as the trivia suggests) why the heck would they want to transplant their parents' brains and the brains of their friends into black bodies?
""Whoa, get me a white body, man, because I'm a white supremacist"". 
I do get tired of the cliche of some bad guy being beaten over the head twice, and then he turns up later to attack the hero again. Hit him three times, man. Then five more.
And by the way, if you're going to do a brain transplant, you remove the host-body brain first, so that the transplant brain remains fresher. But then that wouldn't have given the boyfriend time to escape.
Next time lets' have a movie about a White guy going to meet his Black girlfriend's parents.
And then hear the howls about a movie badmouthing Black families.
The friend-of-hero is brilliant. A great comic turn, which leads to the greatest scene in the movie, where he tries to explain to a police woman that he thinks his friend has been abducted to be a sex slave, and she calls her superiors round, and then they all listen to the story again. There's a beat and then they all fall about laughing. Brilliant. For that scene, this is a 10/10 movie. Shame I read the trivia."
"Mike_Devine","7","18","35","1 January 2018"," Peele proves his versatility in 'Get Out'
","In 2017, Jordan Peele proved he's not a one-trick pony when it comes to his career. When not playing all kinds of various characters on his Comedy Central series 'Key & Peele,' he lately has starred in mostly lower-tiered comedy movies. Then came 'Get Out' - Universal and Blumhouse's terrifying psychological thriller that was written and directed by Peele. The film follows the story of a young couple who happen to be mixed race (Daniel Kaluuya as ""Chris"" and Allison Williams as ""Rose"") who take a weekend trip to visit her parents' estate in the country.<br/><br/>What's expected about 'Get Out' is the major emphasis on race, as Rose's family (and extended family) is virtually entirely white, and their two hired support staff, Georgina and Walter (Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson), are black. As Chris begins to learn more about his girlfriend's family as he spends more time with them, he realizes things are not exactly what meets the eye. While some films mishandle the issue of race relations, 'Get Out' is written in a way that seems fair and doesn't spend too much time on stereotypes. But make no mistake - there is a lot more at play than race in this film.<br/><br/>The themes of guilt and regret have a central role in 'Get Out,' including references to characters' pasts (especially with regard to Chris and his upbringing). What helps these feel authentic is the excellent character development and acting performances, not only by newcomers Kaluuya and Williams, but veteran actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are standouts as Rose's parents. They are complicated individuals and things become clearer as the film progresses, but they never lose their edge as we drift into ""the sunken place."" And then there's LilRel Howery, who portrays Chris' TSA agent friend Rod Williams. Rod's character is definitely the film's attempt at comic relief - and for the most part, he delivers without making things seem too cheesy or out of place.<br/><br/>The only issue with 'Get Out' is the final third of the film, which seems to follow a typical formula. Despite the adrenaline rush that results, there are flashes of a ""seen it before"" feeling in some of the final moments. Even so, this does not really take away from the overall effort.<br/><br/>Based on the runaway success of 'Get Out,' it's likely Jordan Peele has a future in directing and writing rather than just offering up laughs."
"ggraupepillard","8","18","35","31 December 2017"," Definitely worth seeing GET OUT
","GET OUT directed by Jordan Peele is like no other film that I have ever seen; not a conventional comedy, nor a conventional horror movie - but rather a trenchant psychological thriller about black/white relations incorporating myth, history, and racial symbolism resulting in an intelligent, profoundly moving fable. GET OUT opens with an abduction of an innocent young black man who is lost, aimlessly searching for an address on a quiet suburban street in the dark of night - this one abbreviated cinematic moment encapsulates years of racial violence, forecasting what lies ahead for the viewer.<br/><br/>We witness a young couple who appear to be disarmingly happy - a young African American man Chris Washington (an excellent Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (a lovely Allison Williams) packing in preparation for a visit to her parent's home in the suburbs. Once they are in the car leaving the city they allegorically cross a ""color line"" and the mystery and tension mounts with baleful incidents that augur a grim future.<br/><br/>When they arrive at their destination, we observe in the behavior towards Chris, a cool veneer that is draped over each character like a shroud of duplicity, particular Rose's ""liberal"" parents (the wonderful Catherine Keener as her mother Missy) along with a groups of friends who are invited to an annual lawn party. Each character is satirically delineated with a familiarity that betrays their inner bigotry. GET OUT is so biting that the ensuing marks claw deeply under our skins. <br/><br/>Jordan Peele (formerly of Key and Peele) in his directorial debut makes memorable use of his powerful comedic skill, but this time we do not laugh with joy, but we drown in the despair of a modern-day allegory of stereotypical attitudes and conspiratorial stratagems towards Afro-Americans that are as original and devastating as a science-fiction tale."

"rblenheim","9","21","42","8 March 2018"," Not what it first appears to be -- and an instant classic!
","It was my second viewing of Jordan Peele's independent little film, ""Get Out"", that grabbed me. On my first viewing I was lulled into complacency while lazily taking in the first half of the film, the kind of complacency the film ultimately squelches. I had conveniently forgotten the short pre-credit sequence of a casual black man walking through a white suburb at night being struck and abducted into the trunk of a car. Everybody does, and when it catches up with you, you know it. Previously a comedian, this is writer/director/producer Peele's directorial debut, and he gives us the African-American nastiness of a Hitchcock, palming his aces to play in the last half hour of the film with the relish of the Master. The set up: a young black man is pressured by his white girlfriend into meeting her parents by spending a weekend at their secluded estate in the woods. What follows is a gradual descent into nightmare as he intermingles with upper class white liberals who bring out the paranoia in him - or do they have their own agenda? (Remember even paranoids have real enemies.) <br/><br/>Watching this film might enlighten white liberals like myself by forcing us to experience what black people have felt for years in our company (let alone among white conservative racists!), but the film goes much further than one might imagine, even taking the form of a horror fable encompassing not just racial themes but also serving as an uncompromisingly astute societal dissection. Shot in a mere 23 days, Jordan Peele has done something really special here: an engrossing thriller that also bravely delves into important issues, issues that Peele himself has had to deal with personally: e.g., the marginalizing of African-Americans (""No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us,"" Peele says). But don't get me wrong: This is a work of entertainment, not a 'message' film -- and that's all to the good."

The plot to the movie was easy to guess, the hypnosis and the surgery where added for a sense of mystery but fell flat when you realised it was a stepford wives but for black people movie. <br/><br/>Honestly this movie did nothing but show, whites bad and black people good. <br/><br/>Poor show- it gets two stars purely for the TSA character, he had me laughing, the rest however was laughable."

","Get Out is one of the best horror/thriller movies I have seen in a while. I love the balance between the horror in the movie and the momentary humor with the Rod Williams (Chris' police officer friend) and taking the edge off without taking away the horror from the movie. The way that the movie starts off with a very mysterious kidnapping and with redone by childish gambino playing at the start of the movie really sets an ere, offsetting mood to start off. The offsetting and suspenseful mood that keeps you guessing what will happen. 
With the two endings created I actually liked the one that wasn't used more than the other. The one that wasn't used that ends up with Chris killing Rose at the end and having the police catch him and ends up with him in jail. the satisfaction that although Chris is locked up, he has defeated his inner demon. Although this ending is not exactly a happy one like the one used in the final movie it is more realistic and lets you have the feeling of the world not being fair."
"theobarton","8","14","26","12 January 2018"," A good movie with Tension
","Personally I liked the movie ""Get Out"". The plot of the film has an exciting process that never lets the groom know what's going to happen next. In the film, the director has the shots and angles well thought over. Most scenes have a special transition, which provides the viewer with a better insight into the film. The tension of the film increases over time, which ensures that you wanna know what happen next. I think the normal end of the film is unexpected and not very realistic, which made me think about it later on the film.
The other variant of the end, I liked better, although it is a sadder end. In both scenes there was help at the last moment, all the people who survived were the same as in the other scene.
A good movie for people who want to have a good tension of a movie"

The begging was very calm and seemed like it was going to movie about a family reunion. I was wrong! As soon as The couple got in the car the movie took a turn. Once they arrived at Rose's family home we meet her parents, brother and the maid that work for the family. Something seems off with the maids and this makes Chris uncomfortable . As the trip continues, Rose's family starts to arrive and Chris notices they are all white. The only African American people are the maid and Chris. Once the family leaves weird things start to happen and Chris decides they have to leave. The Family turns against Chris and tries to brain wash him. This movie was not what Expected it to be.

"mattjseed","9","14","26","10 January 2018"," Tense and suspenseful fun
","I don't like horror movies. I choose to avoid them if at all possible, but that doesn't mean I haven't seen some of the best ones. The exorcist, Halloween, the Blair witch project, the shinning and the sixth sense are all movies I have seen. I respect them all A's movies and don't dislike them per say but the genre in general just isn't my cup of tea. Not that I am scared by any of them they just don't appeal to me for other reasons.
However get out broke down my defences and gave me one of the best movie experiences I had all year. I went into this movie blind except for the knowledge that this was a horror movie. 
Right out of the gate the suspense for this movie builds as soon as he gets to the house. The movie does a great job of making regular dialogue ominous and meaningful. The movie stays suspenseful up until the the finale. Throughout this suspense you are left to try and figure what it is that is exactly going on. You get small hints and clues throughout each leaving you a bit more on edge. 
Before I talk about the finale I think I need to address the race element that plays a massive role in the movie and likely is a deciding factor to whether you like it or not. I've seen some people feel attacked by this movie which I think is unfair. Whether you think the message is true or not you can't hate the artistic side of it for that. I personally think the whole ""so not racist it's racist"" message is a good one and I think the movie makes an effort to show that this isn't all white people. Despite whether you hate this message or not you can't let it take away from the high level directing and writing exhibited in all the scenes. Especially the dialogue. 
Now on to the finale. This was pure cathartic tense action up until the last. Seeing the people who were using other humans as bodies being killed was somewhat relaxing in a sort kill bill sort of way. 
I saw both endings for this movie and I have to say I much prefer the ending where Rod comes to the rescue rather than the police. This ending makes everything that happened before it more satisfying. I am also a sucker for happy endings. Sure the police ending was more realistic but I don't watch these kinds of movies for realism. Besides the whole brain transplant completely shattered that illusion already."
"linneachute","7","14","26","9 January 2018"," Review of Get Out
","The movie Get Out covers an interesting side to horror films. This movie isn't just basic horror it is a psychological thriller. The writer Jordan Peele creates a whole new world of horror by not creating the movie to be about the supernatural but about the horror of racism. Get Out covers how some people used to see black people as objects. This movie creates a motion of what caucasian people have done wrong. The way John Peele develops this into a plot to a ""horror"" film is outstanding."

"jakemeandi","1","7","11","24 January 2018"," I created an account to revolt -sorry- I meant review this movie
","I will briefly describe the basic values that elevate a movie from just being bytes on a medium, to an over the screen experience. The reason I am doing so, is to contradict exactly what ""Get Out"" undoubtedly is not. And what ""Get Out"" undoubtedly is NOT, is a good movie in any sense whatsoever. I will be brief and avoid any kind of spoilers, as my intention is not to prevent people from watching the movie, it is to keep the light of hope lit.. That people will start watching -not looking.. thinking and processing -not accepting, forming opinions -not adopting the ones for sale..
-Predictability- 
A good movie should not be predictable. It should drag you into the created background and guide you through the story without knowing what the upcoming events would be. By watching ""Get Out"" for just 10 minutes, I knew... Exactly what would follow.. Every scene was a spoiler to the next one, every dialogue was an insult to any point of Intelligence quotient that the viewer -a Human Being (the supposedly most intelligent creature on the third planet that orbits around the Sun) - may have.
-Cliché-
A definition of 'Cliche', would be the overuse of an element,expression or idea, to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of becoming trite or irritating.. The words written above, just described the whole movie. All cliches where gathered, polished and submitted, in a way that their sole successful contribution, is making the movie even more predictable, and ultimately insulting, to any political animal with the power of moral reasoning.
-Meaning-
Where some movies excelled and ensured their passage from past participle to present continuous, is their underlying meaning, or message left for the viewers to pick up, process and interpret. If I do pick up, process and interpret the 'meaning' of ""Get Out"", what I am left with is the notion that Caucasian humans have nocturnal souls. And all those Caucasian nocturnal souls, are boiling in vengeful lust that transforms into relentless viciousness explicitly appointed towards people with darker color of skin. If racism would be fitted in a sentence, it would be awfully similar to the one above.The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to their race. This movie is racism. It is against equality, it is against atonement, evolution and progress. <br/><br/>I could keep expressing my personal opinion why ""Get Out"" is an insult to intelligence, yet I will not. I would not write this review under normal circumstances and keep people to oblivion, but I just found out that this 'movie' is nominated for a plethora of Oscar's, and it hurt every single brain cell residing in my cranial cavity. Please, watch this movie.. But really watch.. Think, process.. And keep in mind.. That we sometimes have to live up to the fact we are the creature with the most processing power contained in a magnificent instrument called the brain."
"eab-02464","10","23","47","12 March 2018"," A Legendary Debut for Jordan Peele
","I have only watched Get Out once before, and having watched it a second time now, I have all the tools I need to review this movie. Get Out is a movie that addresses many aspects of society most importantly racism. Get Out starts with showing a dating couple, and immediately the fact that the couple is interracial pops out at you. It might seem racist to say that but that is first my impression of the movie. This impression sets the tone of the movie for the race issues that follow. The meat of the story takes place in the household of Rose's parents, the Armitages. Rose and her boyfriend Chris, the protagonist, head up to her parents place for the weekend and the plot quickly darkens and thickens. In a predominantly white family, there are numerous black men and women. As we meet each black man or woman, it becomes more and more apparent that Chris is in a trap. As the movie goes on from here, it turns itself into a masterpiece. I remember cheering very loud in the theater with the victory of Chris. This movie is definitely a crowd pleaser. However, having now watched it twice, I would like to say that it doesn't get better the second time around. I know there are some movies like that, but this one is not. The first experience (especially in a theater) is worlds better than the second because of all the surprises and twists. I highly recommend watching this movie because it is a solid horror/thriller. It takes such an innovative approach with the cinematography and creative satire in a horror film. The acting and script fit so well together. I don't recall seeing Daniel Kaluuya in any other roles before, but I feel like he knocked this role out of the park. Watching this movie twice over, I did not think once to critic the actor's acting because their acting was that real. The script was masterful with moments that had you on the edge of your seat. The moment where (spoiler alert) Rose Armitage completely changes character against Chris is such a strong moment that gives the audience the chills. Each eerie scene leading up to the big shabang adds to the experience. To top it all off the big shabang does not disappoint by any means. The final moments might be the most climactic, exciting ending I've ever experienced. I hope for everyone to watch this movie because I remember leaving the movie feeling like I just watched the best movie ever.
 
I feel like the only downfall to this movie is that it is a crowd pleaser and not a critic pleaser. When critics look at this movie, they see a wannabe horror film and a wannabe thriller and a wannabe comedy. The review I read that showed me this was helpful because it showed good points and bad points about the movie. I don't like when reviews about decent movies are all bad or all good because they leave out so much by describing only one side of the movie. The good part of this review is what I completely agree with. This reviewer gave credit to Daniel Kaluuya for a great first big performance in a movie. An actor any less talented than Daniel Kaluuya would have hurt the film immensely. Kaluuya had a big shoe to fill and he certainly stepped up to the challenge. The negative part of this review that the writer emphasized most was that ""Get Out"" did not have an identity. I agree with this but I also don't see it as a factor that would bring down the movies ratings. There are so many different aspects of a horror, comedy, and drama film that all come together so perfectly in Get Out. If these didn't come together so perfectly, the lack of identity would certainly hurt the film but, because it does come together perfectly, the lack of identity makes the film all the better. The fact that this ""Get Out"" has so many aspects of other movies makes it such a masterpiece. If you watch this movie just for the experience not to critic it, you will find that it is a magical mystery that will blow your mind. Bravo to Jordan Peele for such a successful first movie."

Words can not convey just grief stricken and tortured I was knowing that once again the Academy Awards were going to gift accolades to white film makers once again damaged me mentally . emotionally and physically. Thankfully all this was cured when MOONLIGHT won the Best Picture this year. All the world's wrongs had now been righted in what must be the most important event ever since the big bang 13.8 billion years ago. Now the only thing bothering me is that every time I watch a horror thriller is that the token black character gets bumped off early. Along comes GET OUT which has received universal praise and features a black director/screenwriter in Jordan Peele and stars black actor Daniel Kaluuya so there's no way a clichéd thriller where the first scene features a token black character getting killed <br/><br/>!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! <br/><br/>So the first scene features a black man walking along a dark lonely street .. Then he's attacked. I suppose this is an example of post modernism? Thankfully this is more than tokenism because we're introduced to the main character Chris Washington who is African American and has a white girlfriend Rose who drives him to her middle class WASP parents home. There's two things that can happen at this scenario. One is the middle WASP class parents slam the door in their face and disown their daughter. The other scenario is boyfriend is greeted as a respected new addition to the household and he soon wishes the parents had slammed the door in his face <br/><br/>To be fair to Jordan Peele he has made a fairly effective and enjoyable tongue in cheek horror thriller. The only thing he can be criticised for is that the polite middle class White Anglo Saxon Protestant characters constantly reminded me a little too much of THE STEPFORD WIVES. Apart from that it's an entertaining film. The downside is that it's really nothing more than that and I'm slightly surprised as well as puzzled by the hype and acclaim surrounding GET OUT. It goes without saying that the hype works against. Watch the film but don't expect a masterwork of cinema otherwise you'll be left with a feeling of disappointment"

But even if you're actively racist, republican, hate america or whatever I find it hard to believe you would not find a little charm in this incredible thriller
First of all, the characters make a great job hiding their dark side. You see a typical white family, upper-middle class, kind of rich and their black servants. Both the parents, especially the father try to get along with their daughter's new 'catch'. Dean also says several times the typical white 'I'm not racist I voted for Obama' just to seem friendly and appealing to Chris. The fact that the neurosurgeon dad's father was a runner and got beaten by Owens in 1936 adds a certain racial spice in it
The racial topic that this movie puts in light is very controversial and hard to deal with. Just think about how could anyone do a movie in 2017 about slave trade of black people between rich white families. Peele has made a lot of sketches where this topic is at the center of the joke and served the message in a very ellegant way
 A frightening realistic thriller, A philosophical view on hypnotisations, dreams, childhood traumas, and most of all racism and slavery. Even if you don't care about the message, the movie can give you a great experience and a lot of chills"

Her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is a douche bag. They have a neighborhood get-together. It starts with some awkward comments. There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.<br/><br/>This is a surprising project from comedian Jordan Peele. He's injecting a fresh take on the horror genre. It is tackling racism from a new perspective. It would be nice to have Chris and Rose in the regular world in the beginning to set a baseline with their black friends.

It's still a very effective horror satire of the modern world.<br/><br/>***** spoilers *****<br/><br/>The brain transplanting is problematic for me.

I liked the movie, a lot. Horror? It is in a certain way. Racism, of course. It is an American movie with Southern story background, come on, this is like American clichÃ© right there. But it is OK. We all know how races is a big deal in the US. It is maybe the only country where you are forced to think you have a race. I mean, let's not hypocrites here but in the US, it really matters. It is like people are curious to know what mix have you been blended with? Get some white, black, Asian...put in the blender and ... there you are!!

","This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining."

The written dialog feels like it was written right before a high school freshman English class by a C student who forgot to do their homework. Calling this a horror movie is an insult to the genera.

","Sidney Poitier would have had his work cut out for him confronting the band of ""enlightened"" upscale Caucasoid suburbanites found in Get Out, a well paced dark comic horror film by Jordan Peele. Expecting a skeptical Tracy and Hepburn the hero goes from Sid to Duane Jones, Ben in Night of the Living Dead instead.<br/><br/>Promising photographer Chris and Kathy are off for a weekend to meet the parents in upstate NY. Chris a little edgy over the fact the parents are unaware of his racial make-up has these fears extinguished momentarily in their initial meeting as they attempt to make him at ease with cringing patronizing. Chris soon begins to see some strange behavior in the help and when he allows Kath's mom, a shrink to put him under hypnosis for his smoking habit the wheels really start to come off.<br/><br/>Auteur Peel maintains a decent balance of shock and laughter throughout Out with judicious editing and a touch of Bernhard Hermann score as protagonist Chris begins to get the feeling he's in this situation on his own. Things do become farcical eventually but not before Peele exhausts the subtle creepy undertone that energizes the film.<br/><br/>Dan Kayuuya's Chris as the much put upon hero takes it up a notch for a horror film conveying some intense desperation against a family out to get him. Allison Williams as his duplicitous girlfriend is chilling in more than one scene while Betty Gabriel as housekeeper Georgina offers up a few with a startling presence. <br/><br/>Get Out is an entertaining and well crafted horror for first timer Peele that certainly merits attention his next time out."

An odd ball from the writers which seems to be aimed at pleasing specific audiences.)<br/><br/>Besides that there are many logical flaws(so many people were abducted and Chris is the first one that has a friend look for him??

","I am not going to spoil the fun for anyone who has yet to engage in this cinematic treat! The first I heard of it was during the Oscars show on March 4th--Jordan Peele wrote, directed & produced an Oscar-nominated movie? Where have I been, in a cave? Well, sort of, yes...I don't hang out much on social media, and I've been watching commercial-free on-demand shows for quite some time. And since the wildfires destroyed my home in northern California in the wee hours of October 9th, I haven't been in the movie market!<br/><br/>I had to see this. And now I have to see it again, even though I watched it last night--it's that fun--it's that strange--it's that good! It's the right amount of bizarre. I mean, seriously--these actors who are playing these characters are so perfect, I really want Jordan Peele to hear this virtual applause!!! The casting is great, and the direction made it perfect. I really had no idea what this plot was about. I had not seen a trailer or anything. All I knew is that Jordan Peele, a favorite comedian since Key & Peele have been busting my gut for years, was nominated for a movie that he wrote, directed, and produced. Must see. And wow, it did not disappoint me at all. <br/><br/>The tension built ever so slightly and carefully. The characters showed just the right amount of bizarre--I wasn't sure--is there something wrong with that person? Is there? That was a little odd, okay...that was...I'm not sure. <br/><br/>I loved the reference to ""Eyes Wide Shut""--hilarious!<br/><br/>I was feeling Twilight Zoned. It was like Stepford Wives meshed with The Help. It's so much FUN!!!<br/><br/>I rarely give a movie all 10 stars because most movies do have room for improvement. I gave this movie 9 stars because it is that close to perfection as an artistic expression of oh so much more than its surface--this movie runs very deep in my humble opinion--it made me think very deeply, it is provocative in an enjoyable way, it is metaphorical and philosophical without being preachy or evangelical. Really well done, Mr. Peele! And kudos to the entire cast and crew! Thanks for this gem!"

"bbcranker","9","19","38","6 February 2018"," Masterfully done Independent film
","""A mind is a terrible thing to waste."" Of course we have all heard this one and brushed it off as just another whimsical, inconsequential, cliche tossed around in the maze of social interaction, but there is whole new depth brought to this phrase by Jordan Peele's independent Horror film ""Get out""
 We are met in the film by Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) discussing with his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams); the plans for the weekend stay at his girlfriend's family estate. Immediately the issue of race is involved when Chris asks ""Do they know I'm black?"", which is met with the reassurance of Rose that this won't be an issue. When at the estate, there is nothing intrinsically wrong, but at the same time everything has an odd sense to it. Our nerves are settled with the line ""I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could"", delivered by Rose's father, but our intention is immediately recaptured by the oddity of the groundskeeper trimming the grass with a old school rotary lawn mower. This is completely intentional, and complete genius by Peele, as no other emphasis is put on that mower, but it all gets explained after the big reveal. However, in the time it is just playing into the motif of the horror film.
 This Horror film offers much more than your typical jump scare, and tantalising suspense (though it does those well too). This movie contains layers upon layers of social and racial intentions and stereotypes; but again it portrays these in a rather unusual and original manner. This film takes every right wing social stereotype and completely flips them on its head. Not a single scene nor character in this movie is wasted, they all have a purpose and play an integral part in the storyline, with some playing even double and triple subliminal rolls, unbenounced to the viewer.
 The movie is quick to portray the typical white cop racially profiling a black man, stereotype, but Rose, quick to interject as the hero, intervening and standing up for her boyfriend in the face of the oppressive white cop. At least this is what is shown, and is expected to be interpreted from the scene. Ultimilty it is the viewer that is the one being played a fool, by some tricky double acting, with everything building up to the main reveal. 
 Many family stories and tid bits are shared with Chris, aimed to be portrayed as the awkward stage of meeting someone new and inviting them into your home, but as the pieces fall into place, these interesting tales turn into rather disturbing hints. 
 It isn't until the first night of Chris's stay that the viewer finally gets the first inklings to the threat surrounding Chris. Peele sets this reveal up so brilliantly that even though he is shouting the answers to the viewer, letting everyone know the truth to what is going on; the viewer is not fully convinced, and is still unaware of the intimate danger (or at least I still was). It is all explained and covered up by the answers provided to us by the scene, about Chris's mother and the nightmares he battles from the night she died.
 The subliminal hints dropped through the entirety of the film are perfectly disguised within the context of the film, as to not give too much away before the big reveal. Going into and throughout the course of movie, I was expecting an overtly racist, and simplistic storyline with an intriguing aspect of horror. What I got was entirely different, and masterfully intertwined with the social complexities that exist with minority groups. Rather than taking the typical approach and portraying the racism as a right wing, blatantly racist film, Peele went the other way entirely and portrayed the racism rather as an oversensitive ignorance, amongst left wing elitists. You know, the kind that say they would vote for Obama for a third term, but in reality don't have any sustainable, tangible relations with any black people.
 Peele, through angles, lighting, and mise en scene, is able produce discomfort in scenes, that is not reliant to the racial innuendos. Rather, the racial insinuations add more depth to the awkwardness and tie in to the full reveal. The characters still manage to come across offensive and itmindating, without overtly ruining the mystique of the movie by coming across overly aggressive. 
 This film keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 104 minutes, with endarounds, double acting, and overlooked social layers. For an introductory independent film Peele displayed mastery of crucial aspects in the film industry allowing an entire audience to relate with Chris's discomfort even if the racial and political aspects fly over your head. Peele uses a complex shot combining both birds eye view, and worms eye view into one scene, really to drive home the point, while still managing to hide the big reveal. Suspense build throughout the movie with Chris's growing paranoia. The framing is excellent. There are aspects of omniscient perspective, where the viewer knows what's about to happen but the character doesn't. It all meshes perfectly and fluently. Showing the viewer just enough in any one scene, and then completely changing the topic to make them forget what they just saw. (I.E. the lawn mower is just one example of this.) All in all ""Get Out"" hits the mark on every aspect good horror movie ought to, and then it takes it ten steps further!"

","The only thing I'd known before walking into ""Get Out"" (aside from the hype) is that it somehow mixes racial politics and horror. And really, that alone is enough to get the curiosity piqued, but it's the mechanics of the thing that makes it so entertaining. The *how*.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele kicks things off with a certain sense of foreboding; that a potentially awkward meeting-her-parents getaway has sinister intent. Nothing is what it seems, and that uncertainty makes the viewer uncomfortable (in my case, at least). Dread builds on itself until Peele finally pulls out the rug with a classic horror twist; from there, it's a solid thrill ride til the very end. <br/><br/>I liked everything about this movie; the excellent cast, the sharp writing, the tense subject matter. Even the comedic side character is ideal But I loved that I had no idea where all of this was going. <br/><br/>It's scary as hell and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>8/10"
"gradyharp","8","19","38","14 January 2018"," 'All I know is sometimes, when there's too many white people, I get nervous, you know?'
","Multi-talented Jordan Peele both write and directed this controversial thriller that is likely to win awards in many categories. Not only has he selected a superb cast, but he also is willing to take the racial conflict where few have dared go - a story where the concept of being Black in a white atmosphere changes from being an advantage, a showcase for Black culture, to a nightmare of racism carried to the extreme. <br/><br/>The film opens strangely with an incident on the street of an apparent kidnapping of a black young man (LaKeith Stanfield). Jump some time later when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young Black photographer, visits Rose (Allison Williams), his white girlfriend's family estate, he becomes ensnared in the more sinister, real reason for the invitation. The parents (psychiatrist Missy - Catherine Keener and neurosurgeon Dean - Bradley Whitford) are strange but apparently conspicuously non-racist. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he could have never imagined. The manner in which the Black 'help' - Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) - interact with Chris is bizarre, as is the presence of some of the guests at a party held in the estate at night. Where it leads must be seen - otherwise the mood and story are spoiled. <br/><br/>Unique story, well written and directed and photographed and acted, this is a fine film that makes many necessary observations."

A film like this is only as good as the performances, and they are incredible. The entire cast must've realized what an original piece this is, merging elements from home invasion movies like The Purge with social comedies like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. If you are familiar with the careers of Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener, you will be knocked out by what they do in this film. Allison Williams, daughter of Brian (those cheekbones give that away...), is also downright surprising here. <br/><br/>Perhaps the Golden Globes placed this film in the Comedy/Musical category since there were so many fine dramas to come out in 2017.

","Get Out is easily the best movie of 2017, managing to get the highly coveted 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Once I finally decided to watch the movie, it was easy to see why. <br/><br/>The basic idea behind the plot is this man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has decided to go spend the weekend with his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) and her parents, in an isolated home in Alabama. But, as the weekend progresses (and without revealing too much of the plot), Chris begins to discover something truly sinister.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele, the director and writer, crafts this horror film so delicately, being sure to reveal things slowly and carefully as the film progresses. The plot is simply so original, unique and ingenious, and credit is due to Jordan Peele for all his decisions. He has us viewers believing one thing for the majority of the film, only to dash that aside for a far more sinister truth. This horror movie uses so many common horror tropes, and yet it expertly embraces and twists them into what truly is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film also centres around racism, primarily the more subtle, liberal type that has arisen in society in modern times. Jordan Peele intertwines this message of racism so delicately throughout the film, and even though it's a horror movie there's plenty of poignant commentary of the state of racism today.<br/><br/>Personally what I loved about the movie was the pacing, which allowed subtle hints to be sprinkled throughout the movie before the dramatic, sinister reveal. I also loved Kaluuya's acting; it was so raw and believable, and it really had you convinced of the true horror of what was going on throughout the film. Every second of the film we see his character responding and coming to terms with everything going on around him; it's genius.<br/><br/>There were a few things that I didn't love about the film, but they're mostly plot related and I don't want to give spoilers. In my opinion it's not the ""perfect"" movie, but it's so close the difference is honestly negligible. It's especially remarkable given that Jordan Peele is a first time director. Everything about this film - the writing, the acting, the pacing - is so clever, and there is praise due to everyone who worked on this movie. It really does prove that the world of Hollywood still has plenty more ideas to explore yet."
"Prophet89","4","16","31","13 June 2017"," Poorly scripted joke of a horror. Don't give in to the hype.
","Hey, this movie have actually done it! And I can't think of anything that did it before this one - it managed to be totally supportive on black/white racial equality by being equally insulting to both white and black people! Really, if someone told me the whole story of this before I watched it I would react exactly like the cops in this movie.<br/><br/>Seriously, this flick looks like it was filmed with just a draft of a script and I wouldn't even call it a horror. It is unoriginal and rather ridiculous than frightening. Don't waste your time - it's the most valuable resource you have! <br/><br/>PS: It honestly sickens me to even think that, but I have a slight notion it has such high ratings because of the racial angle of the production. Which is sad actually, because I don't believe people of minorities make worse anything as a rule, which means their works need not to be given any undeserved praise - that is not what equality means, people, that is actually a bad, harmful idea - if, say, a movie is praised as good - or even best like Moonlight - just because of some misguided parity sense - in other words, just because it was made mostly by minority members, and apart from that it is, like Moonlight or Ida,mediocre at best, then it harms the minority more than it helps it. It's simple - if you do anything and you are objectively not best in it, or you suck at it even, but everyone around you tells you, that what you do is awesome, then you don't have any incentive to try harder and be better.<br/><br/>It can even be a source of deep frustration as you can sometimes tell that you're getting undeserved praise, like from a overbearing parent, and deep down you know it is not sincere and something else entirely stands behind it. Like some politics that don't concern you personally as a creator.<br/><br/>If my work was praised no matter how bad it was just because of my color, beliefs or ethnicity, I know I would not be happy or satisfied with it. Also such practices make room for unethical creators who will see that picking up a specific set of topics for their works will automatically allow them to get ahead of any competition just because the topic is politically desired to be shown in certain context rather than the quality of the work itself. It's damaging and demoralizing."

"ilpohirvonen","7","12","22","3 December 2017"," Jordan Peele's Directorial Debut ""Get Out"" Is an Unprecedented Shock
","Many a cinephile might have lost all interest and hope in contemporary American films in recent years, but it turns out they might have just been looking at the wrong places. As the award-winning films of the country have become duller and duller, packed in a stale, tight corset, the most interesting auteurs have found their way in popular genre films which do not resonate that well with the businessmen who give out awards but which strike a deep chord with the general public. Long- time comedian, Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" (2017) is a perfect example, and it has already garnered well-deserved critical praise in France. Alongside the Safdies' ""Good Time"" (2017), another genre film which might go over the heads of the critics and award-givers who are used to the stale flow, ""Get Out"" is definitely among the best American films of the year. It should be seen by everyone not only for its social significance but also for its cinematic freshness. <br/><br/>An African-American photographer, Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) travels to his white girlfriend Rose's (played by Allison Williams) parents to visit them for the first time at their secluded estate somewhere in up-north countryside. The friendly atmosphere of this mundane meeting starts to crack and reveal something more sinister beneath the surface. <br/><br/>The basic set-up of the plot echoes the classic civil rights era film, Stanley Kramer's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) where a white woman introduces her African-American boyfriend to her liberal parents whose tolerance begins to show its limitations. Peele cleverly uses this inter-text as a backdrop, giving an undertone for the main theme, but essentially develops his film into something utterly original. Many spectators will leave the film with the thought that they have never seen anything like this. Never have the monsters of horror films felt so abstract and so concrete at the same time. <br/><br/>Peele is able to derive from his comedy-background the ability to build up tension in a fashion which often borders the line of humor without directing the spectator to laughs but rather to flinches in terror. Although ""Get Out"" does not come across as a self-aware meta-film dealing with the genre of horror like ""It Follows"" (2014), Peele's film does have a self-awareness to it which, however, never interrupts a scene or the development of suspense. Peele might use genre conventions with an ironic twinkle in his eye, but they are never subjected to any comprehensively genre-critical discourse. On the contrary, the self-aware genre conventions enhance the deeply felt structure of the film whose narrative power pushes the spectators tightly into their seats. <br/><br/>""Get Out"" begins with a serene shot of a wealthy American suburb where an African-American man is ambling, looking for the right street. This image in itself, mundane as its setting may be, already invokes feelings of horror because we have heard of so many stories where black men end up dead in innocent places such as these. It sets up an impressive and frightening sensation of not being welcomed which characterizes the film throughout. Peele's structured and disciplined mise-en-scène of precise compositions beautifully articulates and exemplifies the impression of a seemingly ""post-racial"" society where everything seems to be in order, but which conceals secrets underneath.<br/><br/>Overall, Peele's ""Get Out"" is a real cinematic treat and most likely will acquire a following. Whether the film skyrockets Peele to cinematic success or not will remain to be seen, for it is always the second film which shows if the director's first hit was just a stroke of luck. Yours truly is very confident -- as well as interested and hopeful for the future of contemporary American cinema."

"cmtrisket","8","12","22","7 June 2017"," Get Out, Honest Review
","Right out of the gate this movie pulls you in. The story line is focused on a Chris an African American (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose his white girlfriend (Allison Williams). He is going to meet her family for the first time and is worried that they won't be accepting of him. The majority of the movie is set at Rose's parents estate. They live on a secluded lake and have money. Right away you can feel the tension and the subtle hints of racism. the movie is much more than racism though. It is a story, made for entertainment, and that is what some people forget. I watch movies, most times for enjoyment, not political reasons.<br/><br/>I was interested to see how Jordan Peele would do honestly. I mean he came up as a comedian and actor, not a writer and director. This was his first movie that he has ever directed and he nailed it with his team. The movie is 104 minutes long so just under two hours. I think this is a great time for a movie. most movies today start pushing over two to two and a half hours and it seems like they add a lot of filler.<br/><br/>Back to the plot. The mom Missy (Catherine Keener), is a hypnotist, and the father Dean (Bradley Whitford), is a neurosurgeon. Chris knows something is off with the family and friends of the family, and is questioning everything. As the movie goes on and becomes increasingly weird, creepy, and spooky you are left with questions of your own. Mostly those questions revolve around other characters that are introduced and what is really going on in the movie. The movie gains some momentum towards the end and some action. I'll leave the summary at that, so nothing is spoiled! The actors are perfect for the roles. So of course I would say the casting department hit the ball out of the park. I am a big fan of Daniel Kaluuya, ever since I saw him in ""Black Mirror."" I would see the movie just for him personally. And honestly that was part of why I gave it a go. The chemistry between Chris and Rose is great throughout the movie and they have you pulling for them as a couple.<br/><br/>As far as the social issue of racism in the movie I think it fell short for some. I think that a lot of people went to see the movie in hope that it made a statement about racism, since Jordan Peele was the director and the whole movie is based on black people working for white people. Butt it wasn't dwelled on like people thought it would be. It really evolves into a story and I lost sight of the color of their skin quickly. I mean if you took the slavery element out of it, it would still be a great movie. I think that was just a ploy to get people interested in the movie and it worked.<br/><br/>Bringing it around 360 degrees, it is a great movie for the times. It is directed super well for a first time director. It is the right length of movie full of content with no filler. The actors are great. It only falls short when you are hoping for more of a political statement than it truly gives. I will be rating my reviews on a scale of 1-10. 1 being the worst, and 10 being the best. Each rating will be specific to how it fits into it's own genre.<br/><br/>*For example if a comedy movie gets a 7 and an action movie also gets a 7, I would give more weight to the comedy movie. It is harder for a comedy movie to get a high rating, whereas an action movie should be pushing 8+* All of that being said I would give ""Get out"" an 8.5/10"
"robspratley","8","12","22","7 June 2017"," A must-see for any Mystery/Horror fans
","I was pleasantly surprised by this film having not really heard of it before watching. Kudos to Jordan Peele as the writer and director of this horror-mystery piece, as I was indeed kept guessing throughout. On several occasions my hubris got the best of me, I thought I had the plot sussed - I was close, but no cigar. And I fully appreciated being taken down a different road than the one I had expected.<br/><br/>A strong performance from the cast en masse, but Daniel Kaluuya did stand out; since we are essentially watching events unfold as and when he experiences them. We cringe as he cringes, we're shocked as he's shocked.... and we, the audience, remain bonded to Daniel's character, Chris Washington, until the movie's conclusion - and in this way we feel like we are almost in the film ourselves. Immersed in a strange scenario, off to 'Meet the Parents', but with a twist of the unusual.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the mystery/horror genre, this film is unmissable. With horror films in particular being bogged down with the same type of characters and very similar plots, 'Get Out' comes as a refreshing change.<br/><br/>On the whole, I would recommend it to most viewers, horror fans and non-horror fans alike - the gore is not overwhelming."
"ficomirko","8","12","22","3 June 2017"," For the premise it covers,surprisingly not racist.
","My worst fear when I heard about this movie was that it would be filled with liberal/black racism against white people.Well,it wasn't .It somewhat exaggerated the racism on both sides,but not hatefully,making it quite even and laughable rather than maddening and provocative. The only thing I disagree with is that the whole ''black paranoia'' (thinking all the white people are out to get them) thing turned out to be ''helpful'' which is certainly not a thing in reality.Well,we all knew the setting of the movie and it does fit *this movie specifically*.I just hope that people don't take it the wrong way and accept it as a global fact.<br/><br/>Conclusion: a great watch with interesting twists. Might've been better without the whole race controversy,which was actually handled exceptionally well.(and I guess it did boost it's popularity and added a decent social message,as long as you don't get triggered easily)"
"dmariie-94019","8","12","22","3 June 2017"," Great Use of Symbolism
","This film is by far one of my new favorites. If you're familiar with the black market of organ harvesting, then you'll pick up on the use of (extreme) symbolism within the film; depicting the fact that because people of color have a superior genetic make-up (athletic build, age- defying skin, ""better"" organ functioning), using an entire body as a vessel would be the ideal goal opposed to just transplanting the heart, kidney or liver of a black person into a white person's body. (This is actually a real thing in America)<br/><br/>Hence, small indications of this ideology of black superiority is shown when an older woman at the party asks Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) something in reference to the saying ""when you go black you don't to back"". <br/><br/>The way that the symbolism is depicted, as far as transplanting a brain is pretty cheesy and unrealistic, however the term ""horror film"" in regard to this film is precise. It's bigger than ""racism"" , seeing as though there are thousands of black children who go missing and when some are found, their organs are missing ... HORROR. <br/><br/>The hypothetical situation of an old friend of André Logan (the man who has a ""seizure"" at the party who maintained the same exterior), running into him/ conversing with him, yet realizing that he is now a ""white man"" is also pretty psychotic . A scene like that should have been somehow implemented in the movie for the film to make a complete point. <br/><br/>If someone rated this movie terribly, it's obviously because they know nothing of what is actually going on in the country and how the film relates. The TSA ""comedy"" was a bit irritating, as it seemed that Jordan Peele added it, to avoid stepping on the toes of any white people who might get offended with the whole ""racism"" rant. <br/><br/>For the people that ""don't get it"", Jordan Peele could have just did a direct film explicitly showing the black teenage boy in Georgia who had his organs harvested and was found in his high school gymnasium, which if he did, the film would not have been cleared for theaters for obvious reasons. ."

","This is not a film for White People. I say this because I sat in a theatre with a diverse group of people and noticed the white people in the audience seemed offended by the film. Even though I am black, I believe this film was very well done. The casting director did an amazing job with the cast, all the actors were very believable in their roles. This is truly a unique cinematic experience, I've spent a great deal of time watching films from different parts of the world and its rare for me to say that I've never seen a film like this before. This is one of those films that makes white people look bad, but to be fair it does a great job in capturing the experience of a black man surrounded by ""too many white people"". For instance, I've almost always been the only black person at my job, and I've had my boss ask me about certain rappers simply for the fact that I'm black. During the summer olympics, my boss literally asked me what it was like to see black people win gold medals for America.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","18","36","1 March 2018"," Smart, subversive film-making; one of the best horror pictures I've ever seen.
","The first two acts of 'Get Out (2017)' are fantastic, creating a palpable sense of growing unease and mounting dread. The film does come to somewhat of a halt as it approaches its final third, with one scene too many spent away from our protagonist. It's fortunate, then, that the explosive finale brings the story to a satisfying conclusion. All the tension culminates in a brutal final confrontation that isn't afraid to go dark, finally releasing all that expertly built tension and becoming an incredibly crowd-pleasing but still gruelling experience. It's a very smart and subversive film, one that manages to plant the seeds for almost every aspect of its plot perfectly and tie the perspective of its protagonist into its narrative in an incredibly intrinsic way. It satisfyingly subverts the tropes of the genre while still hitting all the beats required to make it recognisable to a wide audience. On a second viewing, it is easy to forget just how strange and unexpected the picture truly is. It is honestly one of the most surprising pieces I've seen in some time, with each twist somehow seeming wholly natural yet entirely out of left field. The movie also has some incredible writing and several fully formed characters that are among the best of their kind. Special mention must be made of Daniel Kaluuya, who deserves all the praise and awards coming his way as he delivers what is, for me, perhaps the best performance of the year. The picture represents remarkable film-making in every sense and is definitely one of the absolute best horror films I've ever seen. 9/10"
"niallmaggs","10","18","36","5 January 2018"," Brilliant modern horror movie with a clever theme of racism underneath the surface! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com)
","This first-time director manages to create an unbelievable and surprising horror flick that was hysterically funny at parts. The film is filled with good performances and fun characters with a realistic storyline and quite relatable to many people, not the supernatural bit though! ... the 'meeting the parents' bit! The scenes when the couple arrives at the parent's estate are fun and enjoyable to watch, much like the scenes when the supernatural stuff begins! The film as a whole is quite creepy and features a disturbing performance played brilliantly by Caleb Landry Jones. The film could be classed as a horror comedy though, mainly due to LilRel Howery's hysterical performance with his random outbursts that resulted in the entire cinema completely losing it! This benefited the film as it created a fun cinema experience that you can enjoy with a group of friends! Some may argue that the comedy element may take away from the horror aspect of the film but I'd have to disagree, there is a perfect mix between both that results in a fantastic modern horror flick and the best I've seen in a very long time! Also, this is definitely a contender for my favourite film of 2017 so far! I absolutely recommend this brilliant horror-comedy as it delivers on all levels and I can't wait to see more from Jordan Peel in the future!"

","Honestly, when I was starting to watch this, I did not expect all of the horror in this movie. I thought: ""Wow, a thriller about a black guy that goes to a white girlfriend's parent's house. They'll probably try to kill him."" <br/><br/>But, I have to say, this plot was amazing. In the beginning, there was some foreshadowing, ""My parents aren't racist."" she said. ""Yeah, sure."" I said. Of course her parents were going to be racist and only do that thing to black people. Everyone knew that. <br/><br/>And this movie truly just freaks you out. Like, even if you have never had anything relatable to this movie, this movie will give you chills, with plenty of jump scares to make you jump out of your seats. (Which is why I strongly recommend this movie to 15+.)<br/><br/>Plus, if you are ok with a lot of unnecessary cursing, then I would give it a 13+, since there is just some gore and a lot of jump scares... not to mention the murders... oh well.

","I am not a fan of horror genre. I don't enjoy being scared. And I am so glad it didn't stop me from seeing Get Out. It's not the kind of horror that makes you afraid of the dark, or of showers, or whatever innocent inanimate objects. The horror is in the meaning. The movie takes common, casual racism and what-ifs it to a whole other level. Plausibility of the horrific things that happen or lack thereof (that can be an undoing of a movie like this for me) is irrelevant here. It's the symbolism that matters. And this symbolism is very subtle, never in your face. The film delivers a message, yet never appears to be trying to say something. <br/><br/>The lead and supporting actors are all great, but I want to give special kudos to Marcus Henderson (Walter), Betty Gabriel (Georgina), and Laketh Stanfeld (Andre Logan King). They had the hardest jobs and they were fantastic. The story flows smoothly. There is never a false moment that could throw you out of the movie's hypnotic grip. I thought Chris's mother's death was a bit overexploited, but that is such a small complaint, I wouldn't even count it as one. The film is nothing short of shockingly brilliant."

"JasonR77","10","15","29","4 December 2017"," Nothing is what it appears
","This film is so much more than your standard horror movie. If anything, it's much more a suspense movie with a devious twist. The plot is simple enough at first, girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family. Sure, basic enough. But Jordan Peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic.<br/><br/>The interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable, and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughter's black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily. What Peele does is merge those two, and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringe-worthy no matter what race you may be. If you're white, the white people are embarrassing you. If you're black, you're feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this, and wondering if there isn't something underneath the apparent good words.<br/><br/>In that way, Peele encapsulates our society. White people invoking Barack Obama's name as though it gives them credibility among black people, for instance. Through each scene, you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop, and wonder what exactly it means when it happens.<br/><br/>When it does, the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno, and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo. Peele has, as such, built a perfectly frightening movie, and with its deep societal roots, it is intelligent, and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place.<br/><br/>The acting is stupendous, and the twists are crazy good. The comic relief that Rod provides as a goofy TSA agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that Peele is, but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of Chris's plight.<br/><br/>10/10. See this movie and see it often."

It's not an anti-white film, it's not calling all white people racist, or anyone racist, it's just probably using some dialog the writer/director has probably heard a million times in conversations with white people in high society.<br/><br/>It's not a horror movie as it's listed on IMDb and by most viewers. It has some horror elements, but it's really a suspense movie, and it's a very good one because for the first half of the movie or more, you have a growing sense of dread, and you have no idea why. To top it off, it has some very funny parts, but they don't ruin the suspense because the funny man is on the other end of a phone, the protagonist's only link to the outside world, as it were, and so it is compartmentalized and doesn't diminish the very real threat he is facing."

","I am by no means a professional troll, here to say that my opinion is relevant. However, this movie was FANTASTIC, but again, that is just my 2 cents. For a debut in directing, especially when it's Jordan Peele, I was awestruck. Not for my lack in trust in his ability, but this was a horror/thriller, and I have known his work for always being something more along the lines of side splitting hilarity. I heard he directed this film, often times, doing his impressions of President Obama (how I miss thee) and his other well known impressions. I also hear that Jordan took notes from the late and great George A. Romero, in creating the story around a black man as the protagonist, which really how often do we see that? Always refreshing to see a new perspective in an old genre. If you really want to see a new look unto ""meeting the family"" of your significant other, watch this movie. Especially if you are wasting your precious times reading reviews like mine, and others. Take the 90 mins or so and sit back. The soundtrack also worth listening. I give it a 10 out of 10. This is nothing like Keanu, but it's still a great movie. Kukdos, Mr. Jordan Peele, I was already a fan, but now, I am much cooler. XO"

","Sadly, it is the most racist movie that I, and probably anyone here, have ever seen. The whole movie is based on the concept of race differences. Only black people are presented as good and physically superior human beings while all the whites are jealous emotionless rich psychos who crave for blacks strength and superiority. Actually I could say much more about symbolism in this movie and disgusting insinuations but what I've just written is enough. Really? It is even hard to believe that such movie was released. I guess it had never been if the roles in the movie were reversed."

","White girl has a black boyfriend and they decide to spend a weekend away with her parents for the first time. He is told that her parents are unaware she is dating a black guy and he feels uncomfortable about the pending visit. <br/><br/>For me, the portrayal of the girlfriend was a bit full on, she was annoying and uncomfortable in the role, maybe this was purposeful, a hint at what was to come, but I feel she was just not right for the part. Then i read her bio and find she's the daughter of prominent news anchor, and things seem to make sense. <br/><br/>I got all the racist jokes, the irony of the ending scenes etc but there have been better movies that have dealt with race issues in the same way, and there were no surprises in the movie itself, you know whats going to happen, it's all a bit weak, completely unrealistic, and no real horror to be had. There are periods of suspense and a bit of blood on occasion, and I did like the hypnotism inclusion and the way it was woven into the plot. The main guy must have been cast due to his eyes alone, he looks like he being tortured while just reading a book. The guy playing the father was OK, again, laid it on thick, it was part of the plot to do so, but it still made the movie almost a parody of itself, they were out to get him from the start of the movie, as the trailer suggests, and it was portrayed just like this, almost slapstick in its application. This kinda ruined the 'horror' mood for me. Still had its moments, there were macabre aspects to this portrayal and elements of a generic type slasher film. But I was left disappointed, I kinda got exactly what I expected, thought the ending was a bit of comic relief actually. Next"

Until the end only in one scene, when our main character leaves his bed for smoking outside we feel a bit of tension, but still, nothing special. There's no tension, no rhythm. A complete borefest and a bad rip off of The Stepford Wives and The Skeleton Key. You know there is a problem with a movie when the comic relief, played by our main character's best friend says the same joke over and over again. Boring, pretentious, unoriginal, predictable and stupid.If you happen to like racist movies,or happen to be in a ""hate the white race mode"", i totally recommend this movie. Watch Sharknado instead.

","Get Out is an innovative and entertaining movie: a mix of Comedy, Thriller, Horror, Dramatic, Grotesque, Noir, Sentimental and Social Satire that succeeds as a horror movie even without the use of monstrosity, jump scare or blood, but thanks to really disquieting shots and facial expressions that keep the viewer alert. It is also a criticism of certain ""white people"" who voted for Obama: this movie unveils a less cliche', more politically correct and treacherous face of racism."
"chestern-80136","8","11","20","16 January 2018"," Wonderfully frightening, and nervously humorous, Get Out's one is that it doesn't know it's audience.
","Generally considered one of the best movies of 2017, it's rather safe to name 'Get Out' as the best horror film of the year. It's only real competition would be 'IT', maybe 'mother!' (it's proven to be rather divisive), and if you want to count it as a horror film, 'The Shape of Water'. Excluding IT, there is actually a theme linking these recent horror successes. They each have more to them than simply being scary. Whether it be a message you can interpret, dazzling visuals or splashes of comedy, they each bring something else to the table.<br/><br/>This review shall contain spoilers. I do, however, highly recommend the film. If you haven't seen any trailers, I'd recommend you keep it that way; many of the highlights are teased within them. With that said, spoilers shall be below. Proceed with caution.<br/><br/>Directed, surprisingly enough, by Jordan Peele, famous for his hilarious sketch comedy, Get Out is a genuine surprise. Based on the director, I'd made the assumption that this film would be a generic horror comedy, presumably relishing in over-the-top jumpscares and gore. Instead, what I found myself watching was somewhat of a mystery. Jordan Peele himself said that the film 'can't be put into a genre box', and he's right; it could arguably be a horror film, a suspenseful thriller, a comedy, a mystery or a pretentious commentary of race relations in America. Mercifully, I didn't interpret it as the latter.<br/><br/>Originally conceived following Barack Obama's second election, the film tackles a subject of race-relations rarely noticed: the opposite of racism. And I'm not talking about 'reverse-racism'. Many white characters in this film actually love black people so much, they want to become them. Knowing it was written during Obama's second term, that makes sense. Watching it now, with President Trump in office, gives it a different spin. Regardless of how you interpreted the antagonists, they were probably the most 'human' villain in horror in recent memory. Ignoring some questionable science, they were depressingly human.<br/><br/>The cinematography was a pleasant surprise. Shots, while rarely astounding, strongly added to the mood. Throughout the film, they felt as though they were getting closer, until we are unable to escape the situation we've been thrust into. Also, at times, we can see background characters watching our protagonist without his knowledge. Tension is present throughout, whether it be due to a nervous comment we aren't sure how to react to, or somebody brandishing a weapon, the audience can rarely relax, leaving you tired when the credits roll.<br/><br/>The characters are each rather interesting. Obviously, the family is all rather one-note, but they play that one note so sweetly, I can't bring myself to complain. The exception to this is Rose (Allison Williams). This character shifts so jarringly, I briefly thought it was someone else in her body. Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Chris was also wonderful, and rather believable. Ultimately, the featured roles stole the show, however. Both Marcus Henderson and Keith Stanfield were brilliant, but Betty Gabriel's Georgina was flawless. While the 'saying things in an overly happy way to be creepy' trope has been played out a bit, the cast in this film manage to make it unsettling again.<br/><br/>My main issue with the film is that it doesn't seem to think the audience is particularly bright. Much of the racial 'undertones' are forced upon us, lest we miss the point of the film. There's also occasional recaps of past events in conversations between Rose and Chris. The audience doesn't need to be told why something is awkward, or strange; we can work it out. It's both more rewarding for the viewer, and saves time in the film. This comes to a head when Chris finally works out what's going on. We see literal flashbacks to previous events, as though we'd have somehow forgotten the things we'd seen half an hour prior.<br/><br/>With that said, however, it does highlight something that pleases me greatly. This is a mystery you can actually solve if you're paying attention. It's teased earlier in the film that the family's grandfather was not only a runner, but that he lost to a black man. It's not too large a leap to find the character's envy. Perhaps others are like this? We also learn the parents' occupations rather early, too. The party scene is utterly littered with clues, to the point of it becoming painfully obvious looking back.<br/><br/>To conclude, I feel this film was an exceptionally successful film. With a budget of merely 4.5 million dollars, Jordan Peele has told not only a highly enjoyable horror (or thriller, or comedy..) film, but an interesting commentary on society today. It also manages to avoid persecuting the viewer, regardless of their race, as I feared it may end up doing. I am quite happy giving this a high 8/10. If you're looking for an alternative to a crowd-pleasing horror film such as 'IT', I recommend Get Out. At the moment, the film has made a profit of 250 million dollars at the box office, and it deserves every one of them."
"Mrbrown43","9","11","20","9 December 2017"," Get Out: Come in, relax. Have a cup of tea... (Minor spoilers warning)
","I do not like to watch trailers before the movie itself. I find that either they misrepresent the product or just spoil the entire film within 2 minutes or less. This was the biggest reason why I never watched a trailer for Get out right up until I finished the movie. From what I heard, this was the type of film that could not afford to be spoiled. Oh god it does not deserve to be spoiled at all....<br/><br/>Get out is the directorial and writing debut of Jordan Peele, it stars Daniel Kaluuya as Chris Washington who has been dating a white woman by the name of Rose Armitage (Allison Howell Williams) and the time has come to meet the family (Catherine Ann Keener, Bradley Whitford and Caleb Landry Jones as Missy Armitage, Dean Armitage and Jeremy Armitage respectfully) Chris is concerned that Rose's family would not approve of the interracial relationship. <br/><br/>After a little assurance from Rose that the family is not racist at all He and rose drive to the family house deep in the woods. Once there Chris is welcomed warmly, a little too warmly. The family is so tolerant and so happy to see Chris that it is almost raciest. The two black servants Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and Walter (Marcus Henderson) are a little too happy to be working for the Armitage family, a little too robotic....As the weekend processes Chris begins to uncover an increasing sinister plan that certain members of the Armitage family want to involve Chris in...<br/><br/>That is all I can say about the plot, but want I can say is that this film can easily go right next to Jennifer Kent's Babadook for one hell of a career start. The film has such a great atmosphere, visuals writing and editing. The film has such a deep sense that something is wrong; everything seems just ever so out of place. There is clear inspiration from films like the Stepford wives and Body Snatchers in the atmosphere along with drop of The Shining in for good measure. The film has great performances from everyone involved. The writing oozes laughs and scares along with racial commentary that is subtle enough to where the viewer's intelligence is respected but no so obtuse to the point very few, if any see the commentary. <br/><br/>I really cannot see anything wrong with this movie; everything is just so well done. The comedy for once does not get in the way of the horror (vice versa) a common problem I have when horror movies try to add comedic elements which often creates a tonal disaster for the film. This is the first film I have seen that did not happen and I am happy for it.<br/><br/>Get Out is one hell of a movie that deserves all the praise it gets. I really enjoyed watching this film and I will definitely see it again."

","It's very refreshing to enjoy a masterpiece, obviously. This is an art piece. Just because horror and comedy don't get labelled as art very often doesn't mean it isn't possible. Why? The movie doesn't care what you have to say about it, it just wants to be itself, get its message through, which it does in brilliant fashion. So many layers in this movie will inspire you to reflect on people and society from a fresh perspective. The leads' performance and character development is the kingpin holding it all together. Here you get a brilliantly subtle portrayal of a well fleshed out main character. I'm not a fan of Key & Peele so I resisted watching the flick out of expectation that the humour would turn me off. So glad I gave in and watched it as this film in fact presents a well balanced, thoughtful and expertly wielded theme; one which most are too fearful to touch with a ten foot pole. It must be tough to create a clear, focused vision with topics that are so controversial, but clearly there is much more to Peele than the lighthearted comedian, for here he has have crafted and directed a bold, mature and most of all, important piece of cinema. All the while the horror is still good horror and the humour is still good humour. Smart. Very very smart."

The movie actually scares the audience with thought and getting inside of the mind. Throughout the movie, a mysterious ambiance follows, and this makes the movie fluent.

","Not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.<br/><br/>Well, this is the story of an interracial romance. When Chris decides to meet his girlfriend's white family, living outskirt of her hometown, all goes as planned. But he was not sure how her parents take it, that he's a black. Now everything has settled, but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale.<br/><br/>The casting was amazing. The story was suspenseful. You would feel you can predict the scenes, but not that easy and when twist happens, you will realise it was simple as that. This is a hit film now, but if it was 20 years ago, surely would have gotten a cult classic status. And yes it is, thinking the future.<br/><br/>When this got out and its pre release, I thought it would disappear without any trace. It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast, debutante director and being a low cost film. I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised. But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy. That's true if you are not a film fanatic, otherwise it is one of those decent films. Surely not to be missed.

That's the scary part. <br/><br/>The music has the 10 from me. It's not present in scenes from the movie that require the silence of doubt and turn on when you can finally breathe out a ""what the heck"" is going on here.<br/><br/>The performance of Chris is remarkable. I truly believed the facial expressions he used because I was using them too while I watched the movie. <br/><br/>Some characters didn't quite fit in the whole picture. Rose's brother had no role in the job, he just stood the whole movie being weird and aggressive with no clear reason. <br/><br/>As a whole, it's a great peace of work that entertains and scares, but without getting to the spectacular."

Awkward silences, inappropriate comments, misinterpreted questions. Feeling the whole time like I am a pile of steaming garbage among a group of pampered, vanilla and cream, trust fund babies who are wondering what she's doing with me.

"wotuktanks","7","11","20","18 June 2017"," Not Bad: Good and Creative Story, Suspense Somewhat Ruined by Trailer.
","With the large advertising budget, there's a good chance you've seen the trailer, and there's also a good chance you just saw the IMDb trailer, but I need to preface that the best viewing experience will be found if you know nothing about the story beforehand. (I will not talk about any specific events or characters in the movie.)<br/><br/>Story: 'Get Out' is a great 'journey-type' horror movie that is most strong and reliant on its tone and build-up. The movie is very good in these aspects, and makes the whole narrative well-done overall because of it, even withstanding a weaker ending in my opinion. But that will happen with a lot of the aforementioned 'journey-type' horror movies. Essentially things build-up and build-up to a certain point, and the ending releases everything. Regardless of what the ending is like, that journey is what holds the primary value. (Ex. The Shining (1980), The Witch (2016).) In that sense, I will leave off saying in watching this movie for its story, it's good but not great. <br/><br/>Cinematography: Scenery and sets are really well-shot in this movie. Some events in the latter-half of the film have settings that really stand-out, especially on a second watch. Most of 'Get Out' is shot on one property with a large house and yard surrounded by forest. Scenes inside the 'office' and the basement are prevalent scenes when it comes to cinematography, among others. I will say that the camera-work is good overall but it doesn't utilize any elements to establish any more suspense or creepiness outside of the script and some really good acting. (More or less these statements apply to the former-half of the movie, because there are some creepy shots in the latter.) <br/><br/>Film Score: Even as a lover of music in movies, I didn't feel much from this track. The score is somewhat generic but well-used, so it didn't impact the merit of the film, but it could have earned a higher rating from me if it did stand-out. <br/><br/>Overall: I recommend this movie to anyone that can enjoy a good suspense-filled movie. Even though it is weird and a bit twisted on a superficial level, it's not very bad whatsoever and other than some language. (And yes, there's some practical blood effects but that just makes the film better in my taste.) I would even recommend this to younger (13+) and more general audiences alike, it's not a very hard 'R' to me. It definitely doesn't beat out 2016's 'The Witch', which it's most comparable to in tone, but it is a very solid movie."
"popcorn909","Null","11","20","8 June 2017"," A 5-star production - if it's a Virtual Reality horror movie
","Get Out is an intense, unnerving movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat --- only if you are satisfied with an adrenal rush and not looking for any depth in the characters or the story. It's a great production done with superb acting, music and visual arrangement, but as a movie about racism it just doesn't go beyond.<br/><br/>It starts with the romance between Rosie and Chris, the sweet white girlfriend and the talented African-American photographer, where Rosie asks Chris to spend a weekend at her posh parents' country house. It's just a weekend, but as things get awry, it escalates to be a matter of life or death. The backdrop can be easily taken as a trope for racial relations/tension in America, but contrary to what Peele the director aspired to do, this movie just couldn't provoke any discussion or shed light on the touchy issues. To have the guests ""locked up"" in a grandiose house with two distinct camps of the white and the black is also a scene that occurs in Tarantino's Django Unchained. While Django Unchained uses a fictional story to unveil the cruelty and injustice of black slavery, Get Out feels more like a sorcerer's tale that manages to carry the label of racism because the victim happens to be a black. The characters are diabolical and psychotic, but they are also flat and uninspiring. They might carry a secret agenda, but it just makes them look like an underground cult group who somehow has a bit of a supernatural power – it must be because some of the things they do are scientifically impossible, e.g. the surgery scene. Their persona and the things that they can physically do – hypnosis by the mother and surgeries by the father – are just not representative at all. They do not carry any association to racists or the xenophobic. In fact, they are also kind of dumb to have that kind of video conferencing set-up in the room where the victim gets to talk to the perpetrator. It works well if the movie wants to create suspense or terror by paying tribute to the horror classic Saw, but again, it doesn't add any depth to an intellectual reflection on racism. <br/><br/>Some people comment that the film commits dogmatic stereotypes. I think the only stereotype used here is that the black and the white are by default at war with each other. Yet, it's used more as a convenient trick to shove the audience into this them-versus-us mentality so we get as suspicious as Chris. The horror is real, the acting is fantastic and does send the chill off your spine, but it doesn't stimulate your thinking or perpetuate any racial prejudices. If this movie is played in a virtual reality movie house, it's top notch; but if it attempts to be meaningful, it is not."

One thing is for sure: director Peele knows how to balance between the swamp of horror clichés and a sketchy, almost over-the-top humour (reminding to some extent of Edgar Wright), but he also gives his comedy horror another dimension by playing with the conventions of whites-and-blacks relations."

","It was without no knowledge about what this movie was about when I sat down to watch ""Get Out"". The only thing that I did know about it was the fact that it was a horror movie, and I do enjoy horror movies quite a lot.<br/><br/>I will say that the movie does start out quite alright, albeit it doesn't really have that horror genre feel to it. But the story soon takes a turn into a more bizarre twist. And I mean that in a good way, because the way the story was constructed and set up was actually quite intricate and interesting. Director and writer Jordan Peele managed to introduce an element of confusion to the movie, which keeps the audience in the dark and have the audience guessing at just what exactly is going on. And that was a great accomplishment and definitely something that added a dynamic layer to the movie.<br/><br/>And while the story did seem quite odd and bizarre, it was actually a really good story, and it turned out to be quite interesting and actually well-thought through.<br/><br/>Director Jordan Peele was able to skillfully introduce some great build ups of drama, tension and suspense throughout the course of the movie. And the climaxes of these build ups were equally well brought to realization as well. Again, this really added a lot of depth and worth to the movie.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie was really helped a great long way by having some really good acting performances by the cast. I must admit that I was especially impressed with Daniel Kaluuya's performance and how at ease he seemed to be in this role. And I was also quite impressed with Betty Gabriel, although I think it was a shame that her role wasn't bigger and that she only had limited screen time.<br/><br/>The odd dialogue by various characters thought-out the entire movie actually makes sense when the revealing of what actually was happening took place. I will be the first to admit that I was quite puzzled and was wondering about much of the dialogue throughout the movie. But when the plot was revealed, and you look back at the dialogue it all just makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is labeled as a horror mystery, but I would say that the mystery aspect of the movie far outweighs the horror aspect. But then again, I would say it is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie. Regardless, then ""Get Out"" is quite an entertaining and interesting movie.<br/><br/>For a directorial debut for Jordan Peele then ""Get Out"" is quite an accomplishment. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, and can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch ""Get Out""."

"asda-man","8","17","34","5 March 2018"," Get in
","It's been about one whole year since Jordan Peele's Get Out was unleased onto cinemas and I've only just managed to see it! I call myself a seasoned horror fan but why on Earth did it take me so long to see a four-time Oscar nominated horror film? You know it has to be special when the Academy (who famously shun all genre movies) consider giving it a gong for Best Picture. After all, Get Out is the first all-out horror film to be nominated in the category since The Exorcist in 1973. Unless you decide to count the likes of Black Swan and The Silence of the Lambs which have elements of horror but are no where near as obvious as this film.<br/><br/>Is it all that superior then? Personally I think we've seen better recently in films such as The Witch and It Follows, but there's no denying that it's a cut above the rest. It's certainly far more intelligent than most films nowadays, which the Academy miraculously realised after awarding it an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay last night. It follows black British star Daniel Kaluuya as he goes to meet his white girlfriend's parents at their large middle-class home. Everything seems fine a first but gradually things start to take a sinister turn as some very white guests arrive and seem to almost close in on our black hero. To say anything else would be to ruin the terrific surprises in store, I went in knowing almost nothing about the plot and was certainly all the better for it.<br/><br/>Get Out takes a simple horror movie premise and turns it into a thoughtful and scarily plausible satire about racism. What's nice is that it doesn't shove it down our throats in a ham-fisted way like say, Mother! (which I loved, I must say) but there's stuff for keener viewers to dig in to. It never patronises its audience and is always interested in building up a sense of paranoia and suspense around a likable protagonist who we can all root for. It also manages to provide an exciting third act which manages to satisfy and thrill in equal measure.<br/><br/>It's difficult to believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film. The technical competence is pretty outstanding, although he has had plenty of experience starring in film and TV before so he must've learned something about being behind the camera whilst being in front of it! He shows great flair and vision behind the camera, always remaining focused and expertly building tension. Where most directors would go in for the heavy-handed approach, Peele uses subtlety and restraint. Even the barmy revelation is presented with such confidence, that you don't doubt the logic for a second.<br/><br/>Get Out might not be the ground-breaking classic you were hoping for, but it's certainly a fine horror film with enough comedy to comfortably cleanse your pallet. Despite always having its tongue in cheek, it carries an important message about liberal racism and does an excellent job at making the audience feel what it's like to be a black man in modern America. The ending perhaps could've been less predictable and convenient, but Get Out offers plenty of hidden riches in repeated viewings."

"Dan1863Sickles","9","17","34","28 February 2018"," This Generation's African-American Horror Epic -- A Darker Blacula For Our Times
","Not since Blacula in the early Seventies has a brilliant African-American film electrified the horror audience and changed the way the mainstream audience thinks about race, horror, and the power of storytelling. But where Blacula was patterned after the relatively mild, almost romantic horror films of the early Thirties, GET OUT is a relentlessly terrifying thriller that captures the stifling, shocking paranoia of ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE STEPFORD WIVES, and even darker classics like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.<br/><br/>By now everyone knows the basic plot -- a young black man visits his white girlfriend's parents in the luxurious home deep in the country. This journey is an ironic reversal of Marlowe's journey up the Congo in HEART OF DARKNESS. Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris, the innocent victim turned hero who becomes the perfect symbol of the courage, decency, and humanity that white America so often refuses to acknowledge in young black men. No one else has said it, but it seems to me that Kaluuya's performance is strengthened by his uncanny resemblance to a great black actor who left us much too soon -- Howard Rollins. The movie plays with the fact that Chris is much like the black officer Rollins played in A SOLDIER'S STORY -- the honest observer, the courageous truth seeker, the lone survivor. There are moments that seem torn right out of the earlier classic, just in the way Chris shows so much sadness with his eyes as the other black characters are demeaned and humiliated. <br/><br/>But this is not just one man's story. Allison Williams as Rose Armitage is a revelation. Again, it's astonishing the way this gifted and sensationally gorgeous young actress channels the aura of earlier icons. Early in the picture, Rose comes across as exactly the character a young Jane Fonda or Katharine Hepburn might have played. She's the aristocratic ingenue with a prim demeanor and passion lurking underneath, seemingly cool but full of red blood and passion as well as sympathy for the less fortunate. The genius of this movie is that it takes this archetype, so beloved by white liberals, and then transforms the character in ways that are both terrifying and darkly funny. <br/><br/>Catherine Keener as Mama Armitage was equally unforgettable. I'd seen her in a light-hearted comedy, HAMLET 2 with Steve Coogan. I noticed then that she has a way of striking sparks, sounding discordant notes, making the story turn dark just by her very presence. Here she's even more sensational!<br/><br/>This movie is one of those rare classics that feels totally original -- yet at the same time it's full of tributes to earlier films. You can't see Chris tied up in a chair and shedding tears without picturing Alex in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The use of hypnosis brings back memories of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. Nothing ever feels fake or added for effect -- GET OUT just resembles those earlier classics because of its power, style, and depth. <br/><br/>GET OUT is a movie that has no weak spots, no slow scenes, no bad performances. It's the most economical thriller I've ever seen. You will not forget this young man's journey into a uniquely American vision of hell."
"jimboalistair","8","17","34","24 February 2018"," One of the better horror movies
","In an era where actual good horror movies are pretty rare, Get Out gives me a little hope that this genre isn't dead just yet. This isn't just another series of jump scares with terrible acting and a stale plot. This movie doesn't make you jump, it will genuinely make you feel uncomfortable for the most part. I'll be honest, this is one of the only horror movies that actually made me feel sick because of how creepy and uncomfortable it is to watch. The first two acts are great and very well written but the third act and the ending are both a little silly and don't seem to fit with the rest. Overall though, Get Out is certainly a must watch for horror fans or people who just want to watch something different. Oh and Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic!"

","I've seen mixed reviews about this movie. Some people loved it while others consider it to display an extreme standpoint of systematic racism. To me, its a well-made horror movie with subtle comedic moments. The perspective, although exaggerated and unrealistic, is fresh and unique. Its a break from typical horror movies and there are great symbolic references through the visuals, dialogue and soundtrack. There is great depth to the scenes and I realized this after reading the IMDb trivia section (avoid it if you haven't watched the movie yet). 
The plot was quite predictable but I was impressed by the way it was executed. The dialogue contains great meaning and provides us an insight into the stereotypes that human beings have to live with everyday. And lastly, it was refreshing to see the black guy actually surviving till the end of a horror movie."
"classicsoncall","8","14","27","5 February 2018"," ""Now you're in the Sunken Place.""
","I've read a handful of the reviews here on IMDb for this picture and see that quite a few folks consider that the film was racist in it's treatment of Blacks. Let me try to take a stab at this from a different direction. My feeling is that the Armitage family was targeting Blacks not because they were racist, but because they recognized the superiority of their chosen victims. We get our first hint of that when Jeremy's (Caleb Landry Jones) dinner conversation turns to acknowledging Chris's (Daniel Kaluuya) athletic looking physique and commenting that he (Chris) would have been a 'beast' if he took up martial arts. When the black maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) apologizes to Chris for unplugging his cell phone, she makes it a point to mention that she's treated like 'one of the family'. The thing is, she WAS one of the family; it was her body that was used to accept transfer of the brain of Rose's grandmother. Walter, the groundskeeper (Marcus Henderson), was the receptacle for the brain of the Dean Armitage's (Bradley Whitford) father; the guy looked like a world class sprinter when he buzzed by Chris during that night time, fresh air walk. So I ask, was the Armitage family racist? They could just as easily have procured white victims for their life extending pursuits, but apparently they saw something in Blacks that resonated beyond color.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, I thought this film did quite the one hundred eighty degree U-turn from a racially tolerant set-up to the dark, horror filled picture it turned into. And the way it was balanced with humor was quite the scream. Chris's buddy Rod (LilRel Howery) was hilarious expounding on his 'sex slave' theory, and when he showed up at the finale to make the save, you could see his pride in representing TSA agents everywhere. I thought Allison Williams did a fine job as well, arcing her character from a supportive fiance to a diabolical participant in the Armitage plot. In the lead role, Daniel Kaluuya was also superb; my first look at him as an actor was just a while ago in the Black Mirror episode 'Fifteen Million Merits'. With this picture, I think he's well on his way to a fine career."
"tuttiane","9","14","27","5 February 2018"," Surprising.

","""Get Out"", written by Jordan Peele, was a roller coaster. It incorporates all of society's flaws involving the black lives matter movement. I felt that Jordan did a great job projecting this concept to it's audience, through a various number of symbolism. The acting performance of Daniel Kaluuya was spectacular. The plot line was easy to follow and I felt it conveyed an extremely impactful concept. Jordan Peele has created 2 different ending to the movie and after watching both, I would have gone with the alternate ending. In the ending not added to the final product, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) ends up killing Rose and is sent to prison for manslaughter. I feel like this ending would have been more realistic to what goes on in todays society and would have really impacted the audiences feelings. Although the ending where Chris is saved by his friend leaves the movie off on a happy note, I believe that the truth of how the black community are treated should not be censored for it to be resolved. Overall I still deeply enjoyed watching this film and would definitely recommend it to others."

"cspencebell","10","14","27","28 December 2017"," Best goddamn horror/psychological thriller I've ever seen
","It took me a while to get to this one, and it's because I knew the general plotline and I thought maybe it would be a little too hamfisted for me to enjoy, and I also knew that any movie with that kind of premise would be adored by the critics, whether it was actually good or not. <br/><br/>Turns out this movie managed to be nuanced, deeply unsettling, heart-pumping thrilling and downright hilarious all at once. It really hits every mark you could ever want from a movie like this. Daniel Kaluuya did a spectacular job, and although there are a lot of excellent survivor-trope characters played by excellent actors in a lot of great horror/slasher/thrillers, I honestly think Kaluuya takes the cake for being the absolute best. Which is not something I say lightly, since I am a huge fan of thriller/slasher/horrors with the survivor turning the tables during the climax, particularly when they have a unique twist (a la ""You're Next"", ""The House of the Devil"", ""Babysitter""). Basically what I'm trying to say is that while this movie is in a lot of ways a very particular trope that is popular right now (and that I happen to love), it also manages to be incredibly fresh and unpredictable. <br/><br/>I found myself wanting to re-watch the movie immediately after finishing it. And if you're like me, and you find the ""white people are all veiled racists"" messaging in a movie incredibly off-putting (which is the reason I stupidly avoided this classic for so long), just forget all that and watch the movie anyways. When it comes to the racial element, I think there's a number of different ways you could read into it, and IMO that was entirely intentional. <br/><br/>The important and enjoyable part of this movie (I think) is just how well it puts the viewer in Chris' shoes, such that you can't help but feel the confusion, suspicion, terror and then dread at all the exact same moments he does. Even if you know precisely what's coming. That may not sound like a lot, but particularly for a seasoned horror movie fan, it's exceedingly rare that a movie hits the notes at just the right times in just the right ways to put the audience right into the protagonists shoes every single time. It's terrifying, unsettling, funny and satisfying in a way most horror movies try desperately to be, but very rarely succeed in actually being. Get Out succeeds over and over and over and over. Just watch it."
"blanbrn","8","14","27","20 December 2017"," A mix and blend of horror and drama a social mind spin.
","Finally saw ""Get Out"" one of the most talked about movies of 2017 and I must say this work from director Jordan Peele was interesting as it's a take on society and a spin on race and class as it's blended with themes and elements of drama and horror and the film twist with suspense it's a real guesser and almost mind numbing.<br/><br/>The story is that of an interracial couple Chris(newcomer Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose(Allison Williams from ""HBO's"" ""Girls"") who one weekend drive to visit the well to do parents of Rose. And from the start Chris feels out of place even though Rose swears that her parents are not against black people. Still all of the hired help and servants are black it seems like slave days. And the talk and questions used around Chris make him uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Then strange happenings begin is it real or is just Chris seeing things? This film has you thinking too, as it's a plague as it's like Chris is falling deeper and deeper into this secret society as his entire mind and world is changing. Really this picture is a strange and different style of horror suspense drama that twist with a spin of race and social themes."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","14","27","6 December 2017"," ""It really doesn't matter if you're 'Black or White""
","""Get Out"" was written and directed by Jordan Peele and was his directorial debut. And a hot item on his resume it is too.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya (""Sicario"") plays African-American Chris Washington who, nervously, takes a trip 'upstate' to meet the parents of his cute white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams). The parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford, best known as Josh Lyman from ""The West Wing"") and Missy (Catherine Keener, "" Captain Phillips""), are extremely welcoming.<br/><br/>But the weekend coincides with an ""annual gathering"" of family and friends, and events quickly take a left turn into ""The Twilight Zone"", with anti-smoking hypnosis and a bizarre game of Bingo where the win is so substantial that playing becomes a 'no brainer'. Can Chris 'Get Out', with his mind still intact, before it's too late?<br/><br/>This is a really clever script by Peele. The film baits you into thinking this is some redneck-inter-racial-revenge flick, but actually the colour of the skin is almost irrelevant. (Or is it? This angle is left deliciously vague). Some of the filming is spectacularly creepy, with the hypnosis scene being reminiscent to me of the excellent ""Under The Skin"". And never has a teaspoon in a cup of tea been a more devastating weapon.<br/><br/>I seemed to have talked at length this year in this blog on the subject of the ""physics of horror"": the story elements hanging together in a satisfying – albeit sometimes in an unbelievable – way. ""Get Out"" delivers this to perfection, keeping its powder dry until the closing moments of the film before delivering a series of satisfying ""Ah!"" relevatory moments.<br/><br/>While the 'physics' of the film is good the 'biology' is bonkers, featuring a plot point from the terrible first episode of the 3rd season of the original ""Star Trek"" (if you can be bothered to look that up!). But I'll forgive this, parking my incredulity, to salute what I think is one of the year's most novel and impressive low-budget indie horror films.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

Whoever gets recently starring in a action movie in 2016, ""Keanu"" along with Method Man, Will Forte, Luis Guzman and Jason Mitchell. However, it was a comedy-horror film called ""Get Out"" would notified basis of Eddie Murphy film. Suddenly, the black folks would hear ""GET OUT"" and they've split. <br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya was the good actor in a movie and I really like the final fight scene. Because, it's more than way often than the other horror movies. But Allison Williams from Girls on HBO, will make her feature film debut. I'm very good about that movie. It was the great movie of ever made.<br/><br/>Don't you get worried about Oscars."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","10","18","30 June 2017"," Subtle Mystery at it's Finest
","Get Out follows a young black man as he goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents. From there, weirder and weirder things begin to take place. <br/><br/>To start, the acting is pretty solid. Daniel Kaluuya as the leading character paints himself as something of the modern 20-something- year-old. He's relatable, he's mostly interesting, he's got his flaws and he's got his perks. And he's a photographer. Gotta appeal to the hipster crowd too. In all seriousness his character is very realistically played, but even more so when he needs to hit an emotional high note this guy nails it. Starring alongside him is Allison Williams whom I believe said that this was her first movie. Seeing her on screen that's not something you'd think. She's so subtle and so well played, even if she is a little dull from time to time. You can tell that's part of her character, that's what she's going for and it actually works really well. The performances of the two parents, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, are great as well. I'm going to sound like a broken record here but again, subtlety, they got it. In a film of overwhelming mystery, the subtlety here plays a key role and works fantastically from start to finish. <br/><br/>But what are good actors without a good screenplay? The writing is quite good. While a few lines came off as forced or awkward, the vast majority of it works very well, and the way the story progresses is engaging and very mysterious. It never really hints at what the end goal may be, and yet it makes sense when it's finally revealed. There's no 'eureka!' moment when the twist is revealed, yet that may be the very reason it worked so well. Because once again, subtlety. <br/><br/>Probably the biggest star of this film is Jordan Peele, the director. It's hard to believe that this is the first time he's made a full length film. His ability to direct is fantastic. The way it's shot is that of a professional, and I look forward to seeing more of his filmmaking career in the near future. <br/><br/>Most horror movies feature generic music cues and sharp, loud sound effects to keep the viewer awake through it's entirely boring scare tactics, and while Get Out does use those same sound effects, they are woven into actual music that is quite good. And I get the feeling that the music was partially used to satire typical horror movies, considering how unique this one is compared to others. And while it may come off of as generic or lazy to 'cue the creepy music when creepy stuff happens', the music is still good and, upon a second watch, actually justified. <br/><br/>While I enjoyed Get Out for the most part both times I saw it, that's probably my biggest problem with it. The first time I saw it I didn't care at all. The build up seemed to be going nowhere, and it was all just so weird. However, when the twist ending rolled around I suddenly understood and enjoyed it much more. Upon a rewatch I was able to pick up on the things I missed, along with some unexpected comedic foreshadowing. And while some of the comedy did work, some of it didn't. Unlike the trailer made it seem, the movie is hardly a satire on modern horror, or even a comedy to begin with. It's very much a mystery, so don't go into it expecting to laugh. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed Get Out. The acting, writing, and story are good, and the soundtrack is effectively used. It's a subtle mystery that hits more high notes than low ones. It's one that I can certainly see myself returning to time and time again to see and pick up on new things. In the end I'd definitely recommend it, but moreover, I'd recommend seeing it more than once."

Deserving of special attention, though, is Lil Rel Howery, who plays Chris' best friend and contact in the outside world and steals every single scene he's in.<br/><br/>So,Get Out is a much needed refreshing breeze for a new age of horror film.Most innovative horror since It Follows.<br/><br/>My Rating 7.75/10"
"matt_fresh","8","10","18","21 June 2017"," New review
","I recently watched this movie again with my girlfriend who hasn't seen it and I have to retract my original opinion. I think I was in a bad mood when I first saw it in theatres and blasted it, but now seeing it for the second time it's a very original intense thriller turned horror by the end. My only big knock on this movie is that within the first 25 mins or so I already had figured out what was happening, not to the extent that it goes to, but it was predictable. It's worth a watch."
"Skaigear","8","10","18","19 June 2017"," Get Out is not simply an enjoyable film, but also works very well as a social commentary about race relations
","Get Out is a satirical horror film written and directed by actor- comedian Jordan Peele. Having never watched his sketch comedy series, Key & Peele or any of his film roles, this was my first experience with any content of his. Consider me a fan – I was very impressed by his keen eye for both comedy and horror, which is traditionally very difficult to juggle, since tonally the genres are so different. But Peele knew exactly what it wanted to do with the film and went and did it. At first glance the movie might seem bigoted and heavy-handed to some, but when you actually watch it, that is not really the case at all. It is not a Scary Movie-like parody, which was my biggest initial concern, instead it plays it straight for the entirety, dramatic when it needs to be, and scary when the moment comes. The funny bits comes naturally mostly from situations and personalities of characters, and never once did it cross the line where I could not take it seriously. It is this earnestness and balance that really stood out to me.<br/><br/>The movie is about a photographer, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) going on weekend trip to meet his white girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) family for the first time, the only problem is they do not know he is black. Most of us have probably faced a similar circumstance where we have to meet our boyfriend or girlfriend's parents, and especially if he or she is of a different race, ethnicity or nationality, an extra layer of awkwardness is going to be there. The movie relates this awkward scenario brilliantly to the audience. When Chris arrives at the parents' house, he meets the father, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), mother, Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener) and brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones). At first everything seemed fine, but then Chris begins to realize a few things are not quite right. From their overly nice demeanor to him to the fact that the family's black servants act very strange and creepy, Chris just wants to survive the weekend and go home.<br/><br/>On a surface level the film passes as a good mystery, horror thriller, but that is not all it is. If you want to watch this as just a scary movie, you will enjoy it, there are some jump scares, but just like the situation that Chris was in, things are more than meets the eye. Jordan Peele made the movie first and foremost to be a commentary of social issues and privileges. The entire Armitage family seems really nice to Chris outwardly but reading between the lines, you can sense the insensitivity and hostility when they ask him things like ""what's his sport?"" or telling he has good ""genetic makeup."" To those whom are aware of things like this in real life, it will either cause you to groan or smile, maybe even a little bit of both.<br/><br/>The acting here is really good all around. Kaluuya as the main lead is calm, collected and likable, but to me the couple of standouts amongst the cast are Caleb Landry Jones as the girlfriend's brother, and Lil Rel Howery as Chris' friend, Rod. Jones really only has one scene, but he absolutely stole it in my opinion. He was intimidating and strangely charming as the brother who is trying to know more about his sister's new boyfriend. Howery as the TSA friend who is taking care of Chris' dog back home was utterly hilarious in every scene he is in. He kind of reminds me Anthony Anderson when he was still appearing in every other movie.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the movie has a few jump scares, but nothing too major. The horror mostly stems from the atmosphere and the uncertainty of Chris' situation. There were a couple shots here that sent chills down my spine. My favorite one being the dinner scene where Mrs. Armitage goes back to the kitchen to get the dessert, only to have the door swing open to reveal the maid already standing there holding the carrot cake staring disturbingly into the camera. The black servants who act and speak very white not only create discomfort and dissonance with Chris, but with the audience as well.<br/><br/>A sign of a good movie is when it takes its time to properly set things up early and then having it pay off at the end. This movie does a masterful job at that. Every detail introduced to the audience is not wasted. Chris is a photographer, how does that matter? Photographs and photography is a reoccurring motif and plays a major role in the plot. Mr. Armitage is a neurosurgeon and Mrs. Armitage is a psychologist for a reason. The cop at beginning, Rose backs up her boyfriend and Jeremy's desire to have an MMA match with Chris? Not going to spoil anything, but all these things pay dividends at the end, and if you pay attention, it makes the movie even more well-rounded and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Get Out is not simply an enjoyable film, but also works very well as a social commentary about race relations and real life innate fears of meeting one's significant other's parents. The whole movie just gels really well from beginning to end, and there is really not much fault to be had. If I have to nitpick about something though, it is the movie could have been more gory and violent towards the end. After witnessing Chris' journey, it would have definitely been earned and justified to display maximum carnage on screen. But that is neither here nor there, because this is still a great entry in the horror genre with or without the gore. I would say you should definitely get out and watch this movie."
"arungeorge13","8","10","18","5 June 2017"," Review – Get Out (2017) .. An excellent fusion of racial satire and horror! (80%)
","Jordan Peele's (of 'Key & Peele' fame) debut directorial is a must- watch for plenty of reasons. The social commentary made on the dark themes of racism, slavery and their implied horrors, the clever undercurrent of satirical humor, the eerily odd performances from the ensemble, the smart unfurling of twists, the Afro-American inspired music..pretty much everything deserves applause!<br/><br/>There is quite a bit of homage paid to certain films such as 'The Stepford Wives' and 'Rosemary's Baby'. The early scenes carry an unquestionable sense of mystery, the screenplay is laced with umpteen instances that raise ominous questions in the minds of viewers. This is not a film where the main character keeps taking one irrational decision after the other. The writing is spot-on, and the direction first-rate. Daniel Kaluuya aptly underplays his performance, which is exactly what the character Chris warrants.<br/><br/>'Get Out' doesn't exactly boast of a completely original storyline. Karyn Kusama's 'The Invitation' is another film that comes to mind, when it comes to the setting. Where Peele scores as writer is in some of those scenes where Chris encounters the dark-skinned servants of the house and a guest whose demeanor is increasingly unsettling. Deliciously packed at 104 minutes, the film leaves absolutely no room for second thoughts. The satire is never forced; it just meshes with the proceedings in a paranoid sort-of way.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, 'Get Out' is the kind of film that is bound to fetch divisive feedback. People may not like the film for being in-your- face blunt at times, but thankfully it does not follow the regular tropes associated with a horror flick (such as jumpscares or bizarre flashback sequences). Instead, Peele requests the viewer to assimilate the characters, the decisions they take and their consequential impact. Overall, 'Get Out' is indeed a remarkable debut which is well worth the late-night discussion as well as repeat-viewing.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert – The climactic showdown is delightfully messy with some spectacularly thought-out kills. Had to mention this, as the movie scores additional points on this front."
"ajfhoward","10","10","18","5 June 2017"," Fantastic! But don't watch the trailer
","I was fortunate enough to watch this without watching any of the trailers or having any prior knowledge of it beforehand. It was a thrilling ride! However I would say that the trailer retrospectively gives too much away. It is very clever and I love how it drip feeds you tiny bits of information. Dare I say, one of my favourite movies of all time!"
"CinemaClown","Null","10","18","4 June 2017"," Smart, Subversive & Sardonic, 'Get Out' Is The First Assured Masterpiece of 2017
","A terrific blend of horror & dark comedy that interweaves its ingeniously layered narrative with timely social commentary to deliver a nail-biting experience that's accomplished on all scales, Get Out is a smart, subversive & sardonic delight that's neither overt nor covert, and offers a cinematic ride so effective, thrilling & entertaining that the fact that it is actually a directorial debut makes it all the more commendable."
"zkonedog","8","10","18","27 May 2017"," An Inventive Horror/Thriller
","Though I won't give away any major spoilers in this review, the main reason I clicked the ""spoiler alert"" button is because of this: I don't usually like telling people that a film will have an ending they can never imagine. ""Get Out"" is one of those types of films, however, and it can't really be discussed with referencing that very fact.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Get Out"" sees Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) & her boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) going to do the first ""meet the parents"" routine with the Armitage's. Upon arriving, Chris (initially worried about being ""the one black guy"") starts to realize that things are a bit strange. Rose's parents Missy (Catherine Keener) & Dean (Bradley Whitford), as well as brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), all act strangely around Chris, and things take a deeper turn when all the other black people (maid, groundskeeper, family guest, etc.) act odd too. Is Chris just jumpy about the new setting...or is something strange actually going on?<br/><br/>The thing I like the most about ""Get Out"" is that it creates substantial doubt in the mind of viewers. In terms of horror/thriller flicks, I find that to be a key element. Until the last 15-20 minutes of the film, you won't have a good read on any of the events. Too often, scary movies purposely put themselves into convenient boxes (likely for marketing purposes). Fortunately, ""Get Out"" does nothing of the sort. Instead, director Jordan Peele revels in keeping things a mystery until the very end.<br/><br/>Another thing to like about ""Get Out"" is its sly social commentary. Made in a decade fraught with racial tension, Peele addresses those ideas (sometimes seriously, sometimes with humor) but is frank about them. This allows the film to work almost as much as social commentary as it provides tension.<br/><br/>Of course, that brings us to the ending: You absolutely won't see it coming. I'm confident enough to reveal that because it is indeed so unique. Again, the credit goes to the writing & Peele here, as the film is set up in such a way that literally anything can happen in the end. When ""anything"" literally does happen, then, it is quite a sight to behold.<br/><br/>While ""Get Out"" isn't the best thriller I've ever seen (a character supposedly providing comic relief really took me out of the experience from time to time), it is certainly the most original in quite some time. It uses deft social commentary, and air of mystery, and an atmosphere of tension to lure in viewers. By the end, you'll be totally invested in the characters and their predicaments."
"DVR_Brale","8","10","18","10 May 2017"," Creeps slowly and bursts formidably
","I have to be honest with you: when I first saw how good approval this movie had got I immediately thought that must be due to both actor and producer being black. I was wrong. Get Out is one the best horror movies in the last decade standing alongside with It Follows and The Babadook who have got over eighty Metascore rating as well which is very rare for a horror movie to have.<br/><br/>So we are following an interracial couple visiting her rich (white) parents. Chris (her boyfriend) is a photographer and a very down-to-earth guy who may feel, well, a bit awkward surrounded by a bunch of rich white people. From the moment they arrive things look kinda shady. Nothing in particular prone to much suspect, but that gut feeling tells you that this family, least said, might not be the healthiest one. Creating this quaint ambient is what Get Out does the best. Not only that, but Jordan Peele even managed to fully utilize this mystery elements by creating few very eerie and unpredictable plot twists.<br/><br/>Story itself isn't much of a big deal but does what is supposed to do: it creeps slowly and bursts formidably. Hence, Get Out is not fast paced (like Green Room) but rather makes you think about what is going on here. Different relationship which characters form with each other are worth noticing too. It is truly formidable to have people who you trust turn their back on you in most terrible way. Chris is experiencing snippets of this all the time but may as well think he is the problem. Just wait till you see the grand finale with this aspect!<br/><br/>It is always dangerous to combine serious horror/mystery/thriller with humor because it might create a conflict between these two contrary sides. Get Out breaks the ""monotony of tension"" by introducing a character who doesn't occupy much time not undermines basic genre and manages to somehow ""reset"" the atmosphere by breaking it with humor; the mystery side then takes the lead and begins to glue the atmosphere back together, this time even stronger until everything bursts due to pressure. <br/><br/>We've seen some basic mechanism which Peele utilized so let me immediately conclude. Get Out is a serious candidate for the best horror movie of the last decade or so. All the elements stick together because there is a strong atmosphere which serves as a glue. It is scary and funny. Get out of here and see it!"
"mote99","Null","10","18","7 May 2017"," A very clever horror film that also contains some thought-provoking subtext about race relations...
","I saw this one recently and enjoyed it...<br/><br/>Get Out is a very clever horror film that also contains some thought-provoking subtext about race relations, just below its surface. It also has a number of good laughs in it, so it's bending a few genre conventions here, methinks. It's an entertaining genre film, but it also has some social commentary in it too, so it works on more than one level.<br/><br/>All the performances are strong, but Daniel Kaluuya is particularly effective playing a boyfriend caught up in a scenario that isn't entirely what it appears to be on the surface. Catherine Keener is also very memorable in this one, playing a mom who might be more than just a typical nurturing mother. But there's more than one memorable performance in this movie; the entire cast is very good.<br/><br/>Anyway, thumbs up from me. Get Out is one of the best horror flicks I've seen this year, and it's definitely worth checking out. This is Jordan Peele's first film as a director, and it will be interesting to see what he does next."
"wasimmaqbool1","8","10","18","4 May 2017"," Exceptional, A Must Watch
","Although I can safely say that I can watch anything except ""HORROR"". A genre I avoid at all costs. But then came ""Get Out"" and the buzz was so high that it was really difficult to let it pass.<br/><br/>And let me say that how wrong i was and how beautiful the movie was. The premise is an age old tale, but it is not what you say but the way say it is important.it makes a movie good or bad for me. <br/><br/>This movie really have a strong script, good actors and the net result is amazing.<br/><br/>I would recommend everyone to watch it."
"MrDHWong","8","10","18","3 May 2017"," If David Lynch and the Coen Brothers collaborated to make a blaxploitation comedy, with a dash of horror for good measure
","Get Out is a horror comedy written and directed by Jordan Peele. One of the cleverest movies of its genre I have ever seen, it leaves an impression on the viewer thanks to its underlying social satire and great performances from its cast.<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a young African-American man, travels with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to meet her parents at their wealthy family estate. While there, Chris makes himself at home but soon discovers that not everything is as normal and orderly as it seems on the surface.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a slow burner, the plot doesn't become especially engaging until about halfway through the second act. However, this is all worth it for the highly satisfying conclusion that has been building up the entire time. Most of the film's characters, on the other hand, are interesting from the very beginning, particularly the protagonist Chris and his backstory. The quirky and surreal vibe of the film feels like if David Lynch and the Coen Brothers collaborated to make a blaxploitation comedy, with a dash of horror for good measure. Overall, writer/director Jordan Peele's debut effort is a great success and I look forward to seeing more of his films in the not-too-distant future.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"CountJonnie","7","10","18","3 May 2017"," Builds flawlessly on tension and anticipation
","This movie probably fools everyone with the opening scene, after which you'll be guessing what the real genre, horror, thriller, drama etc. is. After that beginning, the atmosphere changes back to getting to know the characters. Without too much development, it keeps a perfect pace, to keep you wondering what's next.<br/><br/>A likable but not overacting or bland character, in a new environment that will keep everyone still guessing, will end up in a situation in which the viewer will rapidly realize what ""the sunken place"" is, without losing all credibility.<br/><br/>One creepy party and one revelation later, the viewer will finally know what genre, and what kind of movie we are watching. A movie that reinvents creepy movies, with the only small flaw being that after the twist, things go (too) fast. Everything else, acting, characters, surroundings, works perfect!!"
"spencergrande6","8","10","18","22 April 2017"," A near master class in tonal balance
","A near master class in tonal balance. Every scene can be viewed through a lens of either horror or comedy and it works; this is truly exceptional. A great reactionary performance from Daniel Kaluuya, full of responsive eye twitches and half-smirks that speak volumes.<br/><br/>The social satire cuts deep, especially in its revelation of a white liberal racism outside the stereotypical redneck variety, but the film relents a bit in the final act. Same goes for the horror elements; the finale is a bit of a stretch (even if it is fittingly cathartic) and the movie doesn't reach for the extreme hard enough to justify its more out- there elements (Behold the Coagula). It kind of falls awkwardly in the middle; a half measure."
"andremangabeira","8","10","18","22 April 2017"," Out of the ordinary movie experience
","Despite all the noise about racist, genre, etc..I think you should give a chance in watching this one, because at the very least you will be surprised with a great movie that comprises horror, suspense, dark humor and the most important, originality. I mean, forget the ghosts, the serial killers and all the most common clichés and free your mind for a refreshing movie experience. Plus, there is a comic relief with Lil rel Howery and his amazing character who definitely stole part of the show. Actually I cannot believe that it is a debut horror movie, because it is so good. I hope that the director keeps living up to the hype in future projects."
"destinylives52","8","10","18","15 April 2017"," Great horror/suspense/comedy
","From the mind of comedian Jordan Peele comes ""Get Out,"" a story of a black man (played by Daniel Kaluuya) who visits his white girlfriend's (played by Allison Williams) family in the suburbs and slowly finds out that things are very, very off with her family and servants.<br/><br/>Everything is OK at first: the parents are all smiles and greet Kaluuya with hugs; the father mentions how he would have loved to vote for Obama a third time; the father using various slang to show he's hip and down with the Negroes, etc. Then Kaluuya notices the odd behavior of the black servants; the thinly veiled, racist remarks of Williams' drunk brother; plus a weird dream of Kaluuya being hypnotized by Williams' mother. And this is just the start of Kaluuya's long nightmare that will have him fighting for his sanity and life as the full secret of his girlfriend's family is slowly unraveled.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when Kaluuya is told of the family secrets and the heinous plan of what is to be done to him.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is not just a very good suspense/thriller, it is also loaded with social commentary that are insightful, funny, and infuriating. Examples: a black man's worry of being caught in a rich, white neighborhood at night; the troubles that black men have to deal with when dating white women; white liberals who are constantly giving examples of how they are not bigots; the physical superiority of black men over white men; the mental superiority of white men over black men; and how trendy it is now to be black, as if the color of skin is some kind of accessory to flaunt.<br/><br/>The subject of race relations is a touchy one, and those who are overly sensitive may want to steer away from this movie. Everyone else, jump in and watch the movie and have a laugh. ""Get Out"" is, after all, a satire.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"CinemaOddity","9","10","18","12 April 2017"," I can't wait to see what Jordan Peele does next.
","Spoiler free<br/><br/>The thriller is a dying genre. What we have today is ACTION- thrillers. Ones that have car chases and big shootouts. Jordan Peele has proved Thriller is not completely dead. H uses excellent cinematography to build suspense and fright. The whole movie looks beautiful. Next is the acting. Daniel Kaluuya is perfect in this role. All of the family is eery and fits like a glove into the movie. Allison Williams is particularly convincing. The one problem I have is the building of suspense is a tad slow and the first two acts only increase in quality as it progresses. The third act is stunning and held my breath. It left smart references to the days of slavery and terms used my slave owners in the south. The humor is sharp and dark at most times(the Dahmer rant anyone?). Please go and see films like this and not ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Smurfs"", or any film that treats it's audience like money"
"valen060","8","10","18","5 April 2017"," Feels Like Standard Paranoia, Yet Driven Down A Different Turn
","I can now see why this psychological horror is so mind-bending. After catching this movie, I have to say that this is a thrill ride that continuously toyed with my perspective up until the terrible truth is unveiled midway into the film.<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a black man with a hobby in photography has a white girlfriend named Rose that live happily together in the city. When she then decides to finally introduce him to her parents in her hometown outside the city, they seem to welcome him in open arms. However, the townsfolk begin to show signs of odd behavior whenever Chris so much as approaches any of them or if he even speaks his mind in conversations. Chris becomes increasingly paranoid as he uncovers more to the town than meets the eye.<br/><br/>For comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut in a horror film and his pairing with ""Paranormal Activity"" producer Jason Blum, this is something that required more thought as the story began to play out. I honestly attempted to comprehend the motives of each character, but as I started deducing their reasons, it grows unsettling each time. Instead of racism being used as a plot device, it seems this is a bizarre twist on that subject matter by making the residence not racist, yet they add insult to injury in their true nature by giving off a form of liberal ignorance. There are moments in the film that were pretty laughable to ease the tension done by the leading man's best friend TSA Officer Rod (played by comic Lil Rel Howery). And I say this doesn't ruin the ride, more like only gives depth into what his character knows what's best for himself and his friend. In the end, this isn't a movie made for cheap jumps or thrills. Instead, it kept the gears in my mind constantly turning and my curiosity growing with how the horror conventions were approached differently here. It's certainly interesting."
"alan-05036","9","10","18","3 April 2017"," A must-see film for everybody
","It's been a while since I have left the cinema wanting to talk about every detail of the plot with my wife! If I was to be critical it would only be a few picky details but the acting, the plot and the cinematography drew me right in - from early on I felt ""awkward"" for Chris (Daniel Kaluuya)... in fact I felt uncomfortable throughout most of the film but enjoyed every minute. The racial tension and the laughable arrogance of the girlfriends apparently perfect white, affluent middle class family, distracted the viewer from what was to come, despite all the clues. There is so much detail in a script full of psychological study, social statement and dry wit I feel I must watch it again to fully appreciate it. The blood and guts of the final scenes brought the film back to it genre but overall I think this is a must-see film for everybody."
"LessThanPaddy","8","10","18","28 March 2017"," Unique.
","It's been some time since I enjoyed a thriller or even a horror as much as Get Out. Generally, I can watch similar films but only maintain a mild interest, they may not necessarily be bad films but rather they just fail to engage as much as they could. Quite often they're predictable and you can call what's going to happen long before it takes place. Get Out however, is a unique thriller that explores the genre differently, and in my opinion rather successfully.<br/><br/>Firstly, it is acted very well. It has great character development, but it also has twists and turns surrounding the characters that I didn't see coming. The protagonists' best friend is a great addition to the cast for comic value, yet even with his hilarious lines the seriousness of the film is not depleted... not even a little. Secondly, the directing is very different from other films, but in a good way. Interesting camera angles, hues and perspectives are explored, being coupled with well written dialogue. <br/><br/>Get Out is a great story that keeps you invested and continuously guessing what's going to happen next. After watching the trailer I felt I could predict where this film was going, and that I could summarise how the plot was going to play out before even seeing it... I was wrong, so wrong. Get Out does great things for the thriller genre, a welcome change."
"pointblank223","8","10","18","21 March 2017"," Did not see that coming
","Spoiler! Man this movie takes the old sayings Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover to a whole new meaning. This movie had me on edge the whole time. My first thought when I started the movie was, Aw why are they trying to come at the brotha. Its horror mixed with just enough comedy, the perfect film cocktail. You know some things you got to see for yourself so I will not go into details, but there is definitely a twist that will catch you off guard. When I finished watching this movie I thought to myself, OK, I am officially freaked out and with good reason. There are some things that I felt could have been better, I refuse to nit-pic. By far one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. So go check it out and then you decide, but when you are sitting there with your mouth hanging open remember, I told you so."
"kaptenvideo-89875","8","10","18","20 March 2017"," Oh yeah: a horror movie that is actually good. A rare bird, this, no?
","You could predict the quality – or at least freshness – from the trailers but nothing will quite prepare you for this joyride which is a contender for the best horror movie of recent times, and crafty enough to satisfy also those who don't really care about horror movies. Such as me.<br/><br/>Brother (Daniel Kaluuya) dating a white girl (Allison Williams) is dragged to her family estate for the weekend. But something is off from the very start of the journey, and it gets stranger by the minute. <br/><br/>There's a variety of cool cats in smaller supporting roles and you will probably not know them by name, but I will list them anyway: Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the mother and father, Caleb Landry Jones as the brother, Betty Gabriel as the house maid, LilRel Howery as one of the funniest cases of black guy acting like Hollywood comedy black guy I can remember. <br/><br/>IMDb claims he is a rising stand-up comedy star, and he's surely an instant crowd-pleaser here. You will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen.<br/><br/>But back to the movie at hand. Get Out"" is an effective horror piece but director-screenwriter Jordan Peele's ambitions are decidedly wider than that, and he can meet the high standards that he has set. <br/><br/>If I have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment, then I would say that Peele proves to be a master storyteller. <br/><br/>There's a surprising diversity and depth to material. It can be followed as social commentary (what it's like to be different; how covertly racist the modern society can be), classic horror story (adventurer braving the lands unknown) and a crafty cat-and-mouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every ""chess piece"" is moved and how the others react.<br/><br/>In addition, there's an unexpected comic relief going on, mainly acted out by LilRey Howrey as mentioned above. And last but not least, the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural, convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesn't have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements. <br/><br/>Peele actually uses some of those too, but in a way that doesn't feel exploitative; these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels.<br/><br/>If I may nitpick a little, the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward and/or unpleasant situations like in black version of Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or something. This one-note-performance by Kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the action-filled final act.<br/><br/>But all in all, the chosen approach is understandable because Get Out"" is only 103 minutes long and has a lot happening. And to credit the cast one more time, everybody's offering a top-quality work, even the people in smallest roles. <br/><br/>Considering how much their faces are shown up-close, it's no mean feat. I'd even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times.<br/><br/>There are also some pacing issues, mostly during the end which would be more hard-hitting if played out faster, especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle. <br/><br/>Of course, that would require attentive watching and not checking your phone all the time, as many youngsters do these days. Also, horror fans would probably like to see more gore but this is not a problem in itself. So the movie's not near perfect but what is, eh?<br/><br/>Get Out"" is that rare kind of horror movie that really deserves some major-ass awards or nominations. Maybe Oscar noms for original screenplay, directing, and several possible picks from supporting cast (Betty Gabriel, Bradley Whitford, LilRel Howery if I can pick three). <br/><br/>If you liked this little gem that deserves to be called born classic, then you will be pleased to know that it's been already popular in cinemas. It only cost 4.5 million USD and has already brought 113 mil from the U.S. box office alone.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is the best movie of 2017 I've seen yet. And I have seen ten! Get off your ass and run towards the cinemas!"
"christonr-64261","7","10","18","17 March 2017"," Peele-ing Back the Race Curtain
","Jordan Peele's first feature film offers a worryingly bleak reflection of race relations, segregation and stereotyping in what will undoubtedly be one of 2017's most troubling (and terrifying) films. A psychological thriller dressed up as classic horror, the sense of impending doom created right from the off - with an African American man walking through a white suburban neighborhood at night - leaves you with a sense of dread but also numbness; and, to an extent, helpless voyeurism.<br/><br/>Though preposterous at times, the twists and turns taken (and sometimes alluded to, but then swiftly negated) do leave you guessing as to a potential solution to the many problems presented to both our main character, Chris (brilliantly played by Daniel Kaluuya) and best friend, Rod (Lil Rel Howery); both of whom appear to represent specific - yet broad - archetypes of modern day black men in America. The overall eeriness and gloom of Peele's film is sometimes - intentionally- undercut by the voices of certain characters for comedic effect; yet this could be seen as another very real world commentary on the rubbishing of institutionalized racism which is still so prevalent in modern day society. Whilst not perfect, Get Out is a bold, daring and unflinching portrait of the 21st century racial landscape."
"ElMaruecan82","10","16","32","24 December 2017"," An instant classic that won't ""get out"" of your head easily!
","What a fresh wind of creativity exuding from that ""little"" movie. <br/><br/>And by little, there's no disrespect meant of course, just highlighting the not-so-trivial fact that this is a directorial debut from Jordan Peele with an actor who was relatively unknown Mr. Daniel Keluuya, and yet what we've got here is a game-changer, one of these ""little"" movies popping out of nowhere but leaving in your mind the constant impression that they will be standing in cinematic memories for a long, long time. That's how 'good' ""Get Out"" is.<br/><br/>And I won't insist enough on its originality, if we were in 2007, I would have gone straight to the point but we're in 2017, a year where creativity seems to have been declining for good: Disney recycles the classics with the cheap excuse of money-grabbing live-action milking on previously built successes and big directors take the easy way of remaking, rebooting, and chaining up sequels, with no super vision and a lot of supervision. A time where the ""Star Wars"" series became a soap space opera and for all the noises these movies make, all is desperately quiet on the cinematic Western front.<br/><br/>Now, Jordan Peele's film is made of ""old stuff"" but only in the way it totally deconstructs all the usual infuriating tropes of the horror genre and features, for once, a protagonist who's smart enough to figure out when things go suspicious and a ""sidekick"" who incarnates our own point of view and never goes for the face-palm inducting choice. If LilRel Howery manages to slip through the image of the helpful comic relief, Keluuya is simply just too good for words, and his performance covers such a wide range of emotions that I doubt the Academy will overlook him. <br/><br/>Now it's been three paragraphs and I can't get to the story yet, don't take it as pompousness, this is the very indicator of my enthusiasm, I don't need to tell the story because it's so good I would rather invite anyone to go see what's so good in it. Let's just say that it opens like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" where Chris Washington is getting ready for meeting the rich family of his white girlfriend Rose (Alison Williams) in a secluded house, the Armitages who can't stop delivering glorifying compliments on Obama or Jesse Owens yet hire black housekeepers who look so ""Uncle Tom"" it's painful to watch.<br/><br/>But the parts meant to raise our suspicion (I won't get too wordy on them) shine because of their roles within the plot and the various reactions of Keluuya. At first, he's not really in his element and tries to fit in, but his performance is so nuanced and subtle that sometimes you can feel the crispation in his smile, the unease in his eyes, and the way he always reaches for an eye contact with Allison, with the fragility of a child begging for a parent's reassuring sign. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener plays the Armitage parents and they're good at feigning emotions so that our suspicion is never pushed to that level where we expect the worst, Peele engages us in a harrowing journey where each step seems to take us downer toward a descent into hell but no matter what, we're never one step ahead of Chris. <br/><br/>The plot thickens with the first display of racism from the son, played by Caleb Landry Jones, and a mysterious group of white hosts coming for a garden party and where each one indulges to one of these patronizingly racist commentsturning slowly the film to an experience à la ""Rosemary's Baby"" where you can tell there's some conspiracy going on but people are so occasionally friendly, we're tempted, like Chris, to keep on a cool facade and give the benefit of the doubt. Of course, once Chris gets why he'd better get out, there's no way to get out and the film turns into one of the best horror movie experiences of recent years. I would go as far as saying that the film is an instant classic.<br/><br/>The action and the thrills escalate, driven by the usual horror elements, the deserted houses, the jump scares, a séance of hypnosis that alone should guarantee an Oscar nomination for Keluuya, but the film never recycles plot devices, it reinvents their use in a way that respects our intelligence. Indeed, ""Get Out"" is meant for viewers who've seen enough horror movies not to be tricked yet to better trick us. The film has an edge, a level of intelligence that is so bold and daring it can almost flirt with reverse parody, and maybe for that level of self-awareness, it has been nominated in the ""Comedy"" category for the Golden Globes"". Still, there's nothing comedic in the performances... although there are moments in the film that make you smile a lot... often, in a disturbing way.<br/><br/>So yes, this is a ""little"" movie that stands above all today's creations in a way I didn't think was possible. Let me explain this: I've often said that today, you could only make big budget blockbuster movies if you had a name OR an independent movie that tries to be socially relevant, you know, that deals with racism, politics, environment, men and women, homosexuality etc. It would be a lie to say that ""Get Out"" isn't relevant, it's perhaps one of the most intelligent recent movies to deal with racism especially in the way it highlights the mix of fascination and revulsion where the worst forms of racism are rooted... if it wasn't for that fascination, the plot wouldn't exist. <br/><br/>So, yes, ""Get Out"" is disturbing and subversively brilliant, but the social commentary is only one of the facets of its greatness, the film also works on the thrills' department and the way the action unfolds from one reveal to another until the climactic and satisfying conclusion... and that's only after a first viewing, I just realized that I failed to notice many hints and plot points and I guess it'll take me more viewings to get each time more of ""Get out""'s brilliance."

","This movie is a mixture of comedy and somewhat horror although I did not find it scary whatsoever. To me it felt more of a comedy and thriller, because the scary characters aren't scary. This movie does have good soundtrack, great acting by the black actors but the white actors are just bland. This movie would of been better if the white actors were maybe more scarier. However, it does keep you entertained depending on what you're into. If you're open minded and like thrillers and a bit of comedy then this movie is for you.

","Get Out was definetly not what i expected it to be. I was walking into watching this film expecting to get completely horrified but it resulted in teaching me a lesson. That racism is still here in 2017 and will most likely always stay in society.
It was clever in a way where it reminded me of the shinning with the refrence of room 237 and all the symbols and Easter eggs in graved into this film. The cinematography wasn't crazy but somehow tied in with other certain scenes which i thought was very clever. Ultimately this film just made me think and made me actually research about it numerous times and when a film is filled with so much information and layers like that you know its just a great film!"

","Although I marked this review for spoilers, I'll try to keep the spoilers to minimum and try to mention things subtly without revealing too much. But still, you've been warned, read at your own risk.<br/><br/>I have seen this film long after its release and by the time I watched the film it was already critically acclaimed. So my expectations were high, though I was also a little bit apprehensive knowing this is the first directing job of Jordan Peele. At the end, I can wholeheartedly say that it was even better than I expected. Technically this is a horror-comedy which is not my favorite genre. But this is a legit horror film and the horror parts were played straight, which is beautiful. The humor comes from the social commentary and there is also a comic relief character who is used very scarcely. I know Jordan Peele from their popular show Key and Peele (2012) and they are both great in that show. They are not only great comedians and writers, but also great actors and that is what made Key and Peele so good. I loved every skit in that show whereas I can't get through any SNL episode without cringing now and then. Jordan proved that he also has talent in directing, with this film. His strength is his observations on social issues and more specifically on racism. Now, I'm from Turkey, So I won't pretend that I understand all the minor, quantum level racial clashes when a black dude goes to meet his white girl friend's family. But it was still mostly relatable, even to me. There are a lot of smart details with its comments too. Despite their racism against the black people, there is also some envy from same people to their physical attributes and they want to be them. I also liked all the actors, especially the lady who played the servant. <br/><br/>I understand comedy and horror are the most subjective genres. The horror aspect of this film was very effective for me personally. But even if it is not very effective for you in the horror department, you can still enjoy it as a good thriller for it's a very well made film. And lastly, it was also very refreshing to see some different ideas in a horror film, other than zombies and vampires and other bs."

"robin-mcarthur-471-629717","1","18","37","25 April 2017"," Don't Believe The Hype
","Let me get one thing clear, my expectations were high when I sat down to watch this film. Everything I'd heard, everything I'd read suggested I was in for a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>That is not the case whatsoever. The script is contrived (I'm sorry, but the suggestion of racism within the female leads family was introduced with all the subtly of a brick through a window), the main characters unlikable, the set up pace too slow and the very concept of what was going to happen so ridiculous it betrayed any sense of commentary or message the film was trying to convey.<br/><br/>I'll accept this review isn't terribly insightful but in truth I don't want to waste any more time on it than I already have. That said, I feel compelled to warn people off from the OTT hype, with this seemingly just another ""fashionable movie"" (like Drive, which was another one that I found massively disappointing).<br/><br/>I'm afraid the writer/director isn't as clever as he thinks and this film is in no way as good as everyone thinks. I should have realised that from the opening scene where the man on-screen basically talks through what he's doing - something so unrealistic and ridiculous it took my breath away.<br/><br/>I've given this a very generous 2 star rating, although that's mostly because some of the cinematography was fairly decent."

Kaluuya was outstanding, and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.<br/><br/>Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I'm assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don't, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.<br/><br/>Brilliant, 10/10"

","I won't even go into minor details how a white person can feel while watching this movie. It's entirely rasistic toward any other color of skin but black. Starting from cliche bad white cop, ""classic"" white family who hate black people - but, wait a minute, want to be like them because black people are superior (it's stated in the movie more than once) etc.
The second bad thing is the acting. I could cope with one bad actor, maybe 2 or 3, but the whole crew can't express one single emotion right. The only solid actor was LilRel Howery and maybe, just maybe, Bradley Whitford. LilRel had a classic tvtrope role of a classic ""black guy"" in the movie that shouldn't been racist.
I could go on and on about this awful movie, but I will stop right now and just tell people who don't like engaging in current politic situation being on just ONE side, and one side only, to leave this movie to those kind of people"

","PROS: The acting in GET OUT was phenomenal, the best acting I've seen in this decade so far. The genuine fear the main character had was chilling, and the insanity that every other character played was impeccable. The acting, in my opinion, is what carried the film. Most of the other parts of what makes a film worth watching were very OK. The tension in the movie was good. This portion could've been much worse, but it had a very unique style to it. When you watch as many horror movies as I have you anticipate a certain style of rising action, but this film came at it from a different perspective. It wasn't my style, but I could understand and appreciate it from a very technical level.<br/><br/>CONS: With any horror movie there will be some cons. The ending in GET OUT felt very unfinished. To me it felt like the director couldn't come up with an ending as good as the rest of the film, so instead he settled for this very mediocre finale. But when you put that all aside there was one flaw that bothered me more than the rest. GET OUT was marketed as a ""big horror film"" or the ""most intense horror of 2017"" and these statements frustrated me because after watching the film it was quite obviously not a horror film, more or less a psychological thriller. I went in to this movie expecting one thing and preparing myself for that thing but in turn it delivered a completely different message. Was the movie good? 100% yes, but these negatives just stuck out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>www.chorror.com"

A happy ending is okay if executed properly, but random coincidences, no. It would have been a fitting end to a horror/thriller if the police officer from before had arrived on the scene to arrest our hero, who's fingerprints were on the hand-gun with the double-faced girlfriend aptly playing the role of the victim.<br/><br/>*** End of potential spoilers *** <br/><br/>Anyway, makes up for a great one-time watch thanks to the powerful acting, a masterful build-up, and a (90%) strong script."
"lavatch","Null","9","16","27 June 2017"," Multi-Layered Film Delivers a Punch
","""Get Out"" is a film with the perfect title. At around the midpoint, the audience cannot help but wish that the protagonist named Chris would find away to get out of his first visit to the home of the parents of his girlfriend.<br/><br/>The strength of this film is the careful layering of styles. At the outset, it appears as if the film is a straight drama of the introduction of the black boyfriend to the white woman's parents, much like the Sidney Poitier film ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" <br/><br/>But the film smoothly segues into the horror genre when it slowly becomes apparent that Chris has walked into a trap. The early glimpses of the two black household servants and the hypnosis session occurring without the consent of Chris were two of the key transitional scenes.<br/><br/>But the filmmakers successfully incorporate yet another element into the mix: humor. The sly comic timing of Chris's best friend Rod, who is an airport TSA investigator, is at the heart of each of his scenes. The humor serves as a leavening to what otherwise would have been a one-dimension horror story. <br/><br/>It was not entirely clear what message the filmmakers were attempting to deliver about racism. The film's premise of the ""Coagula procedure,"" or the surgery being performed by Dr. Armitage that is the rough equivalent of a frontal lobotomy was shocking. Another repugnant scene was the modern equivalent of a slave auction when the various bidders were holding up their Bingo cards; one only realizes in hindsight that they were bidding on Chris. But what was the point of these shocking scenes and the overall premise of eugenics?<br/><br/>In sum, this film offers a wide palette of thriller/horror, drama, and wry humor that make for a fast-paced and engaging viewing experience. Against a $4.5 million film budget, ""Get Out"" has earned international grosses of more than $250 million. Kudos to director Jordan Peele for imaginative and provocative filmmaking!"

","Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a young African American photographer whose white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) wants to take him to meet her parents, psychotherapist mother Missy (Catherine Keener) and neurosurgeon father Dean (Bradley Whitford). Chris is worried that Rose hasn't told them that he is black, but she assures him that they won't be the slightest bit bothered about his race. As it happens, his colour turns out to be the least of his worries as his growing suspicions that there is something very sinister afoot at the Armitage house turn out to be well founded.<br/><br/>Not long after Chris arrives at Rose's parent's house, matters begin to get weird, Mr and Mrs Armitage's affable behaviour a little too perfect, while their home help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundsman Walter (Marcus Henderson), act in a manner that can best be described as freakin' bizarre. A party for friends and family introduces more strange characters into the mix, most of whom are politely racist. Something clearly isn't right about this picture, but the viewer is wisely kept as much in the dark as Chris, while director Jordan Peele exhausts all of the possible paranoia/conspiracy angles. All the strings are pulled together in the final act, in which Peele reveals the outlandish truth, going for tension and scares, with just a little gore for good measure.<br/><br/>As a Caucasian, I guess I could take offence at the film's portrayal of white folk, who, with no exception, are evil bastards who covet the physically superior body of the African American.

Jordan Peele used it in a way that was reminiscent of British humour, which is something i really enjoyed. On top of that, we have some first rate suspense and a strong sense of anticipation.

","I am a huge fan of Jordan Peele. I loved Key and Peele and loved that the duo stepped into making a film with a pretty good comedy in Keanu. All that said I had some strong reservations about Jordan Peele stepping out of his comedic element and into a horror especially one that is psychological. I didn't know what to make of the trailer. I was thinking that this had to be one of those ""horrors with humor"", I just couldn't see Peele stepping that far out of his comfort zone. While I feel this film gets overrated by the masses, its quite a successful venture for Peele.<br/><br/>The film follows a black man named Chris and his white girlfriend Rose. Rose decides to introduce her boyfriend to her family. While everything seems peachy at first it soon becomes obvious to Chris that something is way wrong. The black workers in the house act so weird and reserved and the extended family and friends of Rose are far too intrigued by Chris and the color of his skin. While I won't divulge any deeper into the plot, I'd say this was a fairly satisfying film. Its an interesting effort by Peele, that has some real world relativism.<br/><br/>The scares are predictable and come in moments that are exactly where we expect them to be. The film still keeps you engaged and entertained and coming up with theories of your own as you go along for the right. The film is kind of predictable at least the main arc of what is actually going on with the family. That really doesn't take away from what is given. There is a fair bit of nice imagery, which goes to show some of the creativity Peele had for this. The social and racial aspect of this film can't be denied, its a bit of a social commentary.<br/><br/>This will probably be a breakout role for Kaluuya, he's come a long way from that episode of Black Mirror. The film received higher praise than i think it deserves but it does a good job at being a thrilling and engaging film. I am very optimistic about seeing whatever Jordan Peele decides to do next because I am certain now that he is very capable of going outside the comedy box.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

(And not because of the film itself, but the ""racial issue"" the story outlines) <br/><br/>The writer of this flick, Jordan Peele, is a pure genius. Not only did he give us something completely new, fresh, and completely original, but he had the guts to touch on what will surely be a completely controversial topic. <br/><br/>Love or hate this movie, sparks are sure to fly over the story line and subject matter. You know that a federal issue is made out of anything and everything these days by the bleeding heart - political correctness gang and everything is made out to be racial issue or have prejudicial undertones that is going to send people off the deep end or result in the infamous ""hurt feelings"". So if you are one of those cry babies, you better pass on this movie or you might just have a stroke.<br/><br/>For everyone else, this surprising and delightful little horror flick is a must see! Peele not only is able to keep you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat, but also keeps you guessing from start to finish. Just when you think you know where the plot is going, BOOM! You get tossed in a different direction. And just as a bonus, there are some great comedic moments.<br/><br/>So before everyone sees this movie and starts getting ticked off and ugly about the subject matter, do yourself a favor and go see this mini masterpiece of bizarre macabre! Hurry before the PC whiners ruin it for you!"

","A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate."" This movie is quite Unique and in its own way. The moment it starts we are thrown into the typical Girlfriend/boyfriend plot along with the Meet The Parents. However what makes this movie so special is how it takes all the old classic clichés and turns it into something extremely original. We all know from the beginning that there is something wrong, but the problem is the audience can never figure out what is wrong and the direction the film is going to go.<br/><br/>The acting was spot on by everybody, especially Daniel Kaluuya and Alison Williams. The direction by Jordan Peele was surprisingly spot on and he manages to mix Horror and Humor into this extremely well. It also moves along at a good pace, and it keeps you guessing what the heck is going on. The music was spot on as well. Very unsettling, extremely over the top, but it suites each scene perfectly. I don't think there's anything I would change in the movie.<br/><br/>By the time you get to the end and you have figured everything out it really does make you wander how they managed to pull it all off! There is a lot of racial stereotype in this movie. I think it works, though. It never really goes full on with the racial stuff, but there are several scenes that may offend or even just make people shake their heads, but in the end it's just a movie and it's for pure entertainment. The Autistic Reviewers give this 4/5 stars. It really is a great and unique film. We both highly recommend it to all of you. It's already getting attention at the Mtv Movie Awards, so there's a sign it's very popular! The Autistic Reviewers. Check us out on facebook or Instagram!"

"dmartinez-52655","8","9","16","13 March 2017"," Impressive Horror Film
","Jordan Peele Directs this Horror Movie that left me pretty compelled on how this film was executed. Peele also directed Comedy Movies including ""Keanu, Wanderlust, and The Sidekick,"" so that makes me more interested of what he could do with this type of Movie Genre.<br/><br/>Get Out's plot is based on a Black Man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), have reached the meet-the- parents milestone of dating, she invites him for a weekend getaway upstate with Missy and Dean. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined. Wow, and it was a awesome experience for me in the Theater!<br/><br/>The Performances by the actors was pretty impressive with each character having their own story to tell through emotion and less explaining, and which i need more in Movies. Kaluuya and Williams couple act was cute and entertaining for me when they would act sweet to each other, and it helps me support how separate race relationships work.<br/><br/>The Scares are minimum with your usual pop-out scares and false scares that feel reused in other horror movies. Yet the scares are also replaced with the annoying toning when characters will run at each other than run the other direction. That felt annoying after a while but still had their own suspenseful moments that got to me.<br/><br/>Overall, Get Out was a pretty decent Horror Movie I will recommend for the suspense, acting, and the story with it's plot and characters that handle both racism and Cult like levels of heart drops. The scares are sometimes good and sometimes boring to see, and the camera movements can be irregular in tone, but still has me on edge. <br/><br/>B+"

","I'm usually not a fan of thrillers/horror movies, but this blew my mind. The psychological aspect was phenomenal, and the whole film in general was executed beautifully. The subtle easter eggs in the beginning created foreshadowing no one could possibly expect, which made the 'woahh' moment at the end even more magical. I also really appreciated how they hid the violence for the most part in the shots, so I didn't have to break away and could stay transfixed on the film. Every aspect of this movie engaged and captured me and I don't know many movies that do that for me. When watching the alternative ending, I thought it was for sure more realistic, but I ended up preferring the ended the makers went with. I appreciated the brutal honesty when Chris ends up in prison, but the og ending where his best friend saves him gave me such good closure to the whole roller coaster of a film. I liked the happy ending mainly because I could be at rest while still being able to frantically talk about how the other 2/3s of the movie was messed. All in all, amazing film."
"drownnnsoda","7","12","23","17 November 2017"," Attack of the killer WASPs
","""Get Out"" follows a young black man who heads to his white girlfriend's parents' home in an upscale bedroom community. Things are a bit off from the beginning, but they become progressively weirder—and worse—as his visit unwinds.<br/><br/>Decried by the political right as ""racist"" and touted as a racial-political masterpiece by the left, it seems to me that most people are forgetting that, at the end of the day, ""Get Out"" is a horror film, and it earns its thrills amicably. Of course there are racial politics being commented on here—at times far too heavy-handedly so—but one has to remember that Peele's script is an exaggerated distortion as commentary on the current social climate around race as a topic; it's hyperbole at its finest.<br/><br/>As a horror film, ""Get Out"" is successful because it manages to generate tension and push buttons in all the right places. It plays to audience expectations just about as much as it doesn't, so there is both intrigue and the expected catharsis these films are known for delivered equal measure. Peele wears his influences on his sleeve here, with ""The Stepford Wives"" (novel and film) being a chief template, even down to the film's primly manicured lawns in what is ostensibly anywhere, Connecticut, USA. <br/><br/>The off-kilter atmosphere is strengthened by astute performances from all involved: Daniel Kaluuya is a sympathetic lead, and Allison Williams, though I found her profoundly annoying in the first two acts, plays the finale much better. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford play the white liberal country clubbers who voted for Obama to a t, but sublimate a perceptible weirdness that adds to the tension (especially Keener). The performances from Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel are also noteworthy in their utter weirdness, marked by odd expressions, movements, and gestures that throw the audience off over and over again. I did find the final act and reveal, as fun as it is, a bit routine; it's remarkably playful and has some clever shifts, but at the same time, it's nothing we haven't seen before—that said, it is nonetheless nicely played.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Get Out"" is a legitimately fun, atmospheric, and suspenseful offering. A large part of what allows the film to surprise its audience is its core commentary and observations on race, and what Peele has in essence done is inject that into a tried-and-true genre setup. It's wryly political as much as it is committed to maintaining its horror prerequisites. 7/10."

","GET OUT was the most satisfying movie going experience I've had in a long time. It delivers brilliantly and viscerally in just the way that you want a paranoid horror thriller to but it also raises some topical questions within its horror conventions without undermining the fun and thrills. Jordan Peele definitely has a career ahead of him as a writer/director with a clever approach and a singular voice and vision when it comes to genre material.<br/><br/>The actors are uniformly excellent. Daniel Kaluuya is crucial to establishing the reality of the situation; he never overplays his character and you never catch him acting. Allison Williams is a pleasant surprise. I'd only known her from GIRLS and she shows a whole new potential here. LaKeith Stansfield is a star in the making; it's just that simple. Everything I see him in, he is impressive. The rest of the cast consists of some of the most reliable character actors working today, including a personal favorite: Stephen Root in a VERY surprising role.<br/><br/>GET OUT will be a future classic. You won't regret seeing it. It has several levels and it works smartly on all of them."
"hunter-friesen","8","12","23","22 October 2017"," Jordan Peele perfectly blends horror, comedy, and satire in the breakout film of the year
","By creating Get Out, director Jordan Peele has created the perfect recipe for a great sleeper hit for moviegoers tired of the usual January to February duds. Start with a great psychological horror thriller, add a little bit of comedy, a dash of social commentary, and top it off with a healthy amount of gore. Then combine this perfect recipe with a breakout lead performance from Daniel Kaluuya as Chris and a hilarious supporting performance by Lil Rel Howery as Chris' best friend. Peele gives the world its first glimpse of his immense skill as a director. He guides the audience through a film that keeps you guessing after every twist and turn. <br/><br/>The story of Get Out starts out familiar enough for everybody who has been in a serious relationship. Chris and Rose (Allison Williams) have been together for six months and are going away for the weekend to meet Rose's parents. Chris is cautious about the idea of going since he is black and Rose is white, but she doesn't see it as a big deal. Eventually, Chris gets the idea that something about the family and house is not right. From here the story starts to speed up, taking twists and turns to keep the audience guessing as to what is really going on. <br/><br/>This is the part that Peele, also the writer, handles the best. He makes a new psychological horror film where you don't know how it will end until it does. There is also the added bonus of raunchy comedy mixed throughout, most of which comes from Howery's character, who is almost too proud of his job as a TSA agent. Peele's experience as a comedy writer/actor on his hit partner sketch show Key and Peele allows him to handle the horror comedy element with ease. Every scare is effective and every humorous moment is truly funny, and both make the film even more enjoyable. Peele describes this movie as a ""social horror"" and you can tell why he describes it that way. The whole way through the film, every confrontational or shocking moment is connected to racial differences between Chris and his hosts. When I heard this, I was skeptical of how that element would fit in with horror and comedy. Luckily for me, and the audience, the moments that send a message are like small little jabs to make you think and aren't ham-fisted at you the entire time.<br/><br/>And what is a horror movie without some gore to make the squeamish look away for a couple seconds? The film holds back with extreme violence until the end and then lets it all loose with a fifteen- minute sequence that delivers on everything and more that the audience was expecting throughout the beginning and middle build-up phases. <br/><br/>Driving this movie along just as well as the writing and directing is the terrific lead performance of Kaluuya as Chris. We've seen a small dose of his talent in a supporting role in the critically acclaimed 2015 film Sicario. In his first leading role, he is required to play all types of emotions and tackles each one with the skill of a veteran actor who has been working for decades. The camera is pressed up right next to him several times throughout the film, allowing the audience to see every detail and emotion. By doing this flawlessly, we are immediately connected to Chris as a character because we are going through this experience just as blind as he is. We are just as confused and uneasy about the situation and hope he gets out of this safely.<br/><br/>For every horror protagonist in need of help, there is the best friend on the outside that will stop at nothing to see them safe again. Lil Rel Howery as Chris' best friend Rod will definitely go down as one of the best supporting performances of the year. He is the only character carrying the comedy element of the film, but he doesn't need any help since he steals practically every scene. <br/><br/>At the end of it all, Jordan Peele as the director of his own brainchild is the primary reason this movie works so well. He puts a lot of confidence in his cast, positioning the camera for multiple close-ups during the most important scenes, the biggest example would be the poster shot of Chris with tears down his face. Peele also infuses symbolism into multiple shots through the movement of the camera and the colors being presented, giving slights hints to the audience. Finally, he allows the film to flow together well and not feel disjointed between the multiple boxes this movie tries to check. The comedy and horror remain interluded the entire time, which raises the quality of each by playing off the other. <br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most important films of the year that is able to both entertain and teach us about present-day issues. It should be on everyone's radar. By the end of the year, I expect to see it on many critics and fan lists as the most entertaining and liked film of 2017."

","After sitting through two and a third long hours of ""IT"" recently, being bored mostly by the predictable CGI and the usual jolts in today's so called horror films, I just watched ""Get Out"". I wasn't expecting much, as the DVD had 5 mediocre to awful previews. But almost immediately, I became intensely involved by the plot and quality of this film, which mixes social satire and racial issues brilliantly. This is not like most horror films today, but rather more like suspense thrillers as ""The Stepford Wives"", ""the Harvest"", or ""The Tall Man"". The scares are not like jolts, but rather stem from the nervous feeling that kept me glued to the screen, anxious to see what will happen next. I just learned this was the director's first film, though it seemed to have excellent production values and built suspense seamlessly. I love stories where something strange is going on, and the mystery is gradually revealed, like the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" or ""Night Of The Living Dead"". For those not looking for gore or shocks, but rather suspense, this should satisfy most of you. But if special effects are your preference, maybe stay away."

There are elements that feel derivative, but on the other hand, Director Jordan Peele tells this story well, and it feels fresh and intelligent. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams turn in very nice performances, and the supporting cast is solid as well. I loved Lil Rel Howery, who plays the friend, a TSA agent who tries to help from afar. There are many great moments – the round of ""Bingo"" led by the father, Kaluuya seeing the pictures of Williams and her expression on that last one, and the effects going to the ""sunken place"". It also puts a mirror up to how white people in real life, even well-meaning ones, sometimes talk to African-Americans in their attempts to relate to them or 'be cool' – stilted, with references that often bring up race, and at least sometimes subtly racist. How great it was to see a diverse cast, and to see this perspective, without it being delivered in a heavy-handed manner. It's not original enough to be in a list of greatest ever thrillers, but it's solid and enjoyable from beginning to end."

"mrbreadtoast-06562","1","22","48","2 March 2018"," Demonizes White Folks
","One of the movie channels had a free weekend awhile back and I DVRed it. I knew almost about it and had an open mind going in. <br/><br/>This movie is about a girl bringing her boyfriend home to meet the parents for the weekend. The catch is that the girl is white and her boyfriend is black. It became apparent from the beginning that their target audience was minorities and this was an anti-white film. <br/><br/>In this racially divisive time, it's sad to see a movie like this which attempts to widen the divide. All of the white people in the movie are portrayed as evil intent on stealing and living within the bodies of black folks. It's bad enough the girlfriend lures him to her parents, but it becomes clear near the end that she's lured in over a dozen or so other black boyfriends to have their bodies stolen. <br/><br/>While they are visiting the parents, the girl's mother hypnotizes Daniel Kaluuya's character and later uses that to subdue him. The girl's parents also have a party with almost all white folks, and they all act as if they've never seen a black person before. Daniel Kaluuya's character sees another black male at the party and tries to buddy up to him. The other black male is very polite & well spoken, but the movie mocks his behavior as well as his wardrobe. It was clear the hidden message they wanted to send was that black people acting like white folks, is creepy and wrong. <br/><br/>Although the whole cast did a a pretty good job acting, there's logic flaws in the script. For example, the girlfriend tells her boyfriend that she didn't tell her parents that he was black. While she could have been truthful (since she has always brought black boyfriends home), her intent was evil as she was luring him to his demise. Given that she dated him 3 months already her not telling a little lie to help lure him there was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Likewise, the goal was to transplant the white person's brain in the black person's body, but movie claims a little part of the black person still remains -- somehow tying into the hypnosis. This was just plain silly, and I'm surprised they didn't just come out and say that the white people were all possessed by demons and their evil spirits would transfer into the black person's body. As the whole movie essentially demonizes white people.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat predictable given the message the movie is intent on delivering. The alternate ending is more realistic, but they apparently wanted a softer ending for minorities since they were the victims throughout the whole movie. <br/><br/>The fact that this is nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, shows how far Hollywood has fallen. This movie is anti-white propaganda with good acting. I'm just glad I didn't spend a dime on it."
"magentahq","10","22","48","6 May 2017"," A great horror/comedy blend with a well-foreshadowed end
","Get Out was a wonderful watch - I found myself alternating between laughing in shock and disbelief, laughing in genuine good-natured joy and (of course, as it is a horror) finding myself deeply afraid for the protagonist's well-being.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say Get Out revolves around a ""twist"" - because a twist implies something unexpected, and while it isn't entirely *expected*, the script did an amazing job of laying all the pieces out for you to realize what was going on on your own time. That said, the ending is intensely satisfying. It has all the hallmarks of a great horror film for me; the protagonist is extremely likable, there's gore and anticipation and characters with disgusting (but realistic) motivations, and the bad ends for each individual who has one feel completely justified and necessary.<br/><br/>Growing up in a very diverse metropolitan area in the US and seeing how different the suburbs can be, I found it a plausible-yet-morally-unthinkable extension of real-life unpleasant racial dynamics. For the skeptics among us, brushing up on your history of medical atrocities will give the film some much-needed context - and despite the very heavy themes throughout, the main character's attitude and simple ability to keep going in a horrible situation (as well as the comedic elements) keep Get Out from being unwatchably dark. Highly recommended!"

Their aim is to further divide us so that we can bring ourselves down without them firing a single shot. When you look at the production companies, you'll find that ""Perfect World Pictures"" (A Beijing-based film-production company) was largely involved. Research, share, and beware!"

","I would like to give this piece of crap a negative rating. I don't know what movie is more pathetic, this one which is aimed solely at brainwashed, politically correct liberals, or Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"". At least Tommy, I believe, tried to make a movie to entertain the audience. Failed miserably I might add. This is just a stupid attempt to perpetuate that stereotype that whites are evil, racist monsters. This b.s only appeals to the most unintelligent liberals.

","What a great movie this is! It really gets under your skin in a good kind of way.. Unsuspecting turns which makes your mind go in multiple directions - all wrong. Brilliant acting & cast and great music. It is no horror movie, maybe this label scares people off. Yeah it has some horror aspects in it, but it is more like a high level psychological thriller. The story is straightforward, but well connected. Near the end, everything comes together. No loose ends. Definitely one of the better movies I've seen in this genre over the last couple of years.

","Peele's debut Get Out is a far cry from his stand up and Key and Peele days, channeling the goriness, witty plot hints, and over the top evil from classic horror flicks of the 80s. The modern racial twist is the cherry on top, being built up by incredible acting performances and music throughout."
"pyrocitor","10","11","21","17 September 2017"," The Alt-Stepford
","Some people go to the movies for escapism - for a diversion; a well-deserved break from real life. Then there are those who frequent the cinema for elucidation of deeper truths, or explication unpacking sociopolitical concerns of the time. Somehow (somewhat amazingly), comedy veteran Jordan Peele has crafted a film perfectly geared to appeal to either camp - and as his directorial debut, to boot. Get Out is an unforgettable cinematic experience, tackling subtext almost eerily prescient in the wake of racially-motivated hate crimes, rallies, and dangerously escalating discrimination (both explicit and pervasively subtle. But, lest prospective viewers pass it by as a soapbox diatribe, Peele opts to frame his discourse through an ingeniously un-didactic psychological horror genre lens (think The Stepford Wives crossed with Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, thrown into a Hitchcockian Psycho blender, and churned with a table saw). It's fiendishly eloquent, but almost outlandishly absurdist. And it may be the most clever, bonkers, nail-biting, irreverently ingenious, and grimly fun time at the movies this year. <br/><br/>If that sounds like a confusing cocktail of diametrically opposed elements it is. Yet, somehow, Peele shakes, stirs, and serves the perfect filmic entrée disguised as an aperitif, its roller-coaster ride of emotions and response somehow working seamlessly as an ingeniously homogeneous film. Social satire and the horror genre have long gone hand in hand (in fact, ""We all go a little mad sometimes"" could practically serve as the tagline for the movie that is 2017 ), but Peele finds that true horror lies in the crushing weight of racially-motivated micro-aggressions sprinkled out by the caste of (sometimes) well-intentioned nouveau-liberals doing their best to counteract privilege by being a little too earnest in telling the only African American in the room that they would've voted for Obama for a third term if they could. Peele's satire may be barbed - perhaps too much so not to hit a nerve for some audiences - but its teeth are razor sharp, capturing the intricacies of moments of discomfort almost imperceptible apart from those experiencing them in both hysterical and cringe-worthy detail. His airtight script is succinct but extraordinarily precise, with dialogue rife with clever wordplay (watch for all of the seemingly innocent inclusions of the word ""black"" in innocuous conversation) and coy foreshadowing so intricate the film practically necessitates repeat viewings to drink it all in. <br/><br/>And just when you're engrossed in cackling and cringing under your breath at the savage Act 1 satire, Peele cordially reminds you that you're here watching a horror film - and hits you with no holds barred. Of course, he's never fully let you fully forget it, with a chillingly surreal prologue, and poetic flourishes sneakily maintaining a mood of general unease (protagonists Chris and Rose hit a deer on the way to visiting her parents in the countryside). Some of these are artsy piece of tone-setting foreshadowing. Some are playful red herrings. Some are both, with enough narrative bread crumbs scattered to elicit some painful 'I should've KNOWN!' face-palming in the third act for all but the most eagle-eyed viewers. And none are extraneous, all firmly in service of forwarding both the film's horror tropes and real-life horror intertexts in equal, grim measure. Case in point: ""the sunken place"" - a bout of hypnosis-paralysis Chris is subjected to that has the film at its most claustrophobically terrifying while also providing a crushingly perfect metaphor for feeling consistently beaten down and repressed in a closeted discriminatory culture. <br/><br/>As things take an increasingly chilling turn for the macabre (and Peele's pitch-perfect pacing stews tension to a frantic fever pitch with the effortless nonchalance of a seasoned veteran), Get Out's ultimate, rather sordid, gag is how easy it is to miss the forest for the trees. We find ourselves tempted, alongside Chris, to write off his spine-tingling experiences as paranoia (or the film artistically extrapolating on the experience of racial discrimination), when the reality could simply be that things are, in fact, so much worse than the fears a lifetime of living in 'polite society' has taught him to dismiss as overzealous. The realization starts witty, then becomes almost overwhelmingly sobering. And there's the definitive microcosmic distillation of the film's audience experience as a whole. <br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Chris, establishing a baseline of perfectly affable nonchalance to make the rawness with which he radiates horror at the indignities he's increasingly subjected to all the more harrowing. Still, Kaluuya's work is too sophisticated for rote 'final girl' horror reactions, and a couple of left-turn character choices skirting obvious Hollywood moral choices keep Chris enigmatic enough to remain compelling throughout. Allison Williams is equally terrific, perfecting a peppy charisma with just enough of a highly-strung edge to ensure she equally dodges cliché throughout. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford embody that particular strain of friendliness that is somehow icier and more imperious with every smile to almost unnerving effect, while LilRel Howery is reliably hilarious, pulling double-duty as the film's bombastic comic relief and incredulous moral centre. Finally, Caleb Landry Jones infuses his inherent slithering creepiness into a drunken jock archetype to perfectly unnerving effect, while Stephen Root's warm eloquence provides a welcome foil to the tone-deaf effete posturing threatening to suffocate Chris. <br/><br/>If ever there were a single film to distill the madness of the sociopolitical climate of the past year and make sense of it with acid wit and world-weary humour, it's Peele's unforgettable Get Out. It's psychological horror film as inventive and groundbreaking as it is sadistically playful. It's an unnervingly timely, walloping deconstruction of the intimate intricacies of privilege and prejudice for the ""I'm not racist, but..."" crowd. In short, prospective viewers would do well to follow the advice of its title - Get Out of your house, routine, deeply entrenched mindset, and drink in what hindsight will invariably decree the most illustrative (and fiendishly enjoyable) film of the year. <br/><br/>-10/10"
"luttrellhenshawsam","10","11","21","28 July 2017"," One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!
","WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE! It's quite rare that I give a movie a 10/10. I think to deserve a 10, it has to not just amaze me while I'm watching the film, but make me think about it constantly for days on end. That is what Get Out certainly did.<br/><br/>I really did not expect this movie to do anything very unique, but I was instantly amazed by its eeriness, strangeness and of course its mystery which it certainly doesn't lack. Being directed by a comedian (Jordan Peele) you wouldn't expect a great horror film, given that comedy is the polar opposite genre to horror, but he did an AMAZING job.<br/><br/>Get Out centres around a black male named Chris who is invited to his girlfriend's house; her name is Rose and she is white. When Chris meets the family of white people, he notices extremely bizarre things, such as black workers and maids who seem to be forcefully smiling. The family is having a neighbourhood party where everyone is white. When Chris is about to leave, he discovers the dark secret behind this family, including his girlfriend. It turns out- SPOILER- that the family is luring in black people so that the family can insert their brains into them, resulting in immortality.<br/><br/>All of the Armitage family are the villains and they are played fantastically. The Father, Dean, is a surgeon for the victims as well as the one auctions off victims. He has the help of Rose's brother Jeremy who acts as an assistant to him by transporting victims. The Mother, Missy, hypnotises the victims into falling asleep and for taking commands. All of these are dark, creepy and absolute psychopaths. What makes them scary is that they seem like normal, average people, making their twist seem much scarier. This also applies to Rose, but she is easily the creepiest and best villain because the way she can hide her true identity for so many people for months and manipulate them like that is just amazing. I also love the fact that she has fun with her victims, an example being with Chris when he asks for the keys but she hangs on to them for about a minute, watching his extreme distress until she says ""You know I can't give you the keys, right babe?"" Honestly, just perfect.<br/><br/>Then you have the other characters. The background characters all have some mystery behind them; for example, I really wanted to learn more about the blind man (before.. you know...). But of course Chris is the main star here: he has a tragic backstory about his Mother's death, yet remains strong. He doesn't fight with strength, he fight with wit, which is a lot more important than strength. He is a fantastic protagonist. The comic relief character, Chris' best friend Rod, was hilarious put a perfect comedic aspect in the film that, unlike in other horror movies, doesn't take away the eeriness. And that is difficult to do because, as I said, comedy and horror are polar opposites, so the fact the movie put a balance between the two is hugely impressive. Also, he saved Chris' life for crying out loud! I could go on about this movie all day; I have theories, I have opinions on minor details. But you came here for a 1000-word review and that's what this is going to be. Get Out is an amazing, creepy, funny, intriguing movie. It's one of the best movies of the decade and I highly recommend it to both comedy and horror fans. This is an instant classic! 10/10"
"lionel-simo","9","11","21","16 July 2017"," "" Man, I told you not to go in that house""
","The story of the film revolves around Chris who's going to decide to spend the holidays with his girlfriend's parents ; but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcome it? I'm not going to say more to avoid spoiling the movie <br/><br/>I'd hesitate to say that this is a horror movie, however, it has horror elements but it doesn't properly belong to this genre. but I don't want to get into conceptual discussion. <br/><br/>As for the scenario it was wonderful, I was very impressed by the functionality of the comedy in a very strange atmosphere."

","Rose Armitage is taking her boyfriend, Chris Washington, to meet her parents for the first time. He's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black. However, her parents turn out to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. Chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the black staff at the house. The Armitages then throw a huge party and Chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests. He initially just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and Armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. Chris decides it is time to get out...<br/><br/>Great directorial debut from Jordan Peele, who also wrote the script. Peele was one half of the hilarious comedy duo Key and Peele, so you would be excused for thinking that his first movie would be a comedy. Get Out is not a comedy. It starts as a social commentary and ends as a horror-thriller. <br/><br/>In both respects it is great, though I preferred the social drama aspect more. Some very clever observations regarding race relations in the first half of the movie, and I imagine a fairly accurate depiction of the African-American experience. As a horror-thriller the build up and plot development is very good but the ending felt a bit too easy and rushed. The conclusion is also not very profound, which is a bit disappointing after all the social observations that came before. <br/><br/>This said, the ending would be the only weak spot, and it only appears weak because the rest of the movie was so good. <br/><br/>Peele does throw in some comedy moments, via the character of Rod Williams, and these are great.<br/><br/>Solid performances all round. Daniel Kaluuya, as Chris, is probably the best of lot. LilRel Howery, as Rod Williams, almost steals the show though.<br/><br/>Great movie."

","*SPOILERS* <br/><br/>This movie awful sucks! It is overrated over-hyped and a copycat this film imitates and steals mostly ideas and scenes from Disturbing Behavior. Let me explain:<br/><br/>In Disturbing Behavior a mad but brilliant scientist brainwashes and operates on young high school students and he turns them in to obeying upstanding citizens cyborg's. The only way you can ruin the cyborg personality is with a loud sound on the radio that makes them mad and disturbed them.<br/><br/>In Get Out A Young white bisexual girl seduces Afro American boys and girls then she and her family captures them, then they brainwash them the same that was in Disturbing Behavior and then they turn them in to obeying slave's cyborgs. The only thing you awake them is buy shooting a picture with a flashback on your photo camera so that they awake from their nightmare.<br/><br/>Get Out copy's and imitates Disturbing Behavior on a bad way, it is similar story. I am not getting this movie a pass just because it try's to be scary this movie failed and it is a failure in my opinion.<br/><br/>I don't like this movie I don't like new horror movies because they are not good and they don't know how to make a good horror film! This movie fails to be a good slasher film, it fails, it is boring way too long, it is not exciting it is not the best horror movie the critics are saying. It is not intense or exciting and it is not interesting at all.<br/><br/>I don't care about the lead guy and his girlfriend she is a selfish monster and he find out when it was all too late what a dumbass. <br/><br/>Catherine Keener what the hell happened with you? You were so beautiful and so damn hot in The 40 Year Old Virgin once beautiful, intelligent very smart, funny and goofy in this movie your fat and very dumb and ugly. You changed lady and that in too ugly one I don't like you today or in this movie.<br/><br/>This film should have been straight out to Blu-ray and DVD I don't understand why everyone LOVES this movie so good I don't understand I respect people for others who likes this movie that's fine but I am only guy who hates this film a lot because I thought it was very silly writing of film I thought the all idea of it looks and sounds silly like story is written buy group of kids in grade 1 written this story.<br/><br/>I don't understand this movie or why was so god damn awful acted ,it was really slow only the end was intense when Daniel fought for his life but that was it. And his fight on the end was terrible I did not like it at all.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't scary enough and it wasn't scary at all. I think the movie get's high rating then any Friday the 13th movies, get's higher rating then any Child's Play that's my problem. Like new movies who are horrendous horrible get's the pass but the old one great slasher films get's thumbs down.<br/><br/>This movie can kiss my ass I have seen better horror film from 2000's that really got worst ratings and ranted on a worst.<br/><br/>Another spoiler for you: when Daniel is captured and chained on that chair and he was hypnotized by large TV Screen how did he got wads in his ears and plugs his ears with a tied hands how did he do that? How did he reached the wads from the sofa chair he was siting? Does anyone has an explanation how did he do that when he was all tied up? I know he scratched the sofa chair out just how did he reach the wads from his hands and how did he plugged his ears when he was all tied up. It makes no sense to me. <br/><br/>I don't know why this movie get's the pass I don't understands. 1/10 awful lame horrible movie a total disappointment and a failure I don't want to watch this movie again.<br/><br/>I am rather going to watch Friday the 13th movies, A Nightmare on Elm Street movies, The Thing, Prince of Darkness, The Fog, Leviathan, House of Wax, The Hills Have Eyes the remake, Scream movies Miles better movies then this overrated peace a sh**T!"

","Being a fan of Jordan Peele from Key & Peele, I came to the movie knowing his comedic and satirical chops, and his directorial debut definitely doesn't disappoint. I am rarely a fan of horror, but when horror is used how it should be - to magnify real societal wounds and inequalities — then I become the biggest fan. Hollywood horror films nowadays are jump scares, cash cows and unnecessary violence and gore without realistic characters. Get Out stands out among a handful others recently to really use the genre well."

","Jordan Peele has made a smoothly entertaining and smart thriller out of material familiar from The Stepford Wives, Seconds, Night of the Living Dead and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. The film doesn't have an original bone in its body, but it's lively, funny and discomfiting nonetheless and it provides a few pleasurable jolts while nimble direction and an able cast compensate for the plot's predictability. In Get Out the buildup is ultimately more satisfying and memorable than the payoff and the revelations feel rushed and somewhat murky. And though the finale is done with admirable restraint in the gore department, Get Out cries out for a better, more original and thought-provoking conclusion. A good, but somewhat disappointing film considering all the hype and though it's superior to Don't Breathe and Split, it isn't original or distinctive enough to be a classic, but just good enough to warrant a viewing."

","I rarely watch films that are hyped up by film critics as I know that such 'critics' are always more impressed by the expression of their own knowledge, understanding and overall genius than by anything else. They try to impress the uneducated masses, that is the rest of us, with their brilliant analyses, particularly of modern films which address what they see as serious social issues.<br/><br/>I decided to watch ""Get Out"" partly because the premise looked reasonably interesting and partly because it had received some good reviews. What a mistake; I really should have stuck with my usual approach.<br/><br/>For the most part, it's boring and predictable and, as has been mentioned by other reviewers here, if the colours of the main characters were reversed, the film would have been greeted with outrage rather than plaudits. The occasional interlude of foul language from a peripheral character and some scenes of gruesome violence in the last 15 minutes are largely irrelevant and unnecessary. To a considerable extent, the film makes little sense; it's nothing more than an attempt to demonstrate how badly those nasty white folk treat the black folk and how the black folk will win out in the end.<br/><br/>There is little acting other than the now usual 'meaningful looks', and the limited script is pretty banal. Overall, whatever the clever critics might say, it's dull and has nothing new to say about anything; there is no originality of any sort.

"bardia-moose","9","22","49","24 February 2017"," GET OUT of your house and go watch this now!
","This is Jordan Peele's feature directorial debut, and what's interesting here is that GET OUT is uncharted territory for him as he comes from a comedic background. But, watching this movie, it felt like he's been directing horror his whole life. To put it simply, the guy knocks it out of the park. <br/><br/>It's an artfully crafted and remarkably accomplished debut. He exploits an atmosphere impregnated with tension and skillfully choreographs an escalation of unrelenting suspense and crowd-pleasing thrills. The camera-work was absolutely ingenious; there's a scene involving hypnosis, in particular that had my jaw hitting the floor. I loved how they visually achieved that heightened state of suggestibility on a visual level. <br/><br/>GET OUT is as much satire as it is horror though. And its most impressive feat is how masterfully it blends the two together. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that so seamlessly shifts from sequences of jubilant laughter to instances of insidious horror in a matter of minutes. <br/><br/>Writing satire is tough, writing good satire is even tougher, and writing good horror-satire is as rare of a commodity as you get in the film industry these days. To achieve this a film must have exquisite timing and near-prefect pacing, which is exactly what GET OUT has. The run-time is 103 minutes, yet it felt more like an hour. I guess I got so invested in this engaging story that I lost all sense of time, which is what you ultimately want in any movie, really. <br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya showcases his acting chops with an impressive range of emotions; it's not necessarily what he says but what he doesn't say that has the biggest impact. Other standouts include Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention comic Lil Rel Howery, who plays TSA agent Rod, aka the protagonist's best friend. He's definitely a scene-steal-er, breaking the film's uncanny tension with a number of gut-busting interludes.<br/><br/>While GET OUT sets out to mainly entertain and shock, it's also accompanied with some poignant social commentary. It shines light on the aspect of ourselves that we'd rather not acknowledge. No matter how much we try to convince ourselves that we're above implicit stereotyping or forming preconceptions, we aren't. Peele uses this unavoidable, unflattering truth to draw out anxiety, and then he uses that anxiety as fuel for the film itself. <br/><br/>GET OUT is one of the best movies to come out of 2017 thus far. I can't recommend it enough."
"mikewhite-20887","3","35","84","23 March 2017"," ""Get Out"" Movie Review by Hypnotist Michael White
","!!! ""SPOILER ALERT"" !!!<br/><br/>Overall, I was quite disappointed in this film, maybe because of all the hype around it from ""non-hypnotist"".<br/><br/>In the film, young black men are lured to a country home by their ""girlfriend"" under the guise of ""meeting the parents"", where they soon undergo a ""body snatchers""-esk, surgical transplantation of a wealthy person's consciousness, to take control of their body, while part of them remains trapped inside their own mind.<br/><br/>The process is 3 steps, first hypnosis to subdue the victim and plant a post-hypnotic suggestion to re-induce a paralyzing trance whenever needed. The second step is a form of mental torture and brainwashing techniques to further tear down the victims will and condition them for the transfer. The third and final step is a surgical transplant of the invading brain matter into the victim's brain to take over the conscious actions of the victim as the new ""puppet master"" of the victim's body and mind.<br/><br/>If you don't catch the brief explanation of the 3 steps, you may be misguided into thinking that ""hypnosis"" is the only tool used to ""control"" these victims. <br/><br/>While the initial induction used in the film would be plausibly effective, asking ""shocking or surprising"" questions before eliciting a revivification of a childhood trauma, while simultaneously anchoring the experiences to a visual and auditory queue (tea cup and spoon). The film doesn't elaborate on any ""post-hypnotic"" suggestions to re- induce trance. <br/><br/>Furthermore, once rapport and trust were broken between the hypnotist and the victim, any subsequent attempts to utilize the post-hypnotic suggestion would fail. The film eludes to a perception that the victim has no control over whether or not the post-hypnotic suggestion would work or not, which is completely contrary to reality.<br/><br/>In hypnosis reality, the subject is always in control, and can actively choose whether or not to comply with a suggestion or not. Therefore the film leaves viewers, who may have no understanding of the hypnotic process, with the illusion that hypnosis is some sort of ""mind control"" technique, which is completely false. The film starts off with a lot of buildup, but seems to rush the ending, showing only minimal details about what's really going on, which is a shame, because more detail would have made the movie more enjoyable. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this film, mostly because of the poor execution of the plot overall, and also for the miss-representation of how hypnosis works in real life. It's a shame that filmmakers continue to perpetuate this miss-information about hypnosis in general.<br/><br/>Hypnosis is not something that was invented in a lab, it's a natural human process that was observed and then later, labeled. We all experience hypnotic trance states multiple times in a day, every day, we are just not consciously aware of when it happens.

","I won't describe the premise, because it's a surprise, so how can I tell you how original this movie is? Consider how many times hypnotism has been portrayed on film. Well, you've never seen hypnotism portrayed as it is here. Everything about this movie is refreshing.<br/><br/>All you really need to know is that, during the climax, the audience of the packed theater applauded, and a minute later they all laughed. But then, 5 minutes later they applauded AGAIN, and a minute later laughed AGAIN. Such is the impact this gem of a film had in that showing.<br/><br/>Thrillers often employ humor, but it's usually not funny and it's used in inappropriate places. Here the humor is timed perfectly with the thrills so they don't interfere with each other, and it isn't used too often, but when this film is funny it's really funny.<br/><br/>The cast has no major stars, and hardly any recognizable faces, yet the director got Oscar worthy performances out of several of them."

","Racist people want the skin of the people they feel superior to!? Alone this big flaw makes this movie total nonsense as a political comment.

On top, the implemented ""black buddy stuff"" feels out of place and takes any seriousness out of this movie. I don't know how this movie can get so much praise, as a horror movie it is without horror, as a comedy the elements of humor are a mixed experience, as a thriller the comedy elements destroy every notion of a ""thrilling atmosphere"", and like I already said, as a political satire etc. the premise, agenda is all wrong.<br/><br/>So what's left!?

"dick6756","9","10","19","7 October 2017"," It is a horror film, but the reality is more horrific
","A film director has a lot of ways to talk about the issue of racism in the United States through dramas (compared to documentaries).Discussing historical events is a common method, ""12 Years a Slave"", ""Selma"", and ""The Butler"" , just to name a few.It is kind of distance between audience and this genre of movie taking about black and white, like time and space differences. Most of the time, in these films, villains are more radical, extremely white supremacy, conservative old-fashioned and stubborn, all of which make most audience assure that ""those whites in the film are very wicked, I was not the people alike.""Rather, this time, ""Get out"" doesn't repeat the exact same way to process the theme. It is for certain a thriller film, but it is also one such film talking about racial issues. Throughout the film, villains are not the kind that look like whites in the southern United States, but those liberal from Northeast, who look upon themselves as kind people without racial discrimination. That is to say, all those who think that they are not discriminated against blacks can learn a big lesson while watching ""Get out"".<br/><br/>""Get out"" has lot of connotations, which are thought-provoking, in the script, reflecting the black dilemma in history of the United States. As black people lose freedom and voice so that they can't even protest against unjust system, so are the black people who are hypnotized and whose body are taken in the film.<br/><br/>At the very beginning of the film shows a reversal of the routine portraits of black and white in Hollywood films- usually the protagonists are afraid of encountering black people, or walking by the poor slum mostly regarded as black area on edge; However, in ""Get out"" here comes a black man walking butterflies in his stomach in the white community. After watching the whole process, I bet some people's heart almost jump out.Sadly, that black guy isn't at all surprised by that, but lament that ""God it really happened to me."" It seems a garden- variety for all black people that they often meet doom in their daily life.For just a few minutes, the director has put the audience into the black people's position.<br/><br/>The things that whites do to blacks in the film are nothing but a metaphor of white hegemony that has forced blacks to submit to them in reality.Rose's mother is so-called psychiatrist, and she makes use of hypnotism to repress Chris's consciousness into the sunken-place.She uses exquisite and noble cup and teaspoon. With elegant and noble stir, she skillfully makes innocent Chris give up himself. Chris has no easy way out. After such bad things have been done, Rose's mother is still a educated lady in upper class.""Self-consciousness falls into the sunken-place"" is a very clever metaphor, it represents victim can clearly witness the unfair treatment, but can not speak, nor move, much less escape.Recently, in the United States, a slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" has come up throughout the black civil rights movement. ""Black Lives Matter"" is a goal. There is still a long way to reach the goal. You may cry, but most of the time, crying and shouting are useless, according to the film.<br/><br/>After transformation, repressing the real thought, having a big smile, the rebirth black people have all the qualities of white elites in upper class. Who would you think of at once? Barack Obama of course. He was a competent president. Blacks and whites alike are fond of him. Nevertheless, it seems that blacks and whites have yet to reach a reconciliation. Black people still feel that they are excluded, and even in the viewpoint of liberal white elites, they are thought to be the second citizens. How to resolve the problem? There is no easy answer. ""Get out"" is a horror film, but the reality is more horrific because the film is fictitious, and the reality is not fictitious."

This keeps things engaging and shows how easy it is for sides to change. The plot is anything but heart felt and is certainly sinister enough to warrant the horror genre.

","I was aware of Jordan Peele's talent from his sketch comedy show ""Key and Peele"". Here he is not on screen, but rather serves as writer and director. Get Out is about an African American man who spends a weekend with his white girlfriend's family in the wealthy white 'burbs. During his visit, he uncovers a frightening truth surrounding her family, which is slowly revealed through strange situations and characters.<br/><br/>It's not a jump out of your seat horror film, and it is often funny in places. The easy spin on race relations developed in his sketch comedy perhaps gave Peele the confidence to go down the road he takes us down. Peele is a self-assured director, and there are no wasted or awkward scenes. The film gets a bit wacky towards the end, in the sense that it's for me an unnecessary turn towards sensationalism where it could have stayed on the same plane as the rest of the movie and still been effective. I did however like the unpredictability of the film.<br/><br/>I was highly entertained and look forward to Peele's next film with relish."
"Reznik_T","9","10","19","4 September 2017"," Excellent filmmaking! Even better after second watch
","I just recently rewatched this movie and I'm happy I did, because there are so many details I didn't realize during my first watch, but I did realize during the second time, which made it even more fun to watch and a better film overall.<br/><br/>GET OUT is a horror-satire that discusses the issue of racism (at least certain aspects of it), but it does it in a way that is not heavy-handed or preachy. I like the fact that it makes fun of how white people tend to relate to black people, but also how black people tend to relate to white people and even to each other. At the same time it has some genuine moments that show the difficulties black people can have in a white-majority environment. Nowadays people can be labeled a racist even for ridiculous reasons (especially in the U.S.) which is a very unhealthy tendency in society. And if that's something that bothers you as well, let me assure you, GET OUT is not a film of that spirit, its goal is not to make white people feel guilty. This movie is smart, funny, but it also has heart, and is honest about the topic.<br/><br/>Acting, directing, writing and cinematography are great across the board. The two best performances, in my opinion, are that of Daniel Kaluuya, who plays the main character and Lakeith Stanfield who plays a smaller role, but is fantastic in that. <br/><br/>GET OUT is thrilling, creepy, funny, sometimes over-the-top, and even though it was released back in January, for me (as of September 4, 2017) it is still the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The secret is out. The world now knows that Jordan Peele is not only known for fame in the comedic realm, but also for debuting a very effective thriller. ""Get Out"" is ultimately effective due to its intriguing premise and crowd pleasing mentality. Comic relief in horror usually falls flat for me, and confuses the tone of the film. Here, it's used very skillfully, and the laugh/thrill mixture is very successful. This directorial debut is a win that is delivered from a very unexpected mind. #getout"
"laserburn","9","10","19","13 August 2017"," Excellent directing debut!
","Some mild spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Wow, looking at the review rating, I got to say that this is one polarizing movie. So many 1-star ratings and accusations of racism (not entirely unfounded, mind you) and not one of the negative reviewers paid attention to how well was this movie crafted and with what attention to details. It is so rare to see a movie that didn't skip to explain something important or that left number of unnecessary scenes that really should have been cut.<br/><br/>For instance, Chris wakes up tied to a chair and he tries to untie restrains on his hand using his teeth. At first I was thinking ""Ok, this is not a necessary scene"", but it turns out it was there to show that Chris can reach his hands with his head, which is important afterwards. Clever, real clever. Though I couldn't deduce everything, for instance, what's the deer symbolism present in this movie? Maybe it makes sense to an American. Few gaffs as well, for instance when Chris tells Rose he wants to leave it's evening, when they enter the house it's already night. And also the big one, why black people? Explanation is because of their superior genetics and I understand what Jordan Peele wanted to say when he went with that, but for the sake of suspension of disbelief (and not to be called racist) maybe he should have went with because they endure the procedure better or whatever.<br/><br/>Movie is really an 8, but I will give it a 9 because it's directing debut and hopefully to anger the people who rated it poorly. It's a movie I would recommend watching if a girl invites you to meet her parents. :D"
"pipecax","9","10","19","11 August 2017"," Don't get out!
","Discrimination, in all its possible variables, is a matter of which it's possible to get very far both in extension and intellection, an issue that has touched various media in terms of attacking this puppet of such evil purposes. Basing on a sad-popular behavior such as racism in the United States of today, filmmaker Jordan Peele—who gained status by TV shows of a comic nature that with the accustomed dubious quality achieved American transcendence—presents a sour, fiery and impetuous social satire brimming with black humor with delicious psychological thriller hint that arrives in order to impact strong on a certain well-off sector thanks to a reflective tale of the big little lies that we tell each other in such a clever, effective and commercial way that might well gets it a list of meritorious titles as ""cult film"" or ""the best suspense movie of the year"" and maybe, a round of accolades for its splendid components, identical in quality, different in appearance.<br/><br/>Peele's feature film converges, in not few vertices, with the laudable allegorical representation (""The Invitation"", 2015) by American filmmaker Karyn Kusama, highlighting as the main concomitant the essence of the true thriller: increasing discomfort and vulnerability sown in order to audience does not feel secure with what happens on the screen, which provokes in this incessant birth of perceptions toward the loaded questions posed by the story. A genre equivalent to a perverse roulette, in which in the slightest moment of carelessness, a rush of revolutions can shake your safety from head to toe. Such concordance adorned with an acute social criticism, substantial of the authentic films inaugurated by Mr. Hitchcock, in which are exhibited the poorest actions that we can come to commit. We're the black and white dots.<br/><br/>While it builds outstanding psychological game with detailedness, Peele, deserving of double mention acting as scriptwriter and director, conjures up ordinary components and other unusual that can be abridged in three major fields: the first one, of course, is the narrative, although, beyond wise skill of developing the subliminal core idea, it's the successful combination and harmonization between two discordant genres as horror and comedy, an impressive achievement especially in the decadent film period in which we are in. While comedy is based on the supporting comic relief gags (contradictory and stereotypical a black man) and the irony of the situations, it's fascinating as horror doesn't require scary monsters or spooky entities to fulfill its objective (although there are), here, terror springs up from dread and the veiled significance of the words, from confrontation with the harsh reality. The second one is plausible constituents at a technical level, namely, its mise-en-scène, soundtrack, cinematography, and photography that unite the vertiginous final act with the hesitant first act using, as usual in Jason Blum's company, precise elements that facilitate and enrich the following of the story. It's prodigious in the composition of its images, having in its power a vacation home encircled by a dry forest is not a break, on the contrary, it's sensational as they create beauty, usually in confined spaces, with what they have. With certainty, the film has conceived one of the most beautiful shots in horror film history, an oneiric picture where Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) jolts awake after a cyclic hypnosis in a pale leather sofa, with the sound effect from an old TV as the only company, his face—tremendously photographic—raises an analogy through the melodramatic tears in his exorbitant eyes, a frame that will last in the memory of any modern cinephile. There are also sparkling scenes, which reach horns of the moon in its exciting third act, highlighting vigorously camera focus in the third major factor: the overwhelming and heterogeneous performances. Kaluuya's role radiates power and strength, he's sensitive and unprotected when he needed, aggressive and lethal when everything is a disaster. The alienation of the Armitage family is dosed between the competent actors, from which stand out Allison Williams (with a twisted plot worthy of Shyamalan) and her brother in the fiction, interpreted by Caleb Landry Jones. Exclusive attention requests scene stealer Betty Gabriel, who plays a couple of shocking scenes, with dimensions of complexity and interpretative depth typical of an acting matron. Be careful because this lady and Kaluuya will present great surprises.<br/><br/>Conscious of its game, Peele's motion picture is a deliberate subversion, offered by the hand of cinema, which cries out for the eradication of injustices perpetuated by the social and political sects of the Trump era. It also breaks supposed barriers between genres and ideas and overflows creativity and power by creating situations as exciting as cartoon-like, as intelligent as reflexive; A satire that wasn't requested, perhaps out of fear, but in the end, it came with a relentless purpose. It achieves what many feature films don't: surprise and affect."

Daniel kaluuya is a new actor to me and he plays the lead in this film and he is fantastic in this film. You are rooting for his character so much throughout this film as you are really watching this film through his eyes. He is very likable in the film that makes him a great character. Allison Williams is his girlfriend in this film and she is good in this film, they have very good chemistry together and you are behind there relationship succeeding.

However, even though entertaining I felt the end of this film to be a bit rushed and I could have done with an extra 15 or 20 minutes of details. The script is great, the blend of humour and drama is really well handled and makes this more unique then expected. The style of the film has so much great tension that truly sucks you in to follow and try and work out what is going on.

It's a bit of a slow-burn until the very end and then everything is resolved very quickly. It's still well-done and intense, yes, but the pacing makes the whole thing feel a bit off. There is also a comic relief character that was given way too much to do. He wasn't annoying, he was actually pretty funny, but his constant appearing gave us some way too sudden tonal shifts. Now while I'm saying all this, it probably sounds like I didn't like the movie, but I really did. I didn't think it was perfect, but it was an interesting ride.<br/><br/>The premise itself is pretty smart, I just felt that more could be done with more psychological parts of the movie. Even though the plot structure isn't the best, the dialogues are very well written and backed up by very strong performances. Main character is well developed and you really care about him, which makes the whole situation even more intense. Through the first two acts, not much really happens, but you can't help but feel that sense of dread. Then things go down.

","Get Out is the directorial debut from comic Jordan Peele and tells the story of Chris, an African American man meeting his white girlfriend's parents for the first time at their secluded home in the woods. With all the praise surrounding Get Out, I tried to go in with an open mind not letting the hype overwhelm for what could be an ""O.K."" film. However after seeing it, the praise its well deserved. This is a meticulous, well-crafted film, that offers both frights and moments of laughter. I was thoroughly impressed by how well made this film was, the score and cinematography is both haunting and dreamlike, giving the viewer an unsettling experience. The story in Get Out, is well realized and the trailer doesn't do enough justice, this isn't a white vs. black film, but rather a social commentary on marginalization, that uses the current events in our world as a springboard to get its ideas across. There were themes/metaphors throughout the film that I didn't realize were connected until the movie was over, this is far more than your average scary movie. Though you can treat it like a good ole' popcorn flick, the film has enough depth to keep the most sharp-eyed viewer thinking afterwards. <br/><br/>With that aside, Get Out is an almost perfect example of a horror/comedy mix, the use of LilRel Howery as the comic relief was excellent, his moments were scattered throughout the film but they never felt out of place and he was actually genuinely funny. This film felt like an old episode of goosebumps or a live action version of the board game ""Clue"", due to the mystery the protagonist faces. As he is discovering what is going so is the audience and though I was able to piece together what was happening early on, I was still enthralled with what was going on, due to the excellent writing and performances. Most of the actors and actresses in this film were unknown to me but all of them played their roles convincingly well, particularly Caleb Landry Jones, who had a riveting scene that takes place at a dinner table which really got under my skin. <br/><br/>Overall this is a well crafted film that had me on the edge of seat, Jordan Peele proves that he is not just a funny guy but should be taken seriously as writer and director. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Get Out and do highly recommend it. I see myself re-watching this film quite a few times, especially around the Halloween season, as it just has a fall vibe to it. This really is one of my favourite movies I've seen so far this year, so for that reason, I'm giving Get Out an 8.5/10."

","Get Out is a film written and directed by Jordan Peele. I saw basically no trailers of this film. I saw the 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was immediately attracted to it. Seeing the name Jordan Peele also kind of excited me as I liked Keanu that was out last year. After the film finished I was kind of overjoyed. I liked this film.<br/><br/>Plot: Chris, an African American goes to met Rose's parents (a white family). Everything is going good until Chris detects something sinister going on.<br/><br/>Story and direction: It's good when you have not seen anything regarding the film. Because you can go with a free mind and think what you want. That's what with the case of this film. I would say this film is more of a psychological thriller than a horror film. Yes, there are some scenes where I was scared. But that doesn't make it a horror film. This film deals with racism in a somewhat unconventional manner. That was something new which I liked very much. I never thought of racism in that way. I too read of an alternate ending to the film in Wikipedia but I guess the theatrical one was apt. It would have been a bit unjust on the hero of that alternate ending had been there. The only issue with the film is that some things were not clear to me. Maybe that was what Jordan wanted just to maintain some kind of suspense. But after the end too I was a bit confused regarding some scenes.<br/><br/>Acting: Daniel Kaluuya was great as Chris. I was with him each and every time. Allison Williams was sweet (and Menacing too) as Rose. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener were also excellent. A special mention to Lil Rel Howery. I mean I laughed at every joke he made. He was the special attraction and the comic relief of this tense film.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The scene where Missy hypnotizes Chris was my favorite. I saw a new way of hypnotizing people. That actually gave me a lot of chills. And it is from this scene where the film shows its true colors.<br/><br/>Verdict: I had a great time watching this film. I strongly recommend it to those who loves these psychological thrillers. I would not say that its an excellent film, but yes it's very good.<br/><br/>I am going to go with a 9/10."

Actors well chosen and their performances almost too real to the point of weird- scary. You just don't know what secretly lurks behind those smiles. 3. You know something is not quite right and the writer/director did a nice job of building into ""how-not-right-it-was"". 4. Rod our TSA agent, and friend to Chris, our lead protagonist, was a highlight bonus, offering a humorous perspective (a role where usually the confidant ends up being either clueless, incompetent, or dead) . Check out his end-of-film worldly advices (sp) to Chris in special features. 5. I preferred the ending that our director chose vs. the alternate ending as it was consistent with Chris's intelligence and personality."

","Get Out was a giant hit, a movie that many people did not know about from exploding, was acclaimed by critics, with one of the biggest notes of Rotten, and when the movie came out he had good criticism of the public, but a lot of people did not find the movie All, I went to watch the movie with contained expectations, I did not even go with much hype, but I expected something very good, and at the end of the movie it was something better than I imagined without exaggerating one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, Is a film that has many criticisms of racism and etc, and are very intelligent critics by the very promising director Jordan Peele, the film is not terror to be scared, will have some scares, but nothing is too much trouble, the film does not have Jupscare and the The film also has a good amount of humor, highlighting Lil Rel Howery who is the comic relief of the film, the cast is excellent, the young Daniel Kaluuya is excellent, Alisson Williams is very good too, it reminded me To Jennifer Connelly In some moments, Catherine Keener and etc, all excellent, the film also hits the dialogues that are excellent, and also has many references to racism too, and obviously the film is strange in several moments, there are parts that you will not understand So strange, the script is very round, the only thing I did not like so much was a part of the end, I found it cliché well in a few moments, but fortunately the movie concerts, Get Out is a great movie, one of the best movies of the year , And the biggest surprise so far, I hope the film gets an indication to Oscar.

","Awesome flick! Super creepy, freaky, scary, and super funny too! The plot is totally whacked out, but it works and I was as scared as I've been in ""regular"" horror flicks! And Marcus Henderson steals all of his scenes and is absolutely hysterical! The other actors are top notch too, and the story is superb! And two of the songs in here are completely used to maximum freaky deaky effect! I'm definitely watching this one again!"

","This movie is unexpected and unpredictable - think Twighlight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock, My Mother the Serial Killer, Stepford Wives, The Lottery - put them all in a blender with great actors and spooky music and it comes close to describing this film. Jordan Peele slices through political correctness like a neurosurgeon. You end up hating the characters you liked and liking the TSA! Nothing ends up the way you expect. Heading in one direction, you think you have it figured out and all of a sudden, you take a proverbial left turn off a cliff (with a stupid brother playing banjo) and things are not what they seem. Pacing, timing cinematography, lighting, music all combine to keep things tight and focused. Funny moments but this isn't a comedy. You will leave the movie theater thinking more deeply and seeing more clearly and wanting to see the movie again! (But you may never drink a cup of tea again!)"
"gtyoshida","9","10","19","17 June 2017"," Destined to be a Classic
","Film fans might avoid the movie ""Get Out"" because it looks like another drama about a black man, a white woman, and the way they are treated in the inter racially unfriendly deep south. However they will quickly discover that director Jordan Peele has twisted this theme of racial ethnicity into a bizarre and intense psychological thriller. The story revolves around Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) a young black photographer who is dragged by his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to her parent's traditional gathering of wealthy white family and friends. Chris is well aware of the hostility he might encounter from the white folks in Alabama but he isn't prepared for the unnatural behaviour of the black people he encounters, especially the gardener (Marcus Henderson) and the maid (Betty Gabriel) whom Rose ironically insists are part of the Armitage family. Rose's father, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) walks Chris through the family history and discloses some interesting facts Rose's grandfather while his wife Missy (Catherine Keener) corrals Chris into a discussion about hypnosis and her ability to cure people of their disgusting smoking habit all the while stirring a cup of tea with her spoon. Everything seems benign in the Armitage family until Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) reveals his true racial prejudice although Missy quickly puts him back in line. The next day, Chis is introduced to several guests attending the gathering who share their admiration for particular traits of black race; the physical strength, the athletic ability, and the fashionable appeal. But when he notices the one black guest resembles an old acquaintance named Dre (Lakeith Stanfield) who mysteriously disappeared from the neighbourhood several years ago, Chris calls his New York friend Rod (LilRel Howery) who investigates the matter and eventually comes to rescue him from this horrible nightmare. ""Get Out"" will certainly prove to be one of the great, psychological thrillers and deserves its high IMDb rating."

","This movie is the second best movie of the year (the first one is Logan), it's a surprise than in this world of sequels and remakes, we can get a good movie from time to time.

"larrymeers","10","10","19","15 June 2017"," A very intense and very original horror comedy
","Get Out focuses on a black man named Chris while he travels with his girlfriend to meet her very nice but very suspicious parents. After Chris is introduced to the house he sees some disturbing imagery and weird acts that make him think something more darker is present, but what exactly? First off, everybody in the movie is great. This film also offers some astounding visual horror. I didn't expect this to be a comedy, but when you get the comedy it really pays off. <br/><br/>Get Out actually touches some of the social issues that are in our world such as racism and it does it in a very smart way. The soundtrack is also pretty great and works very well with what is going on in the movie. This isn't a flaw but there are some scenes that were scary but it didn't really make any sense, but fortunately the big twist explains why that weird thing happened. I won't spoil it, but the twist is very satisfying and is very unsettling to even think about. <br/><br/>In the end, Get Out was a very intense but also in a sort of sense serious with things that happen in our community and excellently blends horror, comedy, and social commentary in one original and creative film. A+ or 10/10"
"listener71","2","10","19","15 June 2017"," Anti-white racist propaganda
","Not a bad movie itself-kind of interesting,some good acting,cinematography is fine...but story is ridiculous with too many plot holes-10 or so black people are missing all connected to the same white girl and no one finds it a little bit strange? Anyway,this is propaganda piece which makes it worthless in my book.All whites are crazy,all whites are evil,all whites are jealous at black people cause they have better bodies and so on and so on...this movie pretends to be social satire toward racism but it ends like being racist itself.<br/><br/>p.s. Microsoft obviously spent some money on this movie and boy it is shown-they are literally everywhere...to see someone actually using Bing as search engine was even more weird then all that brains transplantation stuff!"
"amerbajramovic","6","10","19","13 June 2017"," Fine thriller - nothing special
","I don't know who is declaring a type of a movie these days but whoever it is he doesn't know how to describe a horror 'cus this movie ain't one. It is a psychological and a bit scary thriller.<br/><br/>A whole idea of hypnosis is just too crappy. I think that any psychiatrist would spit on this movie. Unrealistic and way too easy road to a total open gate of a human mind.<br/><br/>One of the main reason for my relatively low note is because a whole plot, from beginning till end is more the predictive. If you pay just a pinch of attention you will be able to know what is going to happen at any time.<br/><br/>Other then hypno-crap, twisted psychology of this movie is quite interesting and beside few small mistakes it is proper movie. It got the action, blood, gore, psychos, bit of humor, small lack of erotics for a horror (or thriller as well).<br/><br/>To sum, noting really special but quite watchable."
"BlueDotProductions","10","10","19","5 June 2017"," Wow. So impressed with this
","Not since a Hitchcock have I seen such mastery. As a filmmaker, it's very difficult to sit thru a film without a few eye rolls, a question of writing, the shot, the acting. My producer friend tells me ""Just enjoy the damn movie!"" Well, with this one - I was lost in it. It was subtle, well shot, extremely well directed. Loved the writing, the premise. The tension was palpable. The sound mix was spot on, and well balanced. Even the scary parts were done with class. Gotta see it."
"pavlek-11262","10","10","19","4 June 2017"," Out Of Breath
","Made an account just to rate this movie and if you ask why I rated it 10/10, it is because of the following reasons (no spoilers):<br/><br/>1. I've read the brief description, thought it was just a ""racism"" movement movie, was really making my mind if I should watch this, after it, I just can't look at other horror movies/thrillers without comparing it to this masterpiece. 2. Acting, actors fit perfectly with roles, every single one of them. It is just amazing. 3. The story was well executed. Perfectly. It follows the viewers line of thinking, and not some ""Hey, let's explore this because we're original like that."" story like in 99% of the today's horror movies. 4. NOT a single jumpscare, but some scenes, boy, will they keep you on your toes. The quality I always look in a horror movie. If you jumpscare me, go away. If you set the mood so tight and so right... it's perfect. A perfect horror movie. 5. Again, the story. It's just too good. And the actors fit them so well, it is not even funny.. So hard to describe it without spoiling anything, but guys, it's worth the 102mins. Trust me.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's a funny black dude, like always. Good guy."
"tomgillespie2002","8","10","19","1 June 2017"," Creepy, thoughtful and often hilarious
","The warning comes early on in Get Out, comedian Jordan Peele's deliciously unsettling horror and directorial debut. As successful New York photographer Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) phones his best friend Rod (a hilarious LilRel Howery) to break the news that he is to meet his white girlfriend's middle-class parents at their countryside home, Rod immediately voices his concerns. He is adamant that there is bound to be some weird, sex-slave s**t going down, but Chris laughs it off with no idea with what is in store for him. In years to come, I have no doubt that Get Out will be a key case study in trying to understand the racial minefield that is modern America. While many have convinced themselves that such medieval attitudes are now behind them, it's quite clear that tensions are as high as ever in the #BackLivesMatter, post-Obama world we live in.<br/><br/>On their journey, Chris and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) hit a deer. When being questioned by the police, the white officer can't resist giving Chris a hard time, even though he wasn't the one driving. He receives a telling-off from Rose, but the tone is set. Chris shrugs it off because he is no doubt used to it. Upon arriving at the impressive home of the potentially future in-laws, father and neurosurgeon Dean (Bradley Whitford) insists they are 'huggers', and appears to embrace Chris. He nonetheless lets slip opinions about wiping out the race of pesky deer who roam their land and voices his frustration at his own father missing out on the Olympic Games due to Jesse Owens, but again this is nothing Chris hasn't seen before from middle-class, white Obama-voters. Rose's mother Missy (Catherine Keener) is more steely, but is a trained hypnotist and offers to help Chris rid himself of his nicotine addiction. So far, so uncomfortable, but things soon get seriously weird.<br/><br/>For such apparently racially-blind liberals, their household staff are all black. Not only that, but they are like dead-eyed robots, all smiles and pleasantries masking pleading and inner turmoil. When Chris tries to bond with groundskeeper and fellow brother Walter (Marcus Henderson), the conversation is awkward and stiff, and maid Georgina (the brilliant Betty Gabriel) seems to do little during her off- hours but stare at herself in the mirror. At a gathering at their home, the only black face in the large crowd seems unnervingly familiar, but he is dressed up like a trophy pet by his fat, much older white wife. When Missy finally gets Chris to sit down for a session and open up about the death of his mother, his worst fears are truly realised. Taking inspiration from, of all films, Being John Malkovich (which also starred Keener), Peele directs these moments with the eye of a horror maestro, proving to be truly uncomfortable, claustrophobic viewing.<br/><br/>Get Out wears its heart on its sleeve, with an almost complete disregard for subtlety. However, this works in the film's favour. It's hugely entertaining and frequently very funny, so it will appeal to just about any audience, reaching more people in the process. Word-of-mouth has already gotten around, so the message is clearly resonating. It's sharp and unique in a way that modern horror movies rarely are, and in no way feels like an elongated sketch from the Key and Peele TV show. Although I've seen relatively little of his work outside of sketches on YouTube and his appearance with Keegan- Michael Key in season 1 of Fargo, there is nothing in his previous output to suggest he was capable of crafting such an intelligent and engaging horror movie. Satirically savvy and edgy, Get Out is also creepy and thoughtful, proving that a black man alone in the white suburbs is just as terrifying as a pretty white girl lost in the woods."
"deloudelouvain","8","10","19","29 May 2017"," Subtle racism and a lot of mystery makes this movie stand out from the rest.
","With a title as Get Out I was expecting a bloody horror movie but it isn't that kind of movie. I would not call it a real horror movie though, more a mystery thriller. The mystery part is clearly the best part of the movie and luckily for us the mystery last almost the entire movie. It all starts nicely but the more you get into the movie the more it gets creepy. There's clearly something bad going on, but they don't reveal everything at once and that's a real positive thing in this movie. The suspense building is slow but once you're into it you won't get out of it. Daniel Kaluuya plays the major character and he did a great job. The rest of the cast was also good and they all contribute to make this movie better than the rest in this genre. To me the best part of the movie is the middle of the movie where you wonder what the hell is happening. One of the better movies in this genre that I saw this year."
"TigerHeron","8","10","19","28 May 2017"," Fun Thriller; Not Racist and Not Political
","People are way overthinking this movie. It's not a social/political satire. It's not racist. Yes, it does make fun of white racist stereotypes of black people, but nobody in their right mind would think the writer/director actually thinks most white people think like the mad scientists in this film do. This is a basic thriller, a piece of old-fashioned movie-making. It is inspired by the classic ""The Stepford Wives"" which did something similar with sexism as this film does with racism.<br/><br/>The plot involves a young black man who is taken by his girlfriend to visit her parents for the weekend. The family has black servants who act weird. Although the plot unfolds in a somewhat predictable way, the movie is elevated by intriguing parallels that involve the main character's childhood trauma. The mom is a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis, and being a hypnotherapist myself I can say that although these scenes exaggerate the power of hypnosis, they don't exaggerate it by much.<br/><br/>There are a few surprises, but what I liked best about this movie is the strange recurring motif that involves the main character's trauma. We see his weakness but also his strength. That made this film a cut above standard horror/thriller movies.<br/><br/>By the way this movie is not very violent; it's about average for a suspense movie. If you want a slasher movie with a lot of blood and gore this isn't it. It's a thinking person's movie."
"NosworthyG","10","10","19","18 May 2017"," Original, authentic, thought provoking and meticulous
","I went to see this film knowing nothing about it, not even its genre. I was given some clues during the trailers before the movie. First I was forced to enter a room with a young girl looking out the window only to turn around and suddenly reveal to my shock and horror the she was a very loud CGI monster. Then I was made to watch some kids go into a dark scary room filled with water which was suddenly and very loudly a clown-doll's swimming pool... or something.<br/><br/>And so I discovered Get Out is a horror movie. Get Out, however, does not follow a formulaic build up of jump scares and rehashed imagery to create it's tension and tone. It does this through meshing flawless cinematography with brilliant acting, music, lighting and script. Furthermore, the movie has plenty of commentary on the modern and historical faces of racism which it explores masterfully whilst never insulting its audience by being too brash.<br/><br/>Every shot in this movie feels carefully crafted to create tension and unease. From the single uncut shot of the opening scene to the unnerving choice of extreme close ups during dialogue. So often the choice of shot subverts what you would expect for the scene. Characters being warmly greeted by family is shown in a long shot giving a sense of detachment and that feeling of being watched. You are also as acutely aware of what is not in frame during the film as you are of what is in frame and this only adds to the ever mounting suspense. Combine all this with an eerie soundtrack (if a little cliché) and you have a film that feels organically creepy and not manufactured.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film has genuine moments of comedy, which is unsurprising given its director's background. But the occasional comedic shifts in the movies tone never felt clunky. Well rounded and well fleshed out characters meant that the humour felt like it came naturally to scenes.<br/><br/>To go with the meticulous directing is a strong script. The film reveals information at an appropriate rate, the pacing is never tedious or rushed and most importantly, character motivations never feel inauthentic. Importantly, there wasn't that ""I'm going to stop escaping to go open that door where the eerie music is coming from. I hope that loud, jumpy, stabby thing that's been chasing me isn't there"" scene that pulls you from the movie. <br/><br/>This film is as intelligent as it is gripping. It will disturb and entertain you whilst viewing it. It will provoke thought during and after. It will continue to grow on you long after watching. Jordan Peele has put together a wholly original film that feels fresh, authentic and most of all meticulously crafted. I thought hard about what rating to give it and ended up figuring if I don't give a film this unique and this well made a 10, then what's the point in having a score go up to 10. Do yourself and those interested in original and well made cinema a favour by supporting this film and seeing it on the big screen."

It deals with old school racism ( yes ) but not in the way most expect. It's not horror ( apart from being trapped , is horror ) social dialogue aside it's a great thriller, keeps clues coming with enough humour to keep it fairly light.

","IT'S no secret that comedians can have a darker side away from the belly laughs and humour.<br/><br/>For Jordan Peele - one half of the hilarious Key and Peele duo - he's taken a hot-button issue and turned it into a film that's both currently pertinent to what's going on in the US and deeply disturbing.<br/><br/>Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is a photographer with a keen eye. He's also African American and is dating a white girl, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). This cute pair head off for the weekend to Rose's parents' home in what will be his first time meeting them.<br/><br/>Reservations about being black are dismissed as paranoia by Rose and the couple head off to the picturesque suburbs. However, not is all as it seems upon arriving and it soon becomes apparent that Chris's fears had some foundation as Rose's mysterious parents, played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener, show something more sinister beneath the fake smiles and feigned interest.<br/><br/>Writer and director Peele has pulled off a masterstroke with one of the most timely and horrifying satirical takes on anxieties facing African Americans in the 21st century. If that's not enough, it also takes aim at the horrendous slaving past that blights the country's history."

","I'm a big fan of horror movies, no matter what type they are even though I've had enough of the typical horror movies where I can tell the plot without even watching the movie. I thought this looked interesting when I watched the trailer and oh my, it was interesting indeed. <br/><br/>The movie is so unlike many of the other horror movies out there. It wasn't about getting sick to your stomach from gore or screaming from the jump scares. I felt like the key in this movie was the feeling of something being wrong, even though it was hard to tell exactly what. You had to stay alerted during the entire movie because everything had its own purpose for the plot. You got the depth of the characters without it being boring or taking up too much of the movie, many thanks to the dialogues that really sent shivers down the spine at some points. <br/><br/>I loved seeing Daniel Kaluuya as Chris, his way of expressing himself through his eyes was unbelievable. A lot of the things that made the movie good was his way of acting, not entirely through his words but his face, eyes, and body. <br/><br/>Not to mention Allison Williams as Rose, that was something to watch and I was impressed by her acting (and a bit disturbed as well). I loved how she went from bright and friendly to a maniac with a face of stone. The part where she was talking to Rod over the phone gave me chills, the way she sounded so worried and caring but her face was a total blank. <br/><br/>Overall, a very good movie!"

","Wow. Just wow. About time Hollywood had the balls to put out something like this. Bravo! This is the kind of movie you want to watch again right after watching it because of how new and innovating it is. This isn't the same recycled horror film you've seen a million times before, and that is why this film performed as well as it did. I'm guessing you know the plot already. A white girl takes her black boyfriend to meet her parents and the boyfriend notices an above average amount of racial awareness and overall creepiness going on with her family. And I'll leave it at that. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie without knowing anything else about it. I can't wait to watch it again. I think this film does an outstanding job of letting film goers feel what a black person or any minority feels like in the United States, at times.

"valzheimer","10","9","17","9 November 2017"," Thrilling and very enjoyable with some intelligent character writing for a change
","I just hate it when every horror/thriller movie takes out intelligence from victims and this movie is very satisfying on this matter. Chris is likable, relatable, intelligent and capable, which automatically makes him stand out as a protagonist in this genre. With underlined political message to think about, the movie takes you on a joyful thriller ride filled with suspense. There's just enough of humor to chuckle through it and it's well timed to not take away from creepiness of the situation. Chris' impressions of things developing are in line with audience which keeps movie on topic every minute of it and doesn't fall behind in keeping it suspenseful.<br/><br/>I've seen lots of people complaining how message about white people playing on privilege is too much in your face and I beg to differ. There's plentiful screenplay lines that affect Chris realistically and that are happening out there in the real world. Anyone who would find character's domination through this story insulting needs to be reminded that that table turns story to story and this story was this guy's turn. While it's good to think about that topic, thrill is guiding the movie and is written for the genre and screened incredibly well - if you'd allow that your ego is so strong to prevent you enjoying such a great cinematic piece, then problem is not the movie, or that message."
"dejavoodoobrand","9","9","17","30 August 2017"," Lame Name - but an exceptional flick!!!!!!!!!
","In retrospect - Perhaps the best way to experience this film is to read nothing, including genre classifications. It is extremely well written, acted and directed and is unlike so many movies out there - new clothes for an old body. This film is unusual in so many respects - from the symbolic scenes and gestures, and the music choices to the way it unfolds. After watching this film, I felt like I'd read a very satisfying book. More than most films I've seen in recent years, I really wanted to watch it again after having a fuller understanding of everything it contains. Sure, there were some 'plot twists' that I saw coming right from early into it, however these didn't diminish my enjoyment of seeing it all unfold.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I did come here and read some of the ""Spoiler Alert"" Trivia. It revealed a few things that I would have missed. Obviously this is a film worth talking about with others, seeing again, rethinking, etc. On the other hand, I felt the name was very poorly chosen. Right from the first time I saw it advertised, I just about overlooked it, as the name, combined with the genre, suggested that it wasn't probably the kind of film that would interest me. I'm so glad that I decided to check it out. I suspect different people will have very different reactions to it. It touches on some serious points, strikes unexpected nerves, and has some very unpredictable scenes. <br/><br/>Hard to believe that this is a first time director.<br/><br/>A very strong piece of work, with great contributions from most departments: (preproduction, production and post production)<br/><br/>UNFORGETTABLE!"

","Here in Portugal, Get Out was released later so I actually watched it at home ... twice. Yes, a movie like this needs a second watch, a more focused look at the details and a more concentrated mind to find all the clues to the expected twist in any genre film like this one. Well, I'm happy to say that Get Out is right up there in the contenders' list for the best movie of 2017 so far!<br/><br/>I never was a big fan of horror movies, but as time goes by I keep enjoying them more and more (maybe before I just watched the pretty bad ones). I didn't know the cast, but I did know Jordan Peele ... However, not as a director. My God, how great is he?! Excellent directing skills throughout the whole runtime: amazing camera-work (some cool long takes), efficient jump-scares with the adequate loud and brief background sounds, but his major achievement is definitely the screenplay. Thought-provoking, disturbing and it handles racism and any preconceptions in a way that, by the end, floored me. Great concept, executed seamlessly.<br/><br/>The unknown cast (to me, at least) is just an awesome surprise. Everyone shines in this brilliant movie and elevate it to a super captivating story that already has a fantastic mystery and intrigue surrounding it. Daniel Kaluuya is unbelievably amazing, all of the actors portraying the Armitage's family and housekeepers are equally spectacular and LilRel Howery (Rod Williams) is amazing as the comic relief guy.<br/><br/>The tone switches a lot throughout the film. Peele goes from comedy to horror, from drama to thriller in an instant, but it's so well- directed that its fluidity is near perfection. Also, the editing is flawless to my knowledge and the way he depicted and explored every preconception and racist stereotype is really brilliant.<br/><br/>A movie definitely worth watching, at least, twice. It has a huge replay value and I already see it as a horror classic.<br/><br/>Does it have flaws? Unfortunately, it does ... In the smallest details, but it does. Watching a second time I couldn't help to notice that some scenes are just weird, with no real meaning behind it. Rose's backstory is my main and only issue with the screenplay, but I really can't get more in-depth than this unless I spoil it for you, which I won't. I can just say that there's a plot point that I still struggle to accept/understand.<br/><br/>There are also some exposition scenes that could have been handled differently and the pacing dragged a little bit in the second act, but it didn't affect me that much since the writing is so great that it almost passed by without me really noticing.<br/><br/>Get Out is probably the most underrated movie in Portugal so far and I'm thrilled that I was able to catch it and watch it twice. Jordan Peele proves that his directing skills are something extraordinary, his screenplay is pure brilliance and his cast is unquestionably incredible, starting on the protagonist, Daniel Kaluuya, to LilRel Howery, the man behind the comedy bits in the film. A very important and thought-provoking movie with social preconceptions on other races explored to the tiniest detail, that only fails to deliver a precise backstory to Rose and it has some really minor issues with its second act's pacing and exposition scenes.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

"eden-rabatsch","10","9","17","4 July 2017"," Brilliant Horror Satire - Spoiler Break halfway down
","This is a masterpiece. Time and time again, genre cinema has proved that it so agile and quick that it can represent a society in a way more prestige cinema might take decades to achieve. That Jordan Peele should achieve this as a first time writer and director is beyond amazing especially considering his lurch from comedy to horror. The premise is a chestnut, awkward and prone for satirical mischief: an interracial couple going home to meet the parents. We are introduced to Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) who are discussing their first visit to meet Rose's parents. Already, you have shades of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" as Chris openly asks whether Rose has informed them of his colour. That is all I can say.this is one of those rare films where any analysis of the film will completely ruin the experience but from the trailer we all know we are headed into disturbing waters. The cast is filled out by Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford playing Rose's parents Missy and Dean Armitage. They have one other son, Jeremy, played by Caleb Landry Jones. The other main role is Rod Williams played by LilRel Howery who is Chris' best friend. They are all great though I think Howery steals every scene he is in. Peele does some brilliant work here. The most obvious influence is ""The Stepford Wives"" which also sat in the uneasy position of horror and satire especially on modern white sensibilities. However, more than that Peele is assured in how he moves the camera. Often he is more scientist, capturing the anthropology of the scene and helping the audience observe and slowly put together the bigger threads in play. That Peele as a comedian is adept at cutting through the hypocrisy of society for laughs is evident as he weaponises it to cut through in a much more horrific sense. This is most clearly seen in how the point of view of all is put forward - Peele clearly has traversed both worlds. I am going to put a break in here. Only read below if you have seen the film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>So the film becomes a horror film because the Armitage's have perfected a method of hypnotising young black people and then having wealthy white people have brain tissue inserted into their brains giving them control of the body and a form of immortality. They even bid for the best bodies in a scene that could be plucked out of a slavery history book. It is how Peele frames this horror conceit that makes it magisterial. Peele is playing 4 dimension chess here because the evil white protagonists (and one random Asian guy) are all upper middle class non racist (in their minds) Obama style Democrats. There are no rednecks, hillbillies or skinheads here. In fact, the reason they are choosing, in the main, young black men is that they are fitter, better genetics, sexier and in some ways cooler. Though the implication is that those assets have been wasted. That with all those advantages these men should have achieved more, and now will, as the gifted body will have a white master. The film also plays with the concept of minority fear in a majority white society. At all times in the film except for the blacks portrayed in uniform, the black characters are always watching their next step, and how it will be perceived. This has a ringing effect considering Peele wrote this as the Ferguson shooting and Black Lives Matter movement started to take hold in the US. Peele is on record that he even changed the ending as he needed to give some hope. His previous ending showed a typical white policeman shooting an innocent black man scenario that he now found too bleak. At this stage I just want to say I found Allison Williams breathtaking. Not only was she the scariest her outright psychopathic and controlling personality shown in the fantastic milk drinking, cereal eating, NBA Tinder scrolling will be legendary. Hopefully, her agent gets her a rom-com because it is hard for me to even look at her now and not be terrified. Not much more can be said. Peele has done the impossible. A great horror film which has you thinking weeks afterward. Those films are rare indeed and soon become legendary."

","This is an astounding movie. 'Get Out' is a gripping horror story, excellently conceived and executed that also serves as biting social satire. A horror story told un-apologetically from a black perspective, it is really creepy as the main character Chris, a young black man, is lured into this white world where no stereotype is spared. Overt racists, closeted racists, racial 'sellouts', white girlfriends and liberals are all equal under first time writer/director Jordan Peele's eyes. I have to admit it made me feel more than a little embarrassed but it's done in such a way that the satire ADDS to the feeling of growing horror. It's truly amazing because not only does it make you uneasy and afraid, it forces you to see the world through Chris' eyes.<br/><br/>I watched both the theatrical and alternate ending and both play really well. The one the that ends down might have been in danger of taking away from the horror aspect of the movie and made it too much about 'the message' but it would have still been great and satisfying in it's way. And sometimes the comic relief pushes a bit far but it doesn't break the suspense. It's really an incredible movie. If this is any indication of who Jordan Peele is as a writer/director there are great things ahead."

"drqshadow-reviews","9","9","17","30 May 2017"," Creepy and Curvy, Topical and Terrifying; Excellent on Many Levels
","Jordan Peele's screen writing/directorial debut is quite the leap, exchanging the comedic chops one might expect for a potent blend of social commentary, suspense and horror. Peele shows us a creepy upper-class suburban atmosphere, host to a mixed-race couple's ""meet the parents"" moment, with a thick, permeating air of uncertainty and alarm. Everyone seems overly accepting of Chris, hometown girl Rose's new black boyfriend, but there's a look to their gaze that might imply something else. The town's dark-skinned residents, however, are less reserved. They behave like marionettes, Stepford Wives with an unnervingly wide smile: stiff, oddly-dressed and thoroughly disconcerting in posture and prose. At first glance, I worried that the metaphors Peele was searching for would be too on-the-nose and blunt, but his well paced, muti-layered story soon brushes those concerns away. The analogies remain, but they're nuanced and subtle, effective players in a larger tapestry. The greater story is twisting and unpredictable, a mystery that efficiently mixes legitimate worries with tension-breaking laughs and personal connections to throw us off the scent. We don't know who's in on the scheme (or what that scheme might be) until the very end, and for too long Chris is afraid to point fingers, lest he offend. Balancing social niceties with the increasing terror makes a great vehicle for this genre, and the prim-and-proper atmosphere only makes the occasional weird offhand remark or personal tick stick out that much more. An excellent small-scale nail-biter, it's richly crafted and sharp, with a sensitive finger right on the cultural pulse. Well worth the hype."
"patomartinezfgo","9","9","17","28 May 2017"," Its one of the best movies of the year
","I loved this movie! This year has been full of sh*t, I have seen very few movies this year that made me walk out of the theatre with a smile on my face. The only movies I have seen this year that I really loved are Split, Logan, and Get Out.<br/><br/>This movie perfectly combines horror, comedy and social commentary. And it is the good kind of social commentary, because its not just saying some stupid sh*t about how racist we are, it actually makes you think and provides some very interesting ideas that really enrich the experience.<br/><br/>The performances are all great. The main actor was great in this film like he was in ""Black Mirror"" and in ""Sicario"". The rest of the actors also did a very good job and the comic relief character was hilarious, I laughed every time that dude was on- screen.<br/><br/>The horror or thriller aspect of this movie was great. There were many scenes in which I was hugging the arm rest out of anxiety. The whole purpose that this white-folks have with ""Chris"" actually terrified me. The only bad thing about the horror is that this movie actually uses the ""someone passed through the hallway and the score becomes loud for a second"" which is really cheap.<br/><br/>The comedy was also pretty good. The director understood that this whole idea had some level of absurdity to it. So he used that to the advantage of the film and created some scenes in which the whole movie theatre was bursting with laughter. I believe that the movie handled pretty well the transitions between the horror and the comedy.<br/><br/>The social commentary is also pretty good. It talks about a whole other level or racism. One in which the characters have passive-aggressive racism. I thought that it really enriched the movie experience.<br/><br/>The whole tone and feeling of the movie is great. You feel awkward when the character feels awkward, and scared when he is scared.<br/><br/>The score and cinematography are great and really made this movie have a much cooler style.<br/><br/>Also, the movie had quite a lot of metaphors and symbols.<br/><br/>Definitely go support this movie. It is really a unique and fun experience."
"Screen_Blitz","9","9","17","28 May 2017"," Jordan Peele's gutsy comedy-horror hybrid is not just entertaining, it is surprisingly smart in its daring satire
","Get Out is a combination of a comedy and a horror, but it certainly isn't your average horror-comedy hybrid. It is one that makes a daunting achievement of not only evenly balancing laughs with a grim tone, but providing a fascinatingly unique examination on racism, an issue that is overwhelmingly relative in our society today. There are gut-busting laughs, there are some dark moments, and are even some scenes of gore. But above these components is an intelligent, yet bizarre allegory of the African-American community falling victim to racial prejudice among a society where racism has run rampant. The mastermind behind this treat is Jordan Peele, the sketch comedic star fresh from Comedy Central's 'Key and Peele' and taking the seat in his directorial debut. With a blend of vulgar humor and gags centered on racial stereotypes, Peele's comedic flair definitely bleeds through. This film focuses on Chris Washington (played by Daniel Kaluuya), a twenty-something year old African- American man who sets out to spend the weekend with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (played by Allison Williams) at her parents' house. Upon meeting her parents (played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) for the first time, Chris quickly begins to witness some strange behavior among the family including relatives and their house maid Georgina (played by Betty Gabriel) who happens to African-American. This leads to one major conclusion: something is not about this family. <br/><br/>It is significantly rare that directors successfully pull off an congruent balance of outrageous laughter and spine-chilling scares, let alone splicing smart social commentary on racial prejudice. Jordan Peele manages to hit that note in nearly every way possible to the point where there is never a dull moment. The film spends the first half showcasing the paranoia of the lead character's uncomfortable situation including calm interactions with his girlfriend's family that quickly morph into awkward circumstances. Throughout the time, Peele does a tremendous job at breathing suspense into the atmosphere that viewers feeling off-kilter and questioning what on Earth is happening around the lead character and what the characters are thinking about the lead character being colored skin and dating a white female. In turn of satirizing the subject matter, the film does so by providing witty social commentary about the African-American stereotypes rather than being going the obvious route by preaching about racial bigotry. Along the way, there is more than a handful of laughs to be offered, most of which come from the lead character's best friend played by LilRel Howery who spends most of the time away from the chaos. It is not until the final half-hour however, when the film escalates into a gory and unnerving fiasco, challenging viewers' expectations upon every turn. While the ending does not the strike a chord in the surprise department, Peele never fails to defy against uniformity nor does slap viewers in the face with his political message. <br/><br/>Get Out is an entertaining, audacious, and surprisingly brainy horror-comedy that not only showcases Jordan Peele's unexpected directorial talent, but opens the door to an outrageous fun, yet bizarre good time. Marking this film as cinematic gold for both the comedy and horror genre may be saying a lot. At the same time, it wouldn't be too unreasonable, especially as no Hollywood director has a made a more daring comedic endeavor such a long time."

About ghosts, anyways.<br/><br/>This is NOT a ghost story as I somehow misinterpreted it to be. That was my bad. What it is is a refreshing, original, wonderfully written and awesome throwback to real horror movies from 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Yep. This could've easily come out in 1977 and with the exception of cell phones and the TSA, it would've fit perfectly.

Good for him. He succeeded. While, technically, it's more ""thriller,"" it definitely fits in the horror genre. <br/><br/>With the horror market more than drenched in ghost/haunted house stories of the past decade, I applaud a filmmaker for thinking outside the box and making a horror movie for the rest of us. The Invitation and Who's Next? are just two other examples in recent years that impressed me instead of boring me with the same ole spooked spirit spin.<br/><br/>While not groundbreaking or unpredictable, it's a fun little freaky tale that ends exactly how I had hoped it would. Well done, Peele. Come back. We need more ghostbustin' of the current horror trend.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I happened to see another ""horror"" movie today in the theatre: Alien: Covenant. Funny. Famous Director Ridley Scott helmed that ""horror"" movie, but probably needs to contact Peele if he plans on making his next Alien movie actually scary."

It is like 12 Years a Slave as a horror film, in some ways at least. Also the twists the film contained kept me interested throughout the whole time (although the midsection had some lengths, but that was essential for the ending). The acting was solid. I really liked Daniel Kaluuya who I foresee to have a great career in Hollywood. Such a charismatic and expressional actor who hit all the right tones with his performance. Also Allison Williams was decent and charismatic. We will see more of her too. Always nice to see Catherine Keener. Bradley Whitford was also fine. Caleb Landry Jones creepy as usual but he really is good at that. Would make a great Joker one day. Great soundtrack that was only a small part of the excellent symbolism provided by Jordan Peele throughout the film. The screenplay was the MVP for sure. The ending revelation was a bit too out of this world and exaggerated for me, the rest worked as a fine horror drama with a lot of depths."

","In a cinema full of suspense movies, ""Corra"" does not revolutionize the genre, but does in a daring and different way, joining blockbuster to a highly artistic cinema, we do not have that session of a fright for minutes and no shallow characters with Ghostly characters, complex characters, high development, social criticism, a spectacular direction and great performances, the daring novice Jordan Pele, accustomed to acting, and making his directorial debut recalls names like Spielberg for betting that Artistic side aligned to a good script is better than an appeal to call the public, also has a Stephen King side, for transforming from something so mundane and natural into something that walks the linearity of the supernatural and occult and why not even Hitchcock and even Shyamalan , And at times he very much remembers Scorsese's ""The Island of Fear"", for Jordan, makes ""Run"" a scrap of the best Suspense has to offer, even if it makes small mistakes. ""Run"" tells the story of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young black man who goes inside to meet his girlfriend's parents, Rose (Allison Williams), arriving at the house, Chris begins to realize that family has something to hide ... It seems even an afternoon session synopsis, but the film goes beyond, the script is great, it's linear, it knows how to create a tension like few, this the first second of the movie we notice that something is wrong, this is the first The movie has a comic relief that bothers it, it breaks the tension of the film, the movie goes through more than an hour building a tension, and instead of letting the viewer enter, conjecture and reflect until a Hypothesis about the construction of the film, everything we imagine about the outcome is verbalized in a joke, and this is horrible, even the final solution being very creative, the last scene does not please, but it's not all bad either. The film criticizes a post- modern slavery, and the whole movie is surrounded by a racial tension that is suffocating, even though they are stereotyped in some points, the film makes us feel disgusted with characters not by themselves verbalize rampant racism, but rather By hiding it, this is new, it is well built, and leaves a very nice criticism. Unlike most suspense movies where tension has to be created, ""Run"" has an extremely clear photograph, with a warm palette, his photograph is almost cheerful. Permeated by a sensational soundtrack, which goes from Hip-Hop to classical music, it is here that, in due proportion, Jordan jokes about being Hitchcock, using the conductor and thermostat music of the audience, the sound design does not have to be used To scare, because the goal is not this, it is to create tension, and the soundtrack is completely perfect in that aspect, another thing that is perfect is the game of camera that Jordan uses, also emulating Hitchcock, the camera does not stop filming a Frame, she has life, because even with a few movements, she creates an absolute tension, always knowing to position herself in the right angle, she films the characters in a way, that even everyone smiling and cheerful, you get stuck in the chair and clenched fist , Because he knows that something is wrong, we can not fail to mention the rhythm that is going on in an extremely visible rising wave and that he acts the acts excellently, and contributes not only to the construction of the tension, but the construction Plot and character. With a cast, that even being little known, is completely fabulous, I will not mention all the actors, because even the secondary characters haunt, even that character in the background, who does not have some annoying dialogue, all are wonderful, but I will cite our Protagonist, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), because it is what has a more different performance, because it is what makes the pape feel uncomfortable and intuitive with the situation, even with few words and few expressions, Daniel has an incredible posture, and A verbal communication that speaks for itself, this is very interesting, which creates an actor of many facets and complete. ""Run"" has problems, it's true, but it's still exciting, it's different, and it's suspense in its fullest naturalness"

","When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has to go to visit his girlfriend's parents he worries that they don't know he is black and that this might arouse problems. Yet, upon meeting them they appear more than welcoming until strange occurrences in the house and to him start freaking him out and ultimately lead to the discovery of a terrible mystery.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is possibly the culmination of the last few years of great horror and finally solidifies Blumhouse Productions as one of the main protagonists of the modern horror golden age, other than introducing the movie going public to the mind of writer/director Jordan Peele and his stunning sensibilities in genre filmmaking.<br/><br/>What is possibly the most indicative aspect of this film's incredible success is the molding of tones and, as in all in great genre clashes, it makes the comedy and the horror work together and function on the same beats. That is something that is rarely found and when it does work it works to these incredible effects: there are moments where the tension is building and building to incredible stress levels and it gets released with comedy beats that are genuinely funny and laugh out loud moments as much as they are fu*king creepy twisted moments that add to the white-knuckled thriller aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The picture is intense, really intense. It does not let you breathe for a second and I loved every moment of it, it always had me on the tip of my toes, I did not know what was coming next, sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or to be scared and it just got me to this place of being totally locked into it with my body, it affected me physically and that is one of the best compliments you could ever give to a motion picture. Peele knows every trick in the box of how to play the audience and he rarely ever makes a false step in guiding us through the story. The scene weave is flawless and every new bit of information is delivered at the perfectly right time and escalates to twists and twists on twists which never lost me and actually ratcheted up the tension.<br/><br/>It is clear that there is a lot of influences moving Peele around and it is a testament to his cinematic ability that they are never bluntly thrown at your face, instead they are used in a complementary way to bring us a delicious mix of everything. Edgar Wright, Quentin Tarantino, Roman Polanski all transpire beautifully through this film, yet possibly the best one that we get is Hitchcock. On one side we see the homages and the subtle similarities that only make the film better on another it just made me remember why Hitchock was and is the best and why his lessons are universal.<br/><br/>There isn't much to point out here on the negative side, the film flows and hits you without having any stumbles on the way. There are little moments where the quirky, off beat atmosphere gets amplified to 110% and you may start to feel a little overwhelmed, but it picks up immediately and doesn't really leave any trace of that on the film. I think that a 10 or so minutes cut down could have benefited the film in making it even more hard hitting as there are little moments that drag and a couple of plot beats that are explained to the audience shamelessly when they could have been entrusted to work it out by themselves.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is a hard hitting Comedy/Horror, incredibly original and fresh and made with a stunning craft in filmmaking, especially considering this is a feature debut. It scared me, it made me laugh out loud and it made me sweat, a lot, I really enjoyed it."
"NicolasCostoglou","8","9","17","18 May 2017"," If you get a Invitation, Get In...!
","After buying a free ticket for the cinema as a mothers day-gift, i looked through all the big-budget-blockbuster movies which are running currently, and stumbled upon a little Independent-Thriller which i heard great things about: Get Out. The premise sounded kinda like the one of ""The Invitation"" a movie, me and my mom pretty much loved, so we watched it...<br/><br/>And we weren't disappointed, Get Out is a pretty great Psychothriller with some humor thrown in, and a nice commentary on racism.<br/><br/>The atmosphere get's set up perfectly in the opening scene (which is a very well done one-take), and it stays that way for the rest of the movie, the only downside are a few unneeded jump scares, from which only one is justified, when our protagonist runs over a deer with his car. Because of that i was very glad when, roughly from the halfway point the jump scares completely disappeared and got switched out with scenes of suspense and some great surprises.<br/><br/>Interestingly, for me and my mom, the similarities between this movie and ""The Invitation"" doesn't end with the premise, after the opening scene the movie starts with a title sequence with a creepy string- theme and pictures of trees passing by (seemingly because someones driving) and then later the protagonists hit a animal on the road, which serves as a set up for later in the movie. <br/><br/>After that Get Out starts to get it's own voice and intrigued and surprised us pretty much the whole way through.<br/><br/>The characters are very interesting, and the acting is fantastic, sometimes subtle, sometimes kinda over-the-top, but in the end you get why.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me a bit, which is something about the climax, but i already marked this as a spoiler-review:<br/><br/>When the protagonist starts killing the family who tried to hypnotise him and use his body, he shows nearly no remorse by doing pretty brutal and violent stuff to them. I know that he wants to survive, but he has nearly no negative reaction almost like he likes it, even though he got introduced as someone who doesn't like violence. That's also another (and i promise the last) thing i have to compare to a slightly similar climax in the movie ""The Invitation"", where they also have to defend themselves, but more like normal people (like us) who never had to do something like that, but have to, even though they don't like it. (Also there are no unmotivated...well i don't think even one jump scare in that movie, and it's tense as hell throughout)<br/><br/>But the rest of the movie is way to strong to let these things destroy the entertainment value or something, most of all because of the great sense of (dark) humor it has. The other star next to Daniel Kaluuya is the incredibly funny and sincere LilRey Howery, in the most funny scenes in the movie, but never too distractingly funny to get you out of the mood, more to give you a little pause from the suspense.<br/><br/>Get Out is all in all a very entertaining, and surprisingly well done Thriller, with a mysterious and intriguing story, great acting and sense of humor..."

"bowmanblue","8","9","17","11 May 2017"," Good horror isn't dead
","Let's face it, the horror genre seems to have got even more stale than ever lately. Sure, ever since 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' kind of launched the 'slasher' sub-genre of mainstream horror, many films have followed that particular layout, especially when teens were the leads. However, I'm pleased to say that 'Get Out' is actually a breath of – pretty horrific – fresh air.<br/><br/>I'm going to get the word out the way straight away – awkward. Yes, this film's primary emotion it generates in you is not fear, disgust or dread. It's awkwardness (an emotion we've all felt from time to time and one more associated with turning up to work in trainers in an office full of people in smart shoes than full blown horror). However, there's more to it than that.We meet a young mid-twenties couple who are returning to her parents' house in a small, but 'respectable' town in 'Middle America.' Nothing particularly out of the ordinary there, but Chris Washington is a black man and his girlfriend, Rose Armitage, is white. Again, nothing that would raise an eyebrow in most places these days, but this is – at heart and despite its overall awkwardness – a horror movie after all.<br/><br/>When this black man arrives in his potential inlaws' house, there's quite an uncomfortable feeling in the air. They're not racists or bigots, just people who haven't really experienced people of other cultures and races – queue the start of the awkwardness. They do their best to make him feel welcome, constantly referencing supposedly 'black' culture in an effort to make him feel at home. But there's still that awkwardness in the air that something else is going on. This is the point where I can't say too much more without dipping my toe into the territory of 'spoilers.' I will just say that if you thought Ben Stiller had it bad in 'Meet the Parents' you won't believe what poor Chris Washington has to go through! Eventually, the awkwardness and uncomfortable atmosphere cracks and 'Get Out' turns into what it's meant to be – something pretty horrible. It's definitely a pleasant change from the slasher/zombie horror films which seem to be infesting the cinema these days. The closest film I could liken it to may be a certain other dark classic from the seventies starring (amongst others) Nannette Newman, but I'll leave you to wait and see any slight similarities. It does touch on quite a few modern issues with race and the perception thereof, however it's never preachy or annoying by trying to put its message over the fact that it's a dark, disturbing film first (social commentary later!).<br/><br/>'Get Out's' primary strength is its two young leads. They have to be believable as a normal couple who you can relate to in order for us to buy into their plight. And they do. Daniel Kaluuya (Chris Washington) ultimately carries the film and it's impossible not to sympathise for him when the bad stuff really starts to happen. All in all, whatever your politics, as long as you enjoy good, solid, slow-burning horror films which gradually crank up the tension, you really do need to watch this."

","I must say that I was delightfully please by watching this movie. It is rare to find talent in Hollywood these days so when a movie like this comes along and gives us a script and performance we have our faith that all is not lost in the art of cinema. There are a lot of Hitchcockian elements in this picture, despite some comedic scenes, and the actors involved all keep us hooked in our seats. I also got the feel that there were some elements of H. P. Lovecraft sewn into this story. I don't know if that was deliberate, accidental or just my modest impression, but the writers have truly outdone themselves. Bravo!"

I can also say that this movie is well written for most part like for the part with the police and the protagonist which I just realize now lol. I also love the satisfying ending.

"austin0731","8","9","17","28 April 2017"," Brilliant directorial debut for Jordan Peele
","Jordan Peele makes his very interesting directorial debut in racial commentary/horror film ""Get Out"". I really enjoyed this movie, the lead Daniel Kaluuya was really good in this movie and he portrays such an interesting character. The supporting cast was also amazing including, Betty Gabriel who plays the housekeeper Georgina. <br/><br/>What was really great about Get Out is its ability to blend comedy with horror tropes, so this is really something to congratulate Jordan Peele on in his directorial debut and it would be very interesting to see what he has to come. I believe that many of Jordan's personal experiences come through in this film as well, I do believe hearing Jordan Peele commenting in one interview about how he often feels uncomfortable if he was the only black person amongst a group of white people. That sense of paranoia really comes through and is fully understandable and relatable for a non-white viewer like me. However Jordan Peele takes a more comedic route with this adding some light heartedness to an otherwise serious topic.<br/><br/>The horror and underlying mystery of this movie was also really great and the build up to the ultimate reveal was a very good process of which tension arise, so the horror aspect was taken care of also."

","Get Out is an all new horror film directed by (yes, the comedian) Jordan Peele. It was very interesting to see that a comedian had directed this ""horror"" movie and executed it so well. Surprisingly, I wasn't necessarily scared! I was more in shock if anything. This movie seems to poignantly point out horror themed references but it fails to truly make them remarkable. It seems like at first that it doesn't take itself seriously, but some scenes just get more and more peculiar. While it's a weird movie; I can agree it's easily one of the best thrillers you can see this year. It definitely has an idea that strikes out at you in expectations. But I feel it's failed to truly stand as a horror film. Is this a recommended movie? Yes, for what it is. But would I classify this as a horror film? No. I would not.

The cast and acting was great. The music score was phenomenal and perfectly fitting with each scene. The camera work was above average. Plenty of tension breaking moments of levity that were really well executed.<br/><br/>One of my biggest gripes about this movie though has to be the pacing of how they reveal the story. You see the ""twist"" if you can even call it that, a mile away. The movie is aware of this fact and nearly breaks the 4th wall to the audience in recognizing this fact. I'm not sure this entirely makes up for it though, as it just comes off as generally lazy writing.<br/><br/>All in all great flick. If you enjoyed the movie skeleton key, you will enjoy this."

","Heard about this one last year & had to put it on my list of ""must watches"" as it was both a Horror & interesting film (from the sound of it anyway). <br/><br/>So after tonight's viewing, I can say it was a pretty good film! Twisted & sinister in all forms & levels. Not to mention political too, but it's true to reality of slavery happening in this day & age as it sadly does happen still. The film seemed to get more fast paced nearing the end & there was some really good scenes which I won't spoil for you as you have to see this one yourselves!<br/><br/>The film is about a young black man named Chris, who meets Rose, a nice young lady who he's has been dating for 2 months or so. The days arrives when Chris goes to meet Rose's parents, who seem somewhat eccentric & odd in their behaviours. The mum is a counselor & the father has black slaves going about doing house chores! Then after one night when the mother tries to ""cure"" Chris of his smoking addiction, she hypnotises him. Though things seem to get more & more odd as after a party, a black slave orders Chris to ""Get Out!"" thereby shortly after the family are into some serious slavery & Chris is not the first as many others are hypnotised & ""not with it"". He then realises the family, let along his gf, are not who the appear to be...!<br/><br/>The kills were pretty good, same old, same old but hell I'm easily pleased when there's some blood splattering gore going about! I'm a sucker for it! But it was good & better than nothing, which to be fair I was fearing as the film went on. But it kicked in eventually & it seemed to be quite satisfying & worth the wait when it got down to it!<br/><br/>The ending was quite satisfying & nearly seemed to go down the judgemental route, but turned around swiftly to a happy & satisfying ending! I was pleased it ended the way it did, but I won't give away how it ended!<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a solid 9/10 rating! It was pretty sinister & twisted, not to mention a good take on modern day slavery!"

","Jordan Peele's directorial debut is a smash hit. A great take on the horror genre with enough comic satiric material to keep you on the edge of you seat both in terror and abdominal pain. The movie tackles the always complex and divisive theme of race, but it passes the test with flying colors not coming off offensive by any standards. All politics aside the movie is a pure joy to watch. From the simplicity of its shot design to the fool proof way it is directed. The movie is truly remarkable considering that this is Jordan Peele's first movie. Having said this I do think the movie has been garnering exaggerated praise. The movie is a really fun watch but that's about it. For a movie with a 99% (as of today) on RT i found it rather dull and lacking in substance. What it lacks in substance it more than makes up for in style. The movie creates situations that should be frightening but my reaction is laughter. And that's directly the focal point of the man behind the camera and his humor. Regardless the movie builds up to an impressive third act where the funny just leaves and here is where the horror in this movie truly shines. Regardless if I had to compare this movie with A Cure for Wellness (both original horror movies) I would tell you the following. If you love film, composition, and direction see A Cure for Wellness. But If you wanna see a horror film with your friends and just have a good time, well Get Out is your flick."

After watching get out, I was disappointed to realize the movie was exactly what the trailer suggest; a decent thriller(not horror or comedy) which was a well written script with decent casting. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a young interracial couple rose and Chris and their awkward and uncomfortable challenge of meeting Rose's family as they struggle to seem accepting of their daughters new boyfriend. The first 40 mins were suspenseful with outlines of repeatable cultural biases with subtle comedy thrown in. As the movie progresses, it maintains an ideal mix of tension, horror and suspense that you'd hope for. What follows is average thriller movie woven around racial tensions put to film. The main character( Chris) is put into a Caucasian household with a modern image, but views of African Americans fell back to white plantation owners in the mid 1800s. <br/><br/>Decent movie with a definite feel of suspense, but lacks in horror and comedy.

","This movie was a good attempt at horror by Jordan Peele, but it was just that, a good attempt. The movie itself was an adequate film, but nothing special. I can't understand the hype of this film. I think most of the reviews I've read from newspaper and magazine publicists are giving this film more credit than what its truly worth. I also think it's just a case of the movie being released during a time of year when no other anticipated films were set to be released. <br/><br/>The movie starts out slow when Rose Armitage, a white girl, takes her black boyfriend played by Chris Washington to visit her supposed liberal minded parents and friends of her parents, and then after many slow reveals, things take a violent turn. It starts out slow with a lot of build up along the way for the big reveal, but the big reveal isn't really that surprising. And the ending falls thin and feels abrupt. None of the scary reveals actually felt scary. The comic relief in the film is low grade humor to lighten the situation from character Chris Washington's TSA friend. Daniel Kaluuya plays his part well, but most of the acting felt flat and the story felt blah. There have been much better horror films released lately. I wouldn't believe the hype of the positive reviews. It really is just an average forgettable movie. I think Don't Breathe from last year was a much more intense and better made horror flick. You'll forget about ""Get Out"" in a few weeks."

","While the first half of the film is getting increasingly weird and builds up some really scary scenes like the first hypnotism scene, at around the two-third mark it just starts to become so much absurd and grotesque, that it actually turns increasingly funny and not very much scary any more. The racist clichÃ©s are thrown around in a way that they become a rather shallow caricature of racism, and the scene where Rod explains his theory to the police about rich white people abducting black people to make them their brainwashed slaves actually summarizes very well how satyric the whole setup truly is. I couldn't decide how much intentional or not that was, but I liked this change - while it ruins the creepy atmosphere, it makes the movie more than the ""average"" horror movie.<br/><br/>It's a very much enjoyable, well made movie - it's just not a horror, but a satire."

","This is such a clever film. Not only does it have a thrilling, unpredictable and often shocking plot, but it also brilliantly interweaves the horror/mystery element with fantastic comedy and strong social satire. Brilliantly directed by Jordan Peele from start to finish, and featuring an entire cast of excellent performances, Get Out is a hugely entertaining movie that you really won't be able to take your eyes away from.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that really works about this film, however, it's the story. Don't go into this expecting a typical horror movie, because you'll come out disappointed. Whilst Peele brilliantly honours so many classic elements of the genre, this is much closer to a mystery thriller than a bog-standard scarefest, and although there are one or two fun jumpscares, it's the tension of the story that'll really get you hooked.<br/><br/>With an immediately unsettling atmosphere, Get Out is a riveting watch right from the start. However, what it does best is patiently build more and more tension and mystery into the plot as it moves along. The opening act won't have you on the edge of your seat, but it effectively establishes the strangely uneasy atmosphere of the big country house, something that plays a big role in making the following two acts work so well.<br/><br/>From then on, it's twists and turns galore as the film dives into thrilling and even shocking territory. I'll avoid all spoilers as always, because you really don't want to miss the incredible reveals that happen again and again throughout the movie, reveals that turn it from an unsettling thriller/horror parody into something much darker, and yet so ludicrous you could never see it coming.<br/><br/>And that's where the comedy comes in. As strong as the eerie atmosphere is throughout the movie, the story would be lost if there wasn't a good sense of humour thrown in too. As I said, things do take a turn for the more preposterous in the latter stages, but it works perfectly because the film always lets you know it's not taking itself too seriously, right from the start.<br/><br/>But the great thing is that it's not the sort of comedy that would make this a horror-comedy. Whilst it definitely leans more towards enjoyment over scares, the humour in Get Out is fantastically nuanced throughout, never cheapening the nail-biting thrills of its atmosphere and story, yet still making for some brilliant laughs.<br/><br/>You do get a good bit of comic relief from time to time thanks to Daniel Kaluuya's effortless charisma, as well as the hilarious supporting performance from Lil Rel Howery, but the best laughs in the movie come from the mix with the almost comically unsettling world of the upper middle class white people.<br/><br/>And that's where the last spark of genius comes in. Jordan Peele's screenplay is already thrilling and funny, but what makes it even more impressive is its ingenious social satire. Although a little heavy-handed on the subject in the opening act, the film eventually gets into its stride with an utterly hilarious series of jabs at the suspiciously sanitised world of upper middle class white people.<br/><br/>With all of the actors playing along brilliantly, to the extent where you get an insanely creepy Village Of The Damned vibe from the white side of the cast, there's so much fun to be had with the film's satire of that side of society, as well as awkward race relations that are brought up time and time again. It's a brilliantly clever touch, and it adds so much enjoyment to the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Finally, we need to quickly talk about the performances and the directing. The entire cast is fantastic throughout, all playing their roles appropriately for both a horror movie and something a little more comical, helping to glue Peele's two genres together so effortlessly, with particular stand-out performances from Daniel Kaluuya, Lil Rel Howery, Betty Gabriel and Stephen Root.<br/><br/>And then we come on to Jordan Peele's brilliant directing. I've already talked about how perfectly unsettling and creepy this movie is from start to finish, as well as its brilliant blend of humour, satire and thrills, but I also can't ignore how well-paced and well- established this film is. With some excellent editing as well, Peele's fun- loving yet unnerving style works an absolute treat throughout, and that's the final reason that this film just comes together so well.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely loved Get Out. It's a seriously creepy and unsettling film right the way through, and one that will have you biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat right up to the end. However, it's also much more than a brilliant thriller, with amazing humour and social satire thrown into the story, a whole host of amazing performances, and stunning direction from Jordan Peele."
"trublu215","7","37","93","23 February 2017"," While the film does boast some talent, the film itself wallows in self importance.
","Let me start off by saying this: Get Out is far from a bad film. It is genuinely frightening at times and, dare I say, even genius at some moments. But the film's biggest problem is that it knows it is a step above other horror films and it reeks of self importance. When you take into consideration the political climate in America, Get Out is a film that is hitting at a right time. It is tackling white liberal racism in the upper middle class and it does a very good job at making its point. However, as the film goes on and the scares become more frequent, the film starts feeling cheesy and overwritten even if the performances are truly stunning.<br/><br/>Director Jordan Peele makes the most out of his cast. Daniel Kaluuya gives a truly magnificent performance as Chris while Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are utterly horrifying as the Armitages. However, Allison Williams is a weak link and is very dry in her delivery which makes her performance comes off as wooden. She is the weak link and it isn't hard to figure it out especially in her scenes with Kaluuya. The story progresses and Williams' performance is slowly twiddled down which then leaves the glaring issue of the script. While the characters in this film are really layered and relate-able, the story they are in is so overwritten and self indulgent that it is hard to consider this the horror gem many critics and audiences are calling it.<br/><br/>The idea of a great horror film is to thrill and scare while making a social commentary. We look back on such films as Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th (maybe), Halloween...these films have weight to them and you don't know it until it's over. With Get Out, we know this is a film with political undertones, we know it wants us to think this is something more than a horror film. In some regards it is, but in most it is just a horror film that thinks it is more important than it actually is. This takes from what Peele is trying to achieve with directing a horror film. Everything comes off being very tongue-in- cheek instead of being straight horrifying and that is probably the most disappointing factor with Get Out. Instead of sinking these political undertones in the writing, Peele makes them abundantly clear and it ends up taking away from a film that is, otherwise, pretty good.<br/><br/>Get Out is a step above your average horror film and features some pretty amazing performances. Despite this, the film suffers from a very weak script that will feel as if you're being hit over the head with political banter rather than having the sh*t scared out of you. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in Get Out but the film does feature some awesome performances and some genuine scares that will be enough to make you wish the film was better."

Chris is worried since Rose 's parents do not know that he is black but he is welcomed by her father, the neurosurgeon Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford); her mother, the psychiatrist Missy (Catherine Keener) that uses hypnotism in her treatments; and her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones). He has also a weird and cold reception from the black servants Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel). During the night, Chris feels uncomfortable and leaves the bed to breath outside the house. When he returns, Missy is in her office and invites him to talk to her about his mother.

On the next morning, Chris wakes up in his bed and he believes he had a nightmare. Then he learns that there will be a family party with white guests only. Chris calls his best friend, the airport security guard Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), and he reports the weird events that happened to him. When the guests arrive, Chris feels awkward and convinces Rose to leave the house at night. While packing his clothes to travel back home, Chris finds photographs and the dark secret of the Armitage family.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is an above average horror film by Jordan Peele with a flawed story about veiled racism and without any message and excessive hype. The first half is great and Walter, Georgina and Andre Hayworth look like characters from the 1975 ""The Stepford Wives"". The second half becomes a joke and the happy ending does not fit well to the story with so many holes and evidences against Chris. Allison Williams is amazing, changing her behavior from a lovely girlfriend to a cruel woman. Catherine Keener is also excellent in the role of a cold hypnotherapist. Daniel Kaluuya performs a non-charismatic character and the impact would be greater with an actor with more personal charm to perform Chris. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Corra!""

","I have never seen a better movie that depicts the insidious, rather than overt, nature of racism. This movie is for all the white folks who think ""they aren't racist."" There are so many layers to this movie: majority culture coercing the minds of the minority, the annoyance of having to explain your identity to every white person around you, the societal eye-rolls when a black person goes missing, the ""violent nature"" of a black man (gaslighting at its finest).. Sometimes, the everyday occurrences that a person experiences is more painful than one traumatic event. This movie perfectly depicts just that. <br/><br/>And to all those that complain that this movie ""played the race card:"" this is like complaining that the Pirates of the Caribbean movie played the ""pirate card."" Why isn't racism a legitimate theme in cinema? Oscars, I'm looking at you. I understand why some white folks don't like having a mirror held in front of them, but that doesn't make those suffering from ""well-intentioned"" white people disappear. Looking away is culpability and watching this movie is one small step in the opposite direction. And isn't that the whole point of art? To open your eyes, to make you feel? Doesn't the best kind of art make you feel uncomfortable, and in that discomfort, change your perspective? This is a horror movie told through the eyes of a black man, but unlike slasher films, this horror comes from a very real place. This is what I learned from watching this movie as a white woman, so excuse my ignorance, as I am not black. I can never begin to understand how that feels. Ignorance is bliss, which is a dangerous luxury that is not afforded to all."

"CineMuseFilms","7","8","15","27 April 2017"," An entertaining but predictable horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire.
","You know we are in a post-Oscars movie slump when a satire horror like Get Out (2017) can generate global praise for bravely cutting new ground in film. The truth is: it does not. What it does is satirise the political correctness of a white majority that expresses racial tolerance but harbours malice for those who are different. Set aside that message and you are left with a well-paced, well- acted but predictable horror film that preys on white guilt and coloured fear.<br/><br/>The storyline is clear-cut and entirely consistent with the standard tropes of zombie-like horrors. Cool black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his gorgeous wide-smiling girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been dating seriously for a few months when Rose arranges a weekend to meet the parents. She insists that it is not worth mentioning that Chris is a black dude as her neurosurgeon father Dean and psychiatric hypnotherapist mother Missy are so liberally non-racist that ""they would have voted for a third Obama term"". Driving onto the sprawling grounds of her parent's home Chris notices a black gardener with a weird smile who stares vacantly. The camera cuts to Chris's face and we know immediately what he is thinking. After an effusively over-friendly greeting by the parents at the front doorstep, Chris sees a black housemaid with the same weirdly vacant stare. After an awkwardly polite dinner where Chris is subjected to the usual new-boyfriend interrogation, Missy tricks him into being placed in a hypnotic state that renders him controllable by the tinkling of a spoon in a teacup. From here on, the story shows Chris increasingly entrapped by the family until he realises his life is in danger and that he must 'get out'.<br/><br/>From the minute that Chris sees the look on the gardener's face most of the script is laid bare. If that does not sufficiently telegraph the narrative arc that lies ahead, the dinner with the parents make the trap and its dangers obvious. The story pivots on the plausibility of a tinkling teacup making Chris comatose and the duplicity of his girlfriend as the collector of fine black human specimens for neuro-transplant purposes. But of course, in the horror genre there are no boundaries for plausibility and no limits to the gory ways of ending someone's life. While the plot's weirdness requires suspension of disbelief, the casting and acting is excellent and delivers entertainment value for horror audience's money. Although words like original do not suit this film, it is tightly directed and holds enough twisted surprises to keep viewers engaged as it cruises to its entertainingly blood-filled climax.<br/><br/>Some of the over-hyped publicity surrounding this film dwells more on its racial message than its merits as a horror film. Indeed, some are even calling it a landmark in socially progressive film. For this to pass any plausibility test, we must be prepared to imagine that the most vocal middle-class supporters of racial equality in contemporary society are most likely the ones that, subliminally at least, harbour the most evil intentions towards coloured minorities. This would be a regressive exploitation of a complex social issue that, in this writer's view, is not what this film is about. It's just an entertaining horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire that is filling cinemas while we wait for the next round of Oscar nominated movies."

","Jordan Peele has been famous as part of the comedy team Key & Peele. It might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie, but he did. And his ""Get Out"" is a horror movie that serves as a biting satire. Basically, it's a look at how white people will often get into black culture but still won't accept blacks as their equals. Think about it: how many white people enjoyed Chuck Berry's songs but would've refused to let him come into their businesses? I don't know that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but I won't deny that it's one of the cleverest things that I've seen all year. A mixture of horror, drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the 21st century (once thought dead due to Obama's election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police).<br/><br/>Good movie."

","Review: This is one messed up film! Now that I have finally watched it, I can understand why some people found it quite disturbing but the ending brought some justice to the whole messed up situation. Daniel Kaluuya plays a black photographer, Chris Washington, who is in a happy relationship with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). They decide to go to Roses parents house, and he soon realises that they have a weird outlook towards black people. With a black woman and man as there servants, and various statements about his colour, he bites his tongue and he attends there annual party, which also leads to more racial comments. When Chris finally decides to leave, he is faced with an unbelievable situation which leads him to fight for his life. I was definitely shocked with the outcome of this movie, and I wasn't expecting the various twists and turns throughout. It's not everyday that you see a film were the black underdog, triumphs with all the odds stacked up against him, so I have to give the director the thumbs up. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, and it does take some time to get going but once it does, you can't fault it for originality. Personality, I would have got out of the house after the first day, especially after seeing how weird the servants were but I can understand that he was in love with his girlfriend, which is why he was willing to put up with ignorant behaviour from the messed up family and friends. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This is the first movie directed by Jordan Peele, 38, who is known for his comedic series Key & Peele, alongside Keegan-Michael Key. The shock success of this movie, brought him to the main stream, and with Keanu also doing well at the box office, the only way is up for the dynamic duo. Although Daniel Kaluuya isn't a household name, he has starred in Cass, Welcome to the Punch, Kick Ass 2, Sicario and the series Skins, so he has had some experience in front of the camera. He definitely brought some intensity to the project, and it was good to see him use his brain towards the end.<br/><br/>Budget: $4.5million Worldwide Gross: $252.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mysteries, starring Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson and Lakeith Stanfield. 7/10"

At first Chris is welcomed by mom (Catherine Keener) and dad (Bradley Whitford) but soon he begins to realize that something isn't quite right.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele wrote and directed this film, which pretty much came out of nowhere and became a huge hit with critics and it was an even bigger hit with crowds. I don't think anyone would have guessed that this film would have made the amount of money that it eventually did but it's refreshing to see. GET OUT is certainly a rather strange picture and it's one I'd call ""liberal horror"" and I'd also lump DON'T BREATHE into that genre. I think both films are incredibly interesting and the best part about both of them is the fact that afterwards you can have a discussion about their politics, which is something not too common for a horror picture.<br/><br/>For the most part this was a very impressive horror film but I'm not even sure I'd call it a horror movie. I'd probably lean towards calling it a mystery with a pinch of thriller thrown in. The film really plays out like a great episode of The Twilight Zone as we got a terrific setting, a racial undertone and some great performances that keep you guessing at what's going on. We really don't figure out what's happening until there's about twenty-five minutes left to go in the film and I must say that Peele did a wonderful job in the director's chair by having the film hold your attention. Obviously there's a strong screenplay that manages to hold your attention even when there's not much action going on.<br/><br/>The film also benefits from some terrific performances. Kaluuya is certainly wonderful in the lead role as he has a lot of different emotions to play. Not only is he the fish out of water but his character is also given some personal drama that plays out throughout the film. Williams is also extremely good because she's playing someone that you don't know where the character stands. She has to walk straight down the line to keep the mystery going and she does so perfectly. Both Keener and Whitford are extremely good as well as is Marcus Henderson.<br/><br/>As I said, the racial and political elements are right in your face and it's refreshing seeing a horror movie that doesn't shy away from this. The alternate ending is actually a lot better than what's on the theatrical cut but it's easy to see why it was changed. Heck, I'm shocked that the screenplay was even able to get funding. I think the first hour is much better than the final thirty-five minutes and especially when the mystery is finally revealed. I'm not going to spoil anything but GET OUT certainly makes you discuss what it's about afterwards."

It wasn't much of a spoiler for me, because I usually don't remember the things I've read or seen when watching a movie. Anyway, I decided to trust this person, because they sounded quite honest. And it was worth it. For anyone out there who cannot stand horror movies, I am with you, and this film is OK to watch. There are a few scenes that initiate jolts - and this is mainly accompanied with loud sound effects. But for the most part, these scenes are quite troll like, in the sense that Peele wanted visceral reactions (as heard in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel), and inserted these loud, abrupt sound effects in order to achieve that.<br/><br/>What I can't stand about horror movies, is mainly the horrific make- up/ costumes, and of course, the eerie soundtrack which no horror movie is complete without. But for this movie, it focuses more on the story, rather than the actual scaring part, and so I would say they wrongly categorized it, as it is more thriller than horror.<br/><br/>Moving on, Kaluuya puts on an amazing performance. I previous saw him in an episode of Black Mirror, and have to say that he is really talented. His expressions in Get Out, and especially the iconic 'sink' scene (which can be seen in the trailer), is phenomenal. Williams too, does a great job, and their chemistry on screen is well established. I would have to say that Gabriel was another actress of which the film would be incomplete without. Her emotionless stares are super bizarre, but is what makes her character. Howery, plays the comic relief for this film, and his personality really shines through. His character helps the movie stay above the line into total darkness.<br/><br/>However, the ending pushed it over the edge into ridiculousness. It was bordering between being realistic but freaky, and sci-fi comedy throughout the film, but the ending just pushed it all the way into the sci-fi comedy realm. I'm not saying that the genre is bad, but it was so good at giving that thrilling atmosphere, until it just gave it away. <br/><br/>So, in general, I'd say that this is a great thriller, with amazing acting, directing, and cinematography, but a poor ending."

","The plot was good but, honestly, all white people are evil and deep down inside they want to be Black. That's really what the plot is, or at least that's the point of the movie, to show you how evil all white people are...and how they always go out of their way to harm Black people.<br/><br/>Now...that's the politics behind the film. When you take away the racist crap...it's actually not that bad. The problem here is that politics get in the way and, honestly, I am sick and tired of being told to admit how evil and racist all white people are...or else get the racist label.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, it works both ways.<br/><br/>Beyond the race crap, the movie is actually excellent, the plot is a slow burner and one that, if you walk into it fresh, keeps you on your toes. There isn't a lot of action, there's not a lot of gore, and it pays off in pure plot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the plot makes a clear racist statement about how evil white people are. If you want to have a reason to hate white people, this is for you. If you want to have a movie that blames all white people for everything wrong with the world, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>And if you want a movie with a solid plot and great acting...this movie is also for you.<br/><br/>The down side is, once it becomes racist to make racist movies, this film is going to be received like the original Birth of a Nation a solid film flawed for it's racism."

","I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very suspenseful throughout, even the beginning which left you wanting to understand what was going on. So why do I title this, ""Is this really necessary""? I just don't get it why movies feel compelled to use foul language throughout the whole movie, which I found distracting. Don't get me wrong, I was not offended with it, just find that someone who uses that language on just about every line of the script is not very imaginative with their character. I find it refreshing when script writers, actors and directors refrain from it for the most part to tell a story. This movie would have been better if they cut out 50%.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie a 10+ if it wasn't for the unnecessary language.

","This is, hands down the first masterpiece of 2017. It is definitely not a masterpiece of horror because it isn't a horror movie. It is a thriller with bits of brilliant comedy infused in. This film has a very important message on race and it really speaks on race as it is still a very serious problem in America. But beyond the very relevant themes, how is it as a movie? It is flawless. If you are looking for a great thriller this is the film for you. The performances are all around incredible but the most impressive aspect hands down is Jordan Peele's writing and direction. His vision is very well realized and it's obvious that the studio really didn't give him much interference which is a very good thing because his vision was the best. Seeing how serious he took this project really makes me excited to see what he can do in the future. I won't spoil anything, but the ending, and the twist, is pure perfection. I loved every moment of this film and although it might not be as scary as I had hoped, that's not really the point in my opinion.

"Horst_In_Translation","8","9","18","6 June 2017"," The Walking Black
","""Get Out"" is a 2017 horror mystery thriller written and directed by Jordan Peele, Emmy winner and one half of the successful comedy duo Key and Peele. Obviously he worked on several other projects as a writer, but when it comes to directing, it is his very first effort and for that it is quite a surprisingly strong achievement, also because there are no co-directors or anything in here. And the cast of this 105-minute film is also not exactly packed with superstars, even if Catherine Keener is of course a 2-time Oscar nominee and fans of Girls will recognize Allison ""Marnie"" Williams and fans of Transparent or ""The West Wing"" will recognize Bradley Whitford. But for me that's it I guess, even if I probably should have known that female housekeeper actress for how amazing she was. Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya I cannot say I know at all, even if I have seen ""Kick-Ass 2"" and ""Sicario"", so yeah this film proves that you don't need a spectacular cast of big names to come up with a quality piece because this is exactly what this film is and while all the actors are doing basically a good job, I think it is really much more about the writing than the individual performances.<br/><br/>It all starts relatively simple when a young couple drives to the countryside where the (Black) guy is about to meet her parents for the first time after being a couple for 4-5 months. But things take a turn for the dark side fairly quickly, when gruesome dreams, strange behavior by family and employees of the house and a really bizarre social event happen the very same weekend. What is going on? You really should watch for yourself. Lets go on with some spoilers now, so maybe stop reading here if you haven't seen the picture yet. I read that people compared this film to Blair Witch Project, one of my all-time favorites, but I personally saw it more of a modern version of Rosemary's Baby (without babies obviously), also with Williams' character and the doubts if she was in on it all or not. But when there is that scene with the housekeeper and the mobile phone and right after the protagonist tells his girlfriend the housekeeper comes in and apologizes, it becomes pretty obvious what Williams' character is all about. Completely aside from the horror side, this film is also a pretty hilarious take on black-and-white stereotypes. Random mentions of Tiger Woods, a lion cuddly toy on the night desk and there is a lot more to that. Very well-done and all these films that fail when it comes to this admittedly complicated subject can learn a lot from Peele here.<br/><br/>At the end, the film's medical component almost has a touch of Human Centipede and it was pretty hilarious how he kept killing them one by one. Oh yeah speaking about the stereotypes I mentioned earlier, I must admit that the very first scene confused me. I thought it was the main character (or his best friend) and a bit of a preview, but apparently it was another character entirely. So much for one Black guy looking like the next to us Whites. I just mentioned the best friend and he is the one who brings most of the comedic value here, even if that gardener running wildly at night was also pretty hilarious for some reason. Of course, there was a moment here and there that I did not like too much, like the hypnosis scene early on or the blind guy introducing himself or the way that the best friend really does come out of nowhere to be the savior at the very end or the previously mentioned very first scene that was okay, but I did not really see the connection, even if the scene itself was pretty strong. I guess it was supposed to show us how they get these Blacks!? Anyway, this first scene also shows that there will be several jump scares, so it is up to you to decide if you like them. But even if I am not the biggest fan of these, I must say they all worked fairly nicely and they also made sense which is even more important. The girl sitting next to me at the theaters really was shaken every single jump scare. But there is nonetheless depth to this film, not just the race aspects that were pretty smart, but you also find many metaphors and symbolisms in here like the way they kill the deer early on and how he eventually kills Whitford's character with the deer head. So all in all, this film was a delight and I would almost call it a must-see. One of 2017's very best from what I have seen so far and a tense thrill ride for 100 minutes. What are you waiting for? Best to be watched at a theater or at least with lights out entirely."

","Racism is Real? Get Out.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a thrilling movie that simultaneously attacks today's controversies, Get Out is a must see movie. This newly- released horror film has been all the rage. I had heard many positive reviews before seeing this movie, so my expectations were relatively high. I was expecting a somewhat scary film; a thrilling story of a boyfriend whose girlfriend's family has a plan to destroy him. What I was not expecting was a thought-provoking film that cleverly confronts the ever-present issue of racism. Director Jordan Peele has discovered a way to throw a controversial topic into a horror and comedy and impressively wrap it all into one. I found myself laughing out loud as Lil Rel Howery, who plays a TSA agent that is best friends with the main character, comes to the rescue to save his best friend. ""Man, I told you not to go into that house,"" he says at the end. This film includes many classic horror scenes and gore. But this film causes viewers to take a look at racism in a terrifying but real way. This movie is an original; Jordan Peele does something never before done in the movie industry. Although I was slightly upset with the abrupt ending to this movie, I couldn't be more impressed with the overall film. If you believe in reverse racism and are a white lives matter advocate, get out of the showing of this movie."
"bethanyslater13","8","9","18","6 April 2017"," Fantastic (although could have been longer)
","Get Out is an excellent movie packed with twists and suspense. I felt that the movie was very sophisticated and dealt with racism in a tasteful manner - it was not offensive nor did I feel that it made either whites or blacks out to be monsters. <br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya played an excellent role, he portrayed much emotion and depth in his character, Chris. Alison Williams plays Rose and I loved her character, she played such a fantastic part and I really did believe she was completely innocent on the whole thing. I was so shocked and immediately hated her when I realised she was 'recruiting' suitable candidates. I was really hoping that she had been hypnotised to forget her past boyfriends and accidentally lured them into a trap! I could not believe that Bradley Whitford played the father, his transformation into this character was impressive. I enjoyed watching the mother too, she played the perfect role, especially with her husky voice, she reminded me of Kaa from Jungle Book. Every actor played their character perfectly, I especially loved Rod from TS mo f*cking A! The brother freaked me out but that just shows that they are playing their roles well.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I was led to believe that the 'slaves' were hypnotised and that the trance could definitely be undone, but it was sad to see that they had a part of themselves removed and replaced with something else - meaning this, most likely, can never be undone. I felt that the movie was a little rushed towards the end and it definitely could have done with an extra 30 minutes or so... The movie was so complex yet so understandable but then sort of ended far too quickly for me. I wanted Chris to almost escape but then to be dragged back and put back into a trance, I wanted to feel frustrated, I wanted a bit more suspense towards the end, but it all seemed a little too predictable. I especially wanted a policeman to get out of his car and to arrest Chris and make it look like the policeman was part of this crazed family, or at least make Chris look like the bad guy in all of this, just to show what really does happen in the real world. This did not ruin the movie for me, however, the ending was left too open - will the other 'slaves' be saved? What happens to Chris? Will Rod be promoted in TS mo f*cking A? Will there be a sequel? Either way, I am looking forward to more from Jordan Peele, who brought out something so respectable, which will be talked about for a long time. Well done, 8 stars from me."

","Jordan Peele, of Key and Peele fame, kicks off his directorial career with a genre-swapping film that depicts a young black man's ill-fated journey to his white girlfriend's parents' house. There he finds that all is not as it should be, and that his prospective in-laws may not be as normal as they appear to be.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of 'Get Out' is one of the very best you can create in a film. Spine-chillingly creepy at times, with foreshadowing and acting that works better than any jump scare, and at other times raucously enjoyable, witty, and entertaining, it succeeds across all fronts. Daniel Kaluuya makes for a relatable and likable protagonist that the audience can root for, whilst Lil Rel Howery as his erstwhile and foul-mouthed friend is huge fun, and one of the standout comedy characters in recent years. The parents, played note-perfectly by Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, represent a ramped-up version of the so-called 'West Wing liberals', the type of people who purport to be progressive and welcoming, but inadvertently make black people uncomfortable with racial stereotypes and microaggressions.<br/><br/>The film ends up being one of the best cinematic examples of presenting race in a long time. Perfectly capturing the zeitgeisty racial divide in modern America, its depiction of the daily struggles faced by minorities is remarkable, and one of the scariest aspects of the film is how plausible and true to life it all is (up to a point). The satire is delivered flawlessly, and Peele deserves all the plaudits he is receiving for the astounding first-time effort he has made here. Combining his fresh, razor-sharp and highly witty script with the subtle yet 100% effective direction, he has made a film that is not only one of the best satires of modern times, but also an incredibly enjoyable horror-comedy.<br/><br/>It is not quite accurate to label 'Get Out' a true horror film. It is certainly scary, mainly stemming from the experience Kaluuya's Chris has to go through, which transports the viewer into his shoes and leaves us on edge throughout the buildup. However, if you go in expecting a Halloween-ready horror film that will rival the horror classics, you will inevitably be disappointed. It is more of a horror-style thriller, with its dynamic plot taking the audience on a twisty and unpredictable journey that lets the viewer piece it together whilst going along.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Get Out' is probably the best film of the first few months of 2017. Being fresh, innovative, thrilling, scary, and sharply scripted, Jordan Peele's debut is promising and it's an important film for the issue of race. 91/100."

There is not a single moment that will make you scream about not going into the dark basement or towards the creepy sound. An upstanding horror protagonist who does everything how anyone in his circumstance would, and Get Out is all the more terrifying for it.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele proves himself as a horror director with this mind- blowing debut that mixes politics and the genre film in a way The Purge wishes it could.

","It was hard to believe all the hype going into the theatre to see this movie. I saw the trailer and it did appeal to me, however to see the raving reviews was a tad shocking. After seeing the movie I have to say it was fantastic. I'm a huge scary movie fan, HUGE. I like all sorts of scary movies from ghosts to slasher to monster movies, if done well I love them all. I would say this isn't really scary as much as it's full of tension (I know, some may say it's a part of a scary movie). The movie oozes with tension from pretty much the beginning all the way to the end, it's constant. It's the main reason of what I love about the movie as you always know something could happen, you just don't know when or why. When something does happen all that happens is the tension builds even more. It's so well written that every scene is interesting or engaging. It makes you guess as to what is going on and at times you may be right until something else happens and throws you off. The acting is also amazing. The Armitage family is played by all familiar actors and they nail it! They come off as inviting and friendly, however the more you get to know them the more awkward it starts to feel. Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main character (Chris) was perfectly cast. He does so well at being likable that when the action starts you want no harm to come to him. All I was hoping for throughout the movie is for him to survive. I think this movie could have been a lot worse if the actor did not do such a good job. You truly need to enjoy the character of Chris if you are going to enjoy the movie. The movie isn't perfect as Chris does make some questionable choices at times, however it is not enough to really fault the movie. Other than some very small scenes the movie is fantastic. Unpredictable at times and it engages you from start to finish. I don't even think you need to be a scary movie fan to enjoy as the scares are not really present. It's more of a thriller that keeps you guessing almost the entire movie."
"reid-hawk","8","9","18","20 March 2017"," A great first film from Jordan Peele
","Get Out is a new horror comedy from one of the minds behind the hit series ""Key and Peele"", although this movie is less of a comedy and more of a straight up suspense film. I thought this film was fantastic. It was always apparent from the direction of ""Key and Peele"" that Both Jordan and Keegan-Michael understood directing very well and could easily satirize bad directing, but I never knew how that would translate over onto a serious attempt at making a film. That is until this movie. From the moment Childish Gambino's ""redbone"" began playing I knew I was in for something special. This is the best first film from a director I have seen since last years ""The Witch"". It knows how to create suspense through things like mood and score rather than overused constant jump scares and other weak techniques. This film utilizes a foreboding string score to ratchet up the tension and it never really lets up. The acting is also amazing. Each actor does a perfect job of either portraying fear or lynchian esque creepiness. Just watch the ""conversation"" that takes place between the movies main character and the house maid. Listen to the score. Notice the low , up-close camera angle. ""Get Out"" knows what it is doing and how to put its audience on edge. In fact, both people I watched this film with were grabbing onto me and refusing to let go pretty much the entire time. It does have issues that hold it back. There is a scene of horrible CGI fire that made me and my girlfriend both say out loud something along the lines of ""wow that looks like dogsh@t"". There is another scene that makes no sense, and without spoiling I'll just say it has to do with an open door leading to a bunch of photographs that have no reason of ever being so blatantly left around. Finally, the ending happens too fast and while it is oh so satisfying, it blows its load too soon and quickly. Don't let any of that deter you from seeing this movie though, whether you are a horror fan or not. Whether you are black or white. Liberal or Conservative. This film is for anybody who can appreciate film or at least loves being scared. I give it an 8.5/10 and it currently stands as the best film of 2017"

","The opening scene of ""Get Out"" (2017 release; 103 min.) shows a black guy being abducted and thrown into the back of a car as he was talking at night in an unspecified suburb. We have no clue what is going on. After the opening title, we get to know Rose and Chris, an interracial couple . They are getting ready for a weekend visit to Rose's parents, who have no idea that Chris is African-American, but Rose insists all will be fine. On the drive up, when their car is hit by a deer, the cop asks Chris for identification, even though he wasn't driving. Rose takes offense at the seeming racial profiling. Finally Rose and Chris arrive at her parent's place, a suburban McMansion, and receive a warm welcome. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from actor-writer-producer-director Jordan Peele, making his directorial debut. Peele, best known for comedy, goes into a vastly different direction, presenting a clever and original 'horror' story for the thinking person. If you are expecting a 'slasher' horror movie, the likes of which are all too common these days in the horror genre, you will be disappointed (or relieved, depending on your viewpoint). Instead, the story focuses on an increasingly discomforting situation where a black man gets introduced to a white family (and circle of friends), who ""would've voted for Obama a third time, if I had the chance"". British actor Daniel Kaluuya, whom we most recently saw in the outstanding ""Sicario"", is even better in this lead role, playing the cool-as-cucumber Chris, until things aren't cool anymore (mustn't say more--biting my tongue here!). But the big star, even though he never appears on the screen, is of course Jordan Peele, who shows enormous promise in his directorial debut. Working on a (for Hollywood) microscopic budget of a mere $4.5 million, Peele gives us an accomplished 'horror' movie where less is more. Can't wait to see what Peele will do next, but whatever it is, I'm all in! <br/><br/>""Get Out"" opened wide some weeks ago to immediate critical and commercial acclaim. This movie may well become the biggest financial success (as in: return on investment) of the year (rapidly approaching $150 mill. at the box office in North America). The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was PACKED and sold out to the very last seat, quite unusual for a movie that's been playing already for weeks. But the positive buzz and correlating word-of-mouth surrounding this movie are absolutely merited. Even if you're not a fan of the horror film genre (like me), I encourage you to seek this out, be it in the theater, later on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Get Out' is, in every which way, a WINNER."
"spikespace","8","9","18","19 March 2017"," Unsubtle but deft balance of laughs and bloody thrills
","'Get Out' is a well-balanced blend of horror and comedy. While it is consistently eerie, intriguing and suspenseful, the comedy manages to compliment the tone, which is hard to achieve. For example, the comic relief character TSA Agent Rod is actually funny and a stand- out, which is uncommon, but it should be noted that every actor in this film is stellar, particularly Daniel Kaluuya. Director Jordan Peele ('Key & Peele' and 'Keanu') displays a strong influence from classic horror/slasher films, but shows enough originality (black brainwashing, the ""sunken place"") to stand out from other horror directors. He achieves this by subverting the horror genre, having a black male as the lead in peril, instead of a virginal babysitter. <br/><br/>The theme of racism is strong and ballsy; Peele's tactic of having white middle-class liberals (you) as the villain, the movie reflects back on the audience to chilling results (like 'Black Mirror', only much better). The film remains accessible throughout despite the heavy, ""in your face"" race theme – I felt the metaphor lacked subtlety, which was a small issue. The ending was good if a little too small in scale ('Hot Fuzz' was better at this) and the twist was surprising and had a strong build-up (""get the keys!""). The film was let down by not having a big scare-factor – this was more creepy than scary and long-time horror fans might be disappointed with the slightly unnecessary jump scare cues. I would describe 'Get Out' as creative and engaging, and awesome to watch with a cinema audience (I can't remember an ordinary packed screening room clapping before)."

","This review of Get Out is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>AS IT HAPPENS, there is indeed no perfect time for Jordan Peele's directorial debut to come out. In a year when we've already had Hidden Figures, Loving, Fences and the Best Picture winning Moonlight taking their challenging turns in showing how racist America used to be. Peele who's also lived with racism decided to input all them racist thoughts into the incredible Get Out. The social commentary is cleverly crafted, too, not only adapting racism to the 21st century but also giving hilarious moments especially from the scene stealingly funny LilRel Howery who thinks that Chris is being hypnotized into a sex slave, cleverly changing the narrative but also giving laugh out loud moments. The film's design is purely intended to lift the façade of post-racial America and showcase the ugliness still lying beneath; the astounding thing about it is he not only sharply manages to craft the film with racism but crafting it so that he even made a hugely entertaining thriller with horror elements. <br/><br/>Still it's not an easy watch for the modern audience, given that a young African-American man as a target for this goes without saying horrific, but incredibly well. The young African-American man here is Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) who's in a relationship with a young Caucasian woman Rose (Allison Williams), he's particularly nervous having never met her parents. He gets the idea that they're going to hate him, while on the other hand trying to make him a slave. When they arrive her parents immediately take a liking to him, they become instant friends. This is when the film changes pace, Chris notices that aren't quite right with this average American family estate he takes a certain notice to the African-American janitor and housemaid helping on the house - perhaps hinting that this family are stuck in the past. <br/><br/>Peele makes us wait for even an immediate thrill to take place, to perhaps give us a jolt, but it's as while before this happens yet when it does the Goosebumps are relentless it's only a second but it's effective. Given that the tension slowly rises and it keeps our fixed gaze on the screen. Keeps the audience on edge as if tied to the seat, wondering what's going to happen next. <br/><br/>What follows are relentless thrills and jump scares as Chris is scared lifeless, he's hypnotized to quit smoking which takes to bigger effect later, and he's left to a moment when he has to escape after being brutally warned to ""Get out"" by a fellow African-American in post-trance state. Peele amps the tension up to 11 here giving no boundaries as to how far he'll take this. The secret reveal takes a turn for the worse when Chris finds that his girlfriend isn't who she says she is – adding to the rising shock factor.<br/><br/>Slowly turning into an escape movie when Chris is hypnotized he has to escape from a cell-like room. It has moments of Stepford Wives and there is a deer antler impalement reference from Silent Night, Deadly Night. This confident debut is never boring, it's hilarious, it's thrilling and it's original. Peele has come a long way since the altruistic comedy standings of Key and Peele and last year's muddled, Keanu. But here his dark side shows it's strength, Get Out is the cleverest horror we've had in ages and it's just what we need. <br/><br/>VERDICT: A thrillingly confident debut by Peele a masterfully constructed plot carefully matching horror with hilarious social commentary with natural seat-edge suspense."
"mark-durfor","8","9","18","15 March 2017"," Get Out thrills and delights
","Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) have been dating for five months and it's time for Chris to meet the parents. He's a bit tentative about the weekend because he's black, she's white, and Rose hasn't told her parents. Chris' best friend Rod (LilRey Howery) advises him not to go to their secluded mansion in the woods, but Rose is able to convince him that it's going to be fine. Chris meets her parents Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener). Dean is a neurosurgeon and Missy is a psychologist skilled in the science of hypnotherapy. At first, they seem like an awkwardly cute, sweet couple trying too hard to be accommodating to their daughter's first black boyfriend, but things turn more than just awkward quickly.<br/><br/>Chris meets Georgina (Betty Gabriel) the maid and Walter (Marcus Henderson) the groundskeeper. They are both black. Dean reassures Chris that despite how it looks (white family with black help), Georgina and Walter were brought on to help with his sick parents and they were invited to stay on after their passing, but there is something off about them. They are blank, vacant, almost like the Stepford wives. Their first night there, Chris steps outside for a cigarette and witnesses both Georgina and Walter behaving quite strangely in the middle of the night. He goes back inside to see Missy waiting for him. Rose and her parents are not thrilled with Chris' smoking and Missy has offered her services to hypnotize him to cure him of his addiction. Despite his opposition to the procedure, Missy is very good at what she does. Chris ends up in ""the sunken place"" and awakes the next morning in bed, apparently rid of any desires to smoke.<br/><br/>Over the weekend, that has turned into a large get together, Chris meets another black man who is a guest at the party. He introduces himself to Logan (Lakeith Stanfield). At first, Chris is relieved to see another black man at the party, someone who isn't employed at the estate, but his relief quickly fades as he finds out that Logan is just like Georgina and Walter: present, but not all there. Chris snaps a picture of Logan and the flash triggers something in him. He charges at Chris warning him to get out. Rod, who also works for the TSA, also warns him to get out when he finds out that black people have gone missing in that area.<br/><br/>Chris and Rose go on a walk and eventually Rose agrees that it's an awful weekend. She is embarrassed by her family and friends and the experience Chris is having and agrees they should leave. While packing, Chris finds a hidden box of photos revealing he is not Rose's first black boyfriend. In fact, he recognizes her with Georgina and Walter in the pictures. That's when Chris realizes he was invited for the weekend, but he was never meant to leave.<br/><br/>Get Out was written and directed by Jordan Peele of the comedy team Key and Peele. The preview looked completely creepy, a scary thriller with a bit of humor thrown in. I was concerned that it looked like it also might have quite a few of the clichéd ""gotcha"" moments. Those are scenes where something is inherently unnerving or unsettling, mildly startling, but you are forced to react more severely because of a sharp music tone, a jarring sound effect, or a sudden camera movement. Personally, I don't care much for the forced jumps in scary movies. I'd rather just let the action or lack of action itself be what is scary on its own. Fortunately, there were only two of those ""gotcha"" moments and they did exactly what they were meant to do by shocking the audience. We all immediately laughed at ourselves for falling victim to the ploy.<br/><br/>Peele has written for MadTV and Key and Peele and also co-wrote the movie Keanu, a movie about a lost cat that didn't really live up to the hype. Get Out is Peele's second feature film he's written and his directorial debut. It's definitely quite a different genre than Keanu, but I went in to this one with low expectations and only gave it a 2.5 Star Prediction. To my delight, it was much better than I thought. It mixed elements of the creepiness of Deliverance, the Stepford Wives, and the Shining; the music of Jeepers Creepers, Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and Halloween 2; the humor of Django Unchained, Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland; and the triumph of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Alien, and 1408. I thought it was worth the money in the theatres and would recommend watching it with a crowd of at least 30 other people in the theatre who are there to be entertained and you can all experience this film together and out loud. You will laugh, squeal, cringe, gasp and cheer for Get Out. I'm bumping up my rating to 3.5 Stars as not only did I enjoy it in the theatres, I'm heavily inclined to watch it again and might even add this one to my home collection. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"
"SaritaLW","8","9","18","15 March 2017"," Funny? No. Creepy? Yes
","I think people hyped this movie up to be more than what it was. Don't get me wrong, it was a GREAT movie and I caught on to a lot of hidden messages; a couple on which I won't speak on. But, I think I went into watching the movie with higher expectations. I didn't think the movie was really funny like some people were ranting about. It was definitely more creepy. The creepy looks, the creepy eyes, and the creepy smiles. It was like, right away, you knew something wasn't right. The one thing that did surprise me about this movie was that the girlfriend was in it the whole time. I mean REALLY in it. All those photos of all the different black men she lured into heart and home only to make them internal slaves to the next bidder. I mean what?! How did I not see that coming? The more creepier thing was the whole transformation of her grandparents into those pour black souls minds. This brings me to the underlining messages that I hope doesn't offend anyone. But we do see from time to time how black people are always looked down upon for this or that when secretly we see white people loving the culture, the hair, the music, and the clothes. So the fact that Peele made it evident that this family took over a black persons life because of whatever reason doesn't surprise me. I love that he touched on these invisible factors because people act so blind to such when black people have been seeing it for centuries. I hope that people not only took this movie as a valid message but that black film is on the rise and have just as much talent as any other director, producer, writer, etc. Congratulations to Jordan Peele for grossing 100 million from this movie off a 4 million budget!"
"rs403404","8","9","18","7 March 2017"," 'Get Out' Gets It
","Is it possible for a movie to be both stupid and smart? both blunt and subtle? Generally speaking, ""no"". But in the case of a film like ""Get Out"", the answer is very much ""yes"". ""Get Out"" is a movie of contradictions. As opposed to being a weakness, the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them.<br/><br/>This is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele. Better known as the second half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series. Last year it was the comedy ""Keanu"" and now we have Peele by himself behind the camera. For a directorial debut, he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling. Also, he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: it's not necessarily what you see that scares you, but what lurks just out of sight.<br/><br/>Further, if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough, but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy. Without giving anything away, there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie. Nevertheless, due to the way that the movie is woven together, they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension.<br/><br/>If all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst clichés of the genre (e.g. annoying characters doing truly stupid things) then you should enjoy yourself just fine. However, there is so much more to uncover within this movie.<br/><br/>You might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie. Yet, no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist. The movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism. Instead, it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and, by doing so, many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice.<br/><br/>On closer inspection, this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing. Just as with prejudice, if you take this film at face value, then you've missed the subtle undertones that give life depth. Peele retells a moral told many times before, yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting.<br/><br/>Peele's directing career is off to a very strong start. I'm exciting to see what he makes next."
"mcneiltavon","10","10","21","14 June 2017"," Get out
","This movie Get Out was a great film in my opinion. One thing I like about this film is the subliminal messages they try to give off through out the movie. In the beginning of the movie, when Chris and Rose were on there way to meet with Rose's family a deer jumped out into the road and got hit by the car,the deer represented Chris's mother. Chris's mother was killed in that same fashion as the deer was. If you pay attention to Chris he was traumatized by the deer and it reminded him of his mother. Another message Get out was trying to send out was the cultural appropriation. Rose's family and friends were using black people to reach a new discovery in their studies. They were hypnotizing these people to use their bodies to reach another goal. This mission represents the cultural appropriation that has happened in history and modern day. Overall the movie was a really good movie. The humor of the movie was one of my favorite things about it."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>So after seeing glowing reviews from critics and amazing score here at IMDb of ""Get Out"" (2017) as a horror movie mega fan i was kinda dying to see this movie. After finally seeing it can safely say - this is simply of the very best (actually the best at the moment) movie in 2017 in my opinion. And i saw tons of film this year.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" isn't true terror horror movie, its not even the best horror movie out the at the moment to be honest. What makes this film special is its kinda mind blowing story, jaw-draping writing and perfect directing. Yes, the acting by everyone involved was more then uniformly good, especially by Allison Williams - this is a star making performance. How perfectly, smoothly and involving everything here is done is just beyond me - this newcomer writer / director Jordan Peele should be on a map of every movie goer from now on - it is hardly gets better then ""Get Out"".<br/><br/>Overall, i wan't spoil anything nor i will go into plot details, but do yourself a favor and watch this amazing film no matter what genre you prefer. This is a blast from start till finish, easily one of the very, very best this year so far."

The whole story is just stupid and the characters are...ugh.... I am a little ashamed I bought and enjoyed the crap out of this back in 2017.. It's a bore fest focusing on race and racism.

","SERIOUSLY?<br/><br/>Well you seen the trailer (even that is boring) and read the plot so no spoilers here.
Premise is like typical MadTV skit. White woman wants to ko visit her parents with her black boyfriend. Wohoo. How is this going to turn out because all the whiteys are racists?
Epic twist they seem to be all cool. Then another twist with some cult action, brainwashing hypnosis stuff and shitty jump scares.
I watched this movie a week ago and can't honesty remember anything worth remembering. I like Peele and guess he tried to do some sort of social commentary with this flick but falls way flat trying that.
In all all the ""twists"" are 100% predictable and the storyline is as ""brilliant"" as ""the Wicker man"".
Acting is all the way acceptably average. Nothing spectacular there either. 
This is not ""wicker man"" bad. Just mediocre horror/thriller/comedy(?) you forget the second you walk out of theatre.
My harsh 1 out of 10 rating is bit harsh just to knock down ridiculous 7.7 imdb score.
And most importantly this movie got nominated for ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"" and ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"". effin REALLY?!
Oscars have totally lost all my respect. I actually laughed out when I saw this on their nominee list. Had to check calendar it's not april fools day.
Obviously this forgettable flick with it's mediocre acting is there just got nominated because other movies don't have enough black people in them to avoid SJWs outrage.

","When I had finished watching this, I felt the film-viewing equal of 'Wow, that was a really satisfying meal!' And I had really not been expecting it to be as good as it was. I don't mean that I thought it would be trash or b-grade. I just wasn't expecting something so powerful really, as a horror, as a dark comedy, as satire and as social commentary.<br/><br/>I loved this film's use of metaphors. Others here have drawn attention to the themes of covert racism that is a disease of power, control and dominance of whites over blacks whilst projecting a smiling, friendly face. Yes. Absolutely. And also about cultural appropriation; admiration and envy for those attributes of a people where there is no respect for the people as fully human beings, even often as not fully sentient beings, less than animals.'Stuff' to be exploited for one's own benefit. I am very sure this is what the 'dark place' alludes to, being pushed into a place of nowhere as your world is gradually stolen from you. <br/><br/>The humour in this that is not really satire, is found in relief scenes centred around Chris's (the victim) best friend who senses something is NQR from the beginning but cannot persuade his friend of this.<br/><br/>I look forward to more from this writer/director."

","Get Out is a thriller-lovers amusement park. It has a plot, a strong story-line, a good acting, and most of all structure. Movies these days lack in structure and are just like pop-music. Copied crap with repetitive sh*t. But not Get Out.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie is not racist as some reviews may suggest. It is good, high-quality thriller that uses known subject, but gives it an extra twist. <br/><br/>Throughout entire movie, you'll probably be interested and think about ""what is next"". Leaves you expecting, which means you'll keep focuse. Don't look for deeper political meaning, because the director did not aim at that subject IMHO. It is just a well made movie, using race issues in past to make good story-line. Simple as that. <br/><br/>The beginning is simple, the middle is quite a ride and ending gives some satisfaction but leaves you kinda wondering. <br/><br/>P.S: The side-role dude is JUST AWESOME.

You'd think while watching whoever made this is a film veteran who can really create atmosphere and mood perfectly, but Jordan Peele is a first time director and you can really tell he put a ton of effort and inspiration from other horror flicks into this one. The climax is satisfying and crazy and it leaves you surprised and afraid when all the puzzle pieces get put together and Chris needs to... well... get out.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya makes for a well-done protagonist, and every antagonist is creepy, twisted and well portrayed in this under-looked gem of excitement.<br/><br/>It is inspiring to young aspiring filmmakers to just do it and be creative.<br/><br/>It's a 10."
"meeza","10","8","16","7 July 2017"," Get Out!!! That good, ha! Yes, sireeee!
","Writer-Director Jordan Peele has just made a mark as another Great Jordan! Peele's masterful orchestration (directorial and scribe like) of his movie ""Get Out"" will probably be getting in my future ""Top 10 Movies of 2017"" list. This horror/comedy/drama/unique movie stars Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams as Chris Washington and Rose Armitage. Chris and Rose are a biracial couple (Chris being black, Rose being white) who go on a trip to suburbia so Chris can meet Rose's parents; but ""Meet the Parents"" this is not. There Chris sees himself in a plethora of surreal & strange situations, which I won't divulge because I don't want you to ""get out"" of reading my review if I reveal spoilers. Peele not only presents the narrative as unpredictable, perplexing, and magnetic, but he also incorporates various social themes on class distinctions within the picture. A big Kaluuya shot, I mean Kaluuya shout-out goes to Daniel for his excellent performance as Chris. Williams also delivered as Rose. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener nailed their performances as Rose's parents, Dean and Missy. I was especially hypnotized with Keener's work. Other phenom supporting work was gotten out of Caleb Landry Jones as Rose's brother Jeremy; and Betty Gabriel as Georgina, the Armitage's housekeeper. Not its time for you to stop reading this, and get out and experience ""Get Out. ***** Excellent"

The film also features traditional elements of horror, which causes one to sprinkle. But some of the best of the film is the combination unconventional action, in combination with good horror effects.<br/><br/>The actors were unknown to me at the forefront, but the convicts to the fullest.

"thegreathealer","8","8","16","30 March 2017"," Alt-right thriller for the Trump administration
","If you re-imagined 'Meet the Parents' and 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' for the horror genre, then 'Get Out is as close to what you'd end up with. But this is far more than just a culture clash comedy or satire on the racial tensions that are as relevant to Sidney Poitier's times as they are today. Instead, writer/director Jordan Peele has crafted a deeply disturbing, gripping and often hallucinatory thriller for our times, manifesting the often 'right-on' desires of white liberals to get in touch with black culture (be it through music, films or indeed presidents) into a story that drip-feeds its building menace for an hour before unleashing its horror credentials in a bloody climax that - in its over-familiarity - nearly derails a film that had hitherto avoided many of the pitfalls of the modern jolt-shocker.<br/><br/>Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is making his first home visit to girlfriend of four months Rose's (Allison Williams) family in their luxurious country estate, already perturbed by the fact that she has omitted to inform her parents that her latest beau is, indeed, black. On the way their car hits a deer, and the attending police officer is more interested in seeing the credentials of Rose's black boyfriend than her own driver's licence. If this proves to be a marker for a film about a young black man in unknown pure-white territory, then things escalate quickly when the pair arrive at Rose's home. Father Dean (Bradley Whitford) comes over far too strongly as a wannabe black campaigner, extolling the virtues of Obama, Jesse Owens and Chris himself in turn, while mother Missy (Catherine Keener) runs a lucrative byline in hypnotism and CBT, offering to relieve Chris of his nicotine addiction in what proves to be a pivotal moment in the film. So far, so creepy.<br/><br/>Chris' first, sleepless, night also sees him almost railroaded by one of the Armitages' black servants, Walter; seemingly hell-bent on running him down before swerving away at the last moment, and explaining his actions away the next morning as his 'training exercise'. Fellow servant Georgina (Betty Gabriel) also ranks high on the weird-ometer, all fixed smile and unnatural bonhomie as she pours drinks and mysteriously observes her hairline in the mirror while Chris observes. The presence of seemingly docile and 'converted' members of the black community in servitude to an affluent white family may itself set off alarm bells if it weren't already commonplace today, but here they ring hollow with Dean's assertions to champion both black culture and the athletic prowess of its people. Son Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) even challenges Chris to a dinner-time one-on-one, an event which itself will pay off in the final act; and for all the awkwardness and cultural mismatch Chris himself was expecting, nothing prepares him for what follows as the family hosts its annual get-together of their well-off friends and neighbours.<br/><br/>Here Chris is interrogated, probed and even physically examined by a crowd of similarly earnest and 'right-on' black idolaters. One elderly lady even comes with a young black companion, dressed like a white person's idea of a 'civilised' black man, all muted flannels and by now accustomed fixed grin. But when Chris inadvertently flashes him with his camera-phone, the man erupts in a furious tirade, telling him to 'Get Out', before being restrained - and retrained - by Missy's miraculous mesmerism. Chris himself has by now also succumbed to her wiles, criticised for continuing to smoke and unwittingly subjected to her tea-cup trigger to send him into the kind of existential realm that recalls Renton's overdose experience in 'Trainspotting'.<br/><br/>The film then ratchets up the revelations towards its kinetic and furious climax. Chris discovers a boxful of Polaroids showing that he is far from being Rose's first black boyfriend; the off-limits basement is revealed to be the lair of Dean's devilish brain surgery - compounding on his wife's hypnotism with some viscerally applied lobotomy surgery - and the dark secret at the heart of the Armitage set-up is at last revealed: harvesting the mental and physical attributes of Afro-American men and women for the improvement of themselves and their equally privileged white friends. Here the film most resembles Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby', as the cloying and overly attentive 'friendship' offered by relative strangers yields to a secret cabal of demented demonics. As the ambiguous mantra of Missy reveals, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.<br/><br/>'Get Out' works just as well as a horror thriller without even reading any subtext into its satire of white liberalism and the white man's need to integrate and understand its black brethren. But in a political climate increasingly charged by race-hate, exploitation and the need to homogenise diversification into one, palatable whole, the film provides a telling and provocative examination of white/black relations at a time when (at least in America) 'black lives matter' has become a mantra for anti- discrimination and equality against a backdrop of police brutality and videos that recall the dark days of the Rodney King trial. White supremacy rewritten as cultural harvesting is nothing new in a post-colonial rhetoric, but 'Get Out' proves that irrespective of living in such 'enlightened' times, the undercurrent of race relations is still close to boiling point if you push the right buttons. Especially subliminal ones."

Every one of them envies a different point of them. One of them thinks they are fast, one thinks they are cooler in this modern age etc. The point is these people are not neo-Nazis or white supremacists. These people are liberals who would actually vote for Obama again. What this movie criticize is liberal people who, when trying to be ""liberal"" to black people, make things worse. I'm no way claiming that all liberals are like that(obviously) as I am white liberal person but yeah...<br/><br/>Rant Ends<br/><br/>The premise of the movie could be better as there was no need to bring science fiction stuff. They could've just rolled with the ""Let's make them slaves by hypnotism"" because I mean brain exchange didn't really add something to story other than unrealism. Saying that, there was a huge tension until the later parts of the movie. And there was a certain sickness if I had to say?

"Ads96","9","9","19","5 April 2017"," Superb Piece of Horror with Interesting and Insightful Social Commentary
","'Get Out' is a superb piece of horror with sharp, sometimes funny and always interesting social commentary that walks the line between classic horror conventions and a modern, revitalised genre form perfectly. It's an excellent debut from Jordan Peele who moulds his clever tale together with a great cast, interesting camera-work and a welcome dose of heavy tension and menace.<br/><br/>First of all, go see this film as blindly as you can. Teaser trailers are acceptable, anything else could ruin or spoil the moment. I made the effort to go in relatively blind through part laziness and part active ignorance, avoiding critic's reviews and switching off the radio if people started talking about it. The premise alone should be enough to interest most people and Peele's name attached to the writing and directing should be able to persuade most sceptics. That said, whether you like or dislike horror, make the time for this one.<br/><br/>The cast is all around excellent though special praise must go to Daniel Kaluuya who, despite the temptations of genre, keeps his acting naturalistic, completely believable and watchable. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford also deserve special mentions for their parts, as do Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel for their creepy turns. Peele doesn't let the cast carry the film however with some interesting, creative and above all else unnerving camera-work and great writing throughout. Lest we forget that Peele wrote, directed and produced this.<br/><br/>Beyond everything Peele has succeeded in balancing the genre demands of his piece with the social commentary he puts forth. There is a danger with any horror film that the social issues at hand overwhelm the story or that the story and plot dampen any wider concerns to nearly nothing. There is interesting and at times genuinely uncomfortable moments created by the issues our main character faces and situations he deals with. Peele has got the balance spot on and the film is also helped by moments of well timed comic relief.<br/><br/>Debuts are always a double edged sword which half the time leave you feeling underwhelmed and the other half overwhelmed, setting up inevitable disappointments for whatever follows up. Peele has proved himself a skilled and inventive director who can tackle complex and fascinating subject matter in a horrific fashion as much as he can in his comedy. He has said he has many more stories of 'social demons' to come over the next ten or so years. I am looking forward to them already."
"rawilliams-604-723035","10","9","19","4 April 2017"," Groundbreaking film may define a new genre
","Jordan Peele has described this movie as a ""social thriller"", and in some respects his use of small, subtle cues to build a growing sense of unease borrows heavily from the ""psychological thriller"" genre made popular by Alfred Hitchcock. Part of this film's strength lies in the frank examination of social expectations and nonverbal communication. Chris, the main character sees, and hears many things that bother him and contribute to his anxiety. But because he is in a social situation where awkwardness and stereotypical gaffes are something he expects, he writes off many of his experiences as misunderstandings or coincidences, or of examples of ways in which his own social expectations are out of place. He is unable to clearly verbalize what's bothering him. He therefore overlooks things that, to his friend Rod, are gigantic warning flags, while voluntarily putting himself in a situation where he is more and more helpless to escape when he finally realizes he's in danger.<br/><br/>It may be necessary to draw a distinction between a ""psychological"" thriller, wherein the key factor driving the plot and the decision making of the characters is the internal thoughts and feelings of the characters, and a ""social"" thriller in which the tension comes from the interaction between different characters and the contrast in their expectations as to what behavior is or is not appropriate. Is a particular behavior creepy, abnormal, and worthy of a jump scare? Or is it simply a normal aspect of a social situation in which the main character is not comfortable? The way Chris begins to question and second-guess himself, and the way he starts to doubt his own instincts and intuition, comes almost entirely from the social aspects of the situation he's in. <br/><br/>Unlike many horror films in which the victims do phenomenally stupid things, this film accurately depicts exactly why Chris tolerates what most people would consider inappropriate behavior, and why he stays at the Armitage home instead of leaving. Every single decision he makes is completely understandable, even when it puts him at risk. Frequently even his riskier behavior is the only possible option given his life experiences and his emotional state.<br/><br/>Race, and racism, are omnipresent in this movie and some of it is overt. Chris is treated differently, objectified, and patronized by the Armitages and some of their friends. In the midst of a scene where ""White"" racial stereotypes of ""Black"" people are being trotted out and exaggerated to the point of hilarity, Peele injects a few lines of dialogue with a Japanese character who, ironically, can easily be interpreted as a stereotype. With layer after layer of irony, the film subtly mocks its own effort to deconstruct racial stereotyping.<br/><br/>Lacking the stereotypical gratuitous nudity and sex many people associate with horror, this movie has several violent scenes at the end but is not gratuitously gory. The victim's helplessness, and the casual predatory nature of the villains (who really are Up To Something) is conveyed almost entirely through the acting, which is outstanding. Many horror conventions are turned on their heads, such as who the victims are and who the villain or villains might be.<br/><br/>It is also important to pay attention to the score. The background music for this movie is spectacular, particularly ""Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga""."
"danielharden","9","9","19","4 April 2017"," From the edge of your seat to the sunken place
","In the Film Industry, race has become a very talked about issue. With events like the #Oscarssowhite campaign last year, prompting hundreds of black filmmakers to be headhunted to join the academy, and then a year later Moonlight wins best picture at the Oscars as well as their being a number of black award recipients. With many films at the moment tackling the very relevant issue of racism, one film stands out above the rest as the most original and all round best in my opinion. Get Out comes to us from the mind of Jordan Peele, one half of comedy duo Key and Peele. The film is a satirical horror comedy about implicit racism, slavery and being the only black person in the room. Now the first black filmmaker to debut with a film grossing over $100 million, Peele has made history and rightly so, as this film is fantastic on every level from comedy, to horror to political satire.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele wrote and directed this film beautifully. The script is extremely clever and well structured, and Peele's direction is just as fascinating. Get Out is a rare breed of horror comedy film as the two genres are kept separate throughout the film, but yet never feel out of place. The main source of comedy in the film comes from character Rod Williams played wonderfully by LilRel Howery. The rest of the comedy in the film is derived from the unknowingly racist comments and assumptions from the old white people in the film. Often with horror comedies it's the subversion of horror conventions that creates comedy, but not in Get Out.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this is an original horror film that explores racial issues. These themes are expressed in an extremely sophisticated manner, within the microcosm of the Armitage residence. To me, the film is essentially a visual metaphor for the slave trade and that it still exists in alternative forms today, whether that be a mental form or being a thing out for display at a social gathering. What's great about this film is the realistic nature of its racism, it's very subtle and implicit, something you can imagine your grandparents would innocently say without knowing. This makes the film feel more authentic and genuine as you can relate to this, regardless what side of the encounter you find yourself on.<br/><br/>The film's direction is superb. As already mentioned, Peele evens out comedy and horror in this film, marrying the two together in a way that shouldn't work but somehow does. Peele is very good at crafting anticipation and suspense in this film, and thanks to Michael Abel's score, the tension in this film is nail biting. Peele is also very good at handling conventions, as he doesn't necessarily rely on horror movie clichés to create an unsettling atmosphere. Jumpscares are in this film, but Peele uses them wisely, rather than making the rookie error of overusing and relying on them. Peele wants to be original in the way he unsettles his audience, he doesn't want to fall back on human reflexes in the way jump scare heavy, modern horror films tend to. Peele uses proportion and I commend him for it. I also thank Jordan Peele for having the most satisfying final act to a film that i've probably ever seen. The use of the police car is simply genius.<br/><br/>As well as Jordan Peele doing an outstanding job on this film, the same can be said of actor Daniel Kaluuya, who plays the films lead, Chris Washington. Samuel L. Jackson may have preferred to see an American black man play the role, but personally I couldn't think of anyone better for the role than Kaluuya. The level of emotional control on display by him in this film is off the charts and simply mind blowing. This is not the first time that I have genuinely been amazed by Kaluuya's acting, he shows the same level of emotional intensity and control in Black Mirrors episode 'Fifteen Million Merits'. After that episode I said he would be an actor to watch out for, and his performance in Get Out is continued proof of that. Get Out also boasts a great supporting cast from good performances from Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Betty Gabriel and comic relief LilRel Howery. But at the end of the day the focus is on Kaluuya and boy does he shine.<br/><br/>Overall, Get Out is an absolutely fantastic horror film. Original, unsettling, funny and with an emotionally mesmerising performance by Daniel Kaluuya. Get Out takes you on a thrill ride like few other film has done before. Hollywood needs more filmmakers like Jordan Peele, visionary directors with original stories to tell. No wonder this film is setting and breaking cinematic records."

","I decided to go watch the movie after I saw the high reviews about it and when I went to the theater I was ultimately enjoyed. everything about the movie is amazing , interesting and exciting. From the very beginning you can feel the strange setting , the strange reactions from the white family, you feel that there's something wrong and this makes you more concentrated in the movie and not feeling bored at all. The movie really takes you from the very beginning and I like that kind of movies which has fast temp. Then the second part of the movie when everything is revealed you can sympathize with the hero as if you're him . you really feel sorry for him , you feel like you really want to help and that makes you more concentrated and following the afterwards scenes where you need to know more and keep thinking how he will react to his situations .what will happen next and all that sort of questions keep coming on your mind.<br/><br/>In the end you can see all the pieces of the puzzle coming together and you began to connect the scenes with themselves. <br/><br/>On the other hand and in spite of that this movie is a horror movie but there is a very high comedy scenes in the movie that would really make you laugh so loud and this was very very very interesting. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the whole movie and I'm really so thankful to the writer & director Jordan Peele because he really made my day and because this is the best movie so far in 2017. Really I do appreciate his hard work and I'm really looking forward to all his next projects.<br/><br/>Last thing I gave it 9 out of 10 just because I wished if the movie could tell us more about the stories of the other victims . This depends on the viewers some people like it to be left like that for our imaginations and some people like me love it when more details in more scenes are shot and added to the movie . <br/><br/>Go watch Get Out all the people"

The main character did not have anything to like about him. <br/><br/>That said, I guess some people will love it, but if you have any form of intelligence you will see its flaws. <br/><br/>As for it being a horror movie - there were maybe two jumpy bits in the entire film. Nothing creative - just a loud string staccato out of the blue to keep your heart at check. <br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie was the hot girlfriend! played by Allison Williams. I predict she has a great career ahead of her. <br/><br/>Watch it if you want a giggle - but don't expect anything exciting!"

This movie had that and more. <br/><br/>The director blended enough what the hell is going on thoughts, with funny comic relief to keep me engaged the entire film. I felt like there may have been more room for a few more jumpy parts, but overall this will be a go-to thriller to recommend to people wanting a great flick to watch that will tie together really well in the end."

"thelastblogontheleft","9","9","19","27 March 2017"," Just brilliant
","I was excited the second I heard that Jordan Peele was directing a horror movie. I have been a huge fan of his ever since I first saw Key & Peele and the idea of someone so hilarious and so clearly brilliant in his wit and intelligence and ability to shatter social and racial norms delving into my favorite genre — horror — was way too awesome. <br/><br/>The story centers around Chris Washington (played by the absolutely incredible Daniel Kaluuya) venturing out for a weekend trip with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), to visit her family at her parents' estate in the woods. He is initially hesitant when he finds out that Rose hasn't told her family that he is black, but she is quick to assure him that they are anything but racist. The trip starts out innocent enough but it devolves quickly into something brooding and terrifying.<br/><br/>I think one of the things I loved the most about this movie was that it dealt with racism in a much more subtle way than is often done. This wasn't a movie about a black man up against a group of neo-Nazis, or a bunch of hillbilly rednecks waving a Confederate flag, or even people who are blatantly racist. It showed a much more subtle — and in some ways, a much more sinister — breaking down of his humanity in the sense that the people involved all seemed to be extremely liberal, the type of people you'd shop beside at Whole Foods or who would make a point to donate to the ACLU, or who ""would have voted for Obama a third time if they could have"". The signs are very slight at first, and almost more annoying to Chris than anything else, but there's this sense of something terrible bubbling under the surface that is extremely well done — you feel a sense of dread throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>The groundskeeper, Walter (Marcus Henderson), and the maid, Georgina (Betty Gabriel), are two fantastic characters as we struggle for a majority of the movie to figure out their story. Both of which are a mystery to Chris, too, as he tries to find some connection with them but fails at every turn, only becoming more perplexed. The scene with Chris and Georgina as she apologizes for unplugging his phone — the look of restrained terror and desperation in her eyes, and the single tear rolling down her cheek — is particularly powerful. <br/><br/>My favorite scene was easily the odd hypnosis encounter that Chris has with Rose's mother (played by Catherine Keener). Not only is it a treat to get to see Kaluuya sort of one-on-one — I've been a fan of his ever since seeing him in Black Mirror and he just has this intense, vulnerable charm that I love — but the visuals they chose for his hypnotic state are brilliant and awe-inspiring and terrifying all at once. Like Chris is falling backwards through some kind of open space with a much more viscous quality, we hear noises become muffled and the fear behind his eyes intensifies as Mrs. Armitage tells him that he is now ""in the sunken place"" — cue my whole week's worth of shuddering.<br/><br/>The hypnosis, which just seems like an extremely odd occurrence at first, becomes much more relevant later on as we start to piece together what is really going on behind the scenes in this seemingly calm, collected community. I think the reveal that Rose was in on it all along — first with Chris finding the photos of her past boyfriends, who she said had all been white, and then with Rose drawing out the process of passing her car keys off to him — was shocking, personally. You really believe that she's innocent in all of this, but her complicity adds another layer of reflection on the issues of racism and seeming trusted allies as a whole.<br/><br/>Peele takes such a classic horror technique — ramping up an already existing, and justified, fear into something even darker and more twisted — and applies it for a chilling reveal as we find out that not only are these family members bidding for Chris, they are bidding to BECOME him. He's taken the idea of cultural appropriation to a terrifying new height with the concept of upper class white liberals LITERALLY taking over the body of a young black man, whether it be for his physical capabilities, his youth, his ""coolness"", whatever their fancy may be. <br/><br/>The ending explodes into what is really the only physical violence and gore in the entire movie as Chris makes his way out of the house. The gore was well done in the sense that it never seemed gratuitous, and added a few awesome moments of ""holy crap!"" to an already intense movie. Chris's friend, Rod (the effortlessly hilarious LilRel Howery), helps with his rescue, which added a glimmer of hope when I absolutely thought the film would end with Chris's arrest and incarceration for the murder of Rose and her family. Apparently Peele had intended for it to end that way initially, but decided the film needed a happier ending after a string of high-profile shootings of black citizens by police occurred during production. It's interesting to think of the different feel the movie would have had if it had, indeed, ended with such a realistic conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, SO GREAT. I am absolutely amazed but not at all surprised that Peele would deliver such a sharply intelligent, relevant, darkly realistic, and occasionally hilarious movie for his first go as a director. I am waiting with bated breath to see what he comes up with next."
"stroggos","7","9","19","27 March 2017"," Suspenseful & witty horror flick about racial stereotypes
","GET OUT is the story of how a black guy—Chris, played by the marvellous Daniel Kaluuya—and his white girl-friend visit her parent's mansion at the countryside. At first sight, his girl-friend's parents seem just fine with Chris being black. But he soon discovers that something is off. The black ""servants"" at the mansion are behaving oddly, as if brainwashed. And as he digs deeper, more secrets about hist girl-friend's family are being revealed.<br/><br/>GET OUT is witty as hell. It deals with racial stereotypes in a funny way, turning them outward and explicit by making racial divides within the US the premise of a horror movie. The script is spot-on, with just enough jokes to keep you laughing, just enough racial subtext to make it cringe-worthy, and just enough seriousness so as to not destroy the suspense. And it is there where GET OUT excels: In many movies, suspense and comedy are mutually exclusive. Not here! GET OUT manages to keep both up and going till the very end.<br/><br/>Mix into this great performances (both on the protagonist and the villain's side), good cinematography, some fun play with US accents, self-awareness of and commentary on horror movie tropes ... perfected with a dash of violence and gore ... and you'll end up with something that's truly unique, managing to deliver many complex emotions simultaneously while still just being outright fun."
"kimheniadis","8","9","19","25 March 2017"," Really enjoyed it, and we need more movies that deal with racism.
","I wanted to give this movie five stars, and I wanted to love it because every moment was excellent. But as you can see with the four star rating, I just couldn't. I still want everyone to see this movie in the theater, because movies like this need to make more money so the studios can see that people want more movies like this. But I want this movie to be even better, like I thought it was going to be. <br/><br/>So why couldn't I give it five stars? The biggest reason is I felt it dumbed itself down. To me this film was taking a big chance that is rarely done in movies today, especially horror-esque ones. Not only talking about the race issue, but showing the horrific feelings and realities that people face every day. <br/><br/>And then along comes the scene in the bathroom after the mainly white, old people party, where Rose and Chris are getting ready for bed. Rose mentions every racist thing that the people did at the party. And Chris just says, ""Yup."", because what else can he say. He deals with it regularly. So the reason it stood out to me so much was because the racist people (if they were even to go and see it), wouldn't even think twice about what Rose is reiterating, and the people who do think about racism already, are aware that the things that were done and said to Chris should not be done.<br/><br/>As far as the Sci-Fi aspect to this movie, it had a bit of a cheesiness to it, which worked for the most part as a tension reliever. I'm referring to the end when Chris is in the basement watching TV. <br/><br/>And the horror doesn't really present itself until the last half hour of the movie. Except for the couple of jump scares earlier. In regards to the some of the horror towards the end, when Dean is downstairs in the workroom, and there are candles lit, I understood this to be part of a ritual, but I would have thought by now that there would be new and better ways to do things. I'm torn on that though. I understand the message to be that some still think racism was something that happened years ago, so keeping the basement in the past fit, but I would have also seen it more modern.<br/><br/>If you go in not reading any spoilers, I think most people will be surprised at how it unfolds. And Jordan Peele left the perfect amount of clues, that if you really think about it, you can probably figure out what is happening early on. If you do watch it spoiler free, I think going back to watch it again is also a good idea, because you can focus more on the actor's nuances, and focus more on looking for the double and triple meanings in some of the scenes.<br/><br/>Even with the four star rating, and some of my comments, I really do think you should see this movie. Go to the theater now and watch it, then watch it again on DVD when you've had time to digest it, and like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, you can look for deeper meanings in the scenes."
"john-higgins95","9","9","19","22 March 2017"," A knock out of the park from first time director Jordan Peele
","Get out is the directorial debut by comedian Jordan Peele from the comedy central show ""Key and Peele"" as well as Mad TV. Unlike his work that I previously mentioned this is a horror film so it was really interesting to see what he would do with this movie. <br/><br/>So what's the story? Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) goes on a trip with his girlfriend Rose to meet her parents. Only thing is he is black and her parents are from a rural suburb and he's worried they won't care for them being in an interracial relationship. At first everything seems okay. The parents welcome Chris in open arms however ,the longer they are at this meet the parents trip, things become stranger and stranger, as the parents gradually begin acting more sinister and hostile and every person that works at this house is black, further adding to the creepiness of this whole situation. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the dialogue in this movie, every single word that is said has some sort of meaning and commentary behind it. If you watch the trailers you'll see the Dad using stereotypical black slang and accents when speaking to Chris in an effort to relate to him. Every one is trying insanely hard to prove that they aren't racist, and many other things that make the viewer feel more uneasy the more they talk. <br/><br/>The good thing is the subtext in this movie isn't completely reliant on dialogue the TV's look very much like the old style ones from the 1950's, the architecture of the house is colonial style like a plantation home and so much detail put in this movie that it's insane. You really get the feeling that Jordan Peele put a lot of effort and care into crafting this insane horrific world. <br/><br/>Also the pacing is very well done. It starts off fairly relaxed. Not boring, just relaxed. Then the further the movie goes along the more intense it gets. The film lulls you in such a way that you don't even notice how drastically the tone changes over time until the movie is over and you realize you've been on the edge of your seat for over 90 minutes. <br/><br/>Despite the film being an extremely intense experience Jordan Peele does manage to sprinkle in some of his special brand of humor when the tension needs to ease up at times. There were times when I would be scared out of my mind and then in the very next scene I'd be rolling in my seat laughing. <br/><br/>You might take a look at this and think if you're a white person ""man I don't wanna watch this movie, I don't wanna feel like some monster simply cause I'm white."" And to that I say get over yourself just because some white people suck doesn't automatically mean you do. With that being said this movie takes a subject that can be very divisive and uses carefully crafted suspense blended with humor to bring the viewer in who may have an entirely different background from the main character as far as race relations go and generate sympathy for problems one may not have to deal with on a regular basis. Me personally, I'm a white man from a rural SOUTHERN suburb in a predominantly white town, and unfortunately I have encountered many people with racist attitudes in my lifetime. And yet I didn't feel attacked for my background or anything like that.<br/><br/>While I did mention everything having a purpose, and extreme attention to detail there are certain parts that while scary at the time don't really have a lasting impact on the story as a whole. The thing is though this is something you don't realize until you're in the car on your way home and you think to yourself wait a second! Really that's my only knock about this movie the story is intriguing, the dialogue and scenery are rich with social commentary, it's well paced, just certain things don't really pay off as well as they could from time to time. Go see this movie. If you consider yourself a horror fan you owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially since good horror is in such short supply recently. <br/><br/>And I'm gonna give Get Out, a 9/10.<br/><br/>(For other reviews like the one you just read, check out my channel on Youtube.

"kingbk-2","9","7","14","15 April 2018"," One of the Most Original Stories in Years
","NYC photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) has been happily dating his caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) for five months. She coaxes him into going to her parent's house one weekend to meet the family. His best friend Rod warns him against this, but he agrees to join Rose. They make the hour-2 hour drive outside the city into a beautiful lake community where the Armitage house resides. Chris immediately feels uncomfortable, from the black servants working at the house, to the awkward conversations he has with her family, to the unannounced party they will now have to attend. Chris learns of a dark secret the family is hiding, and must figure out how he can escape before it's too late. <br/><br/>This is honestly one of the most original movies I've watched in years. Jordan Peele, a comedian I enjoy from his Key & Peele days, writes a story that honestly resonates more with what America is like these days more than the typical racism stories you see. He hits on the ""white liberal guilt"" type of racism, where whites are not blatantly racist to blacks, but instead want blacks to fit a certain white mindset. These are the types who point to Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Denzel Washington and President Barack Obama and want blacks to be like that. They aren't calling them the ""n"" word, they aren't attacking them and many times they are friendly towards them, but only to a point. I'm glad this aspect is finally touched on because in 2018, there are many, many more types of this pseudo discrimination and racism than there are of the white nationalist, blatant racism variety. The irony of it all is Peele himself is married to a white caucasian woman, so I'm sure many of the themes and topics are things he dealt with (and still does) in that relationship. <br/><br/>Calling it just a horror movie doesn't do it justice. Horror, with a mix of comedy, satire and thriller is probably a better description. I takes a deeply political, sensitive issue, addresses it, and does it in a way that is not pushy or over the top. The characters are not stereotypes, but fully developed. The story builds and builds, with a conclusion that I found satisfying. <br/><br/>Peele could be a filmmaker to keep an eye on moving forward. I look forward to other stories he has to tell."

"rbkjr","10","7","14","11 April 2018"," More than a Classic horror Thriller
","When I saw the Academy Award winning film on HBO, before the Oscars were even presented, I knew this film was going to win an award. It did for Jordan Peele, as the ""Best Original Screenplay"" of 2017. The scene that stood out to me, was when Chris, the film's protagonist, near the very end, comes to life (after being induced into a trance-like state by the girlfriend's mother who hypnotized him) so that he can become just a ""body"" to donate his organs for a white man, while Chris is black. Chris takes the mounted 'Deer Head' off the wall & uses the antlers to stab the girlfriend's father to death...just before he plans on removing Chris's organs for the transplant surgery, since the father is a doctor. Watching the blood GUSH from the father, & the antlers stuck into him by Chris with such Delight, knowing that Chris is just about FREE from the ""Nightmare"" of getting away from the girlfriend's family...who has basically held him captive, with NO FREE WILL (which is the underlying theme of the whole movie). ""Get Out"" was more than worthy of an Oscar, for Jordan Peele's ""Best Original Screenplay""...How many different ways can I say Outstanding. No need to, that says it all!"
"juliette-smits","8","7","14","5 April 2018"," The build up is the best part
","The first 45 minutes to an hour had me sitting on the tip of my seat. The movie gives you this very uncomfortable feeling; you know something really bad is about to happen, but you don't know what... it keeps you on edge and that's great. After the plot twist, however, my interest dwindled slightly.<br/><br/>I really liked the main character - great performance by Daniel Kaluuya, by the way - and it's easy to sympathise with him. Maybe that's also because he seems to be one of the very few sane people in the movie. You'll find yourself rooting for him. The other members of the cast also play their roles very well. There isn't a bad actor or actress in this film.
The humour is quite well done. The jokes are funny but also feel kind of awkward, which is exactly what suits this movie.
The story is good, definitely, and absolutely original, but I'm not sure how to feel about the plot twist. It almost feels silly, but I guess that's kind of the point.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie is intriguing and original and worth the watch."

It did take a long while to build up though, but it was at a good pace and then all of a sudden you get to the point where he's in the chair about to be operated on and he starts killing everybody whose in his path. 1. He doesn't strike me to be the 'violent' type. 2. He had never been in that part of the house previous so how all of a sudden does he know his way around?<br/><br/>A lot of these sorts of films start off really good and intriguing but then they rush the ending.

I see no other reason for the hype other than an obvious political agenda and that alone not be so terrible if the movie wasnt as bad as it is and its themes so shallow, and mean spirited<br/><br/>This movie poses no debate and ask no questions worth considering, it simply puts forward it racism and expects you to praise it for it, which the acedemy seemed to do. I've never been head over heels about the oscars but nominating this is a travesty, even today it is ·number one or at least top five in ""movies of the decade"" list, showing how journalists and professional critics are in a debacle and so badly disconnected from reality, the audiences and moviemaking they basically get paid to make clowns of themselves, give banal excuses to praise smut while they insult the audiences intelligences throwing around buzzwords and smug political slogans , becoming a satire of themselves."

Anyone familiar with The Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Stepford Wives will find Get Out a new and effective variation on an old theme that disappointingly looses steam as it goes along, and runs afoul of clichés with no real payoff or satisfying resolution, and the last minute rescue is hokey as is an awkward attempt at exposition via television. The acting and directing go a long way in making Get Out compelling and enjoyable and a level of social critique in the script makes Get Out a welcome relief from the usual horrors."

","It's high time a black filmmaker called out the insidious hypocrisy that is continuously foisted on us in the US: So-called liberal (mostly privileged and white) racists posing as progressive, enlightened guardians. These false liberals believe people of color (whom they view as noble savages) need a caring white hand to guide and protect them. They preach and lecture the rest of us about the evils of racism while they themselves are hateful, hungry predators who foster a culture of fear and despair amongst people of color in order to promote themselves as the great white saviors. Hollywood is addicted to the fantasy of white people playing the role of savior to the fragile, lost black man. (Think Blind Side, A Time to Kill and every film about heroic white teachers who inspire children of color to forsake their criminal milieu and become A students). Get Out exposes these false liberals for the exploitative predators they are. Sadly, reading the reviews here, it appears many missed the point entirely."

"Jared9001","9","8","17","28 March 2017"," A horror movie that makes you think instead of groan
","As a self-proclaimed horror movie avoider, I was hesitant about ""Get Out"". I usually believe that often times modern horror movies really don't do much to tell an interesting story or prove a point, and really serve little of a purpose other than to make a lot of money at a low production cost, but ""Get Out"" isn't that kind of horror movie. I would argue that it isn't really a horror movie at all, but rather a comedic thriller with so many fantastic twists and turns that you'll have to watch it a second time just to put the pieces together. This movie portrays race in (at least from my view as a pasty white person) in a realistic, nuanced way, while still remaining poignant and funny. It doesn't portray white people as inherently evil, but does show the flaws that everyone can have when it comes to the subject of race, and anyone who tries to tell you that this movie has some kind of deep political agenda are people who are looking for something to be offended by. The performances offered by the entire cast are excellent, but the standouts here are definitely Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, and Lil Rel Howrey, for being smart and tragic, believably insane, and absolutely hilarious, respectively. The amount of fresh new talent in this film is fantastic, and Jordan Peele has certainly proved himself as not only a competent director and dramatic writer, but a potentially prolific one. The biggest issue I'd have with this film would be the occasional unnecessary jump scare, where a loud noise plays for absolutely no reason, just to spook the audience. But this happens very rarely, and is easy to ignore after the moment passes. Overall, I can easily recommend this film, and think that everyone should keep an eye on the career's of everyone involved here, I think you'll be rewarded royally. 9.2/10"

"r-43004","6","8","17","25 March 2017"," Get Out (2017) vs the Skeleton Key (2005)
","*****Caution: this review not only contains spoilers for Get Out but ALSO the Skeleton Key*********<br/><br/>First of all, I was shocked to see the Skeleton Key got such a low rating on IMDb while Get Out that just came out recently has been receiving generally positive reviews and feedback from the audience. I have to say, having very high expectations when I walked into the cinema was one of the reasons why I was a little disappointed by the movie. Honestly, the actors did a good job playing their parts, the soundtracks were on point, cinematic pictures were enjoyable, and the movie was not boring, but I still think it is overrated for the following reasons.<br/><br/>1. Unbelievable There are too many flaws in this movie. The white girl is skinny, flat-chested, and acts clueless for the most time. I know the nature of the character demands her to play innocent, but seriously? A bunch of black dudes fell for that? Nobody suspects anything after the black people gone missing? If the black TSA cop can just find the house so easily, how come everybody passing by never suspects anything? <br/><br/>2. Not that original How is the concept different than the body-switching in Skeleton Key? For those of you haven't seen Skeleton Key, I strongly recommend you do. In that movie, an African-American couple uses voodoo to seduce young people to switch bodies with them. I find the idea of ""switching to a younger body just because they are young and stronger"" more convincing than ""switching to a black person's body just because it is in fashion"". In the movie, they made a lot of implications to show the white cult is somewhat racist, like the brother talking about being more advanced and a few steps ahead. It seems like the movie makers want racism to be a selling point but also don't want viewers walking out hating each other so they whitewashed it at the end and have the blind guy say something like, we are not doing this because of your race, we're just doing it because you guys are stronger and faster. <br/><br/>3. Too predictable I mean, we knew the family was up to something all the way from the beginning. Killing the bad guys was way easy and very predictable. The only part that was not predictable was probably when the girlfriend turns out to be a part of them too. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought using race as a theme in horror movies was a fantastic idea, but the movie makers could have done a better job with this topic. It could have been something more unique instead of something that could be replaced by actors of any other color."

"jdesando","Null","9","20","27 February 2017"," Want humor and horror? You got it!
","Jordan Peele has a future as a writer -director. So expertly does he navigate genres in Get Out that I'm struggling to come up with one descriptor; rather I want to put them all in a stew and hyphenate: horror-comedy-social commentary-psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Young black man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), goes for weekend with white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) to her parents' home way out in the woods. The scary tropes are all there including strange servants and wacky psychologist mom (Katherine Keener), all overseen by equally off-center neurosurgeon dad.<br/><br/>If you mash up Guess Who's Coming to dinner with Stepford Wives and add a dash of Freddy for scary laughs, then you'll understand my enthusiasm for this first effort by an entertainer now firmly right behind Damien Chazelle for young, promising filmmakers. <br/><br/>Enjoy brains tossed in a trash bucket and wildly-inappropriate social comments (comments that at the same time as the humor allow Peele to draw on the absurdities of contemporary correctness and social engineering). No social hot button about the place of minorities is not pushed, albeit superficially, but in depth for a horror film.<br/><br/>Now I know why I was so disappointed in the recent Split directed by M. Night Shyamalan: His horror flick was aiming for the expected twist without finesse and understatement. Get Out is assuredly aiming at the incendiary interracial flash point while it attends to issues of conformity and mind control in contemporary society.<br/><br/>This film, however, never loses its sense of humor when it regularly lards the narrative with cell phone conversations between Chris and his shlubby buddy, Rod (LilRel Howlery). It's hilarious use of ethnic humor to advance the plot and provide comic relief from the considerably-scary goings-on. I haven't laughed as heartily as this in a long time.<br/><br/>As amused as I was with Peele's virtuosity, I was perplexed that such a fine genre buffet as this should be released at dumping-ground movie-release time. Surprisingly as well, I have not been as vicariously scared in a long time, perhaps because, stripped of its horror and humor, Get Out is also about us all with our private prejudices fueled by our need to control others when we can't control ourselves.<br/><br/>Enjoy this rich amalgam of light-hearted hokum and genre mixing--or enjoy excellent filmmaking."

The obvious, is that this film is about racism. The racism in this film is as obvious as a welcome and a smile in a West Texas town. That should give you an idea if you have been to west Texas.

","Get out was a movie that never hit the mark the trailers portrayed. The movie had some Ill-placed humor throughout. This humor not only pulled the viewer out of the story, but also felt forced and did not add to the plot. The movie was not over-the-top scary, but did had its share of suspense. I think the majority of the acting was superb and the cinematography and accompanying scores really set the stage for what could have been a great movie.<br/><br/>The movies weakness lies in its storyline. The movie propagated the agenda for racial discourse by portraying white on black crime. This weak plot never allowed the viewer to become fully engaged. This shallow storyline at no point left the viewer feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>I think this movie missed its mark entirely. It could have been a big hit if the story was more fleshed out with a different focal point. I enjoyed parts of it, but would not recommend it or see it again.

","Not strong enough to be a satire, more like a stand-up comedy routine. Witing's not strong enough to support strong acting even though it has top-notch talents like Steven Root & Catherine Keener in it. Follows all the tropes of horror movies going back to the silents but if it wasn't for the reverse-racism slant, it would be a low-budget straight to video film."

","It would be wrong to say that this is not a good film, unfortunately one that has been over hyped. If I had watched it without knowing the hype and rave reviews, it would likely have earned an extra star rating.<br/><br/>No need to discuss the plot but the film sits in the mystery/horror genre slot. I thought it was a comedy-horror going in, but it isn't. In fact the undertone to the film has quite a dark and socially challenging agenda.<br/><br/>Though is the film a new fresh take on the horror genre as some reviews have suggested, well, erm, no. All though there is some astute direction in building the suspense, Get Out does end up following the standard horror narrative. The last 25 minutes is particularly typical as our central character desperately tries to 'get out' of the bad situation.<br/><br/>Would still recommend watching this film, just don't get too excited."

"cruise01","10","8","18","21 June 2017"," Get Out is a smart suspenseful thriller and one of the better horror movies up to date.
","The fear of meeting the significant others parents has always been an anxiety of wondering how they are like. The anxiety of trying to impress them, the background history or even the appearance can make you feel a little nervous. Director/writer Jordan Peele first film and tackling a horror genre at that makes a pretty entertaining movie. He definitely has his work cut out as a director by making the one thing couples usually have an anxiety about and twisting it around.<br/><br/>The film follows Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) are planning a small trip to visit her parents. He is afraid they will judge him for being a black guy. They arrive at their country side house, were Chris notices that there is a black guy doing work on their yard or a house maid. Which her parents assure him that they are not prejudice. When his girlfriends mother does an hypnosis session with him. He notices that everyone there may not be who they say they are.<br/><br/>Get Out is a great suspenseful horror movie. It may not be scary or bloody. It does build the mystery suspense. The moments of Chris noticing the strange behaviors that the house maids are behaving. Her parents behaviors being erratic and cheery and creepy about meeting him and introducing him to other guests in a big party. The concept of hypnosis is also pretty crazy as Chris starts questioning if its his paranoia self about fearing about being judged for his race or if something sinister is going on. Jordan Peele does well building the suspense and the anxiety with a white family having black people as maids.<br/><br/>I was very surprised about how awesome this movie was. I had low expectations after watching the trailers and was thinking it would be a cheesy bad acting horror movie. Jordan Peele proved the expectations wrong. It turned out to be a smart suspenseful movie were you root for the main character. Which is rare to see characters make certain decisions which can be frustrating in most horror movies.<br/><br/>There is a twist that is best not to reveal or talk about. The less you know or see from the previews the better the surprise will be. The last act and the ending does not disappoint. The movie does have some funny moments and plus a comic relief character that is Chris friend that is always throwing jokes about sex slaves and only trusting the ""brothers"" of his kind.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya did great which this is my first time seeing him perform on screen. Allison Williams did well as his girlfriend. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener both were great and creepy with their characters.<br/><br/>Once the twist is revealed, it can be kind of disturbing about whats really going on. Without giving much away. Overall, Get Out is a great horror film. Director Jordan Peele may have a great start working on films. The suspense and funny moments were well balanced. The twist was surprising. The cast and acting were great. The plot and concept of interracial meeting the family and paranoia was entertaining. I definitely recommend the film if you are looking for suspense"
"parsonm2","10","8","18","4 May 2017"," Horror Worth Watching
","There was a ton of positive press from others about this movie which is totally justified. I watched a single trailer sparingly and carefully avoided reading or watching spoilers about this one to savor and keep my viewing experience unspoiled and I'm glad I did. This may be the best horror movie of not only the year but the past few years. I can say without spoiling anything that this movie combined the best of ""Guess whose coming to Dinner"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" feel. What made the movie even better was that I had some guesses about what was going to happen in the movie but the story hits you with a sucker punch from a completely different direction that we've never seen before. This is an utterly new and different horror experience. It has some dry situational humor but remains an utterly dark and worthwhile horror experience. This is definitely a keeper and worth multiple viewings."
"justinjs-10612","10","8","18","26 April 2017"," A Fresh new Horror Film!
","I went into this movie with high hopes and it truly delivered and then some. The film allows the viewer to sympathize with the main character in a way that many horror films have tried and failed. There's also hints of dark/awkward humor spread out within the film that either lighten up the mood after an intense scene or reveals a character's true intentions. The film is very suspenseful but there are some really great horror scenes that fans of horror films will enjoy. This film stands out among more recent scary films because it's smart and three-dimensional. This is a strong debut directorial and I can't wait to see what else Jordan Peele comes out with."

","As I write this in April of 2017, ""Get Out"" is the best movie I have seen so far this year. First time writer-director Jordan Peele shows a talent for dialogue similar to Quentin Tarantino for using language which sounds like the way real people speak to one another. Rose(Allison Williams) is a twenty something white girl with a black boyfriend, Chris(Daniel Kaluula). The happy couple travel from NYC to a lily white suburban community north of the big city. The good liberal(we voted for Obama twice, ha ha) parents welcome Chris into the family with big goofy grins. Something isn't quite right in Mayberry, as the story unfolds into an almost ""Stepford Wives"" tone. Peeles's script is smart, funny and strikes a perfect balance between comedy and horror. I do not want to give away too much and so I will only advise my fellow movie lovers to sit back and enjoy Peele's excellent rookie effort into the film business."

"alfiemachin","10","8","18","8 April 2017"," Jordan Peele's marvelous start into directing
","Get Out is creepy horror/mystery involving hints of great humor and strong message behind the terrifying plot. Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main character Chris Washington does a brilliant job in showing what the character is boldly thinking and does this with uses of thoughts out loud. Normally i would see this type of acting unprofessional, however this fitted in brilliantly with Jordan Peele's style of comedy he wanted to added smartly into the horror. The rest of the cast do a amazing job at giving that uncomfortable feeling Chris is going through. The moment they pull into the drive way of the house it immediately feels scary and that something isn't quite right.<br/><br/>Although some scary scenes were quite predictable and had their fair share of jump scares. The originality was most definitely their and is definitely a completely out there horror we haven't seen for a while. I particularly impressed by the opening scene especially after hearing it was filmed in one take. It put viewers straight into the plot of the film and gives you a mysterious overview of the villain in the film and how it is later shown towards the end of the film. Lots of links between scenes were used to form a great use of intensity that had me trying to hide in my jumper.<br/><br/>LilRel Howery who played Rod a very close friend to Chris completely stole the show with every scene he was included in. He uplifted the film at the perfect moments with great use of humor and had some of the best lines in the script by far. The twist was absolutely perfect and was portrayed at a great time in the movie and was surprisingly unpredictable. It also formed a good transition to start the grand finale of the filming.<br/><br/>The film was not riddled with action and contained a large amount of slow yet interesting scenes that gave clues towards the whole mystery behind the family and house. Jordan Peele was able to enlarge the worldwide problem of racism and had almost everybody thoroughly thinking about how African Americans are still treated in certain states of America that i admittedly wasn't aware of was still occurring.Even though the film showed a unrealistic and paranormal theme. It related effectively with lots of real life scenarios.<br/><br/>In conclusion Get Out was heavily intense, scary and enjoyable film especially considering it was Jordan Peele's first ever film directing. You can definitely tell that the plot was well thought through and i'm excited to see more films by Mr Peele down the line of the film industry. I would most certainly watch this film again and recommend it to anyone."
"kaitlinrs","10","8","18","6 April 2017"," Get Into the Theaters to see Get Out
","Do young black males in America feel like they're being hunted? The movie ""Get Out"" directed by Jordan Peele was a thriller in every sense of the word. The 2017 film is one that will go down in history for a variety of reasons. The director is known for his show ""Key and Peele"" which is a riot for any comedy fan. Peele has been a strict comedy director for many years—making this film a surprise. I expected this film to be comedic in nature and probably not to thrilling. I waited a couple weeks to see it but decided it was a must after the pop culture following. Every social media account of mine was laced with friends' admiration for this film. With this in mind I went into the theater expecting allusions to our culture's view on race. <br/><br/>To say ""Get Out"" met my expectations is an understatement. I was blown away with the rest of America with this film. There was a perfect blend in this movie: comedy, horror, and thrills throughout the whole 103 minutes. There are allusions to the way young black men must feel in our country—hunted. The throne of privilege young white women sit upon is addressed, and the comedy we all have grown to adore from Jordan Peele is prevalent. In one scene Rose, played by Allison Williams, seems to be standing up for Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, by not letting the officer who pulled them over take his license. Rose did this because he wasn't driving so it seems like a noble gesture; the real reason Rose doesn't want the officer to have his license is chilling. <br/><br/>I loved this film. With an astonishing $154.5 million dollar box office grossing and an even more astonishing $4.5 million dollar budget, Peele—a first time thriller film writer and director—has out done himself."
"joshteggert","9","8","18","28 March 2017"," 'Get Out' is a brilliant psychological horror that fittingly exemplifies the revulsions of a supposed ""post-racial"" society
","Set in a ""post racial"" America, 'Get Out' challenges the complacency of a liberal society, setting the audience with deep unease throughout the film, not just by its chilling horror aspects, but rather the disconcerting social attitudes audaciously identified in the white middle class family. Before the main story, which follows Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his weekend away with his girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) family, the film opens with an unsettling pre-credits scene of a young black man being jumped to Flanagan and Allen's Run, Rabbit, Run. This establishes the sincerely disturbing tone of the narrative, constantly manipulating the emotions of the viewers in favour of the victims, whilst still expertly retaining elements of subtlety that slowly uncover throughout the film.<br/><br/>'Get Out' incorporates a remarkable array of horror aspects in its 1hr 44min run time – from guts and violence to, most prominently, psych and emotional terror. Each feature is integrated stylistically, culminating to form a smart and consistently tense narrative, although at points flowing just like any other horror movie in terms of set-up, revelation and the sporadic comic relief. Similarly, a significant suspension of disbelief is required to grasp the tenacious premise of the eventual plot drive, which is unveiled in the latter third of the film. Thus, its overarching spread is sometimes too thin and consequently struggles to candidly assemble at the end.<br/><br/>That said however, there is a great deal more to praise about the way in which director Jordan Peele unravels the story towards this climax. The brilliant intricacy of the family's 'acceptance' of Chris' culture, by being overly pleasant that is, superbly exacerbates the tension in the relationship, not just on screen, but between the audience and the characters. The gradual, relentless extrication of the plot is entrancing during the entire course of the film, leaving many aspects rightfully open to the individual interpretation of the viewer, intuitively hinting at Peele's intentions, to isolate the despicable root nature of racism in our society. And my god, does he do an exceptional job.<br/><br/>The casting of Daniel Kaluuya as the lead character, despite the controversy regarding his nationality (ironically), was an excellent decision by Peele; Kaluuya's steady intensity makes it easy to see why the director eventually chose him for the role, having never intended to cast a black British actor initially. The 'Skins' and 'Sicario' co-star is a captivating lead, with the high forecasts for 'Get Out' hopefully projecting this young talent to step into larger roles that he unequivocally deserves. Lil Rel Howery (as the charming Rod Williams) is without doubt the standout supporting member; the comedic timing of his character and the relatable quality of his personality is exceptionally charismatic, adding a meaningful layer of hilarity to the already fascinating spectacle and appealing to wider audiences who would not instinctively connect with the archetypal horror genre.<br/><br/>A movie that exhibits several fresh prospects in the film industry, 'Get Out' is a terrifically innovative film and potentially a generation defining horror."
"katherinecounce-76172","10","8","18","25 March 2017"," First of it's Kind ; 20/10 would recommend
","I made an IMDb account just to write this review because this movie was honestly that good. In a time where it's hard to have a movie that could be considered a first because there are so many movies out there, Get Out defies the odds and does that exact thing. I have never seen a horror/ thriller even close to being similar to Get Out. Some details of it may be silly and far-fetched, but besides that it's really hard to pick out flaws. It's current and relevant in today's society. I do see a lot of reviews saying how this movie is racist and throws down white people. Yes, every white character (except for maybe the cop) is not a good character. But, that is what adds to the terror of this movie, it is reflecting some of today's problems in society. I know many white people get offended by this because they are not personally like that and they think that the movie is saying all white people are like that, but did the movie ever say that all white people are like that??? (Hint: it didn't) Sure, It can be embarrassing that some white people are like this (it certainly is for me) but this is reality and this movie took reality and turned it into a piece of art. 20/10 would recommend to anybody (except for white people that take everything seriously)."
"ctowyi","8","8","18","22 March 2017"," Darkly funny and whip smart satire of our time
","Get Out is a timely entry in these cynical pressure-cooker of times. It is a piece of compelling entertainment, ensnaring the viewer with a rising intensity of stirring paranoia; it is a sly whip-smart satire of our current world wrecked day in day out with racial tension and inequality. How it never becomes top down heavy and preachy is sheer master-craft. <br/><br/>Part of the fun of Get Out is the winding twists and audacious turns, and a discussion of the plot will rob you of the fun. So I will refrain from doing that and will also not post the trailer. Best to go in blind. Believe the hype. <br/><br/>Writer-director Jordan Peele's debut film is assured and deliciously wicked. Get Out feels like an extended Twilight Zone episode. It is a potent genre blender, pushing many racism buttons, sending them up in a refreshing manner without being preachy. Peele's comedic roots is showcased here and the high-tensioned wire-act is neatly interspersed with some hilarious respites, which believe me, is much needed. Peele also achieved some great tonal shifts as the narrative easily slides out of comedy into horror and vice versa with a snap. I love narratives I can't guess the outcome and even though I could see some twists coming ahead of time, I never felt short-changed because the characters are so well- drawn and the situation so twisted. <br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya, best remembered as Emily Blunt's sidekick in Sicario and an episode in the excellent Black Mirror series, is outstanding as the deer caught in the headlights. He demonstrated a lot of range and his character arc left me breathless as he raced toward the devastating finale. It is a dazzling performance that will make your blood run cold. <br/><br/>When the ultra-violent final denouement rolled in, I was punching my fist in the air; only the really good ones can make me do this. It is definitely one of the most satisfying endings I have experienced in cinema and Peele has knocked it out of the park with his first film. Cleverly written with a pulse on today's crazy world and deeply unsettling, this darkly funny examination of what happens when you have got nothing left to lose is brilliantly addictive. This is a must-see for anyone who is occasionally reckless, ruthless or just plain psychologically weird, and anyone who loves clever movies."

Neither one of us despite being very big movie fans consider ourselves to be lovers of horror films but I must say that we were both pleasantly surprised by Jordan Peele's first movie out of the gate. The story itself was solid and suspenseful the acting was second to none and despite being just a tad long in laying the initial groundwork when the characters initially arrive at the parent's home the story pulled together in a very timely fashion. The supporting cast was great and the interjection of comic relief was timely and funny. The horror moments were just that horrific.The story line kept me guessing just long enough to figure what nefarious deeds were happening behind the scenes. The social message and the intertwining within the story itself were illuminative and gave way to a deeper meaning. Hands down Get Out did not disappoint and delivered in a way I have not seen when it comes to horror films and that's saying a lot from someone who doesn't consider himself a horror fan. The film is a must see if you love movies period and I'll be adding Get Out to my collection of Blu- rays. Nine stars indeed and my wife and I look forward to seeing what Mr. Peele has in the pipeline for our future entertainment."

"LuxuriousWoman","10","8","18","16 March 2017"," So many nuances and an intriguing movie
","I generally write notes before I review movies just to spark a bit of a memory while I'm reviewing it. I couldn't during this movie because it was all very interesting and I couldn't stop watching it. I'm basically going to do slight symbolism (I have to watch it again to analyze it thoroughly. Even then I wouldn't fit it all on here), and the characters.<br/><br/>My first thought was to be annoyed at the black guy in the beginning. I never got why he went to a racist suburb, where black people were disappearing in, without a car, friends, or even some kind of protection. Did they HAVE to meet there? Couldn't y'all go to your place or at a hotel?<br/><br/>As we get pass that part, then we go to the characters and symbolism.<br/><br/>Chris: the main character, a black guy, who's getting ready to meet the parents of his 4-5 month girlfriend. <br/><br/>Rose: Chris's girlfriend and a girl that lures black people at the house to keep them as slaves.<br/><br/>Her parents: racist liberal people who hypnotize and keep slaves.<br/><br/>Rose's brother: a guy who's racist and insecure; constantly talks of masculinity.<br/><br/>Chris's friend: a TSA guy who warns him about white people.<br/><br/>Black workers: people, lured by Rose, that are forced to stay and have had their brain switched for Rose's grandparents.<br/><br/>White Liberals: Many people think of racist white people as the Republican voting Trump lovers. That's only a group of racist people. You have to ones who are liberals, but they still hold racist views and push racism with gentrification. They're also the ones who were complaining about their kids going to black schools, and they push for racist Gerrymandering. I mean...<br/><br/>Black bodies and stereotypes: This is an interesting one. The obvious one is keeping them as workers who never complain. Another one is the white men talking to Chris about sports while the white women talk to him about his ""parts."" The conversations are deeper though. They don't really care to interact with black people outside of the stereotype of workers and sports people. ""you play (sport)?"" ""No."" ""Really? Well, (black athlete) is really good."" They couldn't fathom talking to him outside of sports. <br/><br/>The deer: Running over the deer and having animal control deal, which mirrors his mother getting run over. Rose's dad giving a speech about the deer destroying the Ecosystem. <br/><br/>Speaking of that, tone. The dad may *seem* liberal because he voted for Obama twice and liked Jesse Owens, but his tone seemed rough and it literally went to my collar bones. The subtle things like tone and movement really make this great with the micro-aggressions.<br/><br/>Wokeness: the black people hypnotized are there, but not ""there."" It becomes obvious when Chris flashes his camera, and breaks Andre from the spell. Andre yells at him to ""get out"" in desperation. Also... Chris isn't really ""woke."" He brushes off the weird stuff as, ""maybe (black worker) has a crush on you Rose."" ""Maybe (black maid) doesn't like me dating (white woman)"" <br/><br/>White women: as stated above, the black woman not liking him goes back to her being jealous of the Rose. He never thought it could be anything else. Rose calling for help with the cop car made EVERYONE nervous and that's due to her white female privilege of being thought as fragile. The cop backed off when she asked because they listen to white women."

But what this film does masterfully is building up the tension. This film made me feel very uncomfortable and very uneasy, which is what it's meant to do and does it to a T. In terms of acting Catherine Keener, and Daniel Kaluuya give the best performances. Keener is very subtle and slow with her words making her character very creepy. And Kaluuya gives a frightful and ultimately terrifying performance and plays a character you actually rout for. If you are a horror film fanatic, this is what you're looking for. The only flaws are that the villains are killed off way too easily, making the last fight for survival a weak one. But for the fact that this is Peele's first film to direct, this is as good of a debut as you can ask for. I can't wait to see what else Peele can do. Check it out, or get out! Now to grade.

"parkerryane","8","8","18","12 March 2017"," A Genre film at its finest
","Get Out is a horror film written and directed by comedian Jordan Peele. The story follows Chris, a black photographer, who travels to the house of his white girlfriend's parents. Horror at its finest, Peele doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares or random, wasteful violin screeches in order to get a mediocre scare. What Peele focuses on is atmosphere. For almost the entirety of the film, something feels off, and we are spooked because we, like Chris, are trying to figure out why. *SPOILER ALERT FOR THIS PARAGRAPH- Imagery is taken to a whole new level, both visible and verbal. When Chris first arrives and is given a tour of the property by Rose's father, dialogue is what sets the mood, how the father tries so desperately for Chris to connect with him. That is how we identify the enemy. The meager lies and deceptions. Our enemy isn't a Neo-Nazi skinhead, by an upper-middle class Liberal. Small puzzle pieces can be gathered and put together by the audience. The Deer's imagery, the sense of forthcoming doom, is up for debate. One of my favorite ""puzzles"" was (SPOILER) when Rose is eating froot loops (colored cereal) and drinking the milk separately. Separating White from Colored. Jim Crow. Peele leaves us with a brilliant artistic social commentary on the state of relations between White and Black America. Once you leave the studio, no matter what color your skin, you will question your entire view on race, horror, and identity politics.<br/><br/>One of if not the best horror film of the past 20 years."
"mooreapollo","9","8","18","12 March 2017"," An Unexpectedly Well Written ""Modern"" Horror Story
","First and foremost, kudos to Jordan Peele. Never in all my years would I have expected horror/drama so well written from a comedian. While the story does have its comedic aspects, it is well balanced with thrills, spooks, and mature storytelling with a very interesting and twisted plot. <br/><br/>As you may be well aware, when it comes to the horror genre, minorities are grossly misrepresented. Get Out, I believe, has been the first horror movie to achieve this level of critical acclamation with a black starring role. Now, I'm not basing the quality of the movie on the fact that the protagonist is a minority, but am only calling to attention the rarity of this type of direction. I feel like this movie opens a door of a genre in which minorities are atypical.<br/><br/>The concept/plot of the movie is different -- the good kind of different. You are lead to believe one thing and the movie elegantly slaps you in the face with a twist. This family is spooky as hell, and they are in a league of their own. While the movie does have a racial focal point, it's no disadvantage to the movie's storytelling, rather adds a level of spookiness to the reality that, no matter what your race, you can find yourself confronting the same horrors as anyone else. This movie does seem to portray a certain allusion to slave trades and whatnot, will admit, but that's not inherently a bad thing, unless you're one of those people that think blacks being victimized by whites can only be political correctness. I actually recall many lambasting this movie as one that makes whites seem like egregious, conniving devils, but when watching the movie it seemed to me, a white guy, a representation of particular crazy individuals, and not at all representative or demeaning of the entire white race like some have commentated.<br/><br/>Aside from the concept, the characters in the movie are so naturally acted and convey their roles with excellent direction. <br/><br/>This movie is no Keanu. Prepare yourself for an actual horror film, not a Scary Movie 3. This movie implements horror and comedy so well that one facet does not impend on the other and everything flows like a well though put story should. <br/><br/>This movie was a great watch. It delivers a level of creepiness, complemented with a unique and creative concept and elements of ""black"" humor."

","I watched this movie without reading the sypnosis, I'm kind of glad I did and kind of wish I had read it. At the beginning I was starting to wonder what the hell was going on. It is clear as day something is up with 'the help' around the Armitage House, the lead character must have been hypnotised for about 5 minutes before I realised it, I should have guessed with that constant noise of a spoon stirring on the inside of a cup, it was irritating the crap out of me, but that is what this film does. It gets your brain going in a way you're not really familiar with. Three taps on the cup with the spoon and BAM, the lead character hit the deck harder than an axe hits a block of wood and I was genuinely taken aback with the acting, the story line and most of all.. The score, it helped make the movie what it is. Trust me, you'll understand when you watch it. I know I'll be watching it again, very soon. I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil it too much for others but I rate this film 9, I think there could have been a little more to the film, in the basement part of the movie but I felt the movie was incredible."

","Instead of spoiling anything, I just feel like telling you a story of mine considering race. I have myself been working with movies, and one experience I have is how I needed to find a better lighting guy. You see, as soon as we put a black person in front of the screen, the lighting guy just didn't know what to DO. It wasn't about race or anything, he just couldn't figure out how to make the lighting look good on any black actress. It just didn't work on screen. Now I have been waiting for this movie forever, and I am a white privileged man –however white trash-but I live in a racist underdeveloped country (Sweden, oh the irony) so I found it necessary this morning to just download a shitty cam version of it, and all I can think of is how beautifully lit it is even on a cam version, how the light reflects so well on those ebony bodies even in the dark scenes, their white teeth, their genetic frame and whoops we are back into race again. This movie is very subtle, but always constant, in its remarks on unconscious racism. The direction is ever so slightly off beat sometimes to be subtle, perhaps because it handles issues almost too absurd to handle,but it is truly on the top in the absurdist horror genre right up there with films such as It Follows, The Babadook, and Scream. What this film eventually does is asking the big questions, like where consciousness is even located, which made me respect the script even more. Big ups to Jordan Peele, I seriously didn't think he had this in him, except for the occasional brilliant Key and Peele sketches such as Lil' Homie. Give this nigga an Oscar already. Since these are big questions to handle it never gets too gory, and the slight nuances in the acting is superb. Catherine Keeners evil goddamn chuckle as we remember it from films such as Being John Malkovich is right on spot, and Dexter's sister is brilliant in voice control (the phone scene!). All this being said, there is a contraption men can wear nowadays that with small electrodes let you feel what it is like to have a vagina and go through a period. This movie is as close you can get (apart from wearing a blackface?) from understanding racial tension nowadays. An important and very entertaining movie. You got soul."

","Months before the official trailers were released someone sent me a trailer of this movie. After seeing that the writer and director was Jordan Peele I thought that it was a joke. Jordan Peele is a comedian so this must be some spoof trailer for his show Key and Peele. Then months passed and the official trailer was out. No. It's not a joke. This movie is very real and it's not a comedy. <br/><br/>A young black man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), goes to visit the parents of his white girlfriend, Rose (Alison Williams). Already tense enough due to the uncertainty of how his girlfriend's parents will receive him, he finds that many of Rose's parents make racially insensitive comments and the few other black people around behave very strangely. Just why they behave so strange is the mystery that Chris sets out to uncover.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't so much a horror as it was a thriller. It did have its jump scares and an eerie feel to it but I still wouldn't classify it as a scary movie. The performances were on point and the story itself was intriguing. This was a movie in which you could view for simple entertainment or look deeper and make parallels between it and real life. Already there are several articles pointing out some interesting symbolism.<br/><br/>I appreciated both: the entertainment value and some of the deeper meanings to the film. It was well thought out and mixed the pace quite nicely. There was a steady diet of mysterious content interspersed with genuine comedy with a blanket of creepiness over the entire dish. Jordan Peele just made himself a legitimate player in the writing and directing game."
"justinwfirestone","8","8","18","5 March 2017"," Not as subversive as hyped
","As a Key & Peele fan, I'm guessing my reaction to hearing Jordan Peele had written and directed a horror movie was similar to other fans' reactions: ""Oh, hell no!"" or ""Oh, brother!""<br/><br/>Then it was hyped as ""100% Fresh"" according to the illustrious Tomatometer, forcing my hand into getting out into a movie theater to get Get Out. Get Out, a simple title, brings the issue up front: people who endure racial discrimination might feel a need to leave but often do not have a viable option.<br/><br/>Other critics have championed Get Out by comparing it to John Carpenter's They Live, or even The Stepford Wives. That's going far too far. They Live will endure as a classic criticism of capitalism. To be blunt, Get Out is not that iconic or special. It is, however, an important reminder that progressive white America does not have a realistic understanding of what racial discrimination is or feels like. ""I'm not racist"" sounds trite, just as trite as a majority group's opinion on whether or not any particular behavior or attitude is racist.<br/><br/>LilRel Howery steals the show every time he appears, especially when he warns his friend about becoming a sex slave. Progressive whites are probably more worried about losing wifi connectivity or a coupon expiring. The bourgeois teacup and teaspoon become a weapon. Salvation comes from cell-phone flashes.<br/><br/>In Get Out, nothing is as what it seems. It is not as much about racism, but pointing out we often fail to recognize it."

For example, we don't know where organs of black people go they just tend to disappear. I.E. Kendrick Johnson.

The storyline is genius and relevant, while the dialogue is witty and eerie. The film seems to be more of a comedy than a horror, but that's what makes it so scary. ""Get Out"" has an excellent way of making the viewer feel uncomfortable about societies cultural appropriation. The cinematography is clean, sharp, and satisfying. The film's score is definitely one of my favorites. American composer, Michael Abels, is what holds the film together the whole way through. Included in the score, there's some blues, folk, rap, and traditional African chant. The cast was great and genuinely captured the films flow. The relationship between Chris and his best friend Rod was perfect and refreshing—they had the audience cheering from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the film, but it was way too predictable for me. Twenty minutes in, I already knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to end. I only wish that they kept the concept more on the subtle side and harder to predict. Nothing makes me love a film more than its twists and turns, but unfortunately, ""Get Out"" didn't have any of that. Aside from its predictability, I loved everything else about it. It seems to be a modern-day version of ""The Skeleton Key"" meshed with the satire from ""The Visit"". <br/><br/>This is 100% a must watch. <br/><br/>8/10"

"Quinoa1984","10","11","28","17 March 2017"," watch it twice
","It's a good idea to see Get Out twice. The first time you experience the film much the same way the main character does, as in any thriller where we are looking at things through the protagonists eyes - the best comparison I can make is to how Roman Polanski does this in his films, not just Rosemary's Baby (though this is what is closest to in horror movie spirit) but also Chinatown and The Ghost Writer, with the sense of oddness and outsider-ness becoming clearer with each encounter - and while there are some surprising revelations there's a greater sense of 'Oh, I hope what I actually suspect about this supporting character isn't true... oh, but it is, so why is he/she acting this way'. The last act is the most conventional as far as where it needs to go as a horror film, but the intensity comes more from character revelations and interactions, the meat of the drama in the suspense of who the 'other' is and what information is being withheld from us (also Hitchcock comes to mind as the typical but surefire comparison). Also, it's entertaining as all hell.<br/><br/>The second time, you get to experience things in a different way and can try to spot subtler things, or moments that reveal things that are curious. For example, after the main couple Chris and Rose hit the deer, two things: 1) does Peele mean for the deer to be analogous to our protagonist, the old ""deer in the headlights"" bit? Or is it something to do with the roadkill aspect, or how a deer is used as a prop (we see this later in the basement level of the house). 2) that scene with the cop, where he asks Chris for his ID. What I wondered this time was not if Chris ever experienced this before, which he clearly has (it's a given for practically every black man or woman in this country when it comes to dealing with the police *at their best*), but if Rose has. Is she doing what she does in front of this cop, acting in the credulous ""WTF Cop?!"" manner to get on Chris's good side, or is she genuinely posing the white, ignorant-innocent side of it where, hey, you shouldn't have to do something that's unfair, like, c'mon, you know? Although Rose ends up (spoiler) being an extremely deceitful character - she's a pro at what she does, we later learn, which is both expected but kind of a bummer - this interaction with the cop feels genuine... or is it? There's a surface level part of it and a lower level that could be dissected further, but I'll leave others to speculate.<br/><br/>Another thing along these lines is the brother character Jeremy, played with a special level of sleaze (like out of an exploitation film, or even blaxploitation like one of those white villains in the 70's movies) by Caleb Landry Jones. He's the only white person who doesn't put on an air of sophistication - even Stephen Root, who may be the one who can try to talk without some level of condescension, is still part of the ""system"" that is controlling and enslaving blacks - but while Jeremy doesn't come out and just say it (he can't because, you know, story reasons) - and it makes for an interesting dynamic. He doesn't have many scenes, but those few he has stands out; among the whole white cast he's the one who isn't a phony, or at least he's not exactly putting on an 'act' like those at the white auction party midway through the film. You (or at least I) can feel the contempt he has for Chris right away. It may arguably be too much, like it's giving too much away how there's something not right with him, and it's different than with the Walter and Georgina characters. <br/><br/>The second time around too the best friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery, who is mostly a stand up comic, and it kind of feels it) worked better for me. He was funny and a good presence the first time, but I also wondered if it felt not tonally consistent with the rest of the film (not that it's jarring in the sense of completely taking me out of it, clearly in the quasi-conventional sense as a script, Chris needs a best friend character), but that his humor was a different tone than that of the rest of the movie. However he is integral to the plot, at least to an extent (Chris may be one segment of the audience, but Rod are the ones who will talk at the screen - and at times in this movie it's not completely wrong to do so, depending on the crowd one's with), and I found him funnier the second time too; he is a capable person and is not dumb, which is refreshing in any thriller/horror movie. There are no dumb characters here, only characters who know more than what's going on at times than others, and that can make for a compelling film when done right.<br/><br/>Get Out is a movie that is familiar in its construction in some ways, but is completely fresh in execution, with its sense of surrealism - the ""Sunken Place"" feels like it could've been an element out of Under the Skin's ""Other"" place - its befuddlement as much as rage at such a system that in many ways is analogous to how whites have treated blacks over the past centuries (whether as actual slaves or as the servants that are seen here), and that it is as sharp and vicious a social satire as George Romero at his best, not to mention every performance firing on all cylinders (Williams and Keener by the way have a lot of subtlety to explore on a second go around)."

"adrianasiwy","9","6","13","6 March 2019"," Keeps your head spinning until the final act.
","Jordan Peele's Get Out is a new take on a classic story. Get Out takes this approach to examine the state of racism in our so called ""post-racism"" society. From the very start of the film, a sense of uneasiness is present in the main character, Chris. This uneasiness is maintained and heightened as events unfold. Viewers are set into a cycle of uncertainty, fear, and momentary relief; they are pressed with visceral feelings that accumulate as the story unfolds. You really don't know what is going on until the final act of the film where the curtains fly open. The mis-en-scene of every scene is dramatically important; we are given clues of the future from the very start of the film. There are times where a seemingly meaningless joke has tremendous implications. The deep web of foreshadowing can only be appreciated after subsequent viewings.<br/><br/>Of course a riveting story is important, but so is the cinematography and sound. Peele's use of zooms, extreme close ups, high angles, low angles, create a collage of scenes that are laid out beautifully on-screen. These techniques enhance the viewer experience and improves storytelling. Sounds are equally important. The phenomenal score bounced between moments of silence and intense, heart wrenching music. The dialogue and acting are both very fluid and the script never stops impressing. Most importantly however, is the use of dietetic sound for storytelling. The main characters experience important moments of sound that impact their state of mind in the scene.<br/><br/>Overall the film leaves almost nothing to be desired; it is a journey that ends on a very satisfying note."
"dave-mcclain","9","8","19","4 March 2017"," ""Get Out"" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film.
","Writers are told ""write what you know"". For Jordan Peele, that meant writing (and directing) 2017's ""Get Out"" (R, 1:43), but also stretching significantly as an artist. Half of the Comedy Central comic duo of Key and Peele, Peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of The Second City improv troupe and MADtv. The product of an interracial marriage, much of Peele's comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the U.S., while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues. His talent and insight have earned him nominations for the Emmy Award and NAACP Image Award (multiple times each – including one Emmy win, an American Comedy Award and a Peabody Award for accomplishments in public media). Peele has also appeared in films (including 2016's ""Keanu"", with comedy partner Keegan-Michael Peele), television shows and internet videos. All of those experiences serve him well in ""Get Out"", a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world, but is actually more horror film than anything else.<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a New York City photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), in order to meet her parents for the first time. Chris is nervous about how Rose's parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and Chris' buddy, TSA agent Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), teases him over the phone about the situation. Rose reassures Chris that her parents are very liberal and open-minded. As Rose predicted, her father, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), welcome Chris with open arms.<br/><br/>It turns out that they are not racist, but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants, both of whom are black. Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid, both act so politely that it seems phony to Chris, not to mention that they both speak very strangely. When Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), shows up for dinner, he is even rougher around the edges than his parents. Things get even more uncomfortable for Chris when an annual gathering at the Armitage home introduces Chris to a host of rich white people much like Rose's parents (except for a blind art dealer played by Stephen Root), while one older woman is married to a young black man (LaKeith Stanfield) who looks vaguely familiar to Chris, but who doesn't act anything like the black men that Chris knows from back in his native Brooklyn.<br/><br/>But it's not just the way everyone acts that makes Chris uncomfortable – it's also the things that are happening around him. A police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats Chris like he did something wrong, even though he wasn't driving at the time. Missy, who is a psychiatrist, voices her strong opposition to Chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing Chris in order to help him break the habit, even after Chris turns down her offer. She also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood. Chris talks to Rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then Chris starts finding his phone unplugged. It also turns out that Rose hasn't been entirely forthcoming about her dating history. I'd like to say more, but I won't because, as much as I've already written, there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film. Although admittedly influenced by ""The Stepford Wives"", what happens in this movie and why it's happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in America, even from sympathetic and well-meaning people and groups. In fact, it's easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism, but generally, as a Movie Fan, I see it mainly as a well-crafted horror film. There's a certain creepiness about it that starts early, and then slowly, steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals. Some of the plot points strain scientific credulity, but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy. The film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted. There's also some funny, effective and well-placed comic relief (from Howery's character). That's to be expected from someone like Jordan Peele, but who knew that he would be so good at horror? This movie feels like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better films, with a strong subtext of social commentary. For so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them, this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of ""A""."

","Is Get Out Changing the Future of Horror Flicks?<br/><br/>I know the media makes it seem like many white people are scared of darker skin people. On the other hand, there is an equal amount of fear. Some darker skin people are actually afraid of Caucasians. <br/><br/>Now I've never really been that kind of personbecause of all those white women! Horniness will overcome fear. Yeah that's right, I've been up in that game before! I'm just kidding. But in all seriousness, I've never really been afraid of someone just because of the color of their skin. Unless I'm in the middle of a Neo – Nazi rally or a Klan meeting, I don't think I have much to be afraid of. <br/><br/>But for a lot of brothers and sisters out there, being the only person of color in a large group can be a little mysterious at times. A lot of things can come across your mind if you are put into that situation. Such as, ""What happened to everyone else? Am I though token? Are these people going to kill me?"" and that is exactly what goes through the mind of our main character Chris. <br/><br/>""So how long has this been going on — this  thang?"" <br/><br/>When Chris comes across Rose's parents, played by Bradley Whitford (Billy Madison, The Cabin in the Woods) and Catherine Keener (Capote, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) let's just say Rose's parents are acting a little off the wall, they're simply acting f*ckin' weird. <br/><br/>I can see where this movie might anger some people. Mainly because it deals with race, race issues, social issues, and other heavy topics. On the other hand, if you truly see this movie, and open your mind, you'll see that this movie is one of the best horror films/comedies in a really long time. I absolutely had a terrific time seeing this in theaters, and I think most people are loving this film right here.<br/><br/>I'm just gonna dive into it, and give you the inside scoop. The movie does a remarkable job at building up tension. It starts off with an awkward encounter with Rose's parents. Then things really flip a switch. It's bloody, scary, violent, has social commentary and it all works. The humor works, the horror works, and the thriller ride is a real journey. The movie is really a great mix up of different genres in one. Later on in the film, we are introduced again to Chris' best friend, Rod, played by Lil Rel Howery (The Carmichael Show).<br/><br/>T.S. Motherf*ckin' A Saves the Day!<br/><br/>Rod truly is the comedy gold of this movie. Everything from his theory on Chris becoming a sex slave for these people to him believing he is the baddest T.S.A. officer on the block. <br/><br/>In a way, I feel like Rod was the character that can relate to the audience. Meaning Rod ask Chris what we would ask our friend if they were put in that situation. Such as, ""How are you not scared of this?"" Speaking of people in the theater, this audience was really passionate, having fun, and really enjoying the movie from start to finish. People in the theater were clapping, cheering, screaming, and this is the type of film that made an audience come to life. One young lady was sitting next to me, and she tapped me, a total stranger, and said to me with a mouth full of popcorn and shiny buttered lips, ""Damn this movie is hella good!""<br/><br/>Hence, the writing, the directing, and the direction is all very artistic, fun, relatable, and I had a great time with this movie. I actually can't wait to see this movie again. When it comes to a perfect blend of horror and comedy, this is what Kevin Smith's Tusk film should have been like. <br/><br/>The comedy doesn't feel forced, it has great tension, an original story, has a message, and there is not one dull point in this movie. I believe Get Out earns<br/><br/>9.5 Out of 10!<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen Get Out, what are you still doing reading this review? Get out and go see Get Out. <br/><br/>""So how long has this been going on — this  thang?"" Long enough for me to close the book on this review for now and possibly get back up in the game of some pretty white women. I'll take the risk. Until next time, thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all get out and have an amazing day as always. :)"

","Get Out - I genuinely had no idea what to expect with this one. It's a horror movie, but it's written and directed by one of the Key & Peele guys. And I'm not gonna lie, I thought it might end up being a white-bashing couple of hours based on one of the trailers. But it turned out to be a very solid horror flick. The main actor, Daniel Kaluuya, I had only seen on the English show Black Mirror (which is incredible by the way) so seeing him in this type of American role was quite a shift. He does extraordinarily well, showing a wide range of different emotions. And finally I can report that an accent was done well! I never heard him drop out of it. Race definitely plays a big role, but it's not presented in a vicious way. It more just shows the constant foot-in-mouth moments of white people when they're around African Americans. Rather than a hateful approach to the divide, it takes an honest route and pokes fun at it. The movie's theme and underlying story of course go deeper than this, showing the first time director's ability to get this across without just having the white people shouting the n word to show us they're the villains. A smart, creepy, and satisfying social commentary. 8/10."

You know them, the self-righteous, soft bigot of low expectations, ""I love and want to protect the negro because he's helpless and a victim"" type who treat skin color (outside of whites) as a segregated group and assign stereotypical attributes to those groups based on what they classify them as, both physically and intellectually And in this film they really do want to ""take care"" of blacks, it's nothing personal mind you, just that your ""blackness is cool and trendy"" so we want a piece of it...after all we're your friends. Not a lot of biting social commentary as suggested but more a creepy fish out of water film until the last 40 minutes and then it starts to get freaky.<br/><br/>It's not really that original, sort of a flipped around version of The Skeleton Key blended with The Stepford Wives with a Guess Who's Coming To Dinner social structure. Worth a look, but I'd suggest you wait for the DVD."

"thecamillocienfuegos","7","3","5","17 March 2019"," Highly entertaining bit of 'wokesploitation' with some questionable subtexts
","As a latecomer to this movie I had heard many things, mostly good. And in general those positive reviews were confirmed. But I found the film's sub-textual commentary on race-relations was deeply pessimistic in a way that seemed to exploit, rather than contribute to, the present resurgence of popular awareness and debate around the issue.<br/><br/>The plot, as one expects even of the best horror flicks, is fairly perfunctory and predictable. How would you imagine it might turn out? Everyone who at a glance seems sweet and harmless turn out to be cartoonishly evil murderers.<br/><br/>Some people seem to blame the writer/director Jordan Peele for the fact that all the said awful evil-doers are white, while the only two fully human characters are black. Personally I see nothing implicitly wrong with that. I mean, it is a horror version of Meet the Parents, so what do you expect?<br/><br/>What I do question is the use of the device, repeated several times in the course of the film, of setting up one of the white characters as a real person who might actually have some genuine sympathy for our black protagonist, only to reveal that in fact this ostensible 'white saviour' is just as bad - worse in fact - than the worst of the obviously racist and evil antagonists.<br/><br/>First we have the family, who present as progressive middle-class liberals who just happen to have some black staff. This one is a no-brainer: the genre demand that they be secretly evil.
Then there is the girlfriend, who is presented as a more genuinely open mind who clearly (if belatedly) sees the racial prejudices lurking beneath the surface of her parents' enlightened facade. Again her eventual flip is genre-appropriate and indeed quite central to the plot. But the subtext here is decidedly more questionable than in the parents' case.
Finally there is the blind photography expert (yes you read that right). Here is someone who is literally colourblind, and who, when we first see him, expresses admiration for the protagonist not because of his ""genetic makeup"" or any other dodgy post-imperial concept, but simply because he respects him as a photographer. Yet when we next see this character, he is literally buying the body of the protagonist whose mind he so admires. Ostensibly he wants the hero's 'eye', in the sense of ability to spot a good photo, but given that the procedure involves a full frontal lobotomy one would think that there would be some legitimate questions to ask about which part of the brain photographic genius actually resides in.<br/><br/>But ultimately such questions do not matter, they are not the point. As in any standard-issue horror flick, these characters' ostensible personal qualities are just shallow facades setting up the later scary twist. But... using complicated and sensitive racial issues to set up crude and violent thrills is... well... exploitation. That is, to be more precise, (and I'm going to credit myself with coining this term,) wokesploitation.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, this movie is funny, entertaining, well directed and acted. But it also exploits difficult topics that demand sensitive and intelligent treatment for crass thrills. Whether this is justified or not is open to question. Personally I enjoyed this, just like I enjoyed the movie Shaft. But in both cases I only enjoyed them if they were kept firmly in the box marked ""light entertainment"", because when you start reflecting too deeply on the subtext, it starts to feel a little bit wrong."

","Usually when a movie is very hyped there's a chance it disappoints you, but that's not the case with Get Out. Everyone's been talking about how brilliant Jordan Peele is, and I have to agree.<br/><br/>The very first thing I have to say is I can't believe Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut. The film show such profound understanding of cinema, that many directors don't grasp even though they've done more films than Peele. Also Peele's done some very thorough work. I saw this movie last night and I'm only know writing this review, but during this time I've procrastinated I've re- realised so many moments and details of this movie. They weren't details that made no sense, they were details that either seemed like just an addition to the story or just the kind of stuff you usually have in this genre. The movie itself was completely amazing, but the more I keep thinking about this, the more I'm convinced Jordan Peele is a god damn genius.<br/><br/>All the ingredients of an amazing film are here. The pacing is amazing, so is the build up. The story is detailed, characters carefully planned and multi-dimensional. The soundtrack is incredible and haunting, and it definitely helps to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Get Out also has everything you need from the horror genre. The way the story and the horror progress is amazing and close to perfection. It's just unnerving, then turns into something really disturbing, then turns into absolutely terrifying. All the good elements are there: psychological horror, mind control (or hypnotism) and blood. Also they have manage to keep the audience absolutely excited during the whole thing. <br/><br/>Some of the white audience have been angry at the racism aspect though. But it shouldn't be hard to understand why the white people in this movie are so terrifying. <br/><br/>Get Out is absolutely brilliant movie, and without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen."

Their films continue to make bank at the box office, but the diversity of their horror features are nothing to scoff at either. Just in the last few years alone they've made films like The Gift, The Visit, Split, and now Get Out. All original twists on the horror/thriller genre. Get Out may be the most impressive yet.<br/><br/>I always talk about my disconnect with the horror genre and how I don't find much substance with 75% of the films. Get Out turns the genre on its head, doesn't rely on jump scares, is surrounded by tremendous performances, and has a socially relevant script. It is so rare for a film to have a socially relevant message without feeling too political or one sided. I can't tell you how many times I've appreciated what a film or a TV show is saying, but I get turned off by the way it's portrayed. Get Out manages to make an entertaining horror/thriller, while also commenting on unintentional and benevolent racism coming from a white family towards their daughter's new boyfriend, an African American.<br/><br/>It's the racism most people don't normally think about. The people who say they aren't racist because they ""voted for Barack Obama"" or maybe because ""Tiger Woods is their favorite athlete"". Films like 12 Years of Slave and the recent documentary, 13th, are important. But it's films like Get Out that are more effective because they are giving the same message in a different way.

"poopfock","6","8","20","10 March 2017"," Competent mystery/suspense (not horror), but missed the opportunity to subvert stereotyping.
","I don't get why this is being labeled as ""horror"" when it's clearly mystery/suspense movie. There's literally no horror about it. I can agree with most assessments that it's rather original for the most part, though I'm not sure I'm in the boat with the idea that it's the most amazing thing ever or anything...but then again, I'm the guy who didn't think The Babadook or It Follows were all that great either so I'm not quite as easily won over as most people seem to be these days when it comes to these kinds of ""horror"" movies. This was definitely leaps and bounds better than the aforementioned movies, but it still left a bit to be desired for me. For what it is, it's a very competent movie, but I do wish some of the mystery was allowed to sit before making certain aspects obvious as soon as they did. I had it figured out pretty far before the halfway point, but had they not pointed certain things out so early, it might not have been so easy. I just think they leaned a bit too far with the wink & nod 'hinting' at what was to come and made it too obvious. <br/><br/>I did like that the main guy wasn't a completely oblivious moron, which was nice. Unfortunately, I think that's what was a bit of the problem up front, because it was his lack of obviousness that lead to those ""hey something isn't right here"" moments early on that basically headed up those winks & nods being too obvious. That, or the case could be argued that the signs themselves were too obvious that even a normal acting character would have picked up on them as much as I did. In either case, they could have been much more coy about it as not to spoil the twist too early. There are also some horror tropes that eked their way in on occasion, especially at the end where they employed the 'bad guy coming back' thing which is pretty tired.<br/><br/>Complaints aside, it's actually a pretty good movie. I just want to dispel some of the hype that it's some kind of special, flawless godsend. It's a very competent mystery suspense, and there are some excellent comedy moments that managed to find their way in (seems Peele just couldn't help himself from doing what he does best). I don't think it's going to be a classic that I re-watch probably ever, but it's definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>Side notes: If you're black, you may find this hits closer to home to you if you feel like you're marginalized by society and don't take well to slavery type movies. If you're white and easily offended you'll probably want to skip it because it does make white people the rich out-of-touch bad guys, and it does kind of touch on slavery more than a couple of times. I don't fit into either of those boats (I loved both Free State of Jones and the 2016 Birth of a Nation) but it's definitely something that is there, so just keep that in mind if you're that kind of person. There was a guy next to me who was kind of upset most of the film (that and he couldn't stay off his phone), and lots of murmuring and shifting in seats all around the theater so both a good chunk of both black and white were uncomfortable during the film. If you want to see this and not be uncomfortable in public, you may want to wait for home release.<br/><br/>There are also a lot of stereotypes going on here on both sides. White people envy black people for being so cool, and athletic. Black people don't trust shifty old whitey. Thinking back at watching it, I really wish more time was spent dispelling some of the stereotyping they did. I mean, in the beginning it felt like they were doing that, but then it devolved into being more stereotyped as it went...ultimately making it that white people are all purposely out to steal how cool and athletic black people are. To some degree, I imagine it's supposed to be satire, but I can see where this movie is going to cause controversy because if the satire is meant to be there, it's not particularly obvious.<br/><br/>****SPOILER AREA****<br/><br/>I really really was hoping that the daughter wasn't in on it. It would have kept the whole thing feeling so much more fresh than what it ended up being. The idea that just because they're family and white doesn't mean she has to be in on it too, and just another crazy white person who wants to be black. If they just made her the city girl, who got away from her family, and didn't spend a lot of time with them - the outcast if you will - who loves black people for a different reason other than just wanting to brainwash them and steal their lifestyle, then it would have been so much more refreshing.<br/><br/>Specifically, the moment this movie could have taken the high road would be the end. Guy finds her pics of past boyfriends, and they could have left out the ""slaves"" at the house from the box of photos and let the audience just SUSPECT that she was in on it...then when she's looking for the keys, the brother could have conked her out or restrained her, having her vocalize ""Mom? Dad? What the hell is going on?!"" before getting tied up or knocked out.<br/><br/>It would have been much better that way. It really would have."

It's much better than this. Or maybe it's just me as I'm a white bloke and I didn't get the message. So let's try to analyse this thing and maybe find something good in this film. First of all even though I'm white I got few black people in my family so I know from my uncle a little bit about racism and it's form's and how it affected people back in the day. I'm racist as any other person so please stop kidding yourself you're not. We all got our prejudice in one form or the other. People that will tell me otherwise are the ones I'm afraid off. Since we got that said let's talk about this movie. WARNING SPOILER AHEAD If it was made the other way around: black people luring white people to hypnotise them and transplant brains into new Caucasian hosts lawsuit's would follow. But because its complete opposite not one critic gave this movie a bad review? Why the hell not. I've seen movies smashed by critics that I've enjoyed so much (United States of Leeland, Fight Club, The Thing, Stay, The New Guy, London, Dracula 2000 not to mention Apocalypse Now or Blade Runner) so why everyone is praising this crap is beyond my mental capacity (unless lots of money in bribes was involved and threats that there will be a black dude waiting for you if you say something wrong - because let's face it racial stereotypes are still there and this movie will only ad more venom to this already long outstanding issue). I'm also struggling to figure out what's the target audience for this thing. My uncle that's 66 thought it's utterly crap be he enjoyed white people being killed for most of the time instead of usual black victims so just for that it gets 1 star (i thought it's stupid and since main character is black.who else can he kill?) but hey I will listen to someone who's way older then I am even if he's black and I'm white. My cousin however loved it very much but he's 17 so my guess is that this hybrid of sorts target audience are young black adults with all rage that they have inside them against the (white) corrupted system. When i was younger my rage was let loose on punk rock concerts and picking fights with natzi pric@# afterwards. But it looks like each generation got its own way's to let out some steam. And colour of your skin is also a factor in doing so. Or its just that racist inside me that thinks so."

The strangeness of the characters is a dead giveaway early on and the willingness of the hero to subject himself to their whims seems altogether false.

It is a perfect combination of horror and dark humour; with an underlying symbolic meaning that lingers in the mind for days (all without being too preachy). From the opening scene to the last, the film is utterly captivating. The cast is spot on. If you liked ""Drag Me To Hell"" (2009), you'll love this!"
"MaximumMadness","9","7","17","4 March 2017"," ""Get Out""- A genuinely entertaining and oft-thrilling horror-comedy filled to burst with strong social satire.
","From the mind of comedic genius Jordan Peele comes ""Get Out"", a new horror-comedy that delivers the laughs and thrills at a mile-a- minute and generally excels in every department despite a few minor hiccups in the pacing department. Horror and comedy are very unique and strangely similar genres- both very much based on instinctual and visceral reactions (the tendency to fear in terrible situations and the desire to laugh), and it's always a pleasure to see a film that combines them so well together. Add in a dash of all-too-real social satire regarding subliminal racism, and you got one of the better mainstream creep- shows in recent time!<br/><br/>The excellent Daniel Kaluuya and delightful Allison Williams star as Chris and Rose, an interracial couple preparing to spend their first weekend together with Rose's parents. While Chris has some minor worries about what they'll say about their daughter dating a black man, for the most part things seem more- or-less ordinary when the first arrive, save for Rose's father Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) trying a bit too condescendingly hard to be a ""cool"" and ""open-minded"" guy (""You know, I would have voted for Obama a third time!""; ""So, how long has this THANG been going on?"") and his psychiatrist wife Missy (Catherine Keener) pressuring Chris to stop smoking for health- reasons. But things quickly start to go a little... strange. Especially when it comes to the Armitage's black servants Walter and Georgina (Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel) acting increasingly out-of-the- ordinary and Missy's push to try and use hypnosis to ""cure"" Chris' smoking habits. And soon enough, Chris will discover that despite the idyllic facade crafted by the Armitage household, there are dark secrets hidden away within the home that could spell doom for he and Rose...<br/><br/>Peele proves a more than capable first-time director in this spine- tingling tale, and he loving pays homage to a number of the genre classics that have obviously inspired him while never going to far as to lose originality. With shades of everything from ""The Stepford Wives"" to ""Night of the Living Dead"", Peele is obviously an affectionate fan of old-school horror, and weaves in subtle and rewarding parallels that other fans might pick up on. His eye for composition is quite stirring and I was really taken by some genuinely effective uses of extreme wide and extreme closeups that pleasantly reminded me of some of the greats like Hitchcock and even Sergio Leone in a few key moments. I also appreciated his general sense of deliberation... Peele doesn't feel the need the throw in loud stingers and non-stop jumps to jolt the audience into paying attention. He knows atmosphere is key.<br/><br/>The script is a great deal of fun, and Peele's handling of characters and the subtle racism of old-school societal expectation leads to many moments of pure gold. While he never lets up on the ever-growing and slowly-building sense of tension and intrigue, he injects just enough humor of the film (much of which relates to a delightful character played by Lil Rel Howery) to give the audience breathing room and supply some genuine laughs. The fun that's had with social satire (especially about subtle racism) is a breath of fresh air and adds quite a bit of depth to the film's story. When Chris is told that his being black is ""fashionable"" and ""in"" nowadays by a character who is trying to be nice to him (despite dehumanizing him into little more than a fashion statement), you can't help but both laugh and cringe a little on the inside because you definitely know that's the sort-of thing that all too many people hear in the real world.<br/><br/>The cast is just perfect. Kaluuya is endlessly likable and plays his lead role in a very thoughtful way. You always get the sense that there's a lot going on beneath the surface, even when he tries to play it cool for the sake of his relationship, and there's a lot of really nice moments that delve into his past that give Kaluuya some good material to sink his teeth into. Williams is sweet and likable. I've only really been familiar with her through her singing and music, so it was a very pleasant surprise to see her stretch her acting chops in such a good role. Keener and Whitford are phenomenal in their roles and have a ton of great moments. While you know something is definitely up with them... you haven't seen the half of it until you've seen the film. And supporting roles by the likes of Howery, Henderson and Gabriel (and even a small cameo-role by the great Stephen Root) are exceptionally well played.<br/><br/>Really, the only thing holding the film back from attaining a perfect 10 from me are some very troubling issues I took with the pacing and structure in the film's second half. Whereas most films tend to outstay their welcome and go on for a bit too long... I felt ""Get Out"" was perhaps about 10 minutes too short, and the third act in particular rockets by in a way that made it lose some of its impact for me. There's also a few jarring scene transitions in the moments leading up to the climax that felt inorganic, which also hurt it. The film really has an ideal first two acts... and merely a pretty decent, but not quite great finale.<br/><br/>Still, I can't do anything but give Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" the highest of recommendations. It's already one of my favorite films of the year, and I can't wait to see it again and again.<br/><br/>I give it an excellent 9 out of 10."

"drawlife","9","7","17","4 March 2017"," GET OUT and see the film!
","Seriously, if you've pondered on whether seeing the film or not, please do yourself a favor and go see it. It's worth the admission. <br/><br/>Jordan Peele, known for Key & Peele makes an excellent first impression in his directorial debut. He brings a fresh take on typical horror movies, implementing the obvious, but subtle racial tension and sharp satirical wit. <br/><br/>A young African-American man named Chris visits his girlfriend Rose's mysterious Caucasian family estate, and from there on a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined. <br/><br/>In most horror films guys like Chris, exceptionally played by Daniel Kaluuya, end up dead really quick. It's an overused cliché, but it is reversed in this film, and to see an African-American male protagonist front and center is a nice change of pace within the horror genre. <br/><br/>What's also great is that the film showcases his paranoia, he knows something is up, he's not blind to it. He makes the smart decisions and plays it cool, he isn't some dumb protagonist ready to be next on the chopping block. Kaluuya is great at playing a doomed man who thinks he's in control of the entire situation. On the surface he looks confident and at ease, as he has sharp eyes taking notes on everyone's behavior and it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is odd. You're never quite sure what's going on at the girlfriend's home, whether everyone's involved in some sinister plot or if its just some awkward misunderstanding. But it's clear that something is happening, and Chris is the most normal person here, and as the audience member we're not given any reason to doubt him.<br/><br/>Kaluuya also has great chemistry with Allison Williams who portrays his girlfriend Rose. They both get to showcase their moments as a couple together very well, and I'm quite positive they'll get more recognition into furthering their careers. <br/><br/>The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date. Caleb Landry Jones also has an appropriately, intensely edgy role, a tad bit over the top I might add. Whenever the film needs a short moment of humor, a lot of the film's levity comes from Lil Rel Howery as Rod, Chris' best friend. <br/><br/>In some areas, the film does take its time to get things going, but Peele strategically knows where to add elements into the film to build up the tension. For example he knows where to showcase creepy sound effects and music cues. He successfully increases the level of anxiety, relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eye. It is reminiscent in the ways of a Hitchcock or Kubrick film.<br/><br/>Get Out embraces the stereotypes and embraces them very well. Social commentary is very relevant and poignant in the film. Peele allows the viewer to see prejudice head on. When all is said and done, you now have a bird's eye view of what is really wrong with society. The film definitely shines light on the aspect of ourselves that a lot of us would rather not acknowledge or be in denial of. As much as we try to convince ourselves that we're above forming preconceptions and stereotyping, we aren't. Peele uses this as a tool to bleed out anxiety and tension which very much fuels the entire film. <br/><br/>All the slow build up leads to one of the most satisfying climaxes I've seen in a while in a horror film. Peele is the true star of this film. He brings a distinctive visual style, carving out the film's creative path with some dark reveals, addresses the variable levels of racism with subtly, pays homage to some great horror films, and at times very humorous as well.<br/><br/>There have been some quality horror films of this era, Sinister, Paranormal Activity(not the cash grab sequels), The Conjuring, Lights Out, but Get Out is one of those horror films that is intellectually engaging and self-aware. For me it ranks up there with Scream and Cabin in the Woods. <br/><br/>9/10"
"greggs_nbacon","9","7","17","2 March 2017"," An All Time Great Horror Comedy
","I always say that horror and comedy have a very thin divide between them. In both genres, you are trying to get an extreme reaction out of your audience, whether it be laughs or screams. This may be why writer/director Jordan Peele, half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, was able to make such a smart and well-executed horror/comedy.<br/><br/>Get Out has a simple premise. A black man falls a white girl, and goes to meet her family. He is nervous about her family's reaction due to the fact that his girlfriend has never dated a black man. As he goes from his comfortable urban setting to the country bumpkin locale of her family's home, he begins to feel unsettled by her family's attitude, and the behavior of all of the African Americans in the area. There are multiple ways in which Jordan Peele deals with modern racism that incredibly intelligent.<br/><br/>Some of the all-time great horror films have dealt with race as a subtext. Both Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of Dead have subliminal racial contexts that take some reading into. Get Out brings race issues into the forefront as the central conflict of the plot. As we of course understand, racism has quite changed since 1968 and 1978, when the first two Dead movies were made. In Get Out, the subtle racism of modern is depicted. The details of this film are what make it executed so well. Throughout the film, small little allusions to stereotypes to slavery are a constant throughout the film, if you are perceptive enough to pick up on them. Peele said that he wanted to make a movie we would all want to watch twice, and he definitely succeeded with his precise placements of minuscule, but important details. Many times, statements we make, we truly do not believe they are racist, even though we are trying to connect and relate to another human being. This film brings these to the forefront, to be examined by its audience. also, the film challenges the stereotypical role of the African American man in the horror movie and tries to change this context within the bounds of the film. <br/><br/>What really helps Get Out is getting Oscar and Golden Globe nominees like Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, as well as rising stars like Allison Williams and Lakeith Stanfield in your horror movie. Many times, studios are just concerned about how they can make a movie for as small of a budget as possible so they can maximize profit. The studio is not concerned usually how good the movie is, as long as it makes money. these shoe string budgets usually do not have the room for great talent in front of, or behind the camera. Maybe Get Out can prove to studios that this talent is necessary to make the horror film great again. as a sidenote, I love that some old white studio heads had to approve a lashing criticism of the subtle racism of white people. Viscerally, it appeals to me for some reason. <br/><br/>Get Out has put itself among the all-time horror greats while being intellectually engaging, and roaringly funny. This probably the best horror comedy since Cabin in the Woods. If a movie makes you hate the ways of the race you were born as by the time the credits role, it has succeeded in its purpose."
"matthewssilverhammer","10","7","17","2 March 2017"," ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and Probably Never Leaving""
","For some, there's really nothing more terrifying than a gaggle of well-to-do and overly polite white people. In Get Out (or ""Guess Who's Coming DinnerAnd Possibly Never Leaving""), comedian-turned-director Peele makes this abundantly clear, reminding us that racism often doesn't show up in outwardly obvious hatred, but in an insidious need to understand and control ""the other"". With breathtaking moments of social adeptness (Kaluuya's dealings with cops), terrifying realizations, hilarious satire and even some Django-esque wish-fulfilment, Get Out is as refreshingly thoughtful as it is enveloping. Chris (Kaluuya) , a young black photographer, is going on a trip with his white girlfriend (Williams) to meet her parents (Keener, Whitford). As the weekend unfolds, Chris becomes increasingly concerned about the intentions and history of his hosts. Kaluuya is great, leading with empathetic concerned but always present, and he's supported by some truly amazing actors and characters. Brilliantly written and executed, all confusions & questions are answered without being exposited. What's really fascinating though is this is the type of twist-inclined horror that Shyamalan (Sixth Sense) would drool over. However, the reveal is barely the point. Instead the focus is on straight-up weirdness in visuals and ideas that slow-burn from a calmly paced suspense drama into a raucous and insane mind-trip. It's such a confident debut for Peele in the director's seat: the editing and storytelling are clear, the visuals are striking but not obnoxious, the music is ominously perfect. He's clearly studied the masters (Lynch, Cronenberg, Hitchcock) and learned to allow his audience to be perplexed by while simultaneously sucking us right in. With this and Split, it's already looking to be a great year for horror."

","I loved this movie. Yes, it was very entertaining and funny, but that's not where my praise comes from. What I truly enjoyed about this movie was the complete turnaround of the dialog that was heard throughout when you later discover what is really going on. It does it's best to make you think it's about the subtle racism one feels or imagines when in a place filled with people of another race or culture not your own, and this movie does masterfully mislead you towards that all so familiar path that other like films do with a racist agenda.<br/><br/>However, there's a clever twist, for it to be about racism one group must feel superior, hate, or fear toward another, but the subject of the film was not about feelings of supremacy, nor other such malice towards another group but instead its envy. When this realization hits you, it makes you think about everything that was said before and find it was all along taking you to a different road entirely, and it was your own experiences whether it be from life experiences or agendas of other like movies that blinded you to where you were going. This introspective is what I found most amusing and refreshing."

"heromngmnt","6","4","8","28 February 2018"," Why so hyped?
","I still don't understand this film as a nominee. Okay, the screenplay was a fresh and surprising idea. Jordan Peele outdid himself making it happen in today's situation. I do understand that it is more important deal in receiving the nomination as a man of colour than actually the brilliance. Because for me the film itself was pretty... medicore. Neither the plot nor characters gave me any special feelings.<br/><br/>The story was simple. He goes to meet her parents and suddenly they are worse than he expected. Oh, and there's a huge house far away from anything, an awkward party and pretty girl. Sounds familiar? Idea with hypnosis was somewhat cool, but not really new one. Basically the key of Get Out is the racism. The main idea of white people using black people in XXI century turned into horror. Sorry for not so politically correct words, but it's raw truth. Apart from that it is minor horror film and I don't understand that Best Picture nomination. I was very disappointed after seeing it and now I am even more because Blade Runner was way better and it should be nominated instead.<br/><br/>Oscar for Daniel Kaluuya? Nope again. Speaking of acting, the background was way better. I am not even saying about the supporting roles, but Betty Gabriel, LilRey Howery or Lakeith Stanfield (who had literally two minutes onscreen) gave the whole film its thrill. Daniel himself got his moments while the hypnosis, but mostly the same things can be seen in any lame horror films about teens in scary house. Friendly reminder of some horror-crap such as The Cabin in the Woods (which also was way different, but just didn't have this something)."
"maxigarciasoto","7","4","8","15 February 2018"," Get Out - Movie review
","""Get out"" is a movie that came out last year and is directed by first time director Jordan Peele. This film is about an interracial couple between a black man (Daniel Kaluuya) called Chris and a white woman (Allison Williams) called Rose, and now Chris with Rose go on vacation at the house were there parents live . In that house Chris meets Rose's family and he doesn't feel so comfortable in this environment, he feels awkward and weird and that is meanly because he is black. And later on in the movie we find out some deeps secrets about this family and maybe some dark stuff is going to get him.<br/><br/>Now look, before i saw this film i was really excited, because i watch some of the review from professional critics and they were saying that this film was a masterpiece, a unique experience. In Rotten Tomatoes this film has 99%. So this film instantly went into my radar but i didn't have the chance to see it until this year. And now the Academy Awards nominated this film for four Oscars including Best picture, director, actor and screenplay. This film supposedly had all positive, and now i got the chance to watch it and...well, this is my viewpoint.<br/><br/>I don't hate ""Get Out"", i think it is a good movie, but i don't think it is a great movie. I was kind of disappointed with this film to be honest. But let's talk about the positives things first.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya gave a terrific performance here, thought out this film we see this character progress and change, and i did care about him in some of hard-core scenes, he did a good job. Jordan Peele's direction was good, there are some things in this film that kind of reminded me of the way Stanley Kubrick directed his films. From the way the opening scenes were going along i was enjoying it. From the way the shots are made and the amazing score, it feel like i was watching a horror film from the 90's. The tension and the suspense surrounding this house and this family is very well done and when a character is in danger you feel that danger. This movie also knows how to make the comedy pop, in movie like this you expect to see the scary things pop out , and this movie does that, but also knows how to make the film funny at times. And you laugh when you are suppose to be laughing, there is not weird sentiment of: We should be laughing or should be scary? - The film doesn't do that.<br/><br/>That is what i loved about this film, but, as always, this film has flaws. I think that the major problem that i have with this film is the tone. This film for the majority of it is a suspense movie, things pop out, weird stuff happens. But in the final scene of the movie, it feels like a completely different film. I not going to spoil it of course, but for me just didn't work and i felt that the end of the film was kind of messy. Another flaw with the film for me is LilRel Howery's character. In this film he plays a friend of Kaluuya's character and he is always talking in the phone, and for the majority of the film his character was very funny and Howery was doing a good job as this character, i felted that by the end is was useless. I mean he does things in the movie for sure, but he didn't added to much to film beside some funny jokes and thats it. I also felted that this movie was a little too long, and there are some scenes were Chris goes out of the house to take pictures of things because he is a photographer, and from that scenes, i'm out. There are boring and it doesn't help too much to the film.<br/><br/>Guys, like i said at the beginning of my review, i don't hate this movie. But i thinks is getting a little overrated. The hype and excitement for this movie is putting this film very high and in my opinion it doesn't deserves it. My best way to describe this film is comparing it with another film i saw a couple years ago called ""American Sniper"", that film got a lot of positives reviews, got academy awards nominations, and it was put as an amazing war film. But when i saw it i was kind of disappointed with that film too. That is my exact feeling with this movie, for me ""Get Out"" is 2017's ""American Sniper"". Is a good film for sure, but is not a great one. But as always i'm just giving my honest opinion here. If you loved this movie, good for you, if you hated this movie, good for you also, all the opinions are welcome here. For me this was good horror movie and i had fun with it at times, and because of that i'm going to give this film a 7/10."

Which could have been a terrific arc, especially with the political leanings of Rose's (Allison Williams) father.

Then the black boyfriend is strapped to a chair to watch a few videos before they remove his brain for the transplant. I would have thought that they would drug him and take him directly to the operating table, not to a chair. Then he avoids the trance by blocking his ears with cotton from the arm of the chair despite his arms being strapped down. Then whose brain is in who? Seems that the grandparents brains are in the two black servants (worked this out by myself!) Then there's a young black guy who reacts to the flash of the camera - what gives here? Somehow he reverts to his pre-brain state despite not having his old brain. Then do all the old whiteys have black brains? Not sure about that one. Meanwhile his fat buddy somehow works out where he is - would have added interest if we were shown how he did this. After the killing action and being saved by his buddy we very quickly fade to black. What ever happened to the resolution stage as detailed in Screen Writing 101?

I had not read reviews or any contaminating information beforehand so my responses to the films stimulus were well piqued by the film.<br/><br/>Also I liked how the double issue of an interracial couple and a mixed social class couple acted to utterly inoculate our protagonist from his normal human ability to sense when things are ""off"" or potentially harmful.<br/><br/>After all that nice establishment of our characters, their environment and story start points I found that nothing positive lasted for long for me.<br/><br/>People got stupider and events got more ridiculous until only lashings of coincidences and plot armour were being presented.<br/><br/>Oddly unbalanced comedy entered at about this stage too.<br/><br/>By the final act I was bored and unengaged: nothing new was being adventured any longer and plot devices were blatant.<br/><br/>The explosion of suspense to scares was a whimper after a very long slow build up.<br/><br/>I don't follow why the film needed to jettison it's attachment to character building in order to provide so little shock and awe.<br/><br/>I rate a 5/10 for a film that tentatively interested me with its mature attention to character and legitimate scenario making but then completely lost me as it let it's jack in the box off for the second half."

","It's the new movie everyone is talking about and critics are raving about, as for me, I couldn't wait to get out...of the theater. Guess who's coming to dinner? It's a black man coming home to a rich suburban white families house for the weekend, and despite their black servants, they're extremely nice to their daughters new boyfriend, too nice, something weird is going on. Yes, something weird is going on, only Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is too stupid to realize it! He's so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months, that not only can't he see what's going on right in front of his face, but he doesn't try to talk to her about it, he doesn't try to investigate any of it, he just sort of goes with the flow. People are raving about this noir thriller, when it is one of the most poorly written films I've seen in a while. Major plot holes aside for the moment, there is absolutely no character development, no chemistry between the actors, and worst of all they don't even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over! Yes, it's weird, yes, something is going on, but the writers don't even hint at what that is! They don't even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be. At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Without giving anything away, they never answer the fundamental question, why black people? I never liked traditional noir, but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of what's going on. This film is just one big circle of confusion and to be honest with you, aside from some terrific comic relief, I hated every minute of it."

","This movie was nominated to best picture of the oscar in the 2017 edition, but why ?, i really wouldnt know, could be because of the controversy of 2016, about no black actors been nominated, and really was about lack of diversity in the nominations. Maybe this movie is just a scape goat.
So the movie..., very interisting plot, so much that they could have done with that i think, but this plot in the middle of the movie gets totally smashed by the comercial thriller wagon. Some of the scene were very well done, but most of them (the goodies) were the comic parts, or the conspiration ones, the rest of the movie feels very flat.
Acting its not the best in my opinion (although in movies like this is probably not the most importat), keener was a delight though.
In summary great start, but ends like a mission imposible sort of film."

I felt like they didn't deliver on the promise that had been made with the first half. I don't know if they got lazy at the end and gave into convention or what but I was disappointed with the sudden lack of quality.<br/><br/>And Allison Williams did not look believable holding a gun.

","I don't think the movie is as great as the ratings show. But it is still pretty original and entertaining. I just feel it wasn't developed enough and a lot could have been done better. I think the acting was really good. And it did a great job developing the paranoia in the beginning, it just went downhill when we were supposed to find out what happened.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie is ""racist"". People whining about it are just as bad as SJWs who see racism everywhere."
"pob75","6","1","1","19 May 2019"," Not bad. It doesn't feel particularly new or original to me.
","This is a slightly better than average horror film.
I suspect that overinflated expectation probably doesn't do the film any favours. Hyping it as particularly new or original doesn't feel warranted to me. There are several similarly themed films and certainly several similar feeling films. Maybe it has attracted an audience that wouldn't normally watch this type of film.
It is reasonably well-done for what it is. Many of the criticisms I have I would forgive of horror films that carry me along with them. They stand out more with this because it didn't pull me along with it as much as it should. It didn't build tension much at all for me. It didn't really have me rooting for anyone or questioning things. It just didn't grab me very much.<br/><br/>There is a lot of talk of race around this film. Is this a black/white film that divides on those lines? Do I find it racist? If the black/white characters were reversed would it be racist? Is it rebalancing previous racism by turning it on its head?
Does it really matter? Are people taking it too seriously?
Race is obviously an issue in the film but presumably to prod the audience a bit - it doesn't feel preachy. It is noticeable that ALL the white characters are devious, manipulative and unpleasant but it is a relatively small number of people. Within the world of the film all the white characters are bad - that's OK - it doesn't have to mean all white people are bad unless you want to deliberately generalise beyond what the film does.<br/><br/>Leaving the whole black/white thing to one side - ultimately it is meant to be a horror/thriller (maybe with a bit of old-school sci-fi thrown-in) that is not too serious. Is it entertaining? Yes, moderately. Is it something I've never seen before in some form? No. It isn't an 8/10 but neither is it a 1 or 2/10 IMHO.
Overall I think 5 or 6/10 feels about right - it is watchable, a bit better than average for what it is but not any more than that for me."

It was good, but definitely NOT Oscar worthy! The last 20 min of the film was just like any other horror movie of the past 20 years. Up until then I was really anxious to see what was really going on. Then I was truly disappointed when it turned into an R rated slasher flick with a totally unbelievable pretext. Hollywood must have been feeling guilty about the lack of diversity in its nominees the previous year, and tried to make up for it by nominating this, doing a great disservice to the real quality minority films out that year. Black Panther it ain't! Truth is I wasn't really cheated until I paid $5. Will be in this year's yard sale."

When you do that, expectations are set to actually have some scares and such. A psychological thriller, perhaps. Definitely a thriller and great crime flick. I believe if you market it correctly, then expectations are different and then the problems I have with the film disappear because I don't look for things that aren't there. This was the same issue with M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. When you re-watch and don't have horror movie expectations, it becomes a better flick.

I should discuss the main vulnerability in the story that caused the whole story fail. Racism, that this film is trying to judge so badly, was, and still is one of the biggest social problems. But you will agree me, In the real life it could be scarier, than this film expressed. Somehow, I don't know why, creators of the film decided to put Sci-Fi in the film and make it unrealistic, while they could take a film about segregation period in the USA, or about WW2 period. Also when I reached the end I saw only one message: ""Let's hate each other"". I can not call this movie Anti-Racist.

"blrnani","4","1","1","19 July 2018"," A comedy, not a horror film
","As a comedic satire of AfroAmericans' worst nightmares and fantasies about white people, this film is very funny, especially as our hero is so trusting that he consistently ignores his bff's dire warnings along the path to ruin. That the decrepit white monsters show a preference for virile young black people adds to the humour. 
However, having discovered that this is apparently meant to be a serious horror film cum social commentary I can only give it a thumbs down.
Our leads are both endearing, until we learn the awful truth about her and her family. But everybody else is so absurdly weird (even the bff) that there is no room for belief that this has anything to do with the real world (unless perhaps a real world as reflected in the film Deliverance). 
There is more one can relate to in the films about vampires trying to perpetuate their existence by possessing new bodies full of youthful vitality - which is effectively the same plot but doesn't try to make a racial issue out of it. I am appalled by the potential impact on interracial relations for anybody who takes this film the slightest bit seriously. But for those who can laugh out loud at it there is still hope."

","I surprisingly liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would! I knew from the clips and trailers I have seen that it was going to be well done and well acted. And it was. Especially from Daniel Kaluuya. Superb acting. Even a lot of the smaller characters had certain moments where they shined. It won the best screenplay award so I had that in mind while watching and I have to agree it was great, the story grabs you from the start, kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what the heck is going on. But don't get me wrong. It's not action packed. It's a slow burn mind game and it was pretty fun trying to figure it all out. Don't watch clips or trailers! It was nice going in not knowing much. It was rated R because the story needed it to be, not just because it wanted to be, which I always appreciate. The soundtrack was pretty cool but not that unique for this type of movie. The directing was pretty great and the story was told very well. 
You may be asking yourself ""Why is Chris surprised he liked it? Is it cause it's about black people made by black people and he's racist and doesn't think black people can make good movies?!"" Uh no. Ha! 
That's what the Social Justice Warriors want you to think. Which is exactly why I was surprised I liked it! I feel like the Oscars and lots of the media praised this movie so much and acted like it was the ""best movie of our generation"" and acted like it was SO IMPORTANT for black people. It made me think it was going to be filled with political and racist preaching. But I watched it with an open mind and it wasn't like that! I know it had metaphors and other things throughout but it wasn't in your face or preachy. It was just a good thriller that you can either take at face value and enjoy or you can think really deep about and get social issues. It lets you have that choice. That's what surprised me and I'm glad. So if you want a good thriller with twists and ""what the heck""s, or if you're racist against white people and want to see them get it, Get Out is the film for you!"

","Since the independent filmmakers of the United States presented in 1986, for the first time, their award called Independent Spirit (or, in its short version, Spirit), when Martin Scorsese was honored for «After Hours», the Spirit became the maximum reward of the ""other cinema"", of the cinema away from the mega-industry of Los Angeles, in a kind of Oscar of the ""liberated"" of the Hollywood dictatorship. From that date, the award distinguished good filmmakers ignored by the ""Academy"", such as Robert Altman, John Sayles and Todd Haynes, and many others who later became ""officialized"", such as Tarantino, Nolan and Aronofsky.<br/><br/>To be honest, today in 2018, there seems to be not much difference between one cinema and the other: the film that won the Spirit for Best Film of the Year is not far from the gore aesthetic present in the Oscar-winning film as the best . While «Get Out» is not as whiny as «The Shape of Water», but a more forceful and ""virile"" drama with some denunciation, both films are science fiction products that take the path of extreme and bloody violence to lead us to the conclusion. Both films also have in common an Afro-descendant, obese and comical character that plays a decisive role in the plot: in the amphibious fable it was Zelda as played by Octavia Spencer, and here, LilRed Howery as Rod, an airport investigator.<br/><br/>In the film, a white girl invites her black boyfriend to spend a weekend at her parents' house, and the poor young man falls into a terrifying intrigue, surrounded by sinister Caucasian beings and three African-Americans who look like zombies, though as charming as the ""Stepford wives"". Little by little the intrigue is revealed, although one suspects from the beginning who the villains are - in part, due to the stereotyped performances of some interpreters in key parts of the story.<br/><br/>They say that the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay usually indicates what was the true best movie of the year, according to the ""Academy."" This year this indirect recognition was given to the director and scriptwriter of ""Get Out,"" Jordan Peele. The film does entertain and is effective (thanks also to a careful soundtrack and very good music by Michael Abels), but if you expect a lot from it, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------
P.S. The garden party reminded me of a similar scene in ""The Stepford Wives"". Just as Katharine Ross and friend Paula Prentiss are observing the guests, so does Daniel Kaluuya. As a matter of fact, both Ross and Kaluuya play photographers. And when the Nanette Newman robot malfunctions because it drank too much wine, that is similar to Lakeith Stanfield's ""epilepsy"" crisis."

"jordyreviewsit","8","11","32","23 February 2017"," 'Get Out' Is A Smart, Satirical Look On Society and Racism
","OVERVIEW: Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is invited by his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to spend the weekend at her parents estate. This will be the first time Chris has met them and is nervous how their interracial relationship will be received. Something Rose has not warned her parents of. When they first arrive, Chris takes note that both the maid and groundskeeper for the family are black. However, Rose's father Dean (Bradley Whitford) assures him that there are no racial motivations. Even more odd is her mother Missy (Catherine Keener) who practices hypnosis. Despite Chris' decline for a session, she performs it on him anyways.<br/><br/>As the weekend gets underway, the family hosts their yearly party with friends, all of whom are white. Chris is growing uncomfortable as it seems everyone is trying way to hard to seem like they aren't racist. They bring up liking Barack Obama, Tiger woods and even make remarks about his physique. He is surprised to see one black man and attempts to chat with him to ease the awkwardness, but finds the young man to be just as odd as the rest of them. Chris finds comfort in a phone call with his cousin Rod (Lil Rel Howery), who swears something sinister is going on. Both he and his cousin continue to grow in their paranoia as they piece together the strange happenings.<br/><br/>THOUGHTS: For this horror film, the scares are subtle tricks played upon the audience. It follows more of a psychological thriller pattern, avoiding unnecessary jump scares or relying on gore to aid its story. There is an unease that follows you throughout the film as you try to dissect each character and what is truly going on. It's full of tension and continually plays with your mind. There is also a wonderfully unsettling visual representation of hypnosis that this film utilizes for when Chris is incapacitated. It was reminiscent of The Twilight Zone and it was an interesting way to show the helplessness one could feel.<br/><br/>Not surprising was the amount of great comedic moments in this film. There were much needed moments of levity throughout, most delivered by Lil Rel Howery. Use of humor were at times when it felt natural and it wasn't an attempt to overpower the film or its message. Jordan Peele has found so much success in comedy, which was why so many were shocked to hear he was directing and writing this film. This was a nice way for him to merge his love of horror with what he is best known for.<br/><br/>Also worth its own praise is the amazing performance by Daniel Kaluuya. Many will recognize him from his appearance in the Black Mirror episode ""Fifteen Million Merits"". His portrayal of the emotionally scarred Chris was such a well-developed character in a genre that sometimes forgets how to do that.<br/><br/>Tackling racial issues in a horror movie seemed to unnerve some people when the trailer initially dropped. It was easy for people to judge it on the surface, especially for a topic that makes some people uncomfortable. Without getting into spoiler territory, not only is the subject of racism addressed, but also the idea of genetically superiority as well as life. The film is not so easy to dissect and is really a fun one to watch."

Right at the very beginning, police officer asks the black guy for his ID card for no reason, white girl has to defend the black guy... yeah okay, that always happens *sarcasm included here*. And it just gets worse from there.<br/><br/>This is a social justice warrior's self indulgent journey into their own modern liberal fantasy of what life is like, that white people are out to get blacks, and that it is up to white liberals to hold that moral ground against the horrible racist ""MAN"". So there is no doubt that the apologist white person will applaud this movie, as that type is always looking for ways to ""make amends"", and this movie will absolutely fill that role for them.<br/><br/>If you are a realist, who understands facts, facts like ""you are more likely to be struck by lightning than to be shot and killed by a police officer"", facts like crime statistics, etc, then you will watch this movie, with these cliched nonsense scenarios, the bad acting (the servant filling the glass until it is spilling over, COME ON, saw that coming a mile away) and you will roll your eyes and shake your head... <br/><br/>Bad acting, bad plot, but they added in a ton of assumed racism in order to draw in half this poor country and get them excited.

","When Donald Trump asked blacks during the campaign, 'What do you have to lose?' he didn't exactly have in mind the circumstances envisioned in Jordan Peele's highly original breakout film Get Out. If you think that the story of a white girl bringing her young black boyfriend home to meet her parents in an idyllic rural setting is going to be a romantic comedy, think again. Influenced by such horror films as Rosemary's Baby and Stepford Wives, Get Out has some romance in it and some comedy but they are all wrapped in a twilight zone basket of social satire, horror, and science fiction that adds up to a roller-coaster ride of dizzying proportions.<br/><br/>Peele, a former comedy star whose show Key and Peele was an Emmy Award-winning series on Comedy Central, has said that he would consider his film to be a ""social thriller,"" a genre he describes as one in which ""the horror is embedded in the way people interact, the way people think, the way people categorize."" More directly, he has fashioned a look at the unconscious racism that may lie beneath the outward appearance of polite society. The film opens with a black man (Lakeith Stanfield) walking alone on a suburban street in a white neighborhood who is assaulted and thrown into the trunk of a car by a masked assailant, a reminder of the recent murder of Trayvon Martin.<br/><br/>The scene then shifts to New York where Chris Washington, a young African-American photographer superbly performed by British actor Daniel Kaluuya, is planning to travel with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to upstate New York to meet Rose's parents. Though Rose admits that she has not told her parents that Chris is black, she reassures him that they are open-minded and supporters of President Barack Obama who would vote again for him if he could run. Chris and Rose have terrific chemistry together and appear to be on the same wavelength in their outlook on life.<br/><br/>Their trip proceeds without incident until it is interrupted when they hit a deer crossing the road and have an encounter with a police. In what looks like racial profiling, the officer asks to see Chris' ID even though he wasn't the driver but Rose forcefully intervenes in his behalf, a shadowy portent of later events. Chris feels welcome in the home of Rose's parents, bearded physician Dean (Bradley Whitford) and psychiatrist and hypnotist Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener) who both say the right things even though somewhat awkwardly. Dean tells Chris about his father losing an Olympic qualifying race to Jesse Owens and Missy invites Chris to let her cure his smoking habit with hypnotism but he senses that all is not right.<br/><br/>His antennas go up further when Rose's brother, a martial arts enthusiast (Caleb Landry Jones), returns home and immediately challenges Chris to a jujitsu contest. Things take an even more strange turn when he encounters the Armitage's zombie-like black groundskeeper, Walter (Marcus Henderson), and housekeeper Georgina (Betty Gabriel). When elderly friends of the grandparents arrive at the Armitage's for an afternoon garden party, all white except for an older Japanese man and a younger black man (Stanfield), Chris is taken aback by embarrassing comments about Chris' physique and sexual powers and the only black guest suddenly becomes aggressive and threatening.<br/><br/>Feeling stressed by the unfolding situation, Chris calls his best friend Rod (LilRel Howery), a TSA officer who offers some needed humor but also has an unerring insight into what is taking place at the Armitages. The reveal in the last part of the film is too delicious to give away but it is recommended that you fasten your seat belts for a wild ride. Get Out is a highly entertaining thriller that will keep you enthralled right up until the last minute. While it does have some social implications that is up to each viewer to sort out, according to Peele, ""the film isn't meant to alienate white viewers so much as let them see this experience that we've (black people) been living through."" Although perhaps the rich white liberals in the film are an easy target and depicted as caricatures, Peele says that he ""wanted the movie to reflect the racism that exists in all of us."" This reflection is also a mirror of the fears that exist in the hearts of black people who must carefully navigate the racial divide every single day of their lives."

An eerie feeling of dread and doom that follows its tale to its bloody ending. Critics have lauded comedian Jordan Peele's mash-up of various film genres, calling it a satirical political horror thriller And as the film's writer and director, he has successfully blended these elements most astutely. But, in his first feature, he still follows a safe formula that has been seen countless times in many other thrillers. It is not as original as reported, but it is highly entertaining.<br/><br/>￼Racism is at the core of this film and it is so subtly layered in the writing, direction, and performances, although script-wise, it loses its cleverness around the midway point and the twists and reveals were not so surprising to this reviewer. <br/><br/>Chris and Rose (Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams), an interracial couple decide to visit the Armitage family in the affluent countryside, a picture perfect community with no real diversity in sight, except for the few black servants who tend to their needs of their employers. Rose has not told her parents, Dean and Missy (Bradford Whitford, Catherine Keener) that her boyfriend is black, but assures Chris that they are an understanding liberally-minded family. He has no need to worry. Wrong, of course.<br/><br/>￼Paranoia quickly set in as Chris realizes that some of the town's African-American residents demonstrate odd behaviors and appearances. In the Armitage household, their slightly off-kilter son's behavior, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), may also be misleading. The Stepford Wives / The Most Dangerous Game vibe is more than intentional as tensions begin to slowly build. <br/><br/>Get Out sends up that well-to-do white class privilege and their carefully hidden Trump values. Mr. Peale doesn't shy away from today's divisive climate and uses gallows humor to make his point. His sense of irony becomes grim as the horror elements begin to seep into the plot. His direction is skillfully handled as he creates the right atmosphere and rhythm for his film to jump-start the scares. There are plenty of well deserved jump-outta-your-seat moments to enjoy.<br/><br/>￼The actors underplay their roles which makes the film more disturbing and effective. Mr. Kaluuya is very good as Carl. He is instantly relatable and his nuanced performance is the major catalyst for the film's success. Ms. Williams has a nice counter balance as his girlfriend. Both Mr. Whitford and Ms. Keener, two always reliable actors, are subtly discomfiting as Rose's odd parents. But the standout performance is given by Betty Gabriel as Georgina, who simmers with restrained creepiness as the loyal maid. There is also fine support by Marcus Henderson and LiRel Howery, who contributes the needed comic relief to diffuse some of the tension.<br/><br/>￼The moviegoers in the theater were totally involved, extremely audible in their reactions to the action and gore. This demonstrative twenty-something crowd whooped and hollered their approval at every killing. They applauded numerous times at the bloody mayhem and laughed wholeheartedly at the comic relief sprinkled throughout the film. The film made the right impression with its target audience who all shared in the communal tension.<br/><br/>Get Out is a real crowd-pleaser, but the film is not breaking any new territory as many reviewers have suggested. It's just a well crafted suspenseful, if unoriginal, horror thriller which establishes Mr. Peele as a promising director. So get out, see this film, and have some fun!"
"davispittman","9","7","18","27 February 2017"," Not your run of the mill thriller
","Get Out (2017) is a very well made thriller/horror film. The cast does a great job, especially the parents, Catherine Keener really plays her sedated hypnotist role well. The beginning of the film is ALL about interaction and dialogue that comes into play later on. The chemistry between the actors and the scenes that involve their interaction is all played out very well. The movie then gets more intense and crap starts going down once the star finally figures out what is going on. There are interesting clues and hints that are dropped during the movie that you connect at the end. The ending is well put together too, creepy and climatic. One thing is for sure, you will not leave this film feeling like it was boring or ordinary or stereotypical in any way. And I am sooo thankful for that! I went into this movie wanting it to be just like what the 100% positive reviews were saying. And I was not disappointed in any way. 9/10 for get out."
"adosmoorinos","9","9","25","8 March 2017"," Its a good movie, don't overthink it, just watch it
","Watched this movie with my friend and we had no clue what the movie was about when we entered. We just sat in the theater, and watched. After watching the move, we've been talking about it the last 3 days. <br/><br/>All these sensitive people are pretending that the movie was trying to prove something or is insulting to white people. The movie isn't trying to prove or show anything. It's just a movie. No one listen to those people who thought it was misinterpreting of white people. Those people just want to complain about something.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't use Cgi monsters or demons to make it scary. What makes the whole movie scary is that they make every character so awkward and sketchy that it starts creeping you out. What I find makes the movie stick with you after, is when you realize that everything progressed in a realistic way. For most of the movie, you don't know who's the real bad guy. Also, the main character knows something is up right away. Most horror movies are just a repeat of the main character ignoring all the crucial clues to get out. You realize the main character did everything he could in this movie, which makes the movie seem so real.<br/><br/>In conclusion, If you just watch the movie and forget about all that stupid slavery and white family talk, you'll enjoy it."
"kraytdragon-sean","8","10","29","24 February 2017"," Masterful Horror
","I wish more horror films were as relevant and smart as Get Out. The movie feeds off a paranoia that the majority of the United States population doesn't experience on a regular basis. Fake smiles and awkward handling of racially charged conversations are masterfully put on display in the first half of the movie. The cracks in the white facade intensify at a steady pace. Uncomfortable questions or points start popping up in the viewer's mind. What is up with the eclectic decor (explicitly called out)? Why are all the black ""caretakers"" acting ""white"" on the property? Are we, as white people, really this ignorant? In short, you start to feel an entire system is out to get our protagonist. Admittedly, an early scene explicitly sets the stage up. Mainstream horror films play it safe with the usual jump scares and gory imagery. To be sure, Get Out sports a fair amount of both elements. At some point, all too shockingly familiar racism starts to out scare the traditional horror clichés. Unfortunately, several dumb horror tropes also make an appearance. For example, you have that one horror scene where you have an odd figure chopping wood. The others tropes I could list involve spoilers. The acting is consistently top notch from all involved. I only have one minor quip with the casting choice of a peripheral character. The character certainly sticks out when you notice him and the inclusion is somewhat puzzling. Overall, the subject matter more than makes up for Get Out's very minor shortcomings. How often do movies aimed at a mainstream audience have the audacity to call out whites in America? The timing of the film's release is sadly impeccable. Racism is alive and well in our country. America ""smiled"" when she elected Trump as POTUS. I congratulate Jordan Peele for his impressive foray into directing. The film is dense and I certainly missed a few points on my first viewing."

","This is one of the worst movies i have seen in recent times. It is in every aspect a cheap movie with mediocre cinematography and direction (at best) but with an aggravating script and insultingmeta narrative.<br/><br/>The whole point of this film is to insult white people , thats it, is a racist movie filled with every cliche and stereotype you can think off to serve as a metaphore for how awfully bad meanies the white race is.. Every scene in this movie is cringe inducing, not because a masterfully crafted tension but how presuntuos it is and because of the irony of a movie that is so blatantly racist yet still thinks is making a point in denouncing racism.<br/><br/>This is a short versio of the whole script: <br/><br/>""See what i did there? it is a reference to a meme about race, did you get it? really? did you get it? is smart and polemic, did you get it? because all white people are bad, and she is white and she is drinking white milk? is symbolic see what i did there? but really , did you get how white and bad they are? DID YOU GET IT? CLEVER ISN´T?<br/><br/>This entire film is an insult to the viewers intelligence. it is nothing but a very mediocre B movie that tries so hard to be more than it is by pushing for a polemic narrative that doesn´t have a leg to stand on. The acting is terrible, the drama is weak , is not funny, is not scary, all the characters are one dimensional stereotypes, the direction and script is full of the worst tropes and cheap devices you are already sick of seeing and the fact that this movie is getting so much praise is baffling as is not even good for a tv movie, much less an oscar nomination.

","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THE SUSPENSE!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I just watched this and I really don't see what all the shouting is about or why it's winning so many accolades. The underlying story elements are trite and used-up--rich white people practicing evil magic and mind-control! (THEY LIVE), and, naive hero goes to isolated retreat-location whose inhabitants are gradually revealed to be demonic cultists intent on making him a human sacrifice! (THE WICKER MAN, and god knows how many movies and TV episodes based on stories by HP Lovecraft and others like him). And the conclusion is pure reverse-racism: ALL the white characters, including the most apparently sympathetic, apparently non-racist one, turn out to be e-e-e-e-e-vil bad guys who can only be defeated by using extreme violence.<br/><br/>The only appealing features of this movie are decent camerawork, creepy atmosphere, some engaging suspense at the beginning of the movie, fairly decent performances by SOME of the actors, and a few clever jokes like the capable, heroic good-guy/rescuer being a trustworthy, reliable agent of TSA (yeah, the guys who check you for underwear-bombs at airports) and therefore ""knowing how to handle things"". Not nearly enough to make up for the feeling of let-down from the trite plot and the disgust at the reverse-racism."

"kluseba","6","6","15","28 March 2017"," Fighting stereotypes with stereotypes. OR: Horror hype: Once again, it doesn't follow.
","As a horror movie connoisseur, I couldn't get around this movie that has become a surprising box office success, has got positive reviews from critics and fans and has developed a hype that might classify it as future cult movie. Behold! The same was said about It Follows not so long ago, a movie I thought was tedious and overrated. As it turns out, Get Out is another genre movie that doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, it's better than another Paranormal Activity sequel and is overall a slightly above average film but it surely isn't the stunning masterpiece most people make of it. <br/><br/>Just to be clear, this film barely classifies as horror movie. I would call it a psychological thriller with some misplaced supernatural scientific elements. The movie had an overall vaguely mysterious atmosphere but it didn't get scary aside of two minor jump scares involving a deer and a servant.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. First of all, the movie has a continuously intriguing mysterious atmosphere. This atmosphere isn't only supported by the gloomy plot but also by calm and precise camera work that offers a more than welcome alternative to cheap shaky camera stylistics in contemporary horror cinema. The movie features a moody soundtrack that blends in without being as eccentric as the Insidious scores. <br/><br/>A movie is carried by its main character and British newcomer Daniel Kaluuya is a gifted actor. The character's emotions are portrayed accurately. You can see how the main character starts as calm, grounded and smart person and becomes nervous, hectic and confused. Daniel Kaluuya is a name you should keep on your mind because we might see more stunning movies with him. I could even see him becoming the next incarnation of James Bond.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the negative parts. First of all, the trailer is basically the entire movie, so don't watch it. I didn't even watch it and it still took me less than five minutes after the main character arrived at the mansion to figure out what was going on and what would happen next. The fact that the movie is so predictable has a negative impact on its otherwise intense atmosphere. The movie fails to offer any surprises to people who are familiar with horror movies. <br/><br/>Despite a short running time, the movie feels stretched. When I'm watching a horror movie, I'm not expecting any action and I'm ready to wait until the movie quickens up the pace but some elements in the film are either irrelevant or repetitive. Instead of showing us one scene where specific characters act weirdly, the makers offer three similar scenes until the most feeble-minded viewer has realized what's wrong with these specific characters. A subtle horror movie should take its audience more seriously and offer less redundant clues.<br/><br/>This leads us to the acting performances. Daniel Kaluuya delivers a stunning performance. Allison Williams offers a solid performance but the two main characters have no chemistry and fail to represent a realistic couple. I could still accept this because that hint might have been intentional. What I can't accept is that every single other actor acts over-the-top, no matter if it suits their roles or not. It starts with the main character's hyperactive friend, goes on with repulsively rude police officers and ends with an entire family and its friends who behave as if they came from a different planet. This acting strategy is repeated to death until the characters have become parodies of specific stereotypes. That doesn't fit to a movie that relies on its gloomy atmosphere and intends to spread a message against stereotypes.<br/><br/>On the other side, the movie takes itself too seriously. The scene involving a car accident and an encounter with a local police officer is obviously included as an element of foreshadowing announcing the main character's struggle with his mother's death and with white people with debatable stereotypes. However, this scene feels so forced and pseudo-intellectual that it takes away from the movie's atmosphere instead of adding to it. A very similar thing happens at the end, when the writers offer awkward science-fiction elements appropriate for old-fashioned Frankenstein movies but not for a film with such a relevant message when police violence against black people has increased in what is supposed to be the flagship of democracy, equality and liberty. It seems that the movie makers couldn't decide whether they wanted to offer an entirely serious psychological thriller with relevant social critiques or a clever parody playing with stereotypes. In the end, they failed at both attempts. The movie feels directionless.<br/><br/>My guess is that it got such praise because it portrays an admittedly sympathetic black man struggling with abusive white people. It's funny how a movie that intends to mock stupid stereotypes is itself based upon stereotypes. Would this very same movie have had the same positive reviews if it had portrayed a white main character being abused by black people? I'm quite confident that wouldn't have been the case because people would have called the makers of this movie racist and the film's message debatable. This proves that the reason why this film receives such approval is because of its message that is at the pulse of time and yet simplifies a very important topic too much. If you take away the movie's intentions, what do we have left? We have an average horror movie.<br/><br/>If you aren't familiar with horror movies and want to get a smooth introduction with a psychological thriller, this film is a good choice. If you are rightfully infuriated by the current rise of stereotypes including racism, you will get some food for thought. If you are looking for a clever or innovating horror movie that justifies its hype, you won't get satisfaction. My final suggestion is to rent this movie instead of spending well-earned money on a cinema ticket."

It does't do anything at all that we haven't seen in other movies, absolutely every single scene in it I could find in another movie if I could be arsed. There is no directorial vision at all really, and the acting is really rather average.<br/><br/>Allison Williams, the girl from Girls, plays the girl from Girls, I wonder if all she will ever play is the girl from Girls? and everyone else is just out of casting 101.<br/><br/>There are two really rather good jumps in it both of which are not essential to the plot, and some laugh out loud funny lines, but the film belongs to the supporting cast, and it is much more alive when LilRel Howery is on the screen - he's the best thing in it by far.<br/><br/>The main character (Daniel Kaluuya) has a camera and takes a lot of photos and I was hoping or expecting this to have something to do with the plot, but it never did, and then he takes the important photo with his phone. Kind of a weak moment.<br/><br/>Plot has lots of rather silly plot holes and strange horror devices which are not fulfilled or explained.<br/><br/>They try to attempt to deal with racism but fail to actually 'go there' so it comes across as extraordinarily clichéd'.<br/><br/>Worth watching if you like this sort of thing, which is a 15 certificate horror with a few jumps."
"mitodruroy","9","8","22","28 April 2017"," ""Get Out"" of your homes and watch the movie right now
","I just came back after watching this incredibly intelligent psychological thriller called Get Out. You could call it a horror film as the more generic elements that are seen in a horror film are present in this movie but this film is so much more than just a scary movie. Most of the scenes in this film are centered around the follow four actions (a) denial : Secrets are suppressed: (b) deceit : Secrets are revealed (c) submission : Secrets make the protagonist vulnerable (d) retaliation : Secrets make the protagonist strong<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya, the lead actor, has played his role to stupendous perfection. I remember having seen him play Emily Blunt's FBI colleague in Sicario but that time my focus wasn't really on him so I had kind of missed out on appreciating the man's ingenious acting talent back then. This time though, we as an audience are transported into Daniel's mind and we, in a way, view the entire film from his character's confused perspective. Considering how he has conveyed certain emotions in this film, we might as well presume that he could be in the race for a Best Actor Oscar Nomination next year. Yes, he is that good.<br/><br/>Can anybody who saw this film believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film as a director ? If this is what his first film turns out to be, I am confident he will go on to become one of the greatest auteurs Hollywood has seen till date. I am so happy that this movie has minted so much money at the box-office. It deserves every penny it has earned. I have patiently waited for this film to release and now that I have seen the film, I can surely tell you that my patience has paid off. ""Get Out"" of your homes and watch the movie right now"

","Sick movie, Sick sound track. The music contradicts the circumstances in the early scenes perfectly. Everything seems cool, but you as the audience know there is something fishy going on. You can't put your finger on it just yet and neither can the protagonist, you feel his frustration building as he fails to explain the incongruencies to his girlfriend. He wants to ""get out"", but he has to go through this if he wants the relationship to progress. The internal struggle is real, and when sh*t gets too real (when more knowledge comes to light) it's too late for our friendly protagonist. <br/><br/>The way he gets sunk in (sunken) to all the non sense is pretty original, the scene that visualised what was going on in the characters mind was excellent, as he falls deeper and deeper and his vision of reality slips away. On the edge of your seat the whole way. The acting is excellent from all members of the cast. The movie fulfils its thriller genre, but also delivers some 10 out of 10 comedy moments. All in all, Sick movie, 10 stars, would watch again. <br/><br/>The title in the end credits was also nice touch"
"Rendanlovell","6","8","22","2 March 2017"," A creative if rather bland horror movie.
","Coming off of the amazingly bad comedy 'Keanu' Jordan Peele has decided to branch out into the horror genre. From various interviews that I saw with him, he seemed to bring this film out of a very genuine place. Saying that, while it has commentary about racism, it's not intended to be aggressive or hostile. It's just things that he has personally noticed. So he combined his own personal observations about race relations and his favorite genre of film, horror. The story is mainly about a black man that goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents (it's very weird typing it like this but, trust me this is vital information). Upon arrival, things aren't quite as they seem. Like the tagline suggests, ""Just because you're invited doesn't mean you're welcome.""<br/><br/>Shortly after arriving the mom of his girlfriend puts him in a trance of sorts. She claims that this specific type of hypnosis is to aid him in breaking his smoking habit (a ""habit"" that we never see). This hypnosis scene is probably the best scene in the entire film and I wish we got more stuff like it. The way it's intercut with things from his past and how it slowly ratchets up tension using sound is all very well done.<br/><br/>That's the thing with this film, though. It's about 50% good 50% bad. When it's good, it's really good, but when it's bad, it's really bad. The best thing I can say about this film is that It's a strong directorial debut for Jordan Peele. He puts a noticeable amount of effort into this film and it's clear that this material is something he really cares about. Everything looks great, sounds great, and offers great performances across the board.<br/><br/>But this film really feels like a tale of two halves. The first half of this film is mostly positive. It offers some strange and surreal sequences that do make you feel uncomfortable. But, at the same time, there's also incredibly obvious racial commentary. It feels like the idea for the film was created before the story was. So we get a variety of great ideas for scenes that don't quite connect to make a cohesive whole.<br/><br/>For example, the opening scene. We watch as a black guy gets abducted as he walks about the streets. OK, but why was that in the film? It's not really apart of the main story and doesn't offer anything much aside from a minor set up for later on that we didn't need. Is it a cool scene? Sure it is. It's all shot in one take and does have blatant satire but it's a good idea for a scene.<br/><br/>And that's the biggest problem with the film. It mostly feels like a collection of good ideas that were poorly thought through. The execution rarely falters but the script feels like a first draft. The main story, satire aside, is basically none existent. But that's OK because there's social commentary to fill that void. The only problem with that is the satire is so obvious and so on the nose that it rarely left me with anything to dwell on. It's always spelled out for you to the point of it feeling like it was hitting you over the head.<br/><br/>This is the most frustrating part especially coming off 'A Cure for Wellness'. Which not only had a solid story holding your attention but subtle, strong political and social commentary for anyone paying attention. And you really had to pay attention to see it, which is something 'Get Out' simply doesn't do. The oddest part is that the commentary all but evaporates by the end of the film. The crazy, violent things you expect going in start happening and it seems to completely lose its edge.<br/><br/>It turns into this violent quest to survive but and that was great and all but I completely lost any sense of satire. Which was the only thing carrying the first half of the film. It's bizarre that the payoff to all this obvious satire isn't anything but mindless violence featuring characters that the film barely bothers to develop. 'Get Out' isn't the film it could've been. Its heart is in the right place and it has a good message in there. But the message is bogged down by how in your face it is and the fact that there isn't much more to the film other than that."

I think advertising this as a horror is really a stretch. I guess you could compare it to more of a Alfred Hitchcock horror, as opposed to true horror like Sinister, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, you get the picture.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised at all the 10 star reviews that misled me here at IMDb. This was more of a drama/thriller. If anything the best part of movie was demonstrating how white people trying to not be racist, can still be really racist. The movie is just saturated with dialogue like ""I can't be racist, I voted for Obama!"" or ""I can't be racist, I have a black friend!"". While I'm not quoting the movie directly, you get the idea. So the movie scores points for being a good social commentary.

It's purely because of racist black people or white people suffering of ""white guilt"" who give this top scores. This ""white people bad, black people oppressed and good"" theme was smeared on my face so much that I wanted to puke. Why it had to be only black people who were victims and only white people who were bad? Like many people have pointed out, switch the roles of white and black people and this movie would have caused massive outrage and director would be in prison if alive at all.

","Living in a world full of remakes and turns that might get too !such praise because there's very little to inspire and make the audience gasp.

We are surrounded, line the protagonist with a threatening and stifling atmosphere. With the stirring and spooky soundtrack that enhances perfectly a fresh take on the trapped prey. <br/><br/>The movie works because of the various talents involved. Nothing distracts because of its perfect balance. Eyes convey fear, much surprise, emptiness, signs that something is very wrong and things can get really ugly. <br/><br/>Revealing anything beyond the premise in the trailers that show our protagonist will be facing racism of a very strange And evil type. There are a lot of dark forces at work, some embodied and projected with terrifying gusto by the actress portraying a cold professional with a heart of steel and the coldest eyes one is bound to see this year.<br/><br/>Will he escape?

He is aprehensive and we understand and to some extent share his concerns, especially as she seems not to have any similar concerns. This is where we are already sensing something is wrong but when things turn 'weird' at the house we rather relax into the notion that this is going to be a horror story, maybe based on the guy's paranoia. Well, this goes way beyond that into 'Society' and 'Stepford Wives' territory, but always with an element of race. This becomes more and more pronounced until the film is about little else and the audience is set up to cheer the death count (of the white folk). Allison Williams is a real discovery and will surely go o to greater things and the director too clearly has skills but that chip on his shoulder and a liking for racial humour may hold him back."

This is my only criticism of the movie. It just becomes too surreal and the film suffers for it. <br/><br/>This enticing suspenseful thriller falters as it make way for campy horror. <br/><br/>Is it believable?

","As a general rule of thumb, I trust IMDb ratings to represent how good / bad a movie is. But there have been a couple of movies recently that I've seen that have just not lived up to their IMDb rating promise, and this is one of them. Never in a million years is this a 7.7-star (at the time of writing) movie.<br/><br/>First, the positives. ""Get Out"" was very well acted, and all the characters were believable. And I was gripped enough throughout to not be checking my phone every few minutes -- in that respect, it's a decent enough movie. <br/><br/>I note quite a lot of the reviews here dwell on the racial theme of the film, and give it 1-star on the basis that they think that such racism isn't real, and the film is simply ""paranoid."" My hunch is these people are probably white and thus don't really know what it's like to live as a black person in a white society. So to mark it down on that basis is a nonsense. <br/><br/>I'm marking it down because it wasn't a particularly great horror movie, it was somewhat predictable in parts, and I found it a little weird in parts too. For example, the movie was pretty serious largely -- not something you would call a comedy -- but there were segments that seemed to jump into jokey wisecrack-comedy territory, notably around the main character's TSA-employed buddy Rod Williams (played by Lil Rel Howery). Those scenes just seemed a little out of kilter with the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>I also thought the ending was a bit rubbish. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Get Out"" is a watchable movie, but it simply is not Oscar material, and 7.7 on the IMDb Richter scale is just wrong."

Rather using stereotypes and clichés and being racist against specific people who you consider not too progressive, not too open, not too identical to the mainstream. So the obsession of anti-racism turns out to be racism itself. Making specific minorities to feel more angry for any past disputes and targeting specific groups of people by those minorities and by many more. The movie tries so hard to point out this issue, that in every corner you see or hear stereotype racist comments, concerns, bad behavior always coming from the whites. So in the end the movie succeeds just the opposite. To make people deal and feel either bad or angry with one another. Not a good movie. Too bad, because this concept could have been used differently succeeding in a much better result, without insulting anyone and being more realistic.. Not recommended!"

Then like all good Key and Peele sketches the movie ends on an extremely crazy scenario.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele is a genius in the way he was able to create a film that was both a great horror film and funny as hell, but not because the horror was campy.<br/><br/>You can relate to the social issues of race being handled in the film, and it's strange because most of it is not met to be funny at all, but it connects like Jordan is telling a joke.

","""...I take devilish glee in making people uncomfortable"" - Jordan Peele<br/><br/>Sir, you succeed. No room for sugar coating, as Jordan Peele did not do so in the slightest in 'Get Out'. This film may be one of my favorite films in the past decade and maybe ever. Again, one of my favorites, not all time favorite, calm down. This film was so brilliantly done from performance, to story, to the meaning behind it all, to the twists, just everything. I think what I truly loved about all of this is the originality behind it all. Jordan Peele wrote this and directed this. As it may have a few nods to past films (which, c'mon, what film does not take or at least nod to a past film?), it ultimately left me so satisfied to witness such a creative horror/thriller... Another thing this film did so brilliantly was keeping the audience curious until the very end. Although some things could be predicted, I personally still sat there thinking ""what in the f*$# is going on, what are these people doing?"". It is almost as if Jordan took his dark comedic skits from ""Key & Peele"" and eliminated the comedy and let the dark vibe of it run wild... Lastly, the performances. Applause all around to everyone involved. I hope to see some of these actors and actresses in more projects in the future. I received a very strong Robin Lord Taylor (Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin in 'Gotham') vibe out of Caleb Landry Jones and could foresee him taking on more villainous roles in the future. Betty Gabriel has been a favorite of mine with her involvement in ""The Purge"" films and seeing her involvement and performance in this film just reinforced that favoritism ten-fold. Daniel Kaluuya is a star-in-the-making, absolutely loved him in his main role. Last but not least, LilRel Howery stole the show. No matter how dark 'Get Out' got, LilRel's scenes are when the film takes a breath in the form of laugh-out-loud comedy. Brilliant performances all around.<br/><br/>I had majorly high expectations for this film since I first saw a trailer for it and impressively they were exceeded.

This movie is incredible! Its done so well. Jordan Peele really shows us with this movie, how good he can be in the more serious genre. It holds you in suspense and keeps you guessing throughout. It makes you laugh out loud and makes you jump out of your seat. One of the better movies I have seen in a while. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who likes this genre. <br/><br/>IDE describe it as a urban stepford wives, but instead of white women, its black people in general.

"jtindahouse","10","6","17","23 April 2017"," In a world of terrible horror movies, this is near perfection
","I often wish some of the biggest names in Hollywood film making would dabble in the horror genre a little more often. Most have at least one horror credit to their name, often from early on in their careers when they were trying to establish them self. One name I dream of seeing a horror movie from is Christopher Nolan. That would be undoubtedly amazing. 'Get Out' is written and directed by Jordan Peele, who despite this being his debut film, is already synonymous with quality based on his comedic work to date. Still though, the fact that he has made one of the best and most original horror films of the last 30 years is nothing short of astonishing.<br/><br/>It would take me a long time to explain everything that makes 'Get Out' so great, but that's what I'm here to do, so I'll give it a go. Let's begin with the characters. It's no secret that horror movie characters have long since been a major flaw in nearly every film the genre possesses. They are often bland, idiotic, completely lacking in personality and have terrible interactions with one and other. This is the main area I imagine true film makers could improve on things. Peele proves this to be true, by creating some absolutely brilliant characters that I frankly want to see more of even now. Each character is completely unique and the dialogue they speak has been masterfully thought out and put together. Even if this wasn't a horror movie I could've happily just watched these characters interacting for 100 minutes. There are far worse ways one could spend their time.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film is so damn smart. There's a very strong mystery element in the mix, and the way it is revealed to the audience layer by layer is quite incredible in hindsight. Constantly throughout the movie we are let in on certain things which will blow you way, and every time that is just the tip of the iceberg. The clues given to the audience throughout are so crafty and exceptionally conceived that I truly have trouble believing this is the work of first time film maker.<br/><br/>I wouldn't describe the film as overly scary, but it does have you caring very much about the fate of the characters, whether positively or negatively. In a world where most horror movies are better than sleeping pills at putting me to sleep, I can honestly say I was glued to the screen for the entire run time and genuinely cared about what was happening on the screen.<br/><br/>Finally, (not finally, but I better not ramble on too long) the casting in this movie is the icing on the cake. There is not a weak actor in sight, in fact on the contrary every performance is tremendous. I'm going to go out on a limb and say Allison Williams was the strongest of the lot. The way she portrayed her character's arc, and the some of the visuals she managed to portray will haunt me for a long time. 'Get Out' is unquestionably the best film of 2017 so far."
"mike_brunton","9","6","17","22 April 2017"," Excellent horror/thriller
","Get Out is one of those gems, a horror film that manages to be highly original and unpredictable. I honestly didn't know what to expect next, all the way to the end, when I expected a horrible ending, we had a classic quote from one of the good guys. People were saying this film was racist, I didn't get that vibe at all, apart from saying that black people have extremely good genes. It was funny in parts, but mostly eerie with constant bad emotions running through it, from the start with the accident with the deer. As I said, I didn't know any of the storyline, and this made the film so much better. Go into it like me without researching it, and just go on a horror ride. As I said the ending was a joy, but it was a nail biting ride to the finish. Acting was wonderful, the cast did an excellent job of creating a weird suburban nightmare with scientific tones along with pure horror. In short a must see film, for it's budget I'm glad to see it making a lot at the box office. Horror is really suffering at the moment, few new ideas and loads of low budget movies getting average ratings of 4 out of ten, which tells you avoid it at all costs. This movie is a classic! And I want to add, this is the first film in ages that I have watched, then the next night gone back and watched it again to pick up things I had missed the first time. I have read some of the negative reviews on racism, it's racist against blacks, it's racist against whites. This is a horror/thriller film , it's not meant to be read into too deeply! I want to add Chris the main character in the film really did act excellently, you could sense his growing unease with everything with every facial and tonal change in him. Once again, ignore the haters, this was definitely one of the best horror films in ages."
"tristan99","10","6","17","16 April 2017"," Amazing Thriller, with a necessary theme behind it
","I absolutely love this film! It rolls out a story that many can relate to. Not every parent likes hearing the news that their child is dating someone of a different race, and this movie portrays the struggles and inner turmoil that many interracial couples have to face. Of course, the movie is also a horror film, so there's a deeper story as to why Rose's family acts so weird around Chris. It turns out that Rose has had many African American boyfriends before Chris, and the sole purpose is to lure them in so that the family can harvest their brain to certain attributes that they otherwise could not have. The twist is a great one, while many could've guessed that Rose was involved, the movie plays this twist out to great lengths even adding in some of the household help too. The movie also added some key elements of things we see in society every day, such as when the cop pulled them over near the beginning of the film and ended up interrogating Chris even though he wasn't even driving. I think Jordan Peele's debut into directing went very smoothly and I think this is a must-see for everyone!"
"evanston_dad","Null","6","17","12 April 2017"," White Liberal Elite America's Worst Nightmare
","""Get Out"" is going to make some people very uncomfortable -- if they ever even watch it, that is -- and that is the movie's point.<br/><br/>Coming out in this racially charged time and amid outrage over the whitewashing of Hollywood, ""Get Out"" gives us a horror movie that ends ***spoiler alert**** with a young black man brutally murdering an entire clan of affluent liberal elite white people....and he's our hero! He's our hero because these liberal elite white people are anything but sympathizers to the Black Lives Matter movement. On the contrary, they use their white liberal status and privilege to convey an image of tolerance and acceptance while systematically capturing healthy black people and performing scientific experiments on them in order to hijack all of their best physical characteristics.<br/><br/>This premise might sound outrageous, and it is, but it's handled exceptionally well in this rather goofy horror movie that isn't afraid to go for it. Director Jordan Peele shows mastery in ratcheting up mystery and tension, and the first three fourths of the film, which are all build up, are gripping. It's unfortunate that the last quarter of the film doesn't show any of the creativity that the lead up to it does -- it's a rather pedestrian resolution to what up to that point has been anything but a pedestrian movie. But disappointing ending aside, the overall impression the film left on me was positive.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is easy to pick apart in retrospect. The plot doesn't even really make that much sense once one has had time to reflect on it. I'm still unclear as to what exactly the scientific experiments in the film were accomplishing, and a last-minute surprise reveal did nothing to clarify that point for me. But sometimes a movie is more important for being the right kind of movie at the right moment in time than for any of its individual merits, and ""Get Out"" feels like that kind of movie to me. Good as movies like ""Moonlight"" and ""Fences"" were, they were always going to have a limited audience. But ""Get Out,"" by virtue of being a genre film, might actually pull in more of the audience who actually needs to hear its message. It's the first movie released since the Black Lives Matter movement that suggests that, from a black person's perspective, the liberal progressives who are championing black rights are no more to be trusted than the overtly racist. They're all variations of a system designed to maintain white dominance.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"avishekghosh-02557","8","6","17","4 April 2017"," A Genre defying horror movie you do not want to miss
","Captivating, spellbinding and well directed - these are not the adjectives generally associated with American horror movies. It is a genre which is now suffocating under the sheer volume of silliness produced every year. A genre, so muddled by clichés, that it is not worth watching even for casual entertainment. And that is why Get Out stays as an genre defying exception. The debut feature by Jonathan Peele uses every genre tricks available - but does so cleverly that they become part of the cinematic language and not just thrill seekers' staples.<br/><br/>Get Out works at multiple levels. On the outset it is a horror movie. It builds up the suspense masterfully, adds a well anticipated twist and ends with just the right amount of gore. But then in the narrative it becomes a social critique. There are moments when it becomes psychological thriller and makes you really uncomfortable. At times it pays homage to genre stalwarts like The Clockwork Orange but the very next moment it takes a turn towards a socio-political satire. And it does all of these with such an agility that the audience never loses the connection with the proceedings. There is a hero to sympathize with - but the other characters are masterfully played. The movie hints towards an underlying psychology of hatred which is very relevant in today's world.<br/><br/>Get out is an absolutely recommended watch for the movie lovers. Such a genre defying movie is very hard to come by."
"Stootomlin","9","6","17","23 March 2017"," An absorbing psychological thriller, that's even darker than it seems
","I wasn't sure when I saw the trailer. It had the potential to be one of two things, either a very clever psychological thriller, or a puff piece telling us how all white people are evil.<br/><br/>I'm glad to report, that it's the former. This is a cracking film.<br/><br/>The set up; a young black guy is about to meet the family of his white girlfriend for the first time. He's a little apprehensive, but she assures him that it'll be fine, her parents are anything but racist, in fact her dad would have voted for Obama for a third term if he'd been allowed too. But, when they get there, things don't seem quite right, it's hard to explain why, but something's definitely wrong.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya (nice to see an English guy in an American film not playing the bad guy) plays Chris, our poor unsuspecting boyfriend. He is the lynch pin to the story, everything revolves around him, and he's superb. Allison Williams plays Rose, the girlfriend.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer you'll know that Rose's family live in the whitest of white neighbourhoods, the handful of black people that do live in the area, seem to be acting very oddly indeed.<br/><br/>This is another film with a small budget. There have been a few recently, and I'm starting to believe that some films just spend money for the sake of it, sometimes at the expense of telling a story. Get Out cost somewhere around $5,000,000 to make. As I write this, it's apparently taken more than $130,000,000 in the USA alone. This shows just what you can do with a well written script, some good acting, and some high-quality production values, if you have all that, then you have a really good piece of work on your hands. There are also very few special effects in this film, and those that are used, are very simple, you could probably recreate them on your phone. The film relies on its astute writing, and that's a great thing.<br/><br/>I was just asked if this is a horror? No. I don't care what IMDb says, I don't care what anyone else tells you, Get Out is a thriller, and a good one at that. There is very little in the way of blood and guts violence, it's all about atmosphere, about a palpable creepiness factor. There are points where it's actually hard to watch. There was also one moment that springs to mind, that caused popcorn fly around the theatre, but even that wasn't a horror moment, it was a great use of sound.<br/><br/>The story is a good one. The production values are lovely. It's creepy, it's funnydid I mention the humour? The interactions between Chris and his best friend Rod (LilRel Howery) are wonderful. They might be a little over the top at times, but if you took this situation and transposed it into real life, then it would be pretty surreal, it would be over the top, so oddly, those moments fit in beautifully with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Get Out isn't just Chris on his own, it's also filled with a litany of wonderful performances. Everyone portrays their character perfectly. Roses parents walk a fine line between seeming awkward and menacing. Her brother is an off the wall loon. The other local white people are so odd, even for rich white people. As for the few black people that Chris meets whilst he's there, wow, they would make anyone feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The score is powerful, I can't think of a better way to describe it, it adds so much to the feel, to the atmosphere. The story moves along at a good pace, there isn't time for you to switch off or get bored. In fact, the story is key here, you think you know what's going on, but things aren't quite what they seem, even in a film that is based around the concept of things not being as they seem, and the film is clever in the way that it let's go of its secrets, you find out when Chris finds out, because of that, you really feel a part of the narrative, it draws you in.<br/><br/>I was worried that this was going to be a film that states that all white people are racist, and this is evidence of how far they'll go. But its not, it's so much more than that.<br/><br/>I don't want to go into details, but there are moments when you're thinking ""how are you going to get out of this one Chris?"" It brings out genuine intrigue, it makes you think, it keeps you on your toes.<br/><br/>I really liked it. I'm not going to do what a friend of mind would do, and scream ""it's the film of the year!"" from the highest point I can find, but it's defiantly up there as one of the best of the year so far. At 104 minutes, it's not a very long film, but like everything else about it, it seems just right.<br/><br/>This is well worth watching, in fact I'd say you're an idiot if you pass up the opportunity to see it.<br/><br/>A wonderful film."
"CANpatbuck3664","8","6","17","10 March 2017"," Get Out is a Sleeper Hit for a Reason, it's Creepy, Inventive and Topical
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are packing to go away for the weekend. They're both a little anxious, she's introducing him to her parents Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) and there's some pressure on the event. They've enlisted their friend Rod (LilRel Howery) to watch their dog for the weekend and they head out. Chris is worried how her parents will react to him but Rose sees race as a non-issue and is sure her parents will feel the same way. After a minor incident involving a collision with a deer and a slightly racist encounter with a cop, they finally arrive. To Rose's relief, her parents are courteous but they're interactions with Chris are awkward at best. It doesn't help that the staff are any less friendly, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) smile and do their jobs but something is off about them. Chris wakes up in the middle of the night to go have a smoke and he runs into Missy. She's a licensed hypnotist and offers to help cure him of his bad habit. He's reluctant but he more or less consents. What he fails to realize when he's under her care, she has the ability to make him quit more than just his smoking habit.<br/><br/>This is Jordan Peele's debut film as a director which he also wrote. I've got to congratulate him, this premise is pretty inventive. It feels like a twist on the Stepford Wives but they do a good job mixing things up enough to make this fresh. The setup works and as the story progresses, things only get darker and more twisted from there. The movie goes in directions that you don't expect (you can guess the reason that the villains do what they do from seeing the trailer but their endgame could surprise you) and I was impressed by that. So many movies are just content to follow the formula and deliver the basics, after seeing Get Out, it made me happy to see that people went out to support a movie that delivered something different to it's audience.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was really good minus one or two exceptions. Daniel Kuluuya is great in this role, what he's faced with wouldn't be easy to handle and that's even before things take a turn for the weird. He helps make Chris easy to relate to, you go through the stages of anger he feels and you're completely on his side. Allison Williams was also great, she does a nice job helping you get attached to her character. You want Chris and Rose's relationship to succeed and she functions as the audience avatar almost. Some of the supporting performances were flat-out impressive. Whitford, Keener, Stephen Root all hit their notes and add to the mystique of this strange family. I would single out Betty Gabriel, she was super creepy and I thought she did an excellent job. The only performance I didn't like was Caleb Landry-Jones, while everyone else was relatively subtle, he was so much of a jerk if I hadn't seen the trailers, he would have given away that something was up.<br/><br/>Get Out bills itself as a horror/comedy but to me it turned out to be more of a scary thriller. The movie doesn't shy away from making you uncomfortable and the tension really escalates as the movie plays out. Its effective at that and deserves the praise its been getting. The problem I had is that when they try to relieve some of the tension with jokes, the movie isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is. The character of Rod seems to have been inserted to provide comedic relief but it just didn't sell for me. For a movie that was so forward, the character's comedic styling felt like a step back and instead of making me laugh, it just made me more uncomfortable.<br/><br/>This isn't my favourite horror movie to come out recently but I think it also has a lot of topical value. The movie addresses racism in a way you don't see in very many movies. The racism isn't so in your face or vile, its done in a realistic way where there's a lot of subtext when people are talking to Chris that just makes you wince. There were so many times during the movie where I wanted Chris to leave because he was having to deal with so many inappropriate questions or insults. It was well done and progressive.<br/><br/>I'm happy I got a chance to see this in theatres, I almost didn't go but I had a chance to go with a couple of friends and we all left pretty satisfied with it. Get Out doesn't revolutionize the horror genre but it does have interesting and important things to say. For a guy who's known for comedy, Jordan Peele knows his way around the horror genre and he made something worth watching. If you get a chance to see this, check it out."
"zardoz-13","9","6","17","9 March 2017"," An intelligent, sophisticated, Neo-Blaxploitation, horror chiller
","Comedian Jordan Peele of ""Keanu"" has made an auspicious directorial debut with ""Get Out,"" an intelligent, sophisticated, Neo-Blaxploitation, horror chiller with far fewer buckets of blood than a conventional Eli Roth splatter-fest like either ""Hostel"" or ""Green Inferno."" Two-thirds a suspenseful psychological cat & mouse melodrama and one-third a frightening foray into homicidal histronics, ""Get Out"" benefits from Peele's admirable restraint and his levelheaded helming. Gradually, he peels back the layers of his ""Twilight Zone"" tale like an onion to reveal the alarming revelations that skulk at the soul of this sinister movie. Taking their cues from Mary Shelley's Baron Victor Frankenstein, the white villains perpetuate racism like you have never experienced. Fortunately, Peele incorporates some welcome comic relief to lighten matters. Meantime, he maintains the tension throughout until he brings everything to a tantalizing boil, and this bizarre yarn erupts with violence. During its nimble running time of 103 minutes, Peele presents an enormous number of baffling details the significance of which seem evasive until everything culminates in a slam-bang ending guaranteed to surprise and mortify. Furthermore, apart from the dynamic Catherine Keener and hilarious stand-up comic Lil Rel Howery, Peele has assembled a thoroughly convincing cast of character actors who appreciate the subtlety of his low-key approach and mirror it with their straight-faced performances. Essentially, Peele has appropriated the two Hollywood classics ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) and ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975) as the template for ""Get Out!"" A white female has been dating an African-American, and she decides to take him home to meet her mom and pop. Initially nervous about his forthcoming encounter with her liberal parents, the boyfriend discovers that nothing is what it appears. The solitary shortcoming of ""Get Out!"" that qualifies it as Neo-Blaxploitation is the conspicuous absence of any sympathetic white characters. Every Caucasian emerges as utterly repellent, while the African-Americans are saintly victims.<br/><br/>Twentysomething African-American photographer Chris Washington (British actor Daniel Kaluuya of ""Welcome to the Punch"") has been dating his Caucasian sweetheart Rose Armitage (Allison Williams of ""College Musical"") for almost five months. At this point in their budding relationship, Rose wants to introduce Chris to her parents at their remote country estate. Chris asks Rose if she has told Missy (Catherine Keener of ""Captain Phillips"") and Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford of ""Awakenings"") that he is African-American. Rose assures Chris that he need not concern himself about such trivial matters. She explains her father would have voted for Obama a third time. Later, after Chris has met the Armitages, Dean mentions that he would have voted a third time for Obama. Dean makes a buffoon of himself with his colorblind approach and his ludicrous use of boilerplate African-American slang. Rose's parents embrace Chris as a future son-in-law, but he doesn't feel comfortable around either their brawny African-American handyman, Walter (Marcus Henderson of ""Whiplash""), or Georgina (Betty Gabriel of ""The Purge: Election Year""), their absent-minded housekeeper. Missy explains that her parents hired Walter and Georgia to relieve them of the onerous tasks that old age had prevented them from performing. Chris interrupts Walter one afternoon while the latter is industriously chopping wood. Walter doesn't use, Chris notices, customary African-American slang. Meantime, Chris feels like an object under scrutiny. Rose's parents notice him drumming his fingers across the dining table at lunch. Reluctantly, Chris admits that he smokes cigarettes, but has been struggling to quit. Dean informs him that not only is Missy is an accomplished hypnotherapist, but that she can also cure him in a snap of her fingers. Chris learns that Dean is a neurosurgeon, too. During their conversation, Rose's parents remind their daughter about their annual party that they are hosting for their friends during the weekend. Rose acts like she has completely forgotten about it. The last Armitage to arrive is Rose's confrontational, half-witted brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones of ""Contraband"") who wants to impress Chris with his Jujitsu tactics.<br/><br/>Chris roams around the Armitage estate clicking pictures. Georgina behaves awkwardly as she observes him from afar. Apart from a token Asian at the party, the Armitage guests are primarily affluent but elderly Caucasians. Incredibly, Chris spots an elderly woman accompanied by a slim, twentysomething African-American guy, Andrew Logan King (Lakeith Stanfield of ""Straight Outta Compton""), who appears like a fish-out-0f-water. Stealthily, Chris snaps a photo of him with his cell phone. Unfortunately, the flash discombobulates King, and he shouts the words ""Get Out"" at Chris. Now more than ever, his curiosity fully aroused, Chris sends his best friend, Rod Williams (comedian Lil Rel Howery of ""Get a Job""), the photo of King. A conspiracy theorist as well as TSA agent, Rod has suspected all along that Rose wants to turn Chris into a sex slave. Before he left with Rose, Chris entrusted Rod with the upkeep of his apartment back in the city and the care of his pet dog. Eventually, Missy corners Chris late one evening and hypnotizes him simply by stirring her coffee cup. Suddenly, and this is when things really get twisted, Chris finds himself plunging into the floor under Missy's spell. As he drifts into what appears to be an abyss, Missy points out to Chris that he has entered ""the sunken zone."" Afterward, nothing is the same for our paranoid protagonist who awakens the following dawn without the urge to ignite tobacco.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" derives its title from the shouts audiences scream at horror movies when they urge either an individual or individuals on screen to get the Hades out of a hostile environment as the forces of horror converge like a spider poised to administer its death venom to its web-entangled quarry. Indeed, more is skulking ghoulishly behind the scenes in ""Get Out"" than the humble, unsuspecting Chris can imagine in his wildest dreams. Peele loosens all restraints during the final twenty minutes, and everything horrific is exposed. The Armitage clan amount to a bigoted bunch of butchers with more than lobotomy on their minds."
"Hellmant","10","6","17","9 March 2017"," Definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years!
","'GET OUT': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new horror flick from writer/director/co-producer Jordan Peele (in his directorial debut). The film is also Peele's first venture into the horror genre, as he's previously only worked in comedy (most notably on the TV shows 'KEY AND PEELE' and 'MADTV'). The story revolves around an interracial couple, that visits the estate of the wealthy white woman's parents, where things don't seem quite right there (especially for people of color). The movie has been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also received almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike. I think it's a modern horror masterpiece.<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is an aspiring photographer that's about to visit the parents of his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), for the first time. He's concerned because Rose, who's white, hasn't told her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) that Chris is black yet. Things are definitely awkward, upon meeting the girl's parents, and they only get stranger as Chris meets other people at the estate. Things especially don't seem right with the family's servants; who are both black, and they also both appear to be under some kind of possessive hypnosis. <br/><br/>The movie is extremely creepy, and masterfully directed (almost in a classic Hitchcockian way). It's also very witty, and full of biting social commentary. It's exaggerated, but it really does make you feel what it might be like to be a person of color, in a world ran by privileged (and usually quite bigoted) white people. The performances are all good (especially Kaluuya in the lead) and I think Peele has definitely proved himself to be a very talented, and quite diverse, filmmaker. I can't wait to see what he does next, and this is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ"

","Ignore the 1-2 star reviews. The 5-6's are valid - some people don't like horror, and that's cool.

The ironic thing is that this is more an indictment of the ""enlightened"" liberal. <br/><br/>BUT that really isn't what makes this movie good. It is the quintessential ""good horror movie,"" as opposed to the ""good movie"" that happens to be horror (for instance, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, or even movies like Babadook or Black Swan.) Instead of attempting the drama-as-horror or serious sociopolitical allegory, this is classic horror, done as well as it's ever been done. It embraces the hallmarks of the genre without being submerged by them, adhering to the classic formula close enough to avoid the ""mystery"" label. It's got its share of blood, but avoids relying on it or devolving into torture porn. It's tongue-in-cheek, but doesn't devolve into farce or parody. Amongst the best of the decade."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","6","17","3 March 2017"," Nearly Flawless Horror Flick
","Holy crap this is a good movie. Admittedly, it's been a little while since a down and out great film has graced the screen with its presence; and longer still since a great, mainstream American horror movie has so effectively clutched the collective pearls of moviegoers across this country. Thus sounding off on this film might just be the product of being starved for truly awesome content. Still, the nerve of this movie; the brazen, gargantuan balls of this freaking movie – they're a thing of beauty.<br/><br/>Those who have glanced Get Out's chilling trailer will no doubt know the setup. A black man named Chris (Kaluuya) is brought to the childhood home of his white girlfriend (Williams) in order to charm her upper-crust bourgeois parents. She insists there will be no issues, though it's obvious to Chris and everyone else in the room she's being just a tad naive. Consequently when the couple drives up to the stately family manor on the lake, he suspects little other than the usual barrage of forced, vaguely racist pablum. Yet the longer he stays, the more Chris notices everyone around him seems to be acting rather peculiar; including and especially local blacks who behave more docile and compliant than he's used to seeing.<br/><br/>Using razor-sharp social commentary, quick-witted humor and good 'ol fashion suspense; Get Out has all the hallmarks of an above-average, turn of the century horror film. It balances its blunt themes with a lot of expressive imagery and a consistent tone of protracted, off-kilter foreboding. Between Catherine Keener's hazy somnambulism and Bradley Whitford's subtle coaxing the movie quietly spins on an ever tilting axis of weirdness. Every time that spin slows or the film's center conflict starts to wear thin, we're treated to the bizarre, show-stopping conduct of Betty Gabriel, Marcus Henderson and a particularly good Lakeith Stanfield to keep everything head-cockingly strange. And at the front of it all is Daniel Kaluuya who remains understated throughout, though his smirk can't help but channel Sheriff Bart's in Blazing Saddles (1974).<br/><br/>The obvious comparison here however would be The Stepford Wives (1975), which attempted to do for gender politics in the 70's what Get Out does for racial politics today. The difference here is while one faltered in the realm of active, engaging storytelling, this movie keeps use glued to the screen from start to finish. Its escalating stakes and clever little setups and executions become the glue that holds Get Out together as it wades through the treacherous waters of third-act fatigue. Instead of veering bigger and louder like A Cure for Wellness (2017) does, Get Out keeps its tone and relies on its atmosphere and those sweet, sweet payoffs to tickle your brain and keep you invested.<br/><br/>And boy is this, a tense and engrossing film. It aptly juggles all of its various mission statements in a way that is both enthralling and surprisingly polished. Director Jordan Peele (of Key & Peele fame) slips into the directors chair as if it were a second calling. His technical prowess is reminiscent of early Shymalan only with narrative twists and turns that feel organic instead of back-breakingly absurd.<br/><br/>His freshman film is liable to leave appreciative audiences with a gregarious feeling of catharsis while leaving the rest of us in a state of shock. As for me, I left feeling I have witnessed a movie about as subversive as Brotherhood of Death (1976), made by a director hell-bent on proving that comedy, horror and social awareness are not as far apart as you'd think."

","I just saw Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" last evening in my local theater and I was blown away by how clever, funny, insightful, and of course unsettling it was. It was deliciously weird, eerie, and clever from the very first scene to the last, as I sat transfixed by the events occurring on the screen. Watching the trailers and seeing the first two acts of the film made me think something quite different from what the film actually turned out to be, and I have to commend Peele for being able to pull that off so well. It's rare that my predictions for the ""twist"" or finale to a movie are so off the mark!<br/><br/>But focusing on the plot itself, it follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), who is actually British in real life but I never would have guessed had I not seen interviews with him, another testament to his incredible acting prowess, and his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) who have been dating for five months and decide it's time for Chris to meet Allison's upper class, bourgeois-type parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) who live on a large family estate in an affluent suburb. This affluent suburb also happens to be the location where several black people, mostly men, have gone missing for many years, vanishing under mysterious circumstances. Chris is a bit hesitant and nervous because Rose has apparently not told her parents that she is dating a black man, but she assures him that everything will be fine and they are definitely not racist.<br/><br/>However, immediately after they arrive, Chris quickly realizes, more and more over the course of his little ""visit"", that they may not be overtly racist they do hold certain views towards black people that are a bit odd to say the least. Coming from a satirical perspective as Peele, who also wrote the film, has stated, Chris, and indeed the audience, isn't sure how to take some of the things they say, whether or not they are just snide, off-hand remarks or hinting at something more sinister going on behind the polite, cheerful, Stepford-esque facade. In addition to the family itself, there are also two black servants, Walter and Georgina, who also seem incredibly ""off' as if something isn't quite right in their heads. They seem too polite, too well-spoken, and too ""white"", for lack of a better term, to Chris, who nevertheless tries to maintain his composure and hide his true thoughts to his girlfriend, and the family in general. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, as Chris soon finds out, he has every reason to feel paranoid. At a garden party, another black man who seems oddly familiar to Chris, temporarily snaps out of his robotic persona and desperately screams at him to ""Get Out!"" before it's too late. He quickly realizes that something is terribly wrong and that his very life, or at least his mind, might be in jeopardy. <br/><br/>I have rarely seen a film where just about every single member of the cast, from the main protagonist, antagonists, and side characters give outstanding performances, performing all the little nuances and quirks of their character to an absolute T. This definitely includes Chris's friend Rod (Lil Rey Howery), who provides most of the comic relief of the film, but is also able to carry on the more dramatic scenes effectively. Also, I can't forget to mention the amazing score for the film, which is a mix of blues, funk, and a truly haunting Swahili folk song which plays over the opening and end credits.<br/><br/>An absolute treat from start to finish, and aside from a few clichéd horror movie moments here and there, a true marvel of cinema. Definitely the sort of film to watch at least twice, as once you know the twist, you can go back and see the film from an entirely different perspective, and all the confusing pieces of the surrealist puzzle fall into place. That's all folks!"
"tlooknbill","10","6","17","1 March 2017"," A film that asks...""Why Does The Groundskeeper Run?"".
","See the movie and test yourself. I mean really, as seen in the trailer even I didn't figure it out till after the ending credits. There is an ingenious reason for that but you'll have to listen carefully to the dialog from start to finish because almost every aspect of this movie including the title has a race based dual meaning depending which racial stereotype one leans toward. For instance one may think ""Get Out"" is referencing a racially exclusionary threat toward another race when it's actually the exact opposite made brutally evident at the horrific end of the movie. <br/><br/>That's the bizarre and clever way these social issues are approached and questioned from a racially sensitive perspective that flows effortlessly throughout the dialog without being obvious. A well written script that attempts to make the audience choose what race based lens they interpret the duality of each stereotype... upscale white liberals who admire African American abilities and strengths? Or African Americans who view that not as a compliment but as stereotyping? It addresses each race equally without being preachy balancing out the humor and racial uneasiness with an unexpected final solution at the end more horrible than the issues created by each race's differences.<br/><br/>It puts you in it from both perspectives where the humor acts as a release from the unease created from unjustifiable stereotyping by using them as jokes that left me nearly on the floor busting a gut laughing.<br/><br/>All in all I have to say ""Get Out"" was a thoroughly original and entertaining movie."

","The first thing that stands out about Get Out is its direction. Jordan Peele is the true break-out star of this film. He brings an ingenuity and a grace to his direction, giving us a very well- rounded movie. We have fantastic moments of horror, which were terrifying. We have brilliant moments of comedy, which were hysterical. We have excellent moments of political commentary, which were thought-provoking. Peele is able to pack so much into one film, and is able to balance it all with perfectly measured ratios, as if he's been doing this for years. Not every director could go from a moment of pure horror to a moment of pure comedy in a second, and Peele is able to do this without it feeling forced. He was also able to build incredible tension and atmosphere, which is not something a lot of horror movies do these days. They just go from jump scare to jump scare, but Peele was able to craft this incredibly tense atmosphere that allowed the elements of horror to breathe naturally..."

What is up with the opening scene? if that is the guy that went missing, Andrew hayworth (or something close to that) his attack goes completely against the way they lured the others? The Daughter lured the men and then they hynotized the men and controlled their mind and ultimately turned them into ""zombie like"" but the beginning the man is attacked and strangled and thrown into a car? Was he Dead? is he the man with the funny hat that went missing. and again if so, Why was he taken that way? the whole movie was about Hypnosis, not killing/attacking men on the street. anyone have a rational explanation? and absolutely no one is asking about this. Like we all forgot the beginning! but again, I am looking past this gaping plot hole because i liked the movie other than that."
"burlesonjesse5","7","6","17","26 February 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Get Out
","When I think of the words ""get out"", I instantly revert back to that part in The Amityville Horror where a supernatural voice yells violently at the late Rod Steiger. Cut to 2017 and I'm now reminded of a movie with the same title as those infamous words.<br/><br/>Get Out (my latest review) is directed by Jordan Peele. He's actually a comedic actor by trade. His debut as a filmmaker, happens to be original in scope. Now when I mean original, that's probably because I haven't seen 1975's The Stepford Wives yet. Supposedly, a few critics and Peele himself, saw ""Wives"" as an inspiration for Get Out. No matter. This vehicle despite having a lack of jump scares, still has enough juice to moderately give you the creeps.<br/><br/>Premiering at Sundance Film Festival (via January of this year), harboring a budget of 4.5 million (most of it was spent on eye drops, ha), and dealing with themes of race, religion, and the occult, Get Out projects itself like a fright fest from the late 1970's or early 1980's. This is evident even though the flick clearly takes place in present day. There's a scene where a cuckoo family appears on an old television set (in an in-house commercial no less). Then, you get some nostalgic, hair- raising music from Michael Abels (he mostly does orchestra works). Finally, there's a hypnotism segment in which the main trouper ""sinks into the floor"" and is rendered paralyzed.<br/><br/>Visually and audibly, Get Out is pretty evocative. Jordan Peele must have been using a special lens because he captures cinematic images that feel so 40 years ago.<br/><br/>At 103 brief minutes, Get Out starts as a slow burn only to pick up variable speed. Its last act is bloody and sadly, it's a little anti- climatic. Yeah the bad guys (and girls) get theirs but I wanted more of a deadening schism between a Twilight Zone parentage and their helpless prey. The story is as follows: Photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose Armitage (future star in the making Allison Williams), are visiting Rose's parents at their lavish estate (Get Out was shot in various places in Alabama). Washington is African American. Armitage is Caucasian. What Chris doesn't know is that Rose's mom and pops plan on using pseudo-immortality on him. It's all a setup. They are respectively, neurosurgeons and hypnotists and they want to plant the brain of their frail friend into his body. This will render Chris a vegetable and a person unable to function in their brought upon, comatose state.<br/><br/>All in all, Get Out has a blatant twist, some mild comic relief from Washington's best bud (Lil Rel Howery as Rod), and features the song, "" (I've Had) The Time of My Life"" in a crowning moment towards the film's conclusion. Man, you won't look at Dirty Dancing the same way again (or bingo cards either but that's another story). In truth, this is a nicely plotted, well crafted horror mystery that could've used some grander character development. Talk about a cinematic contradiction. Whatever. I'll give Get Out a pass for Peele's keen eye behind the camera. Rating: 3 stars."
"bastille-852-731547","7","6","17","25 February 2017"," A Solid, Satirical Horror-Comedy
","I'm a big fan of Jordan Peele (and Keegan-Michael Key,) and absolutely loved Key & Peele and their film ""Keanu."" I was excited for this film because not only was it directed by Peele, it was a horror-thriller with some comedic elements pertaining to the subject of race relations. It's certainly an unusual concept, and there aren't many movies out there like it.<br/><br/>The set-up is that a young African-American man is going with his (white) girlfriend to visit her family. The acting in the film is strong, and the script is well-written and very clever. Through the dialogue, Peele manages to unpack the baggage surrounding the issue of racial tensions in the United States today. The film's tone is balanced nicely, with elements of horror, suspense, and comedy. Despite being marketed as a full-on horror film, and containing a couple brutal moments of violence, ""Get Out"" isn't that scary. However, the true intention of Peele is not to frighten in a superficial sense--it is to create a feeling of interwoven suspense within the story.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" isn't perfect, though. The film does drag in the middle to some degree, after starting off in an intriguing manner and finishing with a riveting climax and ending. Additionally, many of the characters (including some of the major ones) came off as very flat and under-developed. But despite these flaws, this is an intriguing deconstruction of the horror genre that feels particularly relevant given the current social climate in America. 7.5/10"
"jackwhitt","10","8","25","26 February 2017"," The Horror Genre has its new Gem
","Jordan Peele, the comedian that brought you Key & Peele, is at the helm of this low budget psychological horror flick and his first feature film director role. I am a very picky person when it comes to horror movies due to it being my favorite genre. With that being said, this movie is fantastic. One of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. The plot is unique to a genre that is plagued with cliché and over the top violence. The movie follows Chris and Rose, Chris being black and Rose being white, as they take a trip to meet Rose's parents. Chris notices from the moment he meets her parents that something is off and he believes it to be due to his skin color. The racial aspect to the story is almost never explored in movies of this genre and it is a breath of fresh air. Get Out had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie. The acting is well done and had me all over the emotional spectrum. I would Highly recommend this to everyone that is a horror movie fan. The horror genre has a new gem in the movie Get Out."

This concept is so cringeworthy that I kept thinking that aliens kidnapped Mr. Peele and replaced him with a knee jerk liberal who ignores the facts in favor of being a terminal victim. Of course right off the bat the stupid girlfriend has to get sassy with a cop for no reason other than we're supposed to think the cop hates her black boyfriend and wants to give him a hard time.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","4","10","8 March 2019"," A smart, thrilling, and poignant film breaking through the ""same old business"" in Hollywood.
","I'll admit that I'm not a fan of horror films. The fact that Get Out (2017) was released in that weird, ""horror month"" of February that merely exists so people trying to catch up on their Oscar nominations don't have to watch anything new meant that it mostly passed under my radar. When buzz about the movie continued for the rest of the year, I was still skeptical as horror has been known for its cheap tricks and gratuitous violence, both of which I don't particularly care for. The trick is, Get Out is certainly a horror film, but with the minimum required trappings to be considered one.<br/><br/>With a few jump scares and a violent and bloody ending, Get Out works on a level that's best described as ""blatantly subtle."" It's not so much that it screams about the racial differences between black people and white people, but that it does so in a way that's almost natural and unnoticed. So much of the movie highlights some of the weird and eye-rolling habits and likes of white people that you'd likely miss them if you blinked. Of course, this highlights the terror of the premise, but the comedy in this film helps to break up these moments with some levity to give the audience a break.<br/><br/>Even though I was aware of the premise and some of the major plot points before watching Get Out, I was still surprised by how everything connected. The strength of the plot is held together by a number of parallel themes and motifs that give the audience credit for paying attention and seeing how they interweave with the characters' past and motivations. People have praised neophyte director Jordan Peele for this piece of work, but I think he just saw the formula for this type of movie, distilled it down to its fundamental elements, and made it something all his own.<br/><br/>A smart, thrilling, and poignant film breaking through the ""same old business"" in Hollywood, I give Get Out 5.0 stars out of 5."
"petra_ste","7","4","10","28 June 2018"," Solid thriller
","I was extremely curious to watch this horror/thriller after all the hype surrounding it. I mean, an Academy Award for writing? Wow. That's rare enough for thrillers, truly exceptional for horrors. Not even Dan O'Bannon for Alien, Stanley Kubrick for The Shining and the Benchley/Gottlieb duo for Jaws got as much as a nomination.<br/><br/>Turns out this film is... fine? It reminds me, in terms of craft, atmosphere and structure, of M. Night Shyamalan's early phase (you know, the good one). I liked it well enough, even if I don't quite get all the hype.<br/><br/>Young African-American Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets the wealthy parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) in their isolated country mansion; the two appear friendly and Chris' initial fears about their racism seem quelled... until he notices something ""off"" about the family, their white friends and their black servants. <br/><br/>It's essentially Guess Who's Coming to Dinner... if Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn had been evil brainwashing body snatchers.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first two acts, with the growing realization of a disturbing secret involving Rose's family; I was, however, a little disappointed by the specifics of the twist. Maybe it's a pet peeve of mine but, whenever thrillers feature scientists inventing and performing revolutionary procedures in their backroom, my suspension of disbelief crumbles. I mean, Mary Shelley could make that material work two hundred years ago... but with modern science it's so far off the left field I honestly wish Get Out had gone the extra mile and opted for a paranormal explanation (a coven of racist witches? whatever). In this kind of schlock magic feels less distracting than unbelievable science.<br/><br/>Performances are excellent. Kaluuya is a relatable everyman and Williams is fine in a tricky role. Veterans Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are great as the parents, walking the perfect balance between smug joviality and creepiness.<br/><br/>7/10"
"kendallschristopher","7","4","10","23 April 2017"," Not sure why people love the film the way that they do
","It is a good film, but I'm not sure why people love it the way they do. Like it is a social justice thing or something. I've heard everything from conspiracy theories about body organ harvesting to warnings about interracial relationships and nothing appears to come close to a true understanding about what the film does, and that is merely to provide metaphors for deeper issues about race. What those are, is totally up to you to decide. What disturbs me, is that people want to take the film literally, and the absurdity of what we see in this film suggests, at least to me, that the film was never meant to be taken literally.<br/><br/>I almost wonder if people are actually watching the sketches from Key and Peele and enjoying them for the social commentary or if that aspect goes completely over their head. The fact that we're looking deeper into anything they do or try to figure things out suggests that the joke is on us. If anything I love the film because it successfully trolls people looking for something to validate whatever theories or micro aggression they may have. It is not a question of whether the film is the truth about anything so much as it is a consideration about why we're looking under pillows and mattresses for confirmation about the complexities of race relations that we already know too well.<br/><br/>Watch the film. Yes, things are not always as they seem. But that isn't the point. The point of it is that you want things to be what they are not. But what are you going to do about it once you come into the realization of what it truly is, and who is to say that you'll never do it all over again?"

"terrellrobinson71","10","8","26","28 February 2017"," Jordan Peele's audacious directorial debut is not only the first great movie of 2017, but a movie that makes you think
","It's very hard to describe a movie like ""Get Out"" without spoiling the secrets or the fun that makes the movie subversively dazzling and audaciously triumphant. I even had the decency to watch this movie without having to see the trailer. But knowing the premise right away, I knew that this was an unusual kind of horror movie, one that actually makes us think about ourselves once we leave the theater. Watching it in a crowded movie theater, I haven't seen a movie this stunning that made an audience feel uneasy since last summer's surprise hit (and my favorite horror movie of that year) ""Don't Breathe"". The opening scene sets up the premise immediately and then it'll come back to you later in the film because of the idea of it is surprising. The idea of an African-American being introduced to your significant other's parents and the fear of suburban life for a black male kicks off when photographer Chris (the wonderfully expressive British actor Daniel Kaluuya) asks his girlfriend, Rose (a remarkable film debut by Allison Williams of the HBO series ""Girls"") before they go to meet Rose's parents for the weekend: ""Do they know I'm black?"" She says no, but she did say that her father would've voted for Obama for his third term. Once we get to meet Dean (the incomparable Bradley Whitford) and Missy (the calm and comforting Catherine Keener), Rose's parents, they really do seem like really wholesome parents. After a few subtle, but very offhand remarks that Dean says (including that Obama line and also about Jesse Owens), you get the sense that something weird is slowly starting to go down. Even the happy, friendly maid Georgina, (Betty Gabriel), the groundskeeper, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Rose's brother Jeremy (a eerie performance by Caleb Landry Jones) are acting quite odd. Even the relatives and friends Dean invited are making Chris and Rose feeling uncomfortable. Then that's when the shift start to change and Chris might need some help for his friend, a TSA Agent named Rod (Lil Red Howery, a showstopping comic performance) to uncover some secrets. This is where I stop and tell you who the real star of this movie is. This movie, of course, marks the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, one half of ""Key & Peele"". Here he had the audacity to make a horror/comedy with social themes that a lot of people are still talking about. What people should take away from this are the themes of white conservatism, how black lives really do matter, and how most people ignore the rules of society and prefer to live their lives the way they think they should. White it's sublimely scary and, aside for a brief moment, not over-the-top gory, it's wickedly funny as hell. Most of that humor, which Peele is known to do on the ""Key & Peele"" show, comes from Rod, especially in a pivotal scene with a social moment interwoven into it when he tries to tell someone about Chris' situation, but no one believes him. Plus the score by Michael Abels, the editing by Gregory Plotkin, the production design by Rusty Smith and the cinematography by Toby Oliver are phenomenally first-rate. ""Get Out"" is the first great movie of 2017. It plays its game straight and the movie weaves its powerfully scary spell on you. And, to my surprise, it kept me on the edge of my seat and refuses to reveal its cards to us until the right moment when it starts to get a little queasy for us, the audience members. And in this day and age, we needed a movie like this that encourages us to stay woke. Something also tells that I'm looking forward to see what other tricks Jordan Peele has up his sleeve. This isn't the traditional horror movie you always prefer, it's an original horror movie with a feeling and a savvy social side to match."

There are a lot of racial innuendos and there are even two strange black people who work on the property that may or may not be hypnotized slaves. What horror awaits our young hero? Turns out this white family wants to control the bodies of black people to use as vessels that elderly whites can pay them to transfer their minds into so the elderly white can cheat death and live in a young healthy black body.

Bradley and Catherine play her parents. There are subtle hints that something is a little off when he arrives at their country side estate. Bradley and Catherine throw a party and almost all the guests are White and they all act strange, too. Some will say odd things like, 'I voted for Obama and would vote for him again for a third term, if I could!' or 'Isn't Tiger Woods amazing!' Some even grab his biceps and say something like, 'Wow, you are strong!' Stephen plays one of the guests at the party. There are a few Black people that show up, like the maid and a yardman but they act strange, too, more like robotic zombies. To make matters worse, Daniel finds out that there have been many cases of Black people gone missing in the area. I don't want to give anything away here-it's better to be surprised-but this really is a horror movie that gets pretty bloody near the end-with a little humor thrown in, mostly by a friend of Daniel's that works for the TSA. It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content- no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","This movie is beyond what I could have expected. <br/><br/>The writing and direction is so tight and so focused and there is no loose end. <br/><br/>The ending was perfect, the twists were fresh, the soundtrack and cinematography captured this sense of unease that just settles beneath your skin from the first scene to the last. <br/><br/>The casting was on point, the acting was fantastic, the comedy and humor so brilliant. I was so delighted to find a horror movie that didn't depend on cheap jump scares and random bursts of sound to drive the story forward. <br/><br/>Every scene had weight, everything came back at some point, I mean, what can I say? Watch this film and watch it in theaters if you can. Or at least in a room full of people. Everyone in the theater with me was cracking up or making comments and there were about 4 points in the movie where fellow movie-goers started applauding at the sheer enjoyment and pay-off they felt when certain things took place. <br/><br/>I will be introducing this movie to many people I know and even if you don't enjoy horror, this movie still has something to offer. The story itself is what makes this film amazing and the humor is to die for. <br/><br/>I loved it.

"moviewithmeg","Null","6","18","7 March 2017"," A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor
","The last horror movie I truly enjoyed was probably ""Cabin in the Woods"". Recently, I liked ""Green Room"", and ""Split"", but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" felt like the universe had heard my prayers. A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor, and yet a still bone chilling plot? How have we been so blessed? The balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly, with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense, giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again. All of the performances were pitch perfect (Alison Williams with the keys!), and I anticipate this is only the beginning of Daniel Kaluuya's rise. I often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horror/thriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as ""a scary movie"", you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends. Having Peele's name attached and released by Universal on the perfect weekend (only up against week 3 of Lego Batman) gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is. Creepy as all hell, and maybe a little too believable. 9.2/10"

"jdtoyshow","9","6","18","27 February 2017"," Jordan Peele is amazing!
","Get Out is a 2017 horror film directed by one half of the best comedy duo, Jordan Peele. I wasn't expecting this movie to be good at all. Peele did an amazing job at blending the horror and comedy. Now, I'm going to give you a run-down of the plot, with no spoilers! Go see this movie!<br/><br/>Chris, played by a actor's name I don't want to butcher, is in the middle of an interracial relationship. The couple have been dating for five months, and the time to meet the parents has arrived. While there, he learns that many of its residents, who were black, have gone missing. Another African-American that was at the house warns him to ""get out"", but he soon learns this is easier said than done.<br/><br/>Much like Split, I took a chance on this movie. I really liked Peele's past work, and I wasn't disappointed. The acting were very impressive. Also like Split, I haven't heard of any of them. I can't stress enough how well this movie blended horror and comedy at the same time! Most will assume this is just a racist statement, but it's not just that! Now, let's go the categories.<br/><br/>The Best Performance: Lil-Rel Howery, who plays Chris' friend Rod, stole the show for me. He had hilarious scenes one liners. I hope to see more from him!<br/><br/>Best Scene: I can't really tell you this part, but go see the movie. When Rod is in the police station and talks about the TSA, that's the best part.<br/><br/>Final Rating: I give Get Out a 9/10. As I said before, Jordan Peele is a terrific director. There's not one bad performance! Star wise, I give it a ⅘. Even if you don't like the Key and Peele show, this will really impress you. Go see Get Out! Like, now! Do it! I guarantee this will be nominated for some time of Oscar."

"maurice_yacowar","9","6","18","25 February 2017"," ""Liberal"" white family seduces and enslaves African-Americans.
","The pre-title scene encapsulates the film. An African-American man is puzzled by the ""crazy"" layout of the fancy suburb. An expensive white sports car trails him. With classical music on its radio it stops. The driver overpowers and abducts him. ""Run rabbit run"" now takes over the sound track, supporting the advice of the title: Get Out. This polished, witty horror film is a parable for post-Obama American racism. <br/><br/>The central couple is the liberal dream. The young beauty Rose Armitage brings her handsome black beau Chris to meet her wealthy intelligent parents. Mom Missy is a psychiatrist, dad Dean a neurosurgeon, so despite Rose's assurance they are going to mess with his head. Chris feared his unannounced blackness might mess with theirs. Missy hypnotizes him with the tinkle of her tea-cup, ostensibly to stop his smoking. Dean starts to transplant his brain into the skull of a blind art dealer. That exposes that liberal dream as a delusion. <br/><br/>That revelation is set up by the family's arch friends and servants. All but one of the friends transparently strains to seem to accept the black guy. One portly gent evokes Colonel (finger-lickin good) Sanders. One old wreck's wife feels Chris's body hungrily. <br/><br/>The one exception is the Brooklyn jazz musician who was earlier abducted, to be made a much older white woman's sex slave. The Armitages' maid and groundskeeper have already been reduced to smiling subservience, just like on the old plantation. The new Northerners are on a Tara of their own. <br/><br/>As Dean repeats, he would have voted for Obama a third time had the law allowed. Best pres of his lifetime. But this cheery liberalism is a deception, a lure too enslave another generation of suppressed and exploited blacks. Turns out Rose is a serial seducer for this collective. Before Chris is done with, she's already on-line trolling for a black NBA prospect. Her whacko brother Jeremy — a replay of Annie Hall's Duane — was the abductor in the opening scene, his victim the jazzman. <br/><br/>In a minor theme, the African American community is tricked by its impression of progress not to band together. Chris's security guard friend is sufficiently paranoid to suspect the sexual enslavement plot. But the three black cops who hear him out erupt into laughter. They've come a long way, baby, so they're not about to believe the ancient prejudice persists. Well, it does, as the election campaign and first month of Trump's supposed presidency confirm. <br/><br/>The film is written and directed by the COMEDIAN Jordan Peele. Like the classic horror, it bodies forth our desperately suppressed fears. Horror and comedy are closely related, as Hitchcock often observed. The child laughs at our ""Boo!"" and we laugh at our adult nightmare films ever after, however nervously. The is an excellent film, both entertaining and chillingly prescient.<br/><br/>The film's last suspense is the flashing police car. We assume it's the white cop on whom Rose earlier unleashed her liberalism. She calls out to him for help, clearly prepared to hang the killings on Chris and deny his story. But it's Chris's friend so all's well. The police lights like the camera flashes earlier snap the deadened back to life, from their trance back to reality, from passivity to aggressive survival. Obama didn't herald a post-racist America but a revived insanity."

It's not only a movie that is supposed to shock the viewers modern perspective of racism in today's society and how someone could get away with the atrocities committed in this film.

"mcdunley","1","3","7","2 March 2019"," Poorly executed horror that fails to make its central theme clear
","First things first. This is a very poorly executed horror film. The pacing is terrible. The dialogue is extremely wooden. The horror elements are not very gripping or startling. The characters are one-dimensional (except for maybe the main character's best friend). Compare it to the absolutely excellent Rosemary's baby that has some similar themes and note the differences in quality for yourself.
So, why did it get an oscar? Maybe because it tries to make a point about race and that this is something unusual in a horror film. Maybe that is something unusual/different, but the message itself is not a clear one. Is it supposed to be saying that positive discrimination or attempts at structural reform still perpetuate an insidious us/them attitude? If so, the point is not very well made and gets pretty distorted by some of the cultish elements."
"rrgordon","4","3","7","21 June 2017"," Not really that good
","I know race was one of the key themes but they laid it on really thick. Took a long time to get into and didn't really fit the horror genre in my opinion. The scariest part is the music during the opening and closing credits - it never really escalates past eerie. However, the redeeming features are probably the lead actor and the ending. I think a lot of the film could have been cut out without detracting from the overall quality particularly near the start of the film (first half) which would have allowed the second half to be a bit longer and a bit more tension could be built in."
"dmc101","4","3","7","3 June 2017"," Peeled Back It's Just A Long Winded Skit
","I don't typically rate movies this low but this felt forced, and the acting was ""not ready for prime time"" feeling. I felt like every other sentence/scene the main character was going to stare into the camera for the ""pause for laughter"" moment. <br/><br/>If you've seen the ""black folk are good folk, but crazy rich white people are evil"" flicks, you've seen this one. I get that racial issues exist and I get how it must feel to be treated like someone from the ""other side"" if you're a black person in a white environment, but somewhere entertainment needs to be considered. I felt like I was watching a long skit on Key and Peele, to be quite honest. <br/><br/>I won't even go into the technical problems or the long winded preachy epilogue at the end with the ""alternate ending"". It felt contrived, stolen to a point (even the title from an old Richard Pryor skit.. ""why don't White people just get the F out when there's a ghost in the house?"")<br/><br/>The horror in this movie was it's predictability. The main character wasn't a horrible actor, but other than the massive amount of tears he cried, was basically stoic and ""cool"" while those around him, all white people, were over the top cartoon characters and stereotypical ""crazy white folk"". <br/><br/>Not sure how anyone could rate this anything above a 5 or 6 and not feel a bit pimped out for doing so."
"Nicknielsen99","8","7","23","24 February 2017"," Piecing The Puzzle Together
","Get Out was one of those movies that I, personally, couldn't tell if it was going to be even the slightest thing toward a good movie... I was wrong. Jordan Peele comes out and does a splendid job with Get Out. The camera angles, and great work with lighting and display, add on to the suspenseful build of the movie. The reviews on this movie have been nothing but positive, and this one is no different!<br/><br/>Although not having any ""big name stars"" on the casting sheet, those to me are usually the best horrors/thrillers. The ability to make someone pop on screen, and learn about that character just through dialogue is ornately done, and makes the conversation roll like R's off the tongue. The appliance of ""social flaws"", where its jokingly basically ""white people who say they aren't racist, but really are"" is indeed an underlying theme throughout the movie. Some comedic relief, and references get a giggle out of myself and the audience, but do not let the name ""Jordan Peele"" trick you into assuming this is purely Satire and comedy, when instead it is a borderline-flawless thriller/mystery.<br/><br/>This movie's ability to allow us as the audience to fill in the missing holes, and ""piece together the puzzle"" is something I value GREATLY out of a thriller. Being my favorite genre, along with horrors, and having seen so many, it is hard to notch a solid result. With that being said, this movie hit every peg on my list, and impressed from start to finish. (AGE: 15+ for grotesque scenes/language/some slighted gestures)"

","This movie seem to have a lot of critics and others praising it, so having a boring weekend I decided to check it out.
And I soon learned that this movie is not suspenseful, it is not thrilling, and is about as scary as watching my towl dry up in the sun.<br/><br/>So we have a black man as the lead actor, and the movie it sort of touched on some of the problems that, apparently, excist with interracial dating. The girl, who is white, and her family which is white, and their friends, also white, mumbles a lot of things about being white and voting for Obama (like that is a good thing) and how Tiger Woods is a great golfer... yawn... About here I was actually starting to think of golf, how to build a great golf course, how watching paint dry on said golf course...<br/><br/>I saw a critic stating this movie is groundbreaking - yea... true, it is groundbreaking for insomniacs, the first half of this movie and they will fall down sleeping for sure.<br/><br/>So before I head into the second half of this movie, which is sort of fun (but not in a good way) let me list a few good things about it. This movie is pretty well acted, the setting is nice and fitting, a few scenes are really well done, some humor lands pretty well, and although the ""mystery"" of the story is easy to figure out after 15min, I was still a bit intrigued how they would pull it off. This movie is not horrible all the time. The first half, although kind of weird in tone and boring, is pretty okay. And the movie keep itself decently in its own world and as such its pretty well made.<br/><br/>With that said; this movie is so boring. So, so boring. Not only because that ""mystery"" of the movie is so transparent, but also because this movie do not know what it want to be. Is it a thriller? Scary movie? Social commentary? Love Story? Is it supposed to be funny? It feel all over the place. On IMDB it states ""Horror, Mystery, Thriller""... uhm... okay...
Sure it is not so common that a Black guy do not die first in a ""horror"" movie, and that although he is sort of the token black guy, he is still the main driving point of the movie. Pretty much everything depends on what he does. But that also feels out of place. Not because he is black, but because he is made so out of place and written almost as the comedic relief rather then the main actor.<br/><br/>In the second half of this movie we see it rolling out all of that boring stuff we already figured out, and it is actually very funny. Not intentionally funny. But when you have a black guy almost written like the comedic relief being the lead in a supposed ""thriller"" with a plot we already figured out with tons of weirdo white people around, it get hilariously funny. The last 10-15min especially I was laughing out loud at how stupid everything is in this movie.<br/><br/>I actually do think there is a good movie in here somewhere, and I can see the intent as positive, but the execution and the writing, especially the writing in the second half of the movie, is so poorly done.
How anyone can praise this movie is beyond me, but apparently a black lead and a black director is all that is needed to get celebrated.
This is really badly put together movie and although it have some good traits and I think this could have been good, it is one of the worst movies I have seen. The only redeeming trait of this movie is that it is unintentionally funny. This is the sort of movie you can do drinking games to, but is that the sort of movie you want to get praise for?<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this to anyone. But if you watch this, get a lot of beers and everytime someone does something which is unintentionally funny; drink."

Peele had an idea to impart, too bad he didn't bother to develop the characters enough for me to treat the message seriously. I guess the motivation for everything is . . . racism? The older couple fell in love over their shared love of. . . racism? The thot daughter spends her life trapping African American guys because she's eager to be. . .racist? And how presumptive to think every obese white girl wants to bid on her own black man to imprison (the heart buys what the heart buys). Offensive! I DID get chills from the housekeeper though. That actress (Betty Gabriel) did this thing where she wept in silent misery as she delivered affirmative lines and it was awesome to see that contradictory performance. But. . . I still don't know where the running man got to. Catherine Keener's character was a paper doll sprung to life just yesterday, but she had fun with it.
The pseudo science of the ancestor was a crutch. And the ""sunken place"" is a variation on a device we've seen used several times in several films. Cartoons have more backstory. Besides that, it's shockingly racist, which I guess is ok as long as it's racism against white people. Amirite?

","Reading through the Wikipedia page for this film, particularly the ""reception"" section, was the reason I finally decided to create an IMDB account to give you (lucky people... lol) a true analysis is the faults of this film, and, more importantly, the stigma associated with this film. What I am referring to is the ""anonymous"" Oscar voter who felt pressured to vote for this film as the ""Best Picture"" award winner, lest they be considered a ""rascist"". I don't know about you (dear reader), but I have been sick and tired of ""political correctness"" and ""pressure to display anti-racism"" (which usually adds up to reverse-racism anyway) since it has become popular (in recent years) to do so.<br/><br/>The double-standard in film when it comes to race is tiresome. If a film were made portraying ""African-Americans"" as emulating typically ""Caucasian"" trends at the expense of their own culture... you would have a fiasco on your hands, critical reception would be highly negative, regardless of if the film is exceptional or terrible... you know it and I know it. We are in an era of increasing double-standards, any film portraying typically ""African-American"" culture is usually highly overpraised (Black Panther and this film come to mind)... not that these films are bad by any means (I give Black Panther a 7.5)... but they are not Cinema Classics either. Black Panther being touted as the ""best superhero movie ever made"" is absolutely ridiculous... though the visuals are incredible.<br/><br/>2 major complaints about this film are: most Caucasians in this film are either dumb or diabolical... even though the viewer is supposed to view this as ""tongue-in-cheek"", it reeks of passive/aggression towards Caucasian people... you could not make a film with role-reversals of this in Hollywood today... you know that and I know that too.
The other is the sheer weakness of the ""operation"" and it's permanent quality... a flash of a camera is enough to reverse the effects... pretty weak... although, I kinda think that was the point, Caucasians are too dumb to identify and fix the issue... C'mon Man!!<br/><br/>I could go on and on... but I won't... this is a good (not great) horror film... judging by Jordan Peele's follow-up ""Us"", I think we can expect more of the same from him...<br/><br/>This film is no ""Exorcist""... it's not an ""all-time great""... and Jordan Peele is not the ""second coming"" of Mario Bava... if you are a horror aficionado like I am, pay attention to Robert Eggers, he is the future of ""Hollywood Horror""."

","The movie Get Out is a really interesting production that I haven't seen in a long time. Nowadays we don't see movies that retract racism in a realistic way, but this movie makes us think, is racism still present in our society? The answer for sure is yes, and the movie shows in a very peculiar way that people don't know how to deal with the differences, when Rose's parents and Chris are having a conversation, they always say something that sounds really racist but trying to show that they are not. It shows a really intense critique about the power that white people still have and how they are ""above"" the others, for example Rose manipulates Chris when she pretends that she is as good person, invites him to her house and strange things happen, pretends that nothing happened and maybe he's out of his mind. When she is actually trying to catch him and make a brainwashing in him. But I really have to say that the end is terrible, I mean, Jordan Peele produced two different ends, the one that it is in the movie is horrible, because it is obviously that there was no possibility of Chris has a happy ending, all the evidences point that he is guilty and that is represented in the other end, so thats why I think that the alternative end is so much better."

The beginning starts off with some entertaining banter about Rose's Parents being over the top accepting of her new black boyfriend. Then the trip their begins and things seem to take on a serious tone, throughout the movie I had kept asking myself ""Is this a comedy or a horror movie?"".

The great ""reveal"" is pretty much what confirmed one of my very early suspicions about the movie and the supposedly ""scandal"" behind it.<br/><br/>The movie is really just a very low-key metaphor for ""OREOs"", a derogatory term used between black people in a discriminatory manner. The word signifies ""Black on the outside, White on the inside"" and is thrown on other black people for ""betraying their roots"", and for many different reasons: they hang out with white people more than they do with their own kind; they tend to exhibit a lot more conservative views in terms of politics; their lifestyles/interests/hobbies that reflect more that of the stereotypical white person; even food choices, maybe? Basically, a more blunt version of the term ""Uncle Tom"", or ""Twinkie"" for Asians -- and they're all derogatory but it's mostly people of the same ""race"" that call each other that.<br/><br/>Give this movie a 7 because to Peele's credit, it's still good writing, character development, and story progression. I just wish this was made 10 years ago so it wouldn't have been released in such a politically polarized climate the likes of what we have today.

","I was a little apprehensive going into this movie, because of the rave reviews and awards nods it has gotten since its release. I tend to find that kind of hype accompanies two different types of film, the first being a great film, whilst the second being a poor, over-hyped film which just captured the zeitgeist and got critics drooling for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that this film sits right in the middle. It's an entertaining lowish budget horror, with strong mystery and suspense elements, peppered with just enough comedy not to take itself too seriously. If you're considering watching this film and that appeals to you, stop right here and go and watch it; I'm sure you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>One thing I will say about this film and the hype around it however, is that it's mostly unjustified. This is a good film, a fun film, a very well-made film, please have no doubt. It's just not anything new. The biting social commentary I'd read so much about mostly amounted to using racial tension to create an atmosphere. The central denouement of course expands on this, but if we're being honest here, it's a very silly message which has been delivered a million times before by much more nuanced, accomplished directors. It's basically 'Society' (1989) with added black people.<br/><br/>At its heart this is a very fun and silly film, with great entertainment value. It isn't new, it isn't biting and any intelligence it displays is in the craft of film-making, rather than social commentary. <br/><br/>As someone who likes to be entertained, rather than preached at, I consider this to be a good thing."

The opening shows that the movie will turn out to be a real good one. The second half of the movie is mundane. The use of horror amid st a beautiful first half looks odd. The topic of black and white in this 21st is highly emphasized. The movie also does not give a take away message. The worst part of the movie is ""the ending"". The ending could have improved. A new layer of story could have been added. The major flaw of the movie is that the real cops figure out the boy and girl. If the mission is a secret one, was not disclosing the license to the cops a flaw? If you re watch the movie, is this scene justifiable? If the movie was to focus on hypnosis, then what was other theme of brain surgery? It seems that the movie is dwindling from one topic to the other. The audience would have enjoyed if only the topic is centered on hypnosis only. Truly only the first half plot of the movie justifies your theater entry. The second half of the movie has ruined the first half."

","Have you ever felt out of place at a party? Perhaps a friend had taken you for the evening or somebody from the office invited you over thinking that their group would click with you. I get that feeling a lot. A lot of it has nothing to do with the people hosting or the food, but I've been more comfortable in situations where I have control. Without something to latch onto, I become that guy at the table whose going to look up something to read on the Internet rather then socialize.<br/><br/>Today's subject deal with that kind of fear that I think a lot of people have; when they suddenly feel alone when ironically, when there are people. It usually has to do when they feel the most different, so it does make sense when people of different color are around those not the same. That's not to say the people hate this guy, but it does express how some communities don't entwine with more a mixed race mindset. During these situations, I try to make some casual conversation hoping I can find one person to stick to for the rest of the evening. That's not an option for our hero in Get Out. <br/><br/>Photographer Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) is getting ready for a weekend trip to his girlfriend's parents place. Rose (played by Allison Williams) is white while Chris is black. They seem like a good couple with the proper chemistry. As he's packing, he does ask whether Alison's parents know if he's black. She responds no, feeling that even saying ""I'm bringing my black boyfriend home"" would seem morally wrong. On their way over, they hit a deer which prompts a cop to stop. After a bit of racial profiling, Chris and Roe finally make it to the parents estate. <br/><br/>Upon driving in, Chris sees the groundskeeper whose black. He also sees their maid who is also black. When Chris finally meets her parents Dean (played by Bradley Whitford) and Missy (played by Catherine Keener), things seem to go well and both act very nice. One the first night over, Missy uses hypnosis to not only break Chris of his smoking habit, but manages to reveal personal information. He dismisses the hypno session as a dream, but faces more of Rose's family the next day at a party. They're friendly, but something about them being over accommodating towards Chris makes him uneasy. He continues to see just what the family is about in the next couple of days. <br/><br/>Director Jordan Peele (yes, that guy from Key & Peele) has a clear understanding of what makes a good horror movie; by exploring one's true fear. He takes advantage of the art by not only staging several scenes as intentionally uneasy, but even showing the more horror-like tropes impressively (the entire opening sequence is all done in one take with no edits). He manages to carry that tone pretty well, though it does become slow once thing unravel.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is Daniel Kaluuya as Chris. Had I not seen him on a talk show the other night, I would have had no idea that he was British. I also like that his character's personality seemed like a guy I would run into rather then making him a stereotype. He can carry a movie, even through the darker parts when his backstory is revealed. Though I can give away much, I can say that this films falls in the same category of the original Straw Dogs in one's feeling of loneliness in an odd environment. <br/><br/>I'll give this eight deer skeletons out of ten. I don't know if I can call this a game changer, but it was still a fun movie to watch. I defiantly recommend this for those looking for a good thriller. Step out of your comfort zone and get out for Get Out."

This might sound obvious but you know that there's always dumb people who will take it personally. My advice: ignore bad reviews based on ""racism""; it is an unfounded reason not to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Now, the movie was good. Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor! This is not precisely a horror movie. The trailer makes it seem scarier, when it actually is just suspenseful and creepy. There were some laugh-out-loud moments of comic relief.

"rgkarim","7","7","25","24 February 2017"," Should You Get Out and See This Film?
","Another February weekend, another time for a horror movie to hit the silver screen. Tonight, my review is on Get Out, a simplistically titled tale that is from the mind of Key & Peele's Jordan Peele! How well does a film directed/written by a comedian fare, as always, it's my job to share some thoughts, insights, and opinions on the latest film. So, stay in, grab a drink and read my thoughts on this ""epic"" film. <br/><br/>LIKES:  Good Central Character  Comedic Relief  Well-Paced  Decent Story<br/><br/>Summary: It's always good to have a character you can grip onto if you are going to watch them face the nightmares of this film. Chris is one of those protagonists that fulfills that role containing all the elements you want in a character: backstory, level headed decisions, not annoying, etc. Daniel Kaluuya is certainly one of the better horror genre actors, and portrays his role in a manner that doesn't want to make you roll your eyes, outside some emotional flatness the team made him portray. Yet the other actor to steal the show (not based on looks) was LilRel Howery as Rod the TSA. Rod's scenes are purely comedic, serving to relieve the tension the movie builds up and keeping it decently integrated into the story. These scenes, in addition to lightening the mood, keep the pace of the movie flowing to avoid that prolonged dragging feeling that many horror films seem to have. Such a pace kept the film interesting to me by keeping the suspense at a maximum. Perhaps the biggest strength to me, is that Get Out has a decent story laced with some originality. While not the scariest tale to hit the screen, this film has some hot topics built into the story (primarily racism and its wrongdoings) that go alongside the character building moments of the story. In addition, there is a nice twist to the tale, which may please many fans of this genre. <br/><br/>DISLIKES  High Political Points  Unnecessary Scenes  Not scary  The ending being a little too easy<br/><br/>Summary: While Peele's writing is certainly impressive, tasteful, and clever at times, it also falls victim to being overly political for me at times. Get Out has many scenes were the extras throw the multiple judgmental stares, the rude, overstep their boundaries with too personal (and insulting) questions, or out of the way monologues about skin color that were more eye-rolling than necessary. It's not that I don't believe this issue exists, I just grow tired of directors deviating from the cleverness and pace of the story to make a point in these movies. Another unnecessary deviation was some of the comedic relief moments. Don't get me wrong, Rod's comedic relief was very welcome and had some of the best dialogue presentation of the film. However, there were moments where his scenes felt out of place, randomly thrown in there where they felt more like an SNL intermission than being pertinent to the story. Guess a comedian can't fully drop his roots. His comedic background may also be the reason this movie wasn't too scary either. Again, Peele has done the genre justice in terms of making a thriller with a decent plot that has some substance to it. But this movie failed to scare me at any point of the film, outside of maybe a few creepy stares from the brother or other staff. I think Peele tried to make it creepier from the realism aspect, but outside of that the jump scares were poor, the extras presentation was more annoying than scary, and the theme of the movie takes a different twist. Finally, when the movie reaches its exciting climax, Peele's writing definitely leaves you feeling fulfilled on many levels. However, much of that ending seems to be a little too conventional that takes away from what he built. Things happen in random succession and there are a few moments where logic (and realism) are dropped like so many hot potatoes it again becomes more humorous than fun. <br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/>Despite my doubts, Get Out is a movie that stands out (in a good way) from many of the horror movies unleashed in the last few years. I always find value in a film has a good central character that has development and a well-paced, intriguing story to support it. In addition, while the comedy does have its out of place moments, the comedy is also a welcome diversion to make you laugh, fortunately in a manner that isn't overly stupid. However, if you are looking for a movie that will haunt your dreams and make you jump, this isn't the movie for you. Whether it is the lack of scare tactics or the overly political moments, Get Out's horror aspect is highly diluted in this film, feeling more like a mystery than anything else. Worth a trip to the theater? I'm on the fence about this one, but I have to say wait on this one until it hits home in a few months. <br/><br/>My Scores: Horror/Mystery: 7.0 (mystery element) Movie Overall: 6.0"

Get Out is fresh, disconcerting, and often funny. Racial tension between white and black Americans is clearly the subject, but things never get preachy. I was not crazy about the ending, which veers into horror/cult movie territory, but this is a unique and fascinating film."

Even if that is ignored, it still makes for a great piece of cinema. The acting is truly unsettling, in a good way.

","Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" is a comedy-horror about race with a sinister twist. With its phenomenal reviews and acclaim it's getting one could assume that this film is simultaneously ""funny, scary, and thought-provoking"" (as rottentomatoes put it). Well just because a movie has racial themes does not all of a sudden make it a good movie. We get it! Some people are racist bigots. Just because this film depicts that (even in a satirical way) does not make it amazing. The film is a horror, right!? Well this film ain't scary in the least bit and Jordan Peele relies on cheap jump scares early on to keep the viewer on edge. ""Get Out"" isn't necessarily bad; it does have some humor, intelligently thought-out character decisions (something uncommon in horror movies), and cleverly depicts a forgotten form of racism. But it all still isn't enough to overcome its absence of any real horror, its inability to say something new, and its violently empty conclusion that did not payoff in the slightest."

Maybe because of Peele, because Birth of Nation is more powerful but didn't get the same response from black people."
"sara2520","10","5","17","4 March 2017"," Get out and go see this movie!
","I dragged myself to go see this movie because I thought it was going to be stupid or Wayans Brothers bad spoof from watching the trailer. But I was totally taken by surprise. This movie mostly drew out two reactions from me. One of laughter and the other of fear. Not like a slasher film like Halloween or Jason, but the atmosphere and music as creepy and haunting as the opening scene from the Shining. It's a different kind of fear. The fear of paranoia knowing something isn't right in your gut but you can't prove it because you can't see it but you can feel. I'll admit I didn't find the leading actor, Daniel Kaluuya who played Chris attractive at first and thought he'll be a buffoon in the movie. But I had to retract those feelings after first seeing his talented artwork in the opening scene, his well built body, his presence, his cute dog, his commanding voice, and his intelligence all kicked up the attractiveness of this man in my eyes. I won't spoil the movie because it is an experience you should witness for yourself. The less you know the better even though the movie has rewatchability and it's one of those movies that the more you watch the more you discover or pick up on. The entire cast was perfectly cast, the script was amazing, and Chris was a smart in how he handled situations. He was a smart character that you symphatized with and wanted to succeed and be happy. I think everyone's favorite character the TSA agent and Chris' best friend played by Lil Rel Howery because he represented us, the audience in the movie and constantly kept us laughing especially when the movie became serious at times. Jordan Peele did an excellent job with this movie. It's Who's Coming to Dinner meets Rosemary's Baby meets the Stepford Wives. As the ending credits rolled and I was leaving the theater and stepping back out in the real world, I was still creep out and paranoid. I love horror and comedy movies, but as I drove home I wondered what was it about this movie that creep ed me out. It was not scary like a good slasher film, but it was the atmosphere the movie created, the haunting music, and the paranoia. It finally dawned on me that paranoia I felt from watching this movie is how I feel like in real life simply being black in the world. I found out that Jordan Peele cleverly made a horror film about racism and turned something that is abstract into something that is concrete as a movie. I loved this movie and had a good time watching it. It didn't have me on the edge of my seat afraid, but some scenes were laugh out loud funny. Go see it if you haven't seen it. It is an experience and a movie like this has never been made before. It was very risky career move for the actors to make this movie, but the risk payed off well and the movie is amazing."

Now you are left with no choice but to see the movie for yourself. I wish more directors or whomever is in charge of the commercial previews follow this direction.

If the people who made this same exact movie just switched the color of every person from white to black and black to white.. the people who made this movie and who are in it would be called racists and other horrible names in reference to racists but because white people are the villains it is not called racist and accepted. If African Americans want equality so bad we should star with this problem and this movie is very racist towards white people and luckily white people aren't babies and couldn't care less. There is something very wrong with this picture... Oh and the movie in general sucks regardless and wasn't scary and just all around stupid. I would do anything to get my time back that i wasn't on this Horrific film. Literally couldn't be worse. But in today's day if white people are the criminals and if African Americans look amazing then it gets a good rating regardless of its actual quality.

"Robert_duder","8","5","18","27 February 2017"," Fantastically unique but needed some fine tuning
","Now one thing is for certain this film deserves a lot of recognition. For one, it's the best horror film to come along in a very long time and it's a bit of departure from the new style of horror like Sinister, Insidious, The Conjuring etc. It hearkens more to the indie/international thrillers that I absolutely love. Isolated location, strange people, villagers of sorts...but the film has an obvious not so subtle political tone/message. It's really a creative story. It's even more impressive that this was written and directed by comedian Jordan Peele. This is a really cool extension for him. I also loved that he cast a lot of people who primarily are known for comedic type roles. It was really interesting watching a group of ""comedians"" take this so deadly serious. My only issue with the film because it was so good and so well shot and so captivating that the social message is lost when the answer to it all is sort of ""well...just because."" I wanted like a super sick reason as to why this involved African Americans and it felt like Peele really copped out on the message they built. Still brilliant performances, a great build up and some solid scares make this a must see for horror fans.<br/><br/>British actor Daniel Kaluuya leads the cast and does so expertly. He has a great back story and brings real depth to the role and his passion and his curiosity shines through. I don't think we felt like we got to know him well enough but he made for a great hero. Up and comer Allison Williams is fantastic as his girlfriend. She is so believable and has such an amazing opportunity to impress towards the end and she does that. Her and Kaluuya have great chemistry too which helps immensely. This cast really is fantastic and the supporting cast are as important as the main. Bradley Whitford is amazing as Williams' father, Catherine Keener is equally as impressive. The two of them together are absolutely phenomenal and their chemistry and performances could make this film a cult classic. Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel (a haunting and terrifying portrayal), Lakeith Stanfield, Stephen Root and comic relief LilRel Howery are all literally great in their respective roles. It's not easy to get any comedy into such a dark story and Peele's script along with Howery's performance brings some perfectly dark comedy to a bleak script.<br/><br/>The setting for the film is equally as important. The isolation of this lavish compound and the stark white of the landscape both people and the makeup of the home. The odd tone of the people and then the party unravelling, it's so great in every sense. This will truly put Peele on a whole new level of entertainment value and I hope he actually explores his newfound territory with horror/thriller because honestly to me this was better than any of his comedy but I know people are big fans. 8/10"

"MrPyroGuy","9","5","18","26 February 2017"," An entertaining, original horror film done properly (video review on my YT channel ""Rami the Critic""
","Video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA3- G0rDyTM&feature=youtu.be<br/><br/>Generally, horror films in this day and age aren't exactly the most congenial of sights for movie enthusiasts. From tired old clichés to a never-ending stream of unsatisfactorily constructed and acted money-grubbing PG-13-ers, expectations are set at an all time Mariana Trench low. A silver lining to that is the unequivocal awe when true effort is exerted and consequently a beacon of hope radiates with incandescent luminosity for the horror world. That is the case with Jordan Peele's horror debut ""Get Out"". It had a shite trailer, an unoriginal title, but it veritably blew me away. Ladies and gentlemen of the film industry, this is how to make a horror film properly.<br/><br/>The film starts off with at night with a young black man in a white suburban neighborhood who is abducted in an emphatically creepy manner. Cut to African- American photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya). He drives with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to her parents' estate. They have no idea that he is black. Rose's father Dean is a neurosurgeon and her mother Missy is a psychiatrist. While they are friendly to Chris (in a rather patronizing kind of way), he becomes increasingly uncomfortable when he notices how strangely groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson and maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel), who are both black, are acting very strangely. We find out that things aren't the way they appear at this place.<br/><br/>The true genius in this film laid in its virtuosity at provoking laughs, unmitigated tension and consternation, and most importantly some post-viewing dialogue as a result of its blistering social commentary on race relations in the United States that is shrouded in this impeccable concoction of horror and satirical comedy. When it came to the way Rose's dad was attempting to pander to Chris with some ""black"" words in addition to the statements made by the creepy old white people at the garden party about ""blacks being in style"", those kinds of scenes in my opinion served to highlight the subtle racism that may exist among some of the politically correct. Moreover, other scenes throughout the film play on our assumptions, whether we're black or white, about how certain events would play out given the race that's involved in them. The overall message is left in the eye of the beholder and that's part of the film's beauty; it's so bizarre it keeps us thinking. When was the last time a horror film truly did that?<br/><br/>I am so glad that Jordan Peele chose to keep the jump scares to a minimum, instead opting for tension, unpredictability, and a surreal atmosphere. We the audience are just as confused as Chris as to what the hell is going on and are equally as freaked out. The film's ability to consistently scare, perplex, and amuse the viewer kept me guessing, which resulted in some heavy satisfaction to the slightly predictable payoff. Additionally, Chris is a character we can actually care about. There is a trouble inside Chris's mind which I will not spoil that is touched on in a very bizarre but earnest kind of way.<br/><br/>It wasn't just atmosphere from a technical standpoint that gave the horror its unprecedented vigor, it's the performances. Daniel Kaluuya's subtle performance conveyed suspicion, restlessness, and all out fear with immaculate panache, topped with an American accent so spot on that some slight incredulity struck me when I found out the actor is an Englishman. Two exceptionally noteworthy performances were by Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel, the groundskeeper and housemaid respectively. Georgina's zombified behavior in particular is the kind that will give you some kind of paralysis as you're watching her, she truly was frightening. Of course some much needed credit should also go to Milton Howery who played Rod, a hardworking TSA officer and Chris's dear friend. Not only was he fantastic in providing some comedic relief, a good deal of his hilarious lines brought out some of the film's satirical elements; a truly lovable character indeed.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the trailer of ""Get Out"", the film is nothing of the sort. With cutting edge performances, genuine thrills, eerie atmosphere, subversion of horror tropes, and scathing social commentary on race relations in America, ""Get Out"" reassures us that originality is something very possible in the horror world no matter how absent it may be from the majority of such films. With 100% approval rating on Rotten tomatoes from 131 professional critics at the time of this writing, will ""Get Out"" be the first horror movie in a while to get nominated for an Oscar in a major category? Probably. When the audience in your packed theater cheer and clap, then you know something is done right. Truly remarkable; I say ""get out"" of your chair or whatever it is you're sitting on and get your spindly ass over to that theater pronto.<br/><br/>My score: 9/10. Absolutely brilliant."

","There hasn't been one horror movie in the past decade to get the critically acclaimed ratings and reviews as Get Out. As this review is being written, Get Out has an impressive 8.3 rating on IMDb and an astonishing 99% on rotten tomatoes. Those types of numbers scream potential Oscar nominations for Get Out, and by receiving this type of notoriety, the potential of the horror film/genre getting to an Oscar platform again would be monumental. However, even before seeing the film and understanding the current political environment in America, it is apparent the social message is the primary reason the film is being universally praised by critics.<br/><br/>It's also clear the best way to view Get Out is in theaters as it feeds the crowd with a variety of emotions that include laughter, intensity, and awkwardness. Jordan Peele did marvelously in his directorial debut, shooting scenes with comedic value swiftly into serious, nerve- wrecking sequences. Peele also have written the story-line came up with a very original concept of a social horror film. Racial dialogue was constant throughout, not subtle in the least, with most lines hitting well but there were a handful of duds. The cast did great with their dialogue and were well rounded in terms of performances and screen time. It seemed supporting actress Betty Gabriel as Georgina, really stood out in her role, executing it perfectly but Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams were spectacular in their leads too. <br/><br/>Possible spoilers ahead... The biggest faults in the movie came in the last fifteen-twenty minutes, when it took a different direction in its plot and drew sharp comparisons to a past horror film, Skeleton Key. The very ending was however the most questionable aspect taking the easy, cherry route instead of a darker, more socially compelling ending. There was an opportunity to hit big with the ending but it missed. Get Out is an amazing original movie, great for the horror genre, and will be cheered heavily for possible Oscars. However, does it deserve the high acclaims it currently has? Answer is a definite no."

","Three and a half stars out of five. I deducted a half-star for the fact that it's obviously an amateur production, made much better than it should be by some very talented people who have bright, bright futures ahead of them. All in all, a fine effort and a load of fun for people who really dislike typical slasher films, because this isn't one. <br/><br/>Nowadays, a ""horror"" film can be just about anything including pornography, ersatz ""snuff"" films and documentaries about the government. We all seem to be a trifle more mature now than we used to be, and Hollywood is throwing everything at us hoping something will stick. So it's fun and cool when a low-budget film doesn't just cop- out with gross-out horror or get lost in politics. I appreciate it when the filmmaker actually gives the audience credit for having a brain and using it.<br/><br/>The camera work is this movie is seldom bad and often very good. The acting is surprisingly good, considering that we're not talking A- list cast here. The story is strong enough to keep you guessing and the little ""touches"" that make or break a story like this are there.<br/><br/>So what's wrong, if anything? Well, like a lot of low-budget ""thrillers,"" Get Out begins to lose a little momentum as the requisite creepy buildup begins to change over into the inevitable ""action."" I don't think it's a spoiler to say that things get more fast-paced as the film progresses. It's during this part of the film where we begin to wonder just how far ""over the top"" we're going to go--too far into ""that's dumb"" land or not far enough into ""that's boring"" land. Get Out almost pulls it off-- but in the end we feel that we watched a really good low-budget thriller, not a true work of art that will go down in history. On the other hand, most people don't like art films anyway. Seven out of Ten."

","It's as if nobody remembers 1975's ""The Stepford Wives"" which is precisely where this script came from. Ira Levine did a great job on the novel and William Goldman did a great job on the screenplay. 
Jordan Peele may have never seen that film but what ""Get Out"" portrays about racism was already done--except with sexism.
Think about it...
All these husbands wanted their wives to be perfect little housewives in white, middle class suburbia so they ""program"" them to be exactly what they want them to be.
And in ""Get Out,"" the people want to use black folks' bodies in white, middle class suburbia so they ""transplant"" their white brain into them to be exactly what they want to be in a different body.
I don't know--maybe it's me. Maybe I'm mis-reading the whole thing, but it sure looks like an obvious rip-off that's getting way too much acclaim for what it is."
"cmoreland-50752","2","2","5","15 February 2020"," Terribly dissapointing
","I heard much good about this movie, so I had high hopes. From the very first line of the movie, Get Out beats you over the head with it's themes of racism. There was no tact or subtlety of emotional persuation. The film simply tells you how to feel, which was at times confusing. For example, when the couple first meets the parents, the parents seem friendly. But simply the young couple's uncomfortable reactions to the parents TELLS you to ""feel awkward"" because ""this is an awkward encounter,"" even though the parents did nothing (yet) to elicit this kind of uncomfortable behavior. It really shows a weakness in writing when the theme of the movie is it's only real content. The main character was hopelessly uninteresting and, although the cast showed some potential talent, the eye-rolling moments throughout their interactions took away from any real substance. This is what happens when the ""message"" of the movie takes precedence over actual good film making. There were moments that felt like what would have made a great comedy sketch about racism, which makes sense give Jordan Peele's comedic background. But instead, these ridiculous and absurd moments were actually taken seriously. I honestly had to start doing the 10-second skip-ahead on my laptop because I couldn't bear a lot of this movie.<br/><br/>Oh and then there is the girlfriend's sudden physical transformation when we ""realize"" (as if it's not already obvious) that she's in on the slavery ploy. Hhmm perhaps making her look like a distopian lab woman rather than the normal girl she was the whole time should make us less sympathetic towards her when she dies? You'd think the fact that she's pretending to love men to lure them into slavery would be enough.
All-in-all, this movie was not worth the $3.99 Amazon price I paid for it and was a sad waste of my time."

"chrisg-36226","Null","2","5","6 March 2019"," Amazing new-age hor-com
","Jordan Peele's Get Out is a fantastic new age ""hor-com"" that touches on societal themes of interracial relationships, suppression of voice, and the what-ifs of future sciences of the human body. The film presents itself as a horror the moment the audience is shocked by the sudden and frightening sound of a deer hitting Chris and Rose's car while on their way to Rose's parents house for a weekend trip. Aside from that rather unexpected scene, the movie opens up almost disguised as a 21st century rom-com, which it most definitely is not. From the start, Get Out has scenes with extremely subtle instances of foreshadowing that will make you tilt your head as if you had just missed a joke, but so briefly that you are no longer concerned with what you may have ""missed out on."" Viewers who have already seen the movie and watch it for a second or third time will be able to notice these hints and get that overwhelming feeling of ""I should have seen this coming from the start.""<br/><br/>*Spoilers Ahead*<br/><br/>The first instance that we see where Peele touches on the societal ""issue"" of interracial couples is seen when Chris asks Rose if her parents know that he is black, while Rose and her family is white. She says they do not know but that should not matter. She goes on to say that her dad would vote for Obama in office again and says ""he will tell you that too."" As Chris and Rose get to her parents house, her mother and father both appear to be very welcoming of the idea of an interracial relationship, but the moment Rose's brother, Jeremy, comes home we start to see some tension and awkwardness between him and Chris. The small weekend getaway quickly turns into an entire family get-together when Rose is told that the annual hosting is that weekend. Various scenes of family members closely observing Chris and inspecting him physically and mentally fuel the theme of the uncertain social status of interracial relationships among the older generations.<br/><br/>The theme of suppression of voice is not very clearly seen to the first time viewer. The first night of Chris and Rose's stay, Chris steps out for a cigarette late at night. Upon entering, Rose's mother asks Chris if he would like for her to hypnotize him to help rid of his habit. He declines but she asks him to sit with her wherein she, unknowingly to Chris, begins to hypnotize him anyway. She sends him into something she calls the Sunken Place where Chris is able to see and hear everything going on around him but is unable to control his body or speak. This directly connects to the idea that minorities voices are commonly suppressed by media in todays society.<br/><br/>*MAJOR spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>The instance where the horrors of evolution in science and technology becomes apparent is in the final scenes of the movie. Up until we see Chris wake up in the basement of the house strapped to a chair, we are getting the idea that something strange is going on between the family and the ownership of African Americans. The true horror is revealed when we see the brain transplant process that is about to happen between Chris and his buyer. What is truly horrific about this is the idea that technology is not very far off from procedures like such and perhaps one day could become a common operation to be fitted into a new body as your previous one grows old.<br/><br/>Peele's first taste into horror resulted in a fantastic symphony of comedy, psychological horror, and extrapolating on the direction society is heading. This movie has instantly become, what some might consider, a new-age classic horror film and has likely (and hopefully) changed the game just enough to continue breathing success into future 'pop-culture' horror films."
"paolaapenasoto","8","2","5","5 March 2019"," Watch it, but it would make you watch it a second time
","Spoilers<br/><br/>In almost every horror there is always a monster/murderer that the audience could clearly see that he or she would be the one that would create the trouble throughout the entire movie. However, in the film Get Out(2017) directed by John Peele that was not exactly the case. At the beginning of the movie, everything seemed pretty normal. A typical first visit to the family where the boyfriend gets to meet the girlfriend family and vice versa. However, the audience started to realize that Chris's girlfriend and her family were the ones that were messed up when the Dad used the same sentence as Rose used when Chris was worried that her parents would not like him just because the fact that he was African American. That was the turning point for us the audience to know that something was not right. Which was really smooth what Peele did because it drags the audience attention and make us connect the dots. In addition, this film uses the typical jump scares when the housekeeper just started following and paying close attention to Chris moves. Also, when she keeps appearing and disappearing from Chris. He included the diegetic sound of the spoon whenever Missy would stir the tea. He uses that at the beginning when Chris first was being hypnotized and neither him or us knew that later on that would become the point that would cause Chris to get hypnotized. Also throughout the entire movie, Peele decided to incorporate racism as the pin point of the family because I think they are the weaker race which would make the family hypnotized and do this crazy process way easier than someone that is Caucasian. Therefore, this is a way to show the audience who has the power.<br/><br/>In the last scenes when the audience and even Chris confirmed that in fact the family and including his girlfriend where the psychos of the movie. Peele decided to included blood and murders which is typically what happens in every scary which would make Chris the ""Final Girl/Boy."" Throughout that entire process, it makes the audience engage more with Chris and puts on in the constant fight that Chris have to get out of that house. Overall, this movie was really good because it is one of those scary movies that engages with audience and make the audience be part of the fight. Which makes the audience watch it a second time to realize and connect more dots."

"Dominik528","8","2","5","23 April 2018"," A really good suspenseful mystery that deserves a re-watch (or two)
","When the promotional TV spots for this were shown in commercials, I don't think I thought too much of it; probably believed that the movie wouldn't be so successful, given how many horror movies (with few exceptions) have been failures the past couple years. So I was quite surprised to see how big of a hit it became -- ""100% on Rotten Tomatoes,"" said one of the commercials for a brief period.<br/><br/>Still, I didn't see it until towards the end of the year on DVD (after a long wait on the hold list from the library). I went into it as vague as possible - I only knew the basic premise, that there's something weird about the family, and that's pretty much it. I paid as close attention to the dialogue, and was along for the ride as Chris, the main character, kept picking up all these off-putting things about Rose's family, servants and party guests. I also kept wondering if Rose knew of her family's intentions, or if she was really clueless. As we got to the twist/reveal, as messed up as it was, I saw the social commentary in it. <br/><br/>The ending, I felt was a tad weak; I soon learned that it was originally going to be very different, if not depressing. While I totally understand and appreciate why Jordan Peele decided to change it to a more hopeful one, his original ending would've definitely been more impactful (this is quite apparent by his comments in the audio commentary).<br/><br/>After I finished watching it by myself, I was eager for my parents to join me for a second time on the weekend. This is one of the few times I bothered checking out the special features - in fact, I watched all the deleted and extended scenes and interviews! I also love the theme with the eerie chanting that plays over the opening and ending credits, and have re-listened to it on YouTube.<br/><br/>My family doesn't understand why love this movie so much. I watched for a third time on HBO yesterday, and am thinking of buying it on DVD. My mom thinks it's just because Daniel Kaluuya is handsome, but I've explained it's because you pick up on things by seeing it again, and that's obviously one of the reasons audiences kept going back to see it in theaters.<br/><br/>It's definatley a much creepier movie than I initially thought whenever I think back on it. Another interesting thing is that I saw this just a month after reading/seeing My Friend Dahmer and learned about Jeffrey Dahmer; it shouldn't be a coincidence that Dahmer was briefly brought up in this (by the hilarious Rod), he was undoubtedly one of the influences to this story. I'm pretty impressed that this is Peele's directorial debut, after having only worked on comedy; I haven't been familiar with him before, but now, I'm excited to see what he'll do next (he's going to work on a Twilight Zone reboot)!"

","Get Out is an unusual suspense horror thriller Daniel Kaluuya is very good in his role but must be the replacement for James Franco who was odds on favourite for a nomination until ""allegations ""of misconduct at the 11th hour by actresses he had worked with scared off The Academy voters.
It's quite a good movie I found the subject of Afro American slave zombies slightly uncomfortable and politically incorrect.
The movie came out May last year so I had to hire it and watch on the small screen and it perhaps would have seemed better at the cinema as all movies worth seeing are but I'm certain Get Out doesn't deserve or have a hope of winning Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director or Best Screenplay, all the categories of which it's been nominated for.
I have only one question after seeing this movie , why was the director of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri Martin McDonagh so egregiously snubbed for a best director nomination when Jordan Peele managed a nomination for Get Out, which is a good movie but just doesn't deserve any of its nominations in my humble opinion.."

","Look, I'm gonna be honest. The movie is good. The story is cool, the cast is good, the acting is very nice. It's not great like my friend told me it would be. But very good. It's a dark story, with tense moments. But what really made cringe were the moments when the white people say stuff like ""hey, I like a black celebrity, so I'm not racist, OK?"". The plot makes you hate some characters, wishing they'd be run over by a train. Some moments are like ""you bastard, you deserve to die!"". Because the story grows on you. It's rare to find a moment where you don't feel something. And, in a certain way, I'd say it's a ""polite"" movie. All the violence happens off-camera. You know what's going on and how, but you don't get to really see it. In part it's bad because you want some characters to suffer a lot more, but then you notice that the focus of the movie is not the ""blood violence"", but the ""mental violence"".<br/><br/>But, the morning after I watched the movie, I realized... This movie is racist. Yeah, it's about what a young black dude goes through and the stupid behavior of some white people. But every single white character in this movie is racist. All of them, every where. And Chris (main character) already knew that. Gonna meet my girlfriend's family? Racists. Oh, they have white friends? They be racists. Black people work in a white family's house? Slaves. Obama? Best president ever. Tiger Woods? Not just a golf player, but an icon. Oh, and let's not forget that all white people want to be black. White people copy their style, their ""coolness"" and claim those as their own. Goes to the point where they'd actually put white people's brain inside black people's bodies. And Chris knows all white folk are racists. He tells his girlfriend that. And he is accustomed. He almost doesn't even mind when it happens. ""It's cool. It's alright. My bad. Forget it."" he tells his girlfriend. And, in the end, those white people aren't just racists. They're monsters.<br/><br/>It could have been done differently. Actually, it should have. Not so extreme. If you're gonna talk about racism, generalized hatred and prejudice, you can't generalize to the point that all white people are the bad guys. That's not how you talk about things like that.<br/><br/>But, I repeat: the movie is good. The acting is very good. You feel anger and awkwardness constantly, which I think it's cool. Watch it, enjoy it. And never laugh at a TSA agent."

It's raw.<br/><br/>I felt the directing could of been improved. Take the scene when Georgina poured tea at the table. That whole scene of her standing there for a long time, the awkward staring into the distance and clunky editing.. It was almost forced when it needed to be discreet so only Chris noticed, but the blatant try- hard of the scene made me say, 'really? if this really happened, someone would of seen it'.. Shortening the stare would of made a greater impact. <br/><br/>The music in the revealing of the surgeon room scene was far too 'epic' and made the scene almost comedic. It ruined the 'creepy' undertones.<br/><br/>Finally, the connection or should I say lack there of between Chris & Rose was cardboard. Though, that could be down to the flat script writing between them. <br/><br/>A good film to compare this to is, 'The Invitation' as they follow a similar structure/directing style. BUT, is much more put together than 'GetOut'."

There are echoes of the disturbing Skeleton Key, but this experience falls short by comparison.<br/><br/>The performances are solid, most memorable being from the actress playing the maid, who delivers some genuine weirdness.

However, in Jordan Peele's directorial debut, he takes it up a notch by having the boyfriend be black, visiting his girlfriend's old fashioned white family in a remote town.<br/><br/>Peele nails it on the head with the social satire of subconscious uneasiness between Daniel Kaluuya as the boyfriend and all the other Caucasian characters he comes into contact with. He learns that something isn't quite right with his girlfriend's family, with their African-American 'servants', that raises a red flag.<br/><br/>Things take a turn for the worst when he learns the truth about his girlfriend's family, and then, his main objective mirrors the film's title. Very simply, ""GET OUT!"" From there, the film goes up a gear in tone and the atmosphere is unsettling to the nth degree.<br/><br/>Peele captures the subtleties of uneasiness between White Americans and African-Americans in this film. It goes a little bit off the rails when you discover the girlfriend's family's true intent, but overall, it's a fairly decent film. Definitely has my recommendation."

It might have worked had they not gone off-the-rails sci-fi with the ending. The whole premise of being black in a seemingly racist, remote white community was creepy enough on its own that they could have gone so many other directions with it. I don't blame the actors, because it was their acting that made the plot so predictable. In the end, I'm not sure if the message of this movie was either ""don't date interracially"" or ""TSA rules"", but it didn't achieve either.

","Really outstandingly excellent movie with a changed point-of-view for people of color. So, the plot is: black dude goes to meet white girlfriend parents for the first time at their remotely rural house and then he notices something weird.<br/><br/>I suppose this film works even better if you don't know it's a horror and if you assume it's a drama, but even you knew that it still would be a good movie. So, what whites don't get is that the horror is ..... them! These are basic fears of every black person living in a white society: re-enslavement and getting locked up because you're black. Whites don't have these fears, nor are their fears on the same level or even real. Of course, there HAS been REAL re-enslavement going on in America, the whole ""justice"" system is actually a continuation of slavery with other means. These are neo-Jim Crow laws and whites are openly still in denial about that. Some blacks too, BTW. Voter-ID laws combined with disproportionate prison sentences, ghettoizing blacks into toxic areas with zoning laws etc. does too, constitute neo-JimCrow, no matter how much that's denied. <br/><br/>My only criticism of this film is that its over the top approach of this subject trivializes it. These fears are very real for blacks but whites won't recognize that. Just like they won't recognize half of the micro-aggression's in the film: ""with your genetic qualities"", ""are they really better"", ""I'd voted for Obama a third time"" ""My man"" ""black skin is in fashion"" etc. etc.<br/><br/>These remarks might seem subtle to whites but are pretty hurtful to blacks. Like making gas-remarks to Jews. Or talking to Jews about banking and money. Most whites would get why that is anti-Semitic, but they won't get why ""with your genetic qualities"" is racist. Oh well.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele really exposed a lot of micro-aggression's, but I fear that even liberal whites won't exactly get why that is offensive. Still, great effort by Peele. And that goes for the overall film. No real plot holes, except for one tiny one: If the TSA guy knew that the first black man was missing, wouldn't it be natural to call that guys' FAMILY to tell them he's been found? Especially if the cops did NOTHING. I suppose he was too busy looking for Chris or driving to Chris.<br/><br/>9/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic."

(R)<br/><br/>Writer/director Peele's satirical horror film is incisive, thoughtful, provocative, discomforting, flat-out entertaining; one of the best feature film debuts in years. Story follows young black man Kaluuya, traveling with his white girlfriend (Williams) to meet her folks, but something is definitely off with not just her family, but the entire situation. A near-perfect balance between that which arrests and that which unsettles, keeping the audience fully invested in what's happening (primarily through humor, character development, and the turning of the plot screws) while also putting them on edge and squirming in their seats. Even if one goes into the film completely cold, there aren't too many surprise revelations, and the build-up is better than the payoff, but it's that rare instance of a movie based around twists and suspense and toying with audience expectations that actually improves on the revisit; plenty to think about and unpeel and study at different angles, details and asides that can be missed the first time around.

","The film Get Out is a satirical horror film. The movie is based on an interracial couple (Chris and Rose) and their visit to Roses family. In the movie every character has a large roll. From the house maid Georgina to Chris best friend Rod Williams. From the beginning you can see that the film is heavily influenced by its director Jordan Peele and his great humor. Mr Peele uses a social issue in the movie and plays it out until it's almost satirical to the audience. One of the reasons I enjoyed it so much is for how relateable it can be for anyone no matter race or gender both sides can relate. I really didn't like that get out tried to be like other horror films and have shock scares. It was a failure in my opinion.
On the other hand the cinematography was great in this movie well shot and really made the movie scary. They didn't spend a lot of money on the gore aspect of this film but you can tell they spent time on the special effects part of the movie in certain scenes. Get out pays homage to films such as Psycho and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I would recommend watching Get Out it's a great movie for people that love horror as well as people that don't really enjoy it. I enjoyed every second of it made me have so many emotions in one movie."
"Cineanalyst","10","2","6","16 November 2018"," Not So Black and White
","Spoilers Warning Elaborated: Brief mentions in the second paragraph below (i.e. not counting this one) of ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999) and adaptations of ""The Stepford Wives"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" may contain spoilers for those films, as well.<br/><br/>On one level, ""Get Out"" is about societal race relations. This is the gist that almost everyone grasps, and it's quite successful in tapping into the zeitgeist of such anxieties in the U.S. at the end of the Obama administration, of a lampooned liberal and affluent sort of bigotry where blacks are coveted for their athleticism and coolness, to the point that the mostly-white characters seek to dominate their bodies by inhabiting them--cultural appropriation taken to the extreme. The beginning and ending scenes, especially, allude to real news stories, with a black man walking in a residential community where he's stalked and attacked recalling the killing of Trayvon Martin to start, and the, at first, seeming appearance of the police at the end posing an additional threat to the protagonist in the form of real-life police violence against African Americans. If that were all there were to ""Get Out,"" it'd be fine, but I think there's a deeper level--even, perhaps, subconscious. It's about the representation of race: photographic and cinematic. It hints at the spectre of past and current racism of motion pictures haunting us, but turns those very devices--creating a horror genre movie--to deliver its doubled anti-racism message.<br/><br/>Some have compared this to ""The Stepford Wives"" (adapted to the screen in 1975 and 2004), but unless you're film critic Rex Reed and misbelieve that all the black men are turned into robots, then I think that comparison misses the mark. Personally, I was originally reminded more of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (adapted in 1956 and a few times thereafter), which also centrally featured a psychiatrist and involved victims being attacked in their sleep--and especially regarding the original colonialist bent of the book. The cocoon metaphor reminded me of the pods, and, of course, the black bodies are quite literally snatched and their bodies replaced by another mind. But, Drew Grant of the ""Observer,"" among others, get more to the point in that ""Get Out"" shares similarities with the quirky self-reflexive indie film ""Being John Malkovich."" Although it's concerned with celebrity, the death of the artist and artistic creation, as opposed to race, there's a conspiracy to extend and better life behind it, as in ""Get Out."" Plus, there's the little door exposing the mystery in both, the orientation videos on TVs, the ""sunken place"" is similar to one being trapped in another's body in ""Being John Malkovich,"" and there's Catherine Keener in both. Here, she plays the pivotal part of the psychiatrist who hypnotizes Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) into the sunken place.<br/><br/>The clever part of this methinks is the self-reflexivity. From the sunken place, Chris sees a mise-en-abyme--a framed image within a frame, like a movie--a film-within-a-film. Moreover, it's one that marginalizes and subjugates him, as it has other African Americans. This parallels Chris's story of the night his mother died, when he remained inactive, tellingly, while watching TV. The TV is further paralleled when Chris is both physically and hypnotically restrained during the orientation and hypnotic teacup videos. He's a deer caught in the headlights, and, indeed, there's a motif comparing Chris to a deer. Outside his subconscious, the rest of the narrative of whites body snatching blacks recalls, as well as slavery, an extreme form of the blackface employed in film and theatrical history. Although, in reality, it's black actors playing white characters written and directed by a black man, Jordan Peele, except there's no whiteface, but blacks acting as whites acting black and who still have traces of their black selves buried within, spectators of a screen image of their misrepresentation.<br/><br/>Notice how Chris challenges this cinematic white supremacy. He's a photographer, with black-and-white images adorning his apartment and gazing upon fellow African-American bodies through the viewfinder of his camera. The blind art dealer (Stephen Root) desires this quality of Chris specifically, which is attributed to his eyes, and the art dealer fancies himself not to be a racist like his cohorts, but he's more than literally blind in this respect. As with the rest of Hollywood history, race is part of the ideology of the cinematic gaze, and who controls that gaze controls racial representations--and shares that gaze with the spectator. In effect, when we're viewing a movie, we're in a sunken place, following a gaze that we don't control. Furthermore, to awaken his racial brethren, Chris snaps pictures of them with his cell-phone camera--although it's specifically the flash of light that's given credit. Chris does within the movie exactly what writer-director Peele tried to do in making it, to awaken the spectator from a sunken place, not only of societal racism, but also the cinematic sort.<br/><br/>P.S. I'm glad there's no white savior trope here, either. It's depressing reading complaints of there being no redeeming white characters. Reverse that and see how many movies where there are no redeeming black characters--or any other character of a racial minority, for that matter. Besides, the white cop requesting Chris's ID was no worse than the detectives of other races mocking the abductions of African Americans. Anyways, ""Get Out"" focuses on a man entrapped by a cult. The only major outside contact is with his friend employed with the TSA (Lil Rel Howery)--the role that might've been occupied by the white savior in a lesser scenario. There are no good white people assuming the bodies of the racial other here; that movie is called ""Avatar"" (2009)."

","'Get Out' is what you shout at a character in a horror movie who's doing everything but what a sensible human being would do - looking in the basement, getting into the car, going to bed with the vampire. Don't go there! Get out!<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Afro-English Daniel Kaluuya) is an African-American photographer with an old-money white girlfriend (Allison Williams) who goes to her (weird) parents' country place for the weekend. Get out, says his buddy (LilRel Howery) over the phone, who's minding his dog. But Chris can't. Or can he? Should he? What's wrong with all the black people in this house? It's all good. Until it isn't.<br/><br/>The great thing about Get Out is that it creates its own logical universe and sticks to it. There's a reason for everything that happens, including how all the characters react, and it all makes sense within the movie. It's also refreshing, knowing and funny in its treatment of the Guess Who's Coming To Dinner angle, with a lot of er, black humour.<br/><br/>My fave is where the buddy goes to the cops to explain that Chris has been missing for 2 days. I won't spoil the joke.<br/><br/>As well as good jokes, there are excellent shock and suspense moments too; it's a well-paced, quality movie and there's some class acting turns. It puts a modern racial angle on a pretty traditional horror scenario, but It does this very well indeed. <br/><br/>Ultimately it's an old-school thriller with a social twist; and the gore and violence levels pitched perfectly.

"david_martin_jr","4","2","6","25 May 2017"," Tired and predictable
","A super predictable movie with all the usual horror tropes, it adds nothing new to the genre with either it's premise or it's delivery. I can think of several books and movies with a similar, or the same, premise that do it much better. It was not scary, or disturbing, or horrifying, or even slight discomfort inducing. There are no surprises because they always give away the surprise in the scene directly before the ""surprise"" happens, there was no twist ending because from the beginning of the movie they tell you multiple times exactly who the bad guys are, by placing large neon signs above their head with the words ""Bad Guy"" and an arrow pointing to them. They literally spoil every potential surprise or twist THEMSELVES. It's almost like the creators said ""Hey audience, you're all idiots too stupid to follow a film's plot, so to make it easy for you we reaaaaaalllllly dumbed it down so you don't get lost and there is no need for thinking."". Then the ending (Potential spoiler ahead, it does not give away any of the plot, what little of it there is), but it goes like this: ""Black people handle their business."", one of the characters literally says that almost verbatim as the last line of the movie before it ends. Conclusion: Although it isn't a terrible movie by any means, it's not a very good one either. It's mindless, and run of the mill. !!HUGE SPOILER AHEAD DON'T READ BELOW IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PREMISE SPOILED!!<br/><br/>I believe that the movie is trying to vaguely imply racism in the ""old white people"" kidnapping a bunch of ""young black people"" to use their bodies as vessels to live longer, as if to make you say ""Hey, these old white people really don't like black people!"" BUT, if these people are supposed to be racist, the notion is completely destroyed by the premise. If they really were racist against black people, they wouldn't want their brains going into the body of an African American. Some racist old white dude is not gonna be okay with living an entire life inside of a black body. I think they really wanted to go the race route, but weren't entirely brave enough to go through with it and gave up on it halfway through so as not to offend anyone. It probably would have been a far more interesting movie, and quite a bit more horrifying if they were kidnapping the young black people, and I don't know, maybe lobotomizing them and forcing them into domestic slavery, then when they try to do it to our main character, he somehow kills them and escapes, with lots of tension and horrific encounters, maybe a couple rescues of the enslaved. Now that I would have enjoyed, that movie would have been a hell of a lot more scary and disturbing. When I turn off a good horror movie after it's finished, I am either: A - afraid to turn off the lights and don't sleep much that night, or B - deeply disturbed for hours afterward. When I turned off this movie, all I felt was annoyance, and that I had wasted a couple hours of my life."
"jcjs333","3","2","6","24 May 2017"," Quite the show
","This review probably won't pass inspection but i'm writing it mainly for myself to clarify some things. I like the stars and acting was good nothing super special but fine jobs by all. The flick's dialogue was OK to good. The show dragged a bit but the ending made it all worthwhile. The ending was delightful and i wish there was even gorier stuff but loved the ending. I want to give this a '10' for stirring emotions in me. Now, is where the review may be refused. The show i think will play great to black audiences and poorly but OK to white audiences. And, it will play great to the black audiences because they'll identify with the racism still rampant and 'underground' in our society. The poor under classed folks in our society will flock to this show and rate it highly. We got 2 West Wingers, Williams and Whitford, teaming up to give us some good entertainment which may near cult film status. When in college , in a black studies class , we had this principal of a school give us a talk. He was as white as white could be but Negro blood. That was when Blacks or African Americans were called Coloreds or Negroes. Now, it' Whites not Caucasians. Williams, as Chris, asked the main question near the end 'WHY BLACK PEOPLE'? and the White guy says he didn't much care. But, i think the makers of the film sure cared otherwise the show would be a flop. Nobody would ever dare try to make this film turning the tables something like this: Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Chris Washington and Regina King or Lapita Nyong'o or Andrea Lewis plays Allison William's role as Rose (i thought Amanda Pete was Rose...boy, they look alike)... and you see these other white 'servant-slaves' hanging around the house and a bunch of black people showing up at the party with a few more white 'slaves' who were hypnotized by this Black woman. Now, i'm talking black actresses not 'white black actresses'. King, Nyong'o and Danai Gurria and Lewis are what i look at as 'black black actresses' not some Haley Barry borderline black chic who could be a white chic with a nice tan. I'm getting nasty now but this film is reversed racism is what i'm saying. I'm sure it's a heck of a lot harder for a black black woman like Nyong'o or King to get a role in Hollywood than all those other 'types'. I guess i'm saying i'm sick of film makers making money on playing the race card arousing sensations they think are swell when they aren't so swell. There's an underlining double standard to this flick which is putting down white people. There's too much of it in our whole society now which is Hollywood and media talking down to 'whites' and 'blacks' alike. e.g If you watch sports ads or certain beer commercials and other commercials where there is a white guy and a black guy, the white guy will be the doofus and the black guy will be the smart one. There's even a commercial where the doofus white guy has to be on the broad shoulders of the strong black much smarter and handsomer black guy. If there's a white guy and black guy the black guy is the cool guy to be. I agree racism is real and it's still harder on Mexicans and Blacks and non Whites but shows like this and stupid commercials i'm saddened make money. The show was OK only because of the fun ending. Otherwise , it rather disgusts me. It is 'racist' against 'whites' and talks down to people."

Which, being a white person, I can't fully understand. This film is trying to illustrate what its like. It also has to exaggerate the evilness of the white characters to get the point across. Even after I started to think it wasn't being racist, I still thought it would have been nice to have at least one good white character. But like I said, it has to exaggerate to get its point across. Peele doesn't think all white people are evil. This film also adds some humor to lighten it up a little, which is nice.

","I've read reviews saying that the racism is ""palpable"" in Get Out - a film that's been credited with creating a new genre: ""socio-horror"". What's really most ""palpable"" is something found in basically every horror movie ever made: an emotional state of anxiety and the perception of being vulnerable in a threatening situation. Where it differs, it differs in a way that is detrimental to social progress and understanding.<br/><br/>Get Out is basically about black people being baited and trapped by white people who want to take over their bodies. The white family at the center of the crime ring is comprised of a shallow woman, Rose who fetishizes black men as boyfriends (literally choosing them online like merchandise), her calculating 'smart-type' hyper-opinionated surgeon father, her icy-cold psychiatrist mother who pretends to be caring, and her conceited brother who is just barely able to mask his racist loathing behind his self-loathing. The movie starts with a scene where the brother, Jeremy kidnaps a black man off the street in a white suburb at night, knocking him out with a choke hold and then stuffing him in the trunk of his car. But for the most part, black people are brought in one by one in the 'friendly' context of a (fake) relationship to be auctioned off and have most of their brain transplanted with the brain of a rich white person who doesn't have long to live or has some physical limitation. The family and the people in their social circle are shown as being passive-aggressive, manipulative fakers who are outwardly supportive of black people and black 'issues' in a manner so contrived it appears strange, and the premise is offered that they want black people for their ""superior genes""; the coveting of black people apparently not just a problem with the shallow girlfriend but with the entire community. No better explanation is ever offered.<br/><br/>When Chris, Rose's latest catch, is brought around and introduced to the white people, he meets a former pro-golfer who knows and ""loves"" Tiger (Woods) and wants to see Chris' golf swing, a woman with her wheelchair-bound geriatric husband who remarks how handsome he is and feels up his bicep with undisguised intimacy, asking Rose if it (sex) really is better (with a black man), a man who remarks that ""black is in fashion"", etc. The only real-seeming interaction he has is with a blind art dealer (yeah, right... a blind art dealer) who remarks that Chris' photography work is good (he thinks) and says that unfortunately he himself didn't have the artist's eye even before he lost his eyesight. He will later buy Chris at auction and tell him that he wants him for his eye.<br/><br/>The trouble is racist people feel revolted by the people they're prejudiced against, and perceive their traits as being constitutionally defective and loathsome. No bigoted person would give high praise to the ""superior genes"" and qualities of a member of the hated race, and they would regard the possibility of inhabiting the body of that person as horrifying and repugnant. The action in the first three minutes of the film when Jeremy assaults and kidnaps the black man in the street is the only credible part. The premise guiding the rest of the film is not believable and it undermines understanding of what actually occurs in the minds and social groups of prejudiced people by presenting them as being covetous of the people they hate.<br/><br/>This bad premise is also problematic because it's similar in ways to common situations we experience. What if the people who hate you could really just be jealous of you on some level? That's sometimes the trouble in the ordinary conflicts people have, and it has appeal as an explanation because it makes you feel more certain of yourself and less ostracized or stressed out. When you're seeking an explanation for why someone seems to be after you, you're tempted to go for the one that confirms that you're OK (or better). But hatefully prejudiced people are an immediate threat to be feared and their violence is direct and unambiguous. They're truly antagonizing and angry, and they despise anyone belonging to the hated race; they're not looking for ways to be just like them, let alone inhabit their bodies.<br/><br/>Using a core of circumstances and feelings that are commonly experienced in ordinary social situations to build an irrational concept of covetous racism is an extreme disservice to a real social problem that has thrived for as long as there have been different races of our species to hate each other. There's a big difference between fears that have a true life-threatening basis and common social fears that generally need to be set aside so we can get along; mashing them together exaggerates the importance of common social fears and legitimizes an overblown response to them. In the continual Us vs Them conflict, this is about Us and the irrational ways we try to elevate ourselves and our tribe above Them."

","Chris, who is black, follows his girlfriend Rose, who is white, to meet her parents for the first time. It's a meeting where everyone can feel the pressure. And the racial issue is at the forefront, although Rose assures Chris that everyone will be ok with it. At Rose's parents house Chris starts to feel uneasy. Perhaps it is that all the help is black, or perhaps it is some odd behaviour from the help. And it doesn't get better when there is a family party coming, with many other family and friends acting very odd indeed. Chris is starting to feel singled out, something deeply disturbing is going on.<br/><br/>An unnerving movie. Jordan Peele, the director, manages to take us along Chris's mental ride. Nothing is revealed beforehand, and there is just the feeling, those few odd details, that something is wrong. Like Chris though, we have no idea what is wrong. At the same time, as the weird things keep happen, sometimes to a bizarre level, it takes on a streak of comedy as well. Augmented by some odd choices of music I can almost best describe this as a horror/comedy.<br/><br/>Unlike many other horror movies it is not so gory and blooddripping as others, not until the end, that is. When all is revealed and Chris need to fight for his freedom, you get some quite bloody scenes.<br/><br/>I usually don't like horror movies, but this as stated, is something else. In the horror genre for sure, but so different that my normal objections doesn't apply. If you also usually dislike the genre, you might want to give Get Out a chance. If you on the other hand are a fan of the genre, I'm sure you will love it for it's originality as well."

It's a good thriller. The acting is good, the twist unexpected and there's some STRONG bloody violence at the end. However it moves slowly and there were a few plot loopholes that I could not ignore.

That movie need at least 2-3 good scenes to be considered near 7/10. Don't overrate this movie just because is trying to be anti-racist or fully racist, nevermind it fail anyway. But is true, I had fun time laughing at those little mistakes in this movie that make it ""meh"" is something, not great horror movie, not good comedy, but something in between. 
p.p Here is thing that will make the movie even better, at that scene where his girlfriend plays dump for the keys, they have to make that she is too brainwashed and unaware that she is used to bring black males and one female. That will be so awesome,part of the bad team who is the good and they team up against them. Sadly no good director think about it."
"Ed-Shullivan","7","1","2","19 July 2018"," A curious and suspenseful film but with a less than stellar ending
","No doubt the lead actor Daniel Kaluuya who plays the African American boyfriend named Chris Washington was a stand out and well deserving of his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Chris who is going to meet his white girlfriend named Rose Armitage's (Allison Williams) parents at their home for the first time doesn't know what to expect on his first overnight stay and neither does the audience. <br/><br/>This film bares little resemblance to the classic 1967 Comedy/Drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, which also has the African American boyfriend surprising his white girlfriend's parents over dinner at their home. The comparison ends there.<br/><br/>Actor Daniel Kaluuya's facial expressions are priceless and I give him kudos for carrying this films quality performance more than the seasoned actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener who play Rose Armitage's parents. I also thought actor Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams as Chris Washington's long distance best friend and advisor was the perfect opposite of the frantic Chris Washington. The screenplay reminded me a bit of the original 1975 The Stepford Wives in the vein of being brainwashed and under someone else's control.<br/><br/>My only disappointment was the ending was a letdown compared to the other 90 percent of a very good screenplay. Overall I give the film a respectable 7 out of 10 rating and it is worth watching."

"anselmdaniel","7","1","2","29 May 2018"," An interesting horror comedy
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Get Out is directed and written by Jordan Peele and is about an African American man in a mixed race relationship visiting her parents. The Armitage family is involved with missing people in the area. The family has some African American servants that act strangely. Over the course of the movie, this mystery is revealed.<br/><br/>The movie's story is its focus and strength. The story is well written. As the movie goes on, audiences can laugh at the strange behavior of the characters but deep down, it is horrifying to see others as objects. The story has a lot of double meaning to it. For example, the Armitage family claiming they are not racists. Racism rakes several forms and Get Out shows that the liberal praising of a race can be discriminatory in the way that Get Out shows. In addition to the story, the movie is well acted and directed. Jordan Peele blended the comedy and horror into the movie well and I enjoyed every moment of the movie.<br/><br/>There are some story inconsistencies. It is strange that Rose could have gotten away with entrapping so many people when she is doing it publicly. The victims do not seem to retain their memories and any friends could see something is wrong. These could be excused as the story has explanations for these inconsistencies.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend Get Out. The movie is a tight horror-comedy that does not rely on jump scares.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","I thought the entire first half to two thirds of the movie was the best I have seen this year. Amazing camera and unnerving shots, things just getting very realistically uncomfortable. But the ending is just ... weird. I thought it just disposed of what the movie felt like being setup for. Many scenes outside of the house felt somewhat redundant and empty, not really capturing the atmosphere of the main plot. Still a great movie, just wishing it was building towards something slightly less surreal."
"icasilas","7","1","2","13 May 2018"," Well directed and subtly terrifying: get out is my kind of horror movie.
","This picture honestly came out of nowhere, because who would expect from Jordan Peele, a man who was knee-deep in comedies and humorous yet of poor taste comedic duos, would write and direct this visionary picture. 'Get out' is by far my most favourite horror film, a classy film that does not rely on cheesy jump scares and completely irrelevant stories, it is a film that raised the bar of great scary movies and transcended to a high artistic level, utilising the power of cinematography, dialogue, soundtrack, symbolism and acting to crate a gem , a movie that sends shivers down one's spine without any kind of conventional scaring technique . First of all, this movie is a directorial triumph, with a scent of classic Tarantinesque vibe and subtle foreshadowing and clever writing, Jordan Peele took Hollywood by storm with his first and original work featuring an ensemble cast of both new commers and more experienced actors. Photographer Chris Washington , portrayed genuinely by Daniel Kaluuya, is an African-American photographer who has an interracial relationship with white wealthy southern girl rose Armitage , depicted by Allison Williams, and is obliged to meet her apparently opened family ,but after experiencing multiple incidents inside the family's residence, it is clear that the Armitage family has other plans for the poor Chris. The great amount of fear and plain confusion that Chris feels during his visit is beautifully screened by the incredible and Oscar worthy performance of Mr.Kaluuya , this added to the intimidating and honestly anguishing performance of Catherine keener added more depth and creepiness to the already shocking reality conveyed by the theme of the movie itself . Another crucial element in the success of the movie is the brilliant use of camera angels: the movies is a collection of perfectly shot and unsettling scenes that gave this movie its originality and granted its success. 'Get out' sets itself apart from its peers, giving more importance to writing, seen in the well-crafted screenplay, and vivid performances of its cast making the audience clench to their seats in both awe and fear. But what made me love this picture so much was how visionary the overall directing was, how much importance was given to the smallest details in the film, to a point in which you will always miss something in the first time you will watch this movie.
Another important aspect of this movie was its noble cause, or at least is noble message. The entire movie is an allegory of the racial state of some of America's communities especially towards people of colour, 'Get out' recaps rather brilliantly what has been said multiple times in many significant Hollywood films, but this particular picture meant the most to me because it made itself as a work of art in the process: this mesmerising picture is going to be the best start for a staggering career for the ascending director Jordan Peele."

"daveinpublic-279-224878","6","1","2","9 March 2018"," Was pretty good
","I liked the visual style of the movie, but wasn't too excited about the screenplay. A quick summary: A black man is dating a white girl... they go to a southern town to meet her parents who he thinks will be racist, but she tells him they won't be. While there, he meets a lot of their white family and friends who think black people are physically stronger, more agile in things like jiu jitsu, and are better endowed than white people. We learn that the mother can hypnotize people and allows her racist white friends to live in the black bodies they desire to. In this movie, the white people are racists who think black people are physically superior, literally not figurative. One time, the white girl laughs and blushes because her family is 'so white'. He laughs it off and says it's all good. To me, it felt a bit shallow. I understand that in our current culture, this is more permissible than the opposite, but Jordan, the director, needs to understand that he's raising a generation of movie goers of the opposite race on the same thing he grew up on, only the opposite. White kids are going to think that being white automatically makes them guilty and physically inferior. From his point of view, it's probably not much compared to the racism he grew up on, but still, the kids watching this movie didn't do those things to him. Feels like he's taking the racism dialogue in the wrong direction. He did a good job on the shot composition, color correction, music, etc, but he needs to find more elegant solutions to address the racial inequality he sees around him."
"heathhawking","7","1","2","6 March 2018"," Thrilling but Overrated
","I'd been postponing to watch this movie for a long time. Not having found any interesting movie as I wanted, finally I decided to see if it's a good movie as much as the people say. At first I thought that it was going to have a cerebral scenario but it does have a very straightforward one.<br/><br/> As you now, Daniel Kaluuya was nominated for Oscar, but he didn't get it. I didn't think he would anyway. But I have to admit that, he remarkably acted well. You can feel the emotions and anxiety through his eyes. I'm a bit surprised to see his unexpected performance. <br/><br/> The scenario is Achilles heel, the movie was relatively short and this may be the main cause why you feels so empty when the credits begin to roll. I don't want to give any spoiler but the less expectation you have the more joy you have is how I can summarize the movie."
"michaelnicholasluciano","5","1","2","25 January 2018"," A Perfect Dichotomy in Film
","This movie manages to perfectly ride the line between having some great aspects and some really horrible ones at the same time. The acting, cinematography and music are immaculate throughout the movie but it can't resuscitate the plot and confusing theme.<br/><br/>The tropes and cliches of the characters are so over the top during the first 1/2 that a theme of satire feels like its being presented but by the end under a barrage of underlying and overt social commentary it tries to demand you take them seriously in what feels like a campy, predictable twist of events. Definitely not horror, definitely not comical; Much more of a middle of the road thriller that is becomes easily forgettable with a glacially slow middle section, non-sensensical beginning and a walk-off-into-the-night ending. Much of the dialogue was forgettable and almost felt comically forced at times. The climax scenes considered horror weren't anything special at all. The only really great parts are the ones that obviously are a take on a Black Mirror episode.<br/><br/>Ultimately this movie comes across to me as a shell of an idea that they scripted and filled in voids with vapid social commentary and forced cliches. I still think there could have been 1,000 different ways they could have made this into a great movie and I really wanted it to live up to the hype. The heart of a great idea is there its just the execution and confusing plot, beginning, ending and tone that squanders it.<br/><br/>What I keep noticing in movies coming out recently is a penchant for hitting you over the head with information and forcing how you should feel rather than building character, theme and plot. Its really ineffective and lazy. I guess I just prefer more subtle psychological horror like The Shining or something like American History X where it doesn't forcibly spell out everything like we so much of in this Twitter generation."

"californiarecordshop","3","5","24","19 September 2017"," Average movie B-movie and Hollywood sucks the blacksnake
","This is an average movie. You could almost say it is a remake of 'The Stepford Wives' but with black people and a bit of 'Guess who's coming to dinner'. Not an original premise in anyway. If this movie was made by a white director/writer I don't think it would be getting all the attention and acclaim it has received. The main idea is ludicrous. The frontal cortex and parietal lobes in the front part of the brain are where personality resides. There is no personality left in the lower parts of the brain. Remove those upper portions and your left with the Medulla and Pons and other lower portions of the brains that serve mostly the autonomic functions like heartbeat and respiration. The exposition portion of the film, which in a good film is the best part usually, is just stupid and does nothing to enhance the film or our knowledge of what is happening. It starts off good, but steadily declines as the movie goes on. As we get towards the end it degenerates into a standard B-movie reel. The violence for no reason at all, in killing the father with the antlers, as if he wouldn't have heard him coming down the hall. Who starts a brain procedure without both patients being ready in the same non-sterile room with the door open? The villain brother whom by all means is DEAD or critically injured, comes back to life at the end somehow a la Jason and every other horror movie cliché villain for one more pointless jump-scare, which none got me at all, the predictability of it. The black guy bashed the brother's skull in with a heavy object - a croquet ball I believe. People are frail. There was plenty of blood shown and the force with which he hits him numerous times in the head is substantial, yet I'm supposed to believe that he jumps right up later to continue fighting the uninjured Black Guy? The 'Deus Ex Machina' TSA guy is lame, somehow he comes to save the day at the end, without any information whatsoever and shows up at exactly the right moment. Burn Hollywood Burn. This trope is used in every Hollywood movie - stop using 'Deus Ex Machina' please people, just stop. I have trouble believing any of the white family characters are real. Especially the girlfriend. This is a person that only exists in movies. No girl her age would be acting the way she does, ever. I could continue my rant, but I've already wasted too much valuable time already. With such critical acclaim I was sincerely disappointed. Its my sincere belief that with all the 'White- Washing' backlash recently for movies like 'Ghost in the Shell' and others, that Hollywood and the critics are just riding the black man's jock to make a token gesture to black film maker's ""see? we're not racist"". Now please someone call me a racist because I didn't like this film as much as everyone else did. I would have re-done the second half completely; left a lot of ideas unclear; if it had continued with the established unacknowledged condescension and creepiness of how the whites were treating the blacks - as objects of curiosity, and gave us a non-Hollywood ending where he undergoes the surgery, but we're not sure exactly if that is bad or good in the end, would have been much less Hollywood, and much more interesting in a broader social context. If it explored the idea if a white brain would do better in a black body, or a black person would do better with a white brain, now you've got me. Instead we get Jason XXXXIIIII horror-movie idiocy. F*** you critics. 99% on Rotten Tomatoes? I now know not to pay any attention to that sites ratings whatsoever. First half of film I give an 6 - second half a 2 for an average of 3.

Peele slowly introduces the audience into an interracial city couple. They go to the suburbs to visit Rose's parents. They all seem so happy to meet her African American boyfriend. It just seems too good to be true. Their employees, an African American housekeeper named Georgina and Walter who worked the grounds are just strange and off to Chris. The next day at the strangest party, we meet very eager middle aged caucasians and a very strange silent bingo game. Peele carefully reveals the secrets to the audience layer by layer. There is not that much gore and violence until the end. Peele was masterful at building the suspense, intrigue and dilemma. There were a few minor questions about the motives behind the secret. I don't want to spoil the plot. The film slowly builds to thrilling conclusion and that's what makes it a great thriller. Peele was careful about slowly building that with every scene and sentence. You just couldn't help yourself once you first start watching it. I enjoyed the performances from Whitford, Keener and Stephen Root as well.

It speaks out as one of the best films of 2017 while it flew under the radar.<br/><br/>I never saw the trailers for the film and so I never heard about the movie till 2019. I finally had the chance to catch the movie and the film is well-written but beyond that it's one of the best acted films I've seen in a long, long time. Daniel impresses most of all but it's also the supporting cast of Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel, LaKeith Stanfield and especially Allison Williams that bring the film to life.<br/><br/>Chris Washington (Kaluuya) is the first black boyfriend for Rose Armitage (Williams) and she's bringing home to her parents to have them meet over the weekend. Rose forgets about a party that is held that weekend in honour of her grandfather and Chris feels uneasy as the party goes on and all the guests act strange.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for the film to delve into the horror aspect. When Chris goes to have a cigarette we are greeted to hypnotism from Missy (Catherine Keener, another great performance). Rose's mother makes you feel uncomfortable during the entire scene and you really feel Daniel's performance in the scene as well.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away here, I'll say that the film itself impressed me very much as it was Jordan's first feature-length film and he's not known for the horror genre. I'll give a lot of credit to the film's success on the actors' performances but Peele I think is set for a future of success."

Being from the northern va area, seeing interracial relationships is nothing special so I wish society would stop treating them like unicorn sightings. ON to the movie... POSSIBLE SPOILERS Coming from a sketch comedy background, I commend Peele's efforts however I didn't find the movie That Funny nor scary plus there were a few plot holes. 1) what the heck made Williams character so DESIRABLE to colored folks?? She's attractive but doesn't have a platinum vagina 2) if the family was aiming for strong nubile folks how did she discover Chris? Yea he was in shape but his body wouldn't have won him internet attention. 3) How did the physical control of those hypnotized work when/if they died? 4) there was never any explanation as to y African Americans were the target? 5) what made Chris's eyes & brains so desirable to the blind dude?... I jus have more questions than answers with this flick. I would've liked it better if my questions had been answered."

","The main plot is very idiotic. I am not even sure that the 'White' family is racist or not. I don't understand why the woman who lures black folks into trap does not use alias.Cotton scene was utterly stupid as you would be used to seeing them in a stupid horror movie.The ending, well, it sucked. No black, with the blood of a 'decent white' family on his hand could walk free under those circumstances. <br/><br/>The movie is yet watchable, though i would not recommend it to anyone. The best racially charged conversation in the movie for me was, that the White family saying they voted for Obama, like Tiger Woods et cetera so should not be considered racist. While this is not a genius work, was worth a laugh."
"guidegoldblatt","8","2","7","29 April 2017"," Very Good but a Bit Overrated
","As I begin this review, I can't help but wonder if my review is influenced by the fact that I saw this movie several weeks after it was released. So much praise was heaped on Get Out that I went in expecting something akin to Citizen Kane or The Godfather. I liked Get Out a great deal, but I don't think it's ultimately worthy of its outstanding reviews. <br/><br/>It is a very good movie, that contains some great social commentary about race in America. As a person of color, I couldn't but help but laugh at some of the inside jokes. This is not to say that whites will not enjoy the movie, though I am sure some will take offense at the depiction of all the white people in the film. <br/><br/>The movie starts a bit slow and meanders a bit before the real suspense kicks in. As Chris starts to wonder what the hell is going on in the Armitage household, I found myself at the edge of my seat wondering what what going to happen. The ending is satisfying and generally ties things up well. <br/><br/>Overall, an exciting, clever, and well-written movie that contains great insights on race relations in America. Definitely worth seeing!"

","The lead actor is really good. This is why, in the beginning, I thought I could take this movie seriously. Seriously as in a well-made movie, but still funny. But that wasn't the case. Just because it's Jordan Peele directing doesn't mean it's going to be awesome, unfortunately. Even though I do find his comedy to be intelligent and enjoyable. But this movie wants to play up racism and murder in a way that I just can't grab onto."
"ebyandsmartie-307-448527","7","2","7","9 March 2017"," Stand out performances, but it is far from 100% original
","SPOILERS, don't read on unless you've seen the film or just do not care!<br/><br/>'Get Out' has good pace, great performances and a good script, but so many keep going on about its originality I have to point out the following.<br/><br/>'Get Out' is a very good film, but it takes its themes from many films that have gone before. Some use similar cultural references, 'Skeleton Key' (2005) and 'Angel Heart' (1987). These don't use surgery to complete the transference, they use the supernatural. Mind transference is also touched upon in both, 'The Stepford Wives' (1975 & 2004), which I've read Jordan Peele references.<br/><br/>Obviously, when you start watching a film where everyone tells you it is going to have a twist you can't avoid looking for it. The trailer even implies what could be happening. Half way through it came to me, a forgotten cult film from 1973, 'Nothing But the Night'. I wouldn't call it a classic, but its a very clever idea and stars Peter Chusing and Christopher Lee. The film hides its final reveal too well, to the point where at the end, to avoid confusion, a tonne of exposition dialogue has to be used to explain. In this film, old people transfer their minds into those of orphaned children, with a plan to continue doing this to live forever.<br/><br/>'Nothing But the Night' (1973) has white old rich people using their power, influence and wealth to stay young by taking over those who won't be missed. But are caught out when someone comes looking.<br/><br/>Finally, just listen to this clip of Eddie Murphy's stand-up (The Amityville Get Out) on how white people and black people relate to events in horror films https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IH6IeiLtts"
"stancym-1","2","4","20","31 March 2018"," Get Out before you watch this movie!
","SAD. It started off OK if you can swallow the ""all white people are hypocrites, all white people are phony,"" ""all white people are not trustworthy"" theme.....but then it slipped into a rip off of three movies: The Stepford Wives (the original), Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen. Loosely speaking.....and the first two are infinitely better films. What really earned it a TWO rating for me was the last part, where it deteriorated into a pure slasher film. Pure gore, pure horror. And totally ridiculous. This was totally unnecessary for us to get the point. This is why the other mentioned films were far superior. <br/><br/>Best script of the year according to Oscar? Hard to believe. Hip and PC and Hollywood-pleasing does not mean outstanding writing is assured.<br/><br/>The lead male actor was very good in his role not to mention eye candy. I will look for him in future films that are more worthy of his talents."

"powermandan","2","4","21","11 March 2018"," An Atrocious Piece of Filth!
","This is supposed to pass as an excellent film these days? Sheesh!<br/><br/>Funnyman Jordan Peele's directorial debut became the biggest sleeper hit in years. The sole reason for this is because Jordan Peele abandons his successful comedy trope for a 100% gritty film. Just because someone goes out of their comfort zone, does not mean the result is anything good. He tries to make a modern-day horror/thriller with a black lives matter theme, which fail dismally.<br/><br/>'Get Out' has a very promising start. Chris is a black man in his early 20's and is dating white Rose. They've been going out long enough where it's time for him to meet her family. Her family is wealthy and they live in a remote area in the woods. He is a little uncomfortable since he's the only black guy among them. He meets some other black people in the area that act weird. He's even getting some hypnosis therapy from Rose's mother (Catherine Keener). So far, the movie is very well done. The filming is excellent, the narrative is exciting, and it's weird enough to keep the audience begging for more. When I first saw this, I was expecting this to go for a 'Vanilla Sky' or 'The Game' kind of explanation for all the bizarre things happening to Chris. But nooooooooooooooo!!!<br/><br/>There's a twist that happens a little more than half way through that had me turning this off right away the first time I watched it. From that point on, the film hits the bottom of the barrel. It turns out that Rose and her family get black people to come to her family then her mother does heavy duty hypnosis so that they become slaves and sex slaves. I'm not making this up. This is an extremely stupid and retarded concept. Chris' best friend, Rod, is babysitting his dog and Chris is giving him some low-downs of the weird things that have been happening. Rod figures out the brainwashing scheme and reports it to the police. They laugh their heads off. They're right! Howcome none of the audience members or critics that saw the movie didn't think the same as these cops?!? So Chris gets out in one piece, but not without a fight. Him getting revenge on the family is pretty cool. These people getting destroyed was the only way of this movie getting any kind of redemption.<br/><br/>When the twist gets revealed, 'Get Out' immediately becomes the single worst concept for a horror/thriller I've ever seen. The best way to describe the weakness of the movie is ""mean-spirited."" ""Mean-spirited"" is unrealistic (the movie is very unrealistic) cruelty without any payoff. Watching 'Get Out' is like watching a 7-year-old kind getting mercilessly bullied by an 8th-grader.<br/><br/>If you have an ounce of self-respect, you will stay away from this mean-spirited insult of a film!<br/><br/>1/4"

","Really wanted to like this movie and like Jordan Peele. Thought it was cool to see him get recognition for something other than comedy. However, the film is very overrated. To simplify the plot..... People are getting kidnapped, then hypnotized to become slaves, then auctioned off, and then undergoing brain transplants. I repeat people are being kidnapped, hypnotized, sold, and undergo brain transplants. It is the most ridiculous story line ever. For people saying it is about something deeper, I get it. I get the social aspects of the film, the racism, all that. Put that aside, if it was an all white cast, an all black cast, whites kidnapping blacks, blacks kidnapping whites..... the film is about people who get kidnapped.....hypnotized... auctioned off, and have 90% of their brain removed and replaced with someone elses brain so they can live forever. Say it outloud and try not to laugh. Its absurd and childish. It's a sci-fi original premise gone bad. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but to see it get Academy Award recognition is mindblowing."

","I had heard about this film many times a couple of months before its release, it was being billed as the big scary movie of the year, it certainly looked like something I wanted to watch, so I hoped the hype would be justified. Basically black photographer Chris Washington (Psychoville's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are preparing for a weekend trip to meet her parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener). Upon arriving at the Armitage home, Chris is curious why the servants are all black, including Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel). Chris talks about his family, and shares that at eleven-years-old his mother died in a hit-and-run, Missy as a psychiatrist offers to help him quit smoking through hypnosis, he declines, Rose's brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) arrives and the entire family has dinner with Chris. That night, Chris goes outside for a smoke, he notices the strange behaviour of Walter and Georgina, upon reentering the house Missy invites to sit down, he explains his guilt for not calling 911 regarding his mother. Chris finds himself unable to move, through hypnosis, using the stirring of spoon in a china cup, Missy transports his consciousness into a void that she calls ""the sunken place"", Chris wakes up in bed, he believes it was just a nightmare, later realises he has been hypnotised to stop smoking. The Armitages have an annual get- together, with many guests arriving, Chris in uncomfortable to finds they are white, older couples, with an uncanny interest in him, but there is also a black guest, Andrew Logan King (Lakeith Stanfield), he unsettles Chris with his bizarre demeanour. Chris calls his best friend, TSA (Transportation Security Administration) Officer Rodney ""Rod"" Williams (Lil Rel Howery), he tells him about the hypnosis and the strange behaviour of the black people. Chris later takes a photograph, the camera flash causes Logan to freeze, have a nosebleed, and hysterically yell at Chris to ""Get out!"", Dean claims this reaction was an epileptic seizure, but Chris is unconvinced. Chris tells Rose about being uncomfortable with things, she agrees to leave with him, while the guests are seen having an auction, for Chris, with blind art dealer Jim Hudson (Stephen Root) placing the winning bid. Whilst packing, Chris sends the picture of Logan to Rod, who recognises him as an old acquaintance, Andre Hayworth, Chris is also disturbed to find a number of photos of Rose with previous ""boyfriends"", all of which are black men, he tries to escape, but the family block his path, and Rose reveals herself as being part of the plot, Chris is hypnotised and incapacitated by Missy. Rod becomes concerned when Chris has not returned home or answered his calls, he discovers more about Andre Hayworth and other black men going missing, he is unable to convince the police to take him seriously. Chris wakes strapped in a chair, he learns that the family have developed pseudo-immortality, where neurosurgeon Dean transplants the consciousness of his older friends and family into the bodies of young black people, Jim Hudson will use Chris's body to regain his sight, Chris will doomed to exist in the sunken place while Jim controls his body. Chris manages to escape, and kills Dean, Missy and Jeremy in the process, as he drives away he hits Georgina with the car, he has the same feeling of guilt as he did with his mother and cannot leave her, it turns out she is a vessel for Rose's grandmother, she revives and become violent, causing Chris to crash, killing Georgina. Rose and Walter catch up to Chris, Rose is armed with a rifle, Walter, a vessel for Rose's grandfather, tackles Chris, but a flash from Chris's phone camera frees Walter from hypnosis, Walter takes Rose's gun and shoots her in the gut, and then himself in the head. In the end, Chris grabs the gun, but cannot bring himself to kill Rose, a police car pulls up, Rose cries out for help, trying to make out Chris is her attacker, but the driver is Rod, he and Chris drive away, while Rose succumbs to her gunshot wound and dies. It is a simple story, a young black man experiencing anxiety meeting the people associated with his girlfriend, but then it becomes increasingly weirder and more deadly, paranoia becomes terror, it works well with the unease of situations, the racial stuff adds to the creepiness, but there is also room for a good amount of laughs amongst the scary stuff, all in all it is a most inventive and intriguing comedy horror. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Jordan Peele (the first black writer to win), and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Director for Jordan Peele, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

","2 out of 10 because I don't give out 1's. <br/><br/>Nothing new here, except to sadly learn the level of absolute contempt, hatred and loathing that Mr. Peele must harbor for whites. The movie starts out okay with this very loving couple planning to head out to the country to meet her folks and family for the first time. <br/><br/>Honestly, one gets the impression that the writer/director has never set foot in a ""white"" household, and in his tunnel vision, Caucasians don't know how to act, behave, or how to treat a black gentleman who enters their home, even though he is dating their daughter, and in spite of the fact that they are seemingly traditional liberal parents who ""would have voted for Obama a third term.""<br/><br/>So our writer has now introduced us to his perception of a white family who doesn't know what to say or how to act, and then we have a big get together at the house where all white people don't know what to say to a stranger, so they bring up Tiger Woods because they are so shallow and have nothing else to say. Even the black servants are portrayed in a negative light, maybe to show the writer's contempt for black folks who allow themselves to be employed by white folks? Im not sure. <br/><br/>Later, the Sci Fi angle becomes more evident, reminding me of the Twilight Zone episode, ""The Lateness of the Hour"" where robotics are employed, here through hypnotism, and then the horror of the white family's intention of switching out body parts to create perfect human beings. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time, or your money.

","Get out(2017) Ignoring politics its a semi decent psychological thriller that doesn't live up to the hype but will keep you entertained for an hour or so<br/><br/>But you cannot ignore the politics in this movie<br/><br/>It starts off mediocre but quickly becomes incredibly racist. For the first half of the movie you will be sitting there feeling actively uncomfortable with all the racial profiling and stereotyping going around(to the point where you will get your phone out and start looking at reviews to see if they feel the same way). Then 1/2 to 2/3 the way through the movie (Spoiler: basically as soon as you find out the girlfriend is in on it) there is an abrupt change of pace where they sort of try to convert all that racism into a sophisticated plot device and actually make a fairly decent ending to a horror movie with a much more detailed plot line beyond this point. But it made you feel so uncomfortable before hand I am not sure it was worth it.<br/><br/>I feel like at least one of the people that made this movie was one of those people promoting things like white guilt, as if anyone should be held accountable for the sins of their ancestors. Thats the vibe it gives off and (depending on how politically conscious you are) may make you very angry<br/><br/>If you don't see how this is racist imagine the movie with all the character colours reversed. There would be rioting in the streets, news networks would be covering it and calling it the most racist movie of 2017. Politicians would probably condemn it and the directors and producers would be sacked and unemployable forever after. But no, because its racist against white people nobody gives a toss.<br/><br/>TL;DR the first hour is just very uncomfortable racism with no plot whatsoever and a few jump-scares.

","Horror films are probably my second favourite genre of movie after science fiction. Not a lot of the time in present day do I find myself actually scared though in regards to having just watched some new ""totally horrifying"" film. I've watched at least 60-70 horrors over the last 5/6 years, and I'm satisfied after seeing 2017's Get Out - because there were some truly unsettling, disturbing, creepy, strange, and horrifying scenes. It had me going. Jordan Peele did such a wonderful job as did the whole team. Daniel Kaluuya does a superb job, a total confident display of his fine acting skills solidifying himself as a great star in today's world of actors. The fact is, this film could be seen as a comedy horror because there were some honestly funny scenes all throughout, from the phone scenes to Chris's rampage at the end up to being found to the scene with the tell off the cops in their office what's going on.. there's a good slide of comedy in this film. But first and foremost, before thriller, before comedy, this film is a dark psychological horror. The amount of unsettling scenes was fantastic. Here's the scenes that were truly special: the man running towards Chris, the woman staring at the window, the woman crying, saying ""No..no... no..,"" the scene with the photographs, the scene with the woman in the car attacking Chris, the scene with the bingo, the scene with the flash on the camera... these are all scenes that are in every sense of the word disturbing or creepy. Yes, this film really did gave me chills, one of only three films to have done so since 2013: Sinister, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, and this make up the three. The writing is fantastic, all three acts are solid and interesting and have their moments. The pacing is good and the plot of the film gets more deeper and intriguing as it goes on, and by act two I was totally, totally captivated by this extraordinary horror. I see some people say it isn't that good, it's overrated, etc.. judge for yourself, and of course you're entitled to your own opinion... but man, I absolutely loved this. Great film. I highly recommend it.
Favourite scene: the photograph scene/Chris's escape
Scariest scene: woman attacking Chris in the car after she wakes up/man running towards Chris outside at night
Creepiest/strangest scene: ""No... no.. no.. / they treat us like family""
Funniest scene: ""I mean I told you not to go to the house""

In The Skeleton Key, the two people are referred to as Cecile & Justify, or Violet and Ben. They use 'old' Voo-doo spells and magic to make the transformation.
In Get Out, they are doing the same exact thing, living a long and youthful life by transferring their conscious minds into younger healthy (black) people using advances in modern science and medicine.
It's the same story, with a new modern twist. In The Skeleton Key, Cecile & Justify win the fight and live, while in Get Out everyone dies, except the main character.
That is only reason I gave this movie a 7-star rating. Get Out was praised with accolades and applause, while The Skeleton Key, barely registered on the map."

","Welcome to a world where you really can judge people by the color of their skin. In case you forget which race is superior, a character will be sure to inform you, and the odd thing? they all agree. Moving past this, the film has other issues.<br/><br/>I missed the ""hype"" just saw this on a recommendation. It's a well written adaptation of a less well known film Skeleton Key (2005) Unlike the original, Get Out completely fails to be scary. Part of it is it fails to place us on the protagonist side. Washington is plenty sympathetic, but he lacks that feeling of powerlessness that would make it horror.<br/><br/>Second, it fails to even make it to Noir, when the film's director is clearly on the protagonists side. Instead of Murphy's Law ruling the twists, things tend to happen which are conventient for Washington to notice everything going on and be able to do something about it.<br/><br/>I don't really have a third, there are just little writing things that bugged me all the way through, subtle details, traits of his character, profession etc fail to come into the fold as dominant story arc drivers and are more window dressing.<br/><br/>That said, the film has some genuinely creepy moments, and outside of some extraneous out-of-setting scenes with characters who have no narrative impact, it's mostly believable. There's some definite Guess Who's Coming to Stepfordness to it all, but there's not enough here to forgive it for fanning the flames of racism. It's an entertaining watch if you have nothing else to see and don't mind being ranted at about the Peele's feelings of racial superiority."

","Being different always have two ways to go, either it will be easily accepted in the audience or thrashed severely by the same people. It took the risk and fortunately, it worked out! Jordan Peele has done an impressive job with the screenplay and presentation of the story. The clever use of passive racism and well written dialogues did their work ; they made the story engaging in the buildup phase. The sound score and the edits were brilliantly done. All of the technical aspects created An eeriness that gradually keeps you on the edge the whole time. Performances as usual were magnificent (Especially from the Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya). The brutality and the gore in the climax fulfilled the story. It makes your heart racing! Now you must be wondering if I'm praising this film that much ; then why I'm giving this a 7/10? There are some reasons for that! The Rod Williams character annoyed me the most, I don't understand the need of adding unnecessary comic scenes or humours into these kind of movies which are supposed to be serious and scary throughout ! Well I'm not going to spoil the main concept but it felt Poorly explained and illogical in a sense! The story could have easily elaborated all the facts in much more clearer fashion! The Director wanted to put all of our attention to the main character of Chris ; and in order to achieve that he somehow neglected the other major character buildups! Those were needed in my opinion. Overall a Technically sound movie that delivers on the main subject of Racism culture and at the same time makes you uneasy and scared but in no way it's a flawless film."

","Right off the bat I knew Get Out was going to be something unique, sporting a trailer that resembled something so perfectly on the fence between funny and eerie. This is a movie that has oceans of hype and deserves every drop of it, you'll never get a film like this again.<br/><br/>Plot- A black man retreats with his white girlfriend to her family home out on the countryside, meeting her family for the first time with insecurity of his ethnicity. He notices that the white folks out there seem to have heightened ideals of black people in terms of physicality, culture, and behavior. The genius of the film is that it takes something so very real, pokes and prods at stereotypes, while also making you laugh at it. I cannot give away much of the plot without spoiling it but I will say this, the plot twist will rock you. Never has a resolution been so culturally relevant, yet also fictionally disturbing.<br/><br/>Writing- Perfect writing. The conversations seem natural, yet winkingly objective when foreshadowing. Humor hits you in all the right places, never having an offbeat moment. The whole story and idea behind it is ingenius. I'd really like to sit down with Jordan Peele and investigate him for this one. There's very much a reality behind the script, and I think that reality not only applies to common society, but primarily high society.<br/><br/>Characters/Acting- Dude I have nothing but praise so just leave now if you cant believe me. The acting is spot on- you can feel the awkwardness, sense when somebody may not be as they present themselves, and the characters are all pitch perfect for their roles. Sure there is that Horror movie tone to it, but nothing campy or derived. Alot of moments here where the acting really makes the script pop and sizzle, creating unforgettable scenes.<br/><br/>Quality- The camera angles and filming are spot on, never having a predictable angle. The opening scene is so simple yet executed with grace, drawing you in immediately. The sound is booming when needed, the violence is pretty nasty but not frequent. The scares come in such a simple form that plays off of your knowledge more than using loud noise and mosterous imagery to shake you.<br/><br/>Get Out is a classic. I applauded my TV screen my first time watching it. If you want something that will creep you out, intrigue you, while also making you laugh, sit down and get cozy. The theme of the film is probably the greatest thing about it."

"ryanwinning1","9","1","3","30 January 2019"," How to address race. The elephant in the room!
","This is pure genius film making to me. Movies like this crush the entertainment value of a lot of high-budget blockbuster style movies, because the acting is on point throughout the movie, and it addresses thought provoking social issues that a lot of people deal with on a day to day basis.
I have seen anything from Jordan Peele that I haven't like in the past. In fact I always get a sense of originality and executed timing with his comedy and this movie certainly follows suit in a horror aspect. The quality of the acting and chemistry amongst the characters clearly stems from the directors passion on the subject of racism. For Jordan you can see the racism he deals with in life isn't white people chasing after him with pitch forks, looking to do physical harm to him, but it's the complete opposite. Peele appears to draw from his real life experiences where people of non-black races try to be overly nice to him and overstep certain boundaries trying to recognize him as an African American and that makes him feel socially awkward. The film addresses many social stereotypes on the social awkwardness of different coloured skin people fitting in together. Watching this movie it is quite evident to me that we just haven't figured it out as a society how everyone can be satisfied with our interactions amongst each other. We certainly know that it's unacceptable for different coloured people to be violent and hateful towards each other. This film addresses that it's not appropriate for non-African-American people to address any black-stereotypes, and we hear so often ""treat everyone equally,"" but that's sort of an oxymoron as well because people of the same colour don't treat everyone inside of that one colour equally as it is and combine that with the fact that people are encouraged to be proud of their culture and personal colour, and the result is that in North American culture their really is no ""Right way"" for different coloured people to appropriately interact amongst each other.
To wrap it up the directing, acting, chemistry amongst the cast, shots and set is all great. Really original movie and well worth watching."

","Perfect.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is a phemonemal debut for Jordan Peele who surprised the whole movie industry with this movie. A combination of his directing and writing skills made a huge impact in this masterpiece. The main plus side besides amazing plot is the way how he managed to create a creepy atmosphere with the help of intensive terrifying music and nice cinematography. Another plus was the way he handled the question of racism very superbly as he shown that it's still a sensitive topic to this date. For example, showing that modern day slavery, the black market or illegal surgeries, and many more problem are still present in the world.<br/><br/>The cast for this movie was another huge aspect in a success of this film as there was a lot of chemistry between all of the actors and actresses. Daniel Kaluuya as Chris and Allison Williams as Rose fulfilled their job as the leading characters but astonishingly, the biggest surprise came from Lil Rel Howery as Walter who has relieved me from the tension with his hillariously funny scenes throughout the whole 1 hour and 44 minutes. Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford and Caleb Landry Jones played the role of a Rose's (Allison Williams) creepy family very good as the discomfort escalates to the final act.<br/><br/>After all, I feel like everything just graduates though the whole movie from best to top-notch material. Watching it multiple times and each time finding the one of many Peele's easter eggs, I couldn't find or come up with any flaws. ""Get Out"" will play with your mind and make you wonder how, why and what is happening. At last, ""Get Out"" has became one of my favourites and i can't give it any other mark than 10 out of 10. Hope you will find my review helpful."

","Fundamentally, this is not an interesting film, its not particularly well written, does not have any particularly outstanding performances, the plot is pedestrian and the whole gamut of available cliches is run through.<br/><br/>Yet, Get Out demanded that I watch it, principally because its writer and director won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay, which on reflection says more about the current state of the Academy than it does about the film itself. <br/><br/>As genuine fan of Jordan Peele's Key and Peele, I was excited to see this film, especially after the universal praise the film received from critics before its writer was garlanded with an Oscar. Perhaps too much of a fan? I could not escape the sensation of hearing Jordan Peele deliver the lines he had written for his characters instead of the characters appearing as entities whole and believable. <br/><br/>The film was certainly successful, but sadly it will not age well, I suspect.<br/><br/>Boring, predictable, and cliched. Get Out gets 5 stars out of 10."

","As soon as hypnotism was mentioned, it immediately dawned on me that Georgina and Walter were under hypnosis, as I'm sure that was the point, since the greater reveal is far more sinister. However, though the truth was indeed more alarming, somehow it didn't quite land with that gusto.<br/><br/>The way the reveal came to light was via mere explanation, with little to no demonstration, and was actually quite confusing. Also, the grandparents being the ""servants"" had zero impact, even though I feel and know it should've had that ""OMG"" effect, obviously, but sadly, it really didn't.<br/><br/>What would've been a better reveal in my opinion, is Rose also being a pawn in all of this; now that, would've been the kicker. Picture that final scene as it is, with Chris, Walter and Rose; Chris still flashes Walter, and Rose still gives Walter the gun however, as Walter is about to shoot Rose, the flashing lights from the cop car triggers Rose's ""passenger"" and as Chris realizes that Rose too is a victim, Walter pulls the trigger(insert slow motion here). And so, instead of Chris trying to strangle her, he tries to save her. This way, Rose becomes a far greater redeeming quality than Georgina, for Chris, as an added bonus. And, as an added, added bonus on top of that, it would assist greatly, in at least not painting the ENTIRE white cast as, evil.<br/><br/>The whole family being in on it felt, shortchanged. Get Out was entertaining, but it was missing something and the reveal wasn't awesome enough, or it wasn't revealed as awesomely as it could've.<br/><br/>Of course, given the angle chosen, there has to be an underlying message to this film, of sociopolitical issues among other matters, and that is impossible to ignore, and perhaps aids in stealing some of the shine from this film unfortunately. The undisclosed narrative may be true, however, in the interest of putting art before politics, Get Out was less than it should've been, but much more than what it could've been. 6.5/10."

","But it just wasn't my cup of tea. I think a lot of white liberals and progressives are lying about what they thought of the film; I say this as a white Lefty who felt compelled to lie about what I thought when I first saw the film. Here's my honest opinion:<br/><br/>I think the only reason the film got so much attention was because of white guilt and atonement for the Oscars' neglect of black filmmakers and artists. It's really easy for white people to go to the film and sing its praises in order to show how ""woke"" they are. But that's incredibly dishonest. The film is cynical and stigmatizes interracial relationships. It's super manipulative. The black characters are painted as helpless victims while the white people are all painted as evil villains. This idea that people of color in interracial relationships are being entrapped by white people into interracial relationships is intellectually lazy. <br/><br/>I did appreciate the satirizing of northern WASPs who ""would have voted for Obama a third time if they could have."" When I tell people I'm from the South, I get enough looks of pity and/or ""you don't have an accent"" comments to understand how insufferable these types of people can be. Jordan Peele clearly seems to have a lot of experience with these sort of elite circles (he grew up on the Upper West Side and went to Sarah Lawrence), so I can't really knock him for writing a film about what he knows. <br/><br/>But films should be evaluated on the strength of their writing and the acting, not because they are serving to assuage people's white guilt or as an antidote to Hollywood's overwhelming whiteness. There have been *PLENTY* of great black films, directors, actors, and actresses that are light years better than what we are presented with in ""Get Out."""

","There are many reasons that you might find Get Out unsatisfying or worse. Many here have pointed out that far from being ANTI-racist, Get Out is actually a pretty racist story ... simply reverse the racial types of all the characters and you'll immediately see just HOW racist.<br/><br/>It's also impossible to hypnotise anyone against their will, but this a movie, so we can just about let that one slide.<br/><br/>No, for me the real problem is that the script-writer doesn't seem to know what's going on in his own story.<br/><br/>So if Andre (the guy we see abducted at the beginning of the movie) is under strong hypnosis to be the ""property"" of the Amitages' elderly neighbour lady, and the flash of Chris' phone releases him (momentarily) from the hypnosis, then fine, I can live with that.<br/><br/>And judging from their odd behaviour, it seems as though the Armitages' two ""servants"" Walter and Georgina are also under the same kind of hypnosis.<br/><br/>Where it all starts to go wrong is when we're shown Jim Hudson undergoing surgery of have his brain removed. The plan is to pop his brain into Chris' body, right?<br/><br/>Then it's revealed that the same process was already performed on Walter and Georgina. It turns out this pair are actually Rose's grandparents, their brains transferred to donor bodies. <br/><br/>So my problem is ... which is it? Are the victims hypnotised, or are their bodies receptacles for white people's brains? See, it can't be both. A sudden flash might - plausibly - release a victim from hypnosis, but it sure as heck can't release someone from a brain transplant.<br/><br/>Chris' camera flash at the end of the film, that snaps ""Granpa"" back to his regular self, is just plain lazy writing that does't follow the rules the plot has itself set up.<br/><br/>Breaking the established parameters of the story just cheats the audience and that's a real shame because, with just a little more thought, this silly error could have been avoided. <br/><br/>Worthy of a Best Screenplay Oscar?

Right from the beginning a black photographer is questioned by the police while driving to meet his white girlfriend's family. And if his unfunny friend who believes all the racism garbage wasn't bad enough, the white girlfriend's whole family act strange to the photographer as if they've never interacted with blacks before. I understand the hate that still goes on in some places, but you really should try to make the haters less obvious if you want more mystery in the story. Any viewer can tell the protagonist is in serious danger and even he knows it to the point he can't believe anyone around him. Despite being able to sit through all this what really killed the whole movie for me was the plot twist; it is so STUPID, so UNREAL, so INSULTING, I might never watch this movie again! I won't spoil it but its about as imaginative as M. Night Shamalyn's movies.
There is one thing I enjoyed about this movie though: the hypnosis scene. The main actor may have starred in a fake horror movie but I do believe he's got talent. Watching him trapped in a chair being forced to relive a bad childhood memory managed to get me to feel empathy for his character (not to the mention his tortured face).

One of the more impressive elements involved here is the fact that this one goes for a much more original and creative spin on the genre. There's a lot to work with her involving the social commentary featuring the racial disparities between the two sides and how it all plays off between the family during the beginning as everything comes back to his culture. From the incident on the highway to the treatment he receives from the family as well as the staff around the house all comes together into making this come off with an incredibly unique take on a theme prominent in modern society. What also manages to tie that into the film as a whole is the slow-burn feel of the weekend that keeps on adding more and more strange elements to the fray with the whole meeting of the different groups there for the party that are just odd and eerie that makes this adds even more to its intentions by again playing up the racial angle that had long been apart of the main storyline. As the events continue and the pieces continue to fall into place, the fact that this one goes for a much more subtle manner than what's expected as the true revelation of the trip plays out in much darker tones than expected. After the chilling first hypnotism session that sets this one up through the creation of one of the most chilling concepts in the genre which helps to make the later scenes stand out that much more with the sequences in the brainwashing which manages to further the cause even more than what is necessary as that gives this the kind of setup in the finale for plenty of exciting action as this one sets up quite a fun finish. Alongside the fun and frantic pacing at its core, these here hold it up over it's few minor flaws. The main issue here is the fact that there's no real danger given to the majority of the film as the main genesis of what's going on doesn't give off any sense of fear or scares. The fact that it's spending so much time on the social commentary of the scene gives this more of a dark drama feel that doesn't make the stakes seem that horrific and all that evil, and it's really only in the final moments that it finally turns into a properly scary genre effort. The other big issue here is the fact that it tends to overplay the racial commentary to the point that it feels comical how it beats the issue into the ground and it doesn't serve a purpose once it's already been established.

","It's sad, because the first part of the movie deserved a 9, but then it got only worse and worse. It's very solid technically, has good acting, nice audio, the main idea is a definite plus. On the other hand the special effects are weak (like blood or flames) and the second part of the scenario is terrible.<br/><br/><ul><li>the car which is used for the initial abduction is playing a loud music, which I don't really believe is the best way to imperceptibly kidnap someone - there's an open door out of nowhere leading the main character to finding the box with photos simply waiting for him; the servants are steered by their grandparents so I guess they didn't leave it there for him - they 'kidnapped' the main character with his friend knowing his new girlfriend.. I mean is this supposed to be the first time they act to stupidly? or am I somehow supposed to believe they acted this way many times in the past and no one has noticed their friends/family missing? - they could have hypnotized him at the start, but of course they've waited until he'll start to be problematic, they could've kept him inside the hypnosis, but of course they didn't - oh.. they didn't think he can use the cotton wool to plug his ears.. and of course there's no monitoring, no checking if he really is unconscious.. - then a guy who had a liter of blood flow out of his head is resurrected and attacks the main character.. of course he could get any weapon in the meantime, but he attacks him with his bare hands! - then the main character drives away and his girlfriend who has not heard the roar of the engine, did hear him hit the soft body of a grandma.. and of course she could quietly approach him and shoot him from up close, but she starts some shooting practice from far away letting him run away.. of course he doesn't run away into the woods where it's harder to get shot, but run by the road where he's in the open.. then she doesn't notice the flash in the darkness (!!!) of him doing a photo and for some reason gives away her gun - the character of his friend from Border Guard seems like some help for low intellect people, because all that he does is prompting the viewer (during phone conversations) what is happening in the story, if they're unable to see it themselves - another movie about the supposedly intelligent people who cannot even act elementarily cautious</li></ul><br/><br/>Well, in the end even the title was already a spoiler. And generally it's quite predictable. You can anticipate the hypnosis, the complicity of his girlfriend etc.<br/><br/>It's a perfect film for a revolution in democratic societies: - blacks incited against the whites - conservatists against Obama supporting liberals - common folk against evil intellectuals + conspiracy theory feeding<br/><br/>I rate it 7 mainly for it's 'reflective value', but it had so much more potential."
"NormanCroucher","6","1","3","22 October 2017"," Sinister satire loses its way in the third act
","An offbeat horror film and satirical social commentary about race in America where the upper middle class liberals are the creepy villains and their political correctness is actually an overcompensation to mask the disturbing prejudices that lurk beneath. The film takes a detour from the conventional formula of the paranoid community-conspiracy thriller, but it's ultimately just an update on 'The Stepford Wives' with a racial twist.<br/><br/>This is an assured debut from comedian Jordan Peele, helped by an acutely OTT Hitchcockian score and some winning performances, with particular noteworthy turns from Bradley Whitford, who is perfectly cast as the overeager and sinister father, and Daniel Kaluuya, who balances that 'meet the parents' awkward politeness with a jagged edge of paranoia. There are many squirm in your seat moments - some of which are just the scenes where the thinly-veiled animosity and racial subtext bubble beneath the surface of the dialogue - and the unsettling atmosphere of the piece keeps you digesting in the dark underbelly of rich white suburbia right alongside Kaluuya's protagonist.<br/><br/>Peele manages to keep the story taut for the first hour, with heightened moments of almost comical tension, leaving the viewer unsure as to when things will spill over into pure horror, which it inevitably does. And once all the cards are put on the table much of the tension deflates and the situations become more arch and silly, from the weak comic relief sidekick subplot to the unnecessary expository villainy. All subtly and nuance is suddenly jettisoned at the tap of a teaspoon and Peele lowers the bar by over-explaining everything to his audience, perhaps the only real sign of his inexperience as a cinematic storyteller.<br/><br/>The other major problem with the film is that it's too predictable in terms of its plot to fulfill the thriller criteria of shock and surprise. There is never much doubt as to what is really happening and that takes away from the experience somewhat, but 'Get Out' is still a nerve-jangling tale for about an hour and change even though the third act is pure hokum. The best way to look at this is as a very twisted 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' for millennials."
"jadavix","7","1","3","7 October 2017"," A great beginning and middle, and an anti-climactic ending
","""Get Out"" starts strongly, with several chilling moments, but doesn't quite come together in the end.<br/><br/>For most of its run-time, it is a rebuttal to anyone who thinks that the horror genre cannot be socially relevant. From its opening scenes reminding us of Trayvon Martin, to the protagonist meeting affluent types at a party, none of whom can avoid mentioning his ethnicity, aspects of ""Get Out"" feel almost too timely and on-point, perhaps uncomfortably so, which is, of course, a great place to set a horror movie.<br/><br/>The movie shows its hand pretty early, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that it has you primed for a big reveal, and I found myself a bit let down by the climax and its conclusion. The beginning was handled so skilfully, I was obviously hoping it would continue in kind. However, it went too far into standard horror territory in the end, and seemed to lose touch with the social conscience that had made its first act so interesting."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","23 June 2017"," The plot twist comes directly fromSPOILER
","I'll leave the spoiler to the very end. The start of this movie, where a white girl Rose brings her black boyfriend Chris to see her unknowing parents, looks very much like ""Guess who is coming to dinner"" (1967, fetching Katharine Hepburn one of her 4 Oscars) . But here it is more than just dinner, but a weekend at their suburban home in an upper middle class white neighborhood. The parents Dean, a neurosurgeon and Missy, a psychiatrist welcome Chris warmly, maybe a little too warmly. The only fault they find with their daughter's new boyfriend is that he is a smoker, but he assures them he is quitting. Missy offer one session of hypnotism which she gaurantees will cure him once and for all. He politely declines.<br/><br/>A not-unexpected slight discomfort for Chris is encountering the two black servants Georgina and Walter. Dean explains that they were actually hired to take care of his aged parents. When the parents pass away, he kept them around for their loyalty. Note this bit of detail.<br/><br/>Nothing seems really abnormal as Chris gets to meet Rose's younger brother Jeremy (just a tad eccentric), and later a big assortment of the family's neighbors and friends, in a big party. There is nothing you can categories as abnormal and yet there are lots of encounters and exchanges that goes from subtly irritating to outright creepy. In particular, the only black guy the meets, Logan, is the husband of a wife twice his age. Note this bit of detail.<br/><br/>I'll get to my summary line and the spoiler now. The movie I am referring to is ""The skeleton key"". If you remember that one and note the two bits of details I pointed out above, the plot twist becomes painfully obvious. The difference is in that movie, the host ""soul"" is switched to the ageing while here it plunges into a sunken place still inside the host's body with just a flicker of consciousness (even more horrible).<br/><br/>Casting is good. The two protagonists Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams contribute to the movie's success. The only one in the cast I know, however, is Catherine Keener, arguably the best character actor around, playing Missy. One character I have not mentioned, who appears briefly together with Chris at the beginning before the latter leaves town, is buddy Rod. Throughout the movie, he is virtually and literally Chris's life-line, at the phone (maybe not too literally because we use cell phones these days). He appears in the very end, carrying through this role, to rescue Chris. LilRel Howery is excellent, providing the only comic relief quite essential to bring some balance to this movie."
"vostf","6","1","3","20 June 2017"," Works on a basic level but covers too much territory
","As an horror/thriller movie it works pretty well. It is very well shot, very well acted but the whole story is made obvious way too soon to keep us scared by the whole setup. Said differently what is really going on is way too technical, mundane in itself to keep the movie at the same level of anguish, horror, fantasy...<br/><br/>I discussed it with a friend and he gave me a very good explanation of the subtext, ie. the social commentary. Most reviewers mistook the premise for a take on Racism 3.0 while it is definitely about the appropriation of Black Culture.<br/><br/>Nobody is racist in this movie, they just overtly envy Blacks. This is just the opposite sin, the materialist stance that views other people as a way to enrich your life without giving something back. This is not ugly racism, this is only class egoism. This would be the same with the same affluent WASPs having a paternalistic behaviour with poor whites (there are movies about this: Rich bored guy goes out to have fun with simple peasants then goes back to his comfortable condo with a year-worth of shrink realization). Only here WASPs have a very specific history of poaching on new frontiers and appropriating Black Culture.<br/><br/>So yes, despite its strengths and original premise Get Out covers too much territory from horror to thriller, fantasy and social commentary. My guess is the social commentary is lost for most... except black people but it made for an eerie backdrop which all the same mesmerized most of the viewers."
"sashaaus","6","1","3","18 June 2017"," Appears to be much better than it actually is
","I did enjoy the movie. It is very well made indeed - not too openly scary, but it has its moments, at the same time atmosphere is built up perfectly and cinematography is hard to criticize. It's well paced and you don't feel tired of it, it's a quick set up - escalation - resolution sequence which keeps you interested at all times. Acting is top notch, as well as direction.<br/><br/>However, as soon as you take a step back and think about it, the script is just too shallow for such a great effort from the cast. The premise is too obvious and gets revealed very early in the movie, so that fragile balance between ""just a bit weird, but nothing to worry about"" and ""get out now"" is broken when things haven't even started to unfold yet. <br/><br/>I won't talk about plot holes or character behaviour making no sense within the set up proposed. If you watch it you'll realize plenty of scenes were shot for the sake of beautiful picture and don't fit within the context of events, at all. <br/><br/>And since everyone is talking about this topic, I'll mention it as well, although I do think it's beyond ridiculous, it didn't even cross my mind before I saw the reviews. If you are outraged that this movie is ""racist"" towards whoever you think it is, you are paranoid. Really, there are certainly racist or just not very sensitive people depicted in the movie, but they are CHARACTERS which are (mildly) racist, movie itself is totally fine. Yes, there are groups of white people who have preoccupied opinions about black people. Yes, there are black people who talk like... well... like stereotypical black people. It's reality, get over it."

","'My parents are not racist', Rose tells her boyfriend Chris when she's planning to introduce him to her mum and dad. She's not planning to tell them Chris is black. Why should she? They're not racist.<br/><br/>Indeed, her parents seem to be more worried about his smoking habit than about his skin colour. But the fact remains that they employ two black servants, who seem rather submissive and not very talkative.<br/><br/>The first part of this film is a clever exploration of race relations. Chris feels that something strange is going on in the household of his girlfriend's parents, but he doesn't know what.<br/><br/>Only in the second half it becomes clear what is going on. The movie changes radically: thriller and horror elements take over. Subtlety makes way for straightforward violence, the viewer is treated to a series of bloody killings, contrasting strongly with the sophisticated observations about race relations.<br/><br/>This is a film with two faces: intelligent drama and bloody horror. You could argue that it's clever to combine both elements, but it's also the weak point. Viewers who don't like horror (like me) are disappointed by the bloody second half, viewers who do, will find the first part boring."
"invisibleman48-263-577385","6","1","3","3 June 2017"," Spoiled by the Hype
","I was fully expecting an original horror film featuring a brilliant lead, Daniel Kaluuya,but what I got was a relatively bland thriller. The production value and acting of the film was above par for a ""horror"" film. The story was never a surprise to me. Maybe I had spoiled the movie by listening to the glowing reviews or watched a trailer for the film. Generally speaking if I know the main plot from the trailer then the movie is pretty thin. I just don't see this being as good as the hype or ratings have lead me to believe. <br/><br/>The racist aspects of the movie are so tired and beat down that I really don't get how this movie contributes anything new to the conversation. Kevin Heart and Tyler Perry have already beat the black boyfriend / white family stuff into tired tropes. When I start flipping the races around from white to black to Hispanic to Asian the story really loses a lot of bite. This tells me that there isn't a strong horror aspect to the story, and that the story would have been more effective if there were more than 3 effected persons and if there were no racial biases. Then the horror of losing control becomes more pure. Where was the basement with the failed experiments and deformed persons? Where was the ugliness of the process? Why does a white family choose black people? If the are racist then wouldn't they use other white people? The whole racist aspect feels flat and poorly conceived. <br/><br/>Based on the hype and reviews and all the news, I expected a much better film. The emperor wears no clothes."
"agentk-77301","6","1","3","3 June 2017"," So close to being perfect. But also so far.
","It had two, MAJOR flaws. One of them is subjective, one of them is objective. I'll start with the objective one. <br/><br/>The first flaw, is just a plot hole. (Hence, an objective problem). When Chris was tied to the chair, he came out with this idea of using the cushion of the chair as ear-plugs. It's clever, I will admit. But the problem is... How the ""other side"", the villains, didn't know he did this? Obviously they had implemented a mic. That's a given, since he talked with the blind guy on the TV. But the problem is, that they heavily hinted they planted a camera too. After all, the TV switches on and off when he awakens and drops, which means they SEE him. So how didn't they see he plugged his ears shut? ""Security guard not noticing the camera ex machina""?<br/><br/>The second problem, the subjective problem, is the massive race bait throughout the movie, which even contradicts the villain's evil plot! The villains were painted in the beginning as ""really really white"" and ""racist"" and ""Never seen a black before"" or ""they is kinda racist man"". But eventually, we find out they AREN'T actually racists, but they abduct people based on fashion (""Black is in fashion now"") and needs (The blind guy just wanted Chris's body to see like Chris for his gift in the art of taking pics). In other words - The whole beginning to the middle of the movie was one huge race bait.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I thought about this movie some more, and I realized more flaws. For example, right at the beginning - The black guy walked around the neighborhood KNOWING bad stuff are going around. Then he sees a suspicious car. Will he run for it? NO. He's gonna wait 'till the villain comes out and kidnaps him.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the other major black-character was annoying. It felt like they wanted to do comedy, but the humor was meh at best. They should have stuck to their dark tone from the start to the end without trying to spice it up, which effed things up regarding the tone as a whole. <br/><br/>And lastly, it's not ""horror"". It's a thriller. Or a psychological thriller. But it's definitely not horror nor comedy.<br/><br/>But still, overall, I had fun it was good. I don't think I'll edit it again."

","Get Out  The great thing about interracial relationships is you'll never start  to look alike.  Even dressed identical, the mixed-race couple in this horror movie  would maintain their distinctiveness.

His fears are soon confirmed when he begins having strange encounters  with the few other black people around who all warn him to get out.

What I will say about the movie is that it is very racist against white people & it tries to make out that all white's are closet racists, which is basically the crutch of the movies story-line. I did however, know something about the movies story-line before viewing it, so was expecting this, but I didn't find out until after I had viewed the movie that it was directed by a black guy, which shines a whole different light on the movie in my opinion, as it makes it a racist commentary rather then interesting social commentary.﻿"

","As this film opens a young black man, lost in a suburb is attacked and abducted. We then switch to our protagonist Chris, another young black man, who is preparing to meet his white girlfriend, Rose's, parents for the first time. She assures him that they aren't racist but liberal to the point of cliché. Once at their large rural home Chris soon starts to feel uncomfortable; their black maid and gardener seem like characters from before the civil rights era and while outwardly friendly there is something a little off about the family. Rose's mother hypnotises him to stop him smoking but he is convinced that she did something more. A party thrown by the family only makes him more concerned but by the time he realises the real danger it may be too late.<br/><br/>I found this to be a really effective horror movie even though it features little obvious threat till the very end. In many ways I was reminded of 'The Wicker Man'; a protagonist goes somewhere of his own free will, finds things somewhat creepy then finally learns a horrifying truth. There were also obvious 'Stepford Wives' vibes with the way the other black characters at the family home and their neighbours behaved. As the film progressed the tension was constantly raising and although it was obvious that something bad was planned for Chris I didn't guess just how bad until he was told what it was. Some levity was provided by Chris's friend Rod, who was convinced that rural white folk wanted black men as their sex slaves! Daniel Kaluuya does a really fine job as Chris; he is rarely off screen and is convincing throughout. The supporting cast; notably Allison Williams as Rose and Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, as her parents are also impressive. Writer director Jordon Peele did a brilliant job; it is hard to believe this was his directorial debut. While it is obvious that there is a racial subtext to the story it doesn't feel like the viewer is being lectured to. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans who don't demand frequent violence."

","Spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>Okay, so the plot is cliched (any film geek who's seen the old Rock Hudson movie Seconds or The Thing With Two Heads will roll their eyes at Jordan Peele winning an Oscar for Best ""Original"" Script, but for a first-time filmmaker, I gotta say this was impressive. Certainly Peele knows how to get the best out of his actors.<br/><br/>However the movie is littered with annoying contrivances, from conveniently-placed candles in an operating room (wtf?), a crash that kills the bad guy but leaves the protagonist completely unhurt, to a photographer randomly activating his camera's flash at the right moment (incidentally I think Peele got that from a Simpson's episode), to the fact that in a city of seven million people all the black people apparently know each other by sight. The criminal plot in this film is quite frankly moronic, neurosurgeons and trained psychologists are too stupid to realize they are repeatedly leading a bread trail straight back to themselves.<br/><br/>This all aggravated by the fact that the movie requires two separate people to explain the plot because it thinks we are too dense to get it. The last twenty minutes of this movie are pretty lame, as everything resolves neatly in a paint-by-numbers horror climax. As smart a horror movie as it is initially it ends up playing out a gimmick. Like The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects, this film only works if you don't know the twist."

","Get Out is horror thiller that dives much deeper into a commentary on the topic of race and racism in America today. This film does not leave you once you watch it, this film lingers in your thoughts well after the credits finish rolling. This was Jordan Peele's debut in directing a horror movie. He masterfully and subtly payed homage to classical horror films while still putting his own foot-print on the film. It specifically pays homage to The Stepford Wives and Night of the Living Dead. The film was casted beautifully and the two actors that stood out were Daniel Kaluuya who plays Chris Washington and Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams. This was Daniel Kaluuya's first major role in a film, and I believe that he stepped up and his acting looked effortless. Lil Rel Howery was the perfect fit for the movie because he has starred in the role of comedic relief in many movies like: Uncle Drew and Tag. Next, the sound design gives the audience Toby Oliver and Jordan Peele work skillfully together to create the images in the film. There is an alluring scene where Chris is in the sunken place. This was very elegant and chaotic at the same time. They wanted to create a feeling of the sense of him floating in a black void with the screen above him. They achieved this by simulating Chris being uracistnderwater while he was on a dry set. Another great scene is when actor Betty Gabriel, playing the maid gets a close up of here crying and laughing at the same time while the camera was about 8 inches from her face.I would rate Get out an 8 out of 10 and a must see."

"BlueFox94","8","1","4","18 August 2018"," The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)<br/><br/>As the United States and the world coasts from the aftermath of a most controversial presidential election, many wonder whether the problem of racism has improved between the time that Barack Obama took the reins as the 44th president and this past January when he made way for Donald Trump. This eye-opening horror-comedy-from the moody, more reserved half of the popular Key & Peele comedy duo in his directorial debut, of all people-seems to suggest that the problem has only gotten worse. Luckily, such turnouts soon become fertile ground for curious and rich trends in art, which is a blessing for the barren horror cinema of modern times.<br/><br/>A tense cold opening should squash any doubts of Mr. Peele's directorial hand, which captures (in mostly one long take) a young man (Keith Stanfield) walking down the quiet, moonlit streets of a seemingly safe neighborhood, joking on the phone about how easy it is to get lost in copy-and-paste suburban streets. Out of nowhere, a car blasting polka music sneaks ever closer to the man, and from there, we know the scene's destination. Nevertheless, the opening scene establishes the tone-even in the surrounding horrorshow, a contrasting amusement ensues.<br/><br/>""Do they know?,"" Chris Washington (Sicario's Daniel Kaluuya) asks his kindhearted, live-in girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams, of HBO's Girls), signifying that her affluent parents may not be aware of their interracial, ""he black, she white"" romance. The film wastes no time bringing the couple to the wealthy home of Rose's parents-her neurosurgeon dad, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), and her psychotherapist mom, Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener). A dog-and-cat complementary attitude characterizes the two: A smiling Dean confidently but forcefully tries buddying it up with Chris with phrases like ""My man"" and remarking that he ""would've voted Obama for a third term,"" whereas the subdued Missy all but sneakily coaxes Chris to reveal his childhood traumas in one of her hypnosis sessions. <br/><br/>Right away, Chris senses something rather askew about the estate-the two servants Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) are both African-American, not to mention behaving like characters out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Furthermore, Dean reveals to Chris during the tour of the grounds that his father would have competed in the U.S. track and field team for the 1936 Summer Olympics if not for a certain runner named Jesse Owens. Just an innocent little family tidbit, right? The creepiness only amps up from there with the arrival of the family's younger son Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), who's obsessed with Chris' physicality, and the Chris-fixated behavior of the guests at the neighborhood get-together the following day, where Chris recognizes the young man from the opening, the one we watched get kidnapped-something Chris' TSA-employed best friend back in the city (Lil Rel Howery) is quick to point out to him over cell phone.<br/><br/>With this solo debut behind the camera, writer-director Jordan Peele never forgot that only the handling of setup and payoff differentiate between comedy and horror. Peele brought out worthwhile performances from all of his actors. Whitford and Keener handle their characters like seasoned pros, harnessing their warm demeanors to cover sinister intentions. Star Daniel Kaluuya proves his worth as a dependable lead, while it's always a delight to see character actor Stephen Root at work, even in a small role. The standout performance of the bunch, however, is Lil Rel Howery as Rod, who gets his own subplot as the Chris' determined best friend whose only obstacle when warning the police of Chris' potentially dangerous circumstances is his graceless street language. Howery's turn provides the comic relief in an otherwise disturbing tale.<br/><br/>Only mature teens and older should watch this film. Characters, particularly Rod, don't shy away from strong language when the circumstances welcome it. Though somewhat justified by one character's intentions, the story portrays Chris and Rose's cohabitating relationship as normal. Viewers should expect sudden, bloody violence towards the end, with the more grotesque moments involving medical tools. Moreover, the conservative crowd might find some of the more politically-charged elements questionable, such as when the party guests all show a bit of red while Chris is primarily dressed in blue or when a character eats colorful cereal while keeping the white milk in a separate glass. <br/><br/>Horror is all about fear of the unfamiliar and few in American history know that better than the African-American community. One may laugh and fawn over a foreign, seemingly innocent creature, up until the moment it bites off a finger or burrows into a brain. Get Out is a film that thrives in that gray area in between-that final moment of suspense between the smile and the scream."

Now don't get me wrong, it's a decent, enjoyable movie, but it isn't really as smart of a metaphor on racism and the black experience in America as people think it is. It's not really very scary, either. 
To sum up my thoughts of the movie, it's decent, there are a couple great scenes, acting is alright, but it's not amazing and in no way deserving of the hype it got from critics. 
But i guess that makes me racist now, since I didn't think a movie starring, written, and directed by African American people is amazing. Whatever.

","Get Out is a slowly accelerating descent into horror, that makes you both uncomfortable and wanting to laugh out loud about the sheer madness of the plot. Said plot is, to be fair, not very original but rather derivative of other socially aware horror films. Yes, it is a kind of a horror film, with social commentary on US race relations, flashes of a very dysfunctional family drama, but it is also surprisingly funny: a true horror dramedy I'd say with its greatest asset being the actors. Most of all, Daniel Kaluuya and his performance stand out. The three acts of the film are tonally different. There is always this unnerving sense of darkness which makes for great suspense (Jordan Peele knows his Hitchcock!), but the transitions are interesting. Especially the third act suddenly becomes very Tarantino-esk and I had to laugh quite a bit. It is not the best film of 2017 but it is a genuine surprise, well crafted and acted."
"silverturtle-11808","7","1","4","20 January 2018"," Interesting Story, Lackluster Execution

Having seen a trailer beforehand, I thought I had an idea of what was going on beforehand, but it turned out I essentially knew the entire story, which is the problem I have with this movie: the turn comes so quickly, and after that point guessing the rest of the story is impossible not to do.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, save for the campy, irritating best friend. The biggest irritation was the forced stupidity/ignorance of the main character. It should have been fairly obvious to him very early on what was happening, but it took him essentially the entire movie to get the idea. I don't hold this to the actor though - it's necessary to keep the plot ""moving""."

Overall I was pleasantly surprised because I was frankly expecting something very predictable but then enjoyed the weird twists. <br/><br/>Politically, I also appreciated the handling of not only of racism but of the ludicrous reality of wealthy hypocritical ""liberals"" in isolated suburbs removed from the social groups they claim to care for. The old satire tune ""Love Me, I'm a Liberal"" comes to mind.<br/><br/>However despite my appreciation of the film I was a bit taken aback that every single white character is evil. Its fine to make a film with all white villains, that's fine with me... What unnerved me is that there are zero good or neutral white characters in the film, not even so much as a cameo of a co-worker or janitor. If that was supposed to be a sophisticated jab at pseudo-liberals demonizing all white people (after all the director is biracial and has a white wife after all) that I can live with. What I can't live with are the people who will see this film and only have their suspicion or paranoia about whites reinforced because they aren't complex thinkers.

"psufan-64278","7","1","4","10 July 2017"," Good, but not as Good as the Hype
","Overall I did enjoy this movie, it is above average. The rating on here is much more accurate than Rotten Tomatoes' (A 99%...seriously?). This movie, had some major strengths, along with some major flaws. Starting with the strengths, the film was well- directed, turns out Jordan Peele is a very talented guy with a bright-future in comedy and drama/suspense. The film was well acted from the supporting cast, to the main characters, all performances were believable, and the portrayals conveyed what they were suppose to. I thought the story was very unique, and definitely original. It was truly a bizarre movie, that disturbs you. Now with the flaws, I thought there was a blatant pacing issue. The movie is a relatively slow-burn that keeps you interested in what is so odd about this family. Then bam, there is the reveal, and in about 10 minutes it seems that the film is over. I thought they could of made this movie about a half hour longer. They could of added more to Chris/Rod investigating, and piecing together what is happening. It seems as though the ending was kind of rushed. Chris is told what is going to happen, escapes, kills everyone, then *roll credits*. There were also some plot holes and plot-device that I felt they could of delved into more. For example, the deer hitting the car, why was that necessary to the plot, it seems as though deer have some sort of relevance to the movie (as seen in the end, and in some of the movie posters), but I am not sure what. What was the purpose of Walter sprinting towards Chris, and turning abruptly, I get that he was a sprinter before his brain was transplanted, but what purpose did that serve (maybe I am missing something). Why did Logan and his wife need to attend the auction party, Logan has already had his brain transplanted. Doesn't seem to make sense as to why they would bring anybody who could add further suspicion to Chris. Finally, why black people? They explain, because they are better, and the ""in-thing"", but that just seemed like a lazy explanation to me. Overall, I think this movie could of been a little longer, and would of made for a much better character development. It also would of allowed time to elaborate on some of the plot holes. However, this was still a good movie, and I do recommend it. Not as great as everyone said, but still an enjoyable watch. I feel with a little more development this could of been a 10 or 9/10."
"obesechicken","7","1","4","13 June 2017"," Race Horror Movie
","The movie was pretty good. For once a black character survives a horror movie and is the hero. I went into it thinking it was just going to be a regular horror movie without much social commentary which in retrospect was dumb. There's a lot to think about in this movie, and it's good for either close inspection or a cheap watch.<br/><br/>The Asian character shows that Asians are either a model minority that is almost as privileged as whites (which as an Asian I don't think is true) or that Asians are not allies for black people. I know in an interview they said the Asian was to show the spread of the coagulant group, but they could have just used an Australian or a European if they didn't want the movie to be about Asians. Alternatively the Asian asked if it was better to be black as if he thought being black would be an advantage to his current race in today's society. This scene is something they could have improved on.<br/><br/>The mind control was unnecessary. The movie could have cut it out entirely and used hypnotism as the explanation. Instead it tried to convince you that people had 2 brains put inside their heads. But a shared brain surgery doesn't make sense (where would the second brain fit?). I think it was trying to say that black people are being convinced that racism doesn't even exist anymore and that they're betraying their own race by arguing against black rights movements. Modern racism is mind controlling people so it's almost like a white person inhabiting a black person's body.<br/><br/>Or they just don't want to rock the boat and want to try to be happy with the amount of racism in the world. If we ignore that the Grandma was controlling Georgina, symbolically she's like a black woman who doesn't want to fight the system. The most she could do to help Chris was open the little door in Rosa's room. Even though she could be awake at night she couldn't walk to Chris to warn him.<br/><br/>I don't know if making Rosa into a bad guy was to make the story make more sense or to say that even white allies are not entirely on the sides of black rights. Rosa and many of the other black people just fetishized black men. I'm sure many black men don't think this is a problem for them though. Or they think that their white girlfriend is the exception.<br/><br/>It was also interesting thinking about the questions the people at the auction asked. They wanted to know if Chris' body would be suitable for their own now that they were old. But when white people talk about Tiger woods or Obama when they first meet a black person it means they still see the person's race first. Those conversations actually do happen IRL. Only one person talks to Chris about his photography even though he's carrying a camera around. And that was because he wanted Chris' body thinking it would give him talent for photography."

The scene where he is hypnotized was not done very well. He got sucked it far to quickly considering how weird he thought everything was.

","It's my first review and i'm not that good in writing in English but i have to write this review. Why? Because this is the first case of watching two films in one (at least for the films i've seen). I'll divide film in two parts because at a certain point we'll basically have a change of genre and a totally different film from first part. My rating for first part of the film is 10. I'm not kidding. First part is awesome. I'll tell later where this part ends and starts delirium. Rating for 2nd part (delirium, maybe author delirium. Don't know but i would like to know who smoked what) is 0. So (10+0)/2 it's 5. Can't go on without spoil so... FROM THIS POINT ON THE REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. First part, as i said, it's awesome. It's thrilling, you don't know what to expect but you'll understand that something isn't good with that family and protagonist will understand with you. You'll feel a bit of panic, you'll fear your gf mother and maybe a bit more your gf father. Oh wait i was talking about the film... The point is: the film will get your attention. Now the spoiler: the film will drastically fall after the protagonist asked for car keys to her gf. I'm not kidding again. 2nd part starts in this moment. I loved how it turned out that gf wasn't that sweet but then... Second part starts. It becomes a sci-fi Frankestein based about a mad scientist with a mad family and mad relatives. I would like to know how protagonist put cotton in his ears too. Wasn't he tied? And why he casually started killing?! Atmosphere was saying ""he is afraid, he wants to escape"", not ""he is afraid, he wants to KILL, KILL, KILL!"". I'm really sad to say that second part of this film is... I won't say that word.

"rosavalentineroseland","8","1","4","21 May 2017"," Impressive but a bit too far gone
","This is a film that speaks for the black, very obviously. Basically all white people are bad and all black people are victims, and the line between the black and the white are drawn as clear as that between the Capulets and the Montagues. As a horror film, it indeed is horrifying, with the ambiance. The unnecessarily particular attention that everyone gives Chris creates an atmosphere like being stared by a million pairs of eyes. People smile, but weirdly. Blood and deaths appear in the end, but the horror starts from the beginning. This is why I give an 8. But I'm not rating more than 8, because the point is overstated. I doubt if a black person will feel really good after watching it. As a foreigner of another race in Paris, I know the extra attention native people pay to us, but that doesn't mean they are all evil. It's a dramatic way of underlining the point of the film, I understand that, but think about it: When all white people are portrayed like this, isn't it racist as well? A hate towards the white? For me, this film is all brilliant until the moment when Rose refuses to give the key to Chris. From there on, it's gone way too far. Of course, the scenes after that add on greatly to the horror, but this part of horror is not the same kind. It's no longer the horror of seeing how hypocritical the so-called non-racists are. It's more the horror of learning how much humans can hate each other just because they are not the same sub-species. A film that fights against racism is supposed to seek for peace and harmony among all races, not to stand with one race and attack another. All in all, it's still a very impressive work, and what Jordan Peele genuinely wants to convey is truly deep."
"barryweir","6","1","4","9 May 2017"," Not as smart as people would have you believe.
","I'll caveat this review by immediately saying that as an immigration lawyer and a political centrist I am in no way some sort of conservative crybaby who is going to dislike this movie because it assesses racism in America.<br/><br/>The fact is that there are great elements to this film. The direction is good. The editing is good. The performances are good. The script feels like an extended X Files episode, but, hey, X Files at it's best was damn good...and yes, the movie does provide an interesting view of the African-American experience in the US.<br/><br/>The conceit of this movie is that that it shows the experience of life in America for African-Americans in dealing with whites. Well, I'm neither American or black, and while I have both White (or otherwise) American and African-American friends I cannot claim to know what it is to grow up African-American. But I do know that there are a great deal more social problems for black Americans than what this movie offers. However, that isn't really my complaint. Doing what I do for a living, I have travelled the world over and having been, like the lead character, in a multicultural relationship as a minority I was in an ideal position to try and sympathise with the lead character. And I did, up until Peele made the mistake of portraying white people as bigots and only bigots, who judge blacks superficially. Sure, there is a horror (or more accurately a sci-fi) framing, but it is inescapable that the movie relies on a stereotype of white people as shallow and inherently racist. Now, I don't give a crap about all the luvvies and critics calling this accurate social commentary, it is only accurate to the extent that it identifies an attitude among SOME whites, but it undermines those of us who are white and think the complete opposite. I am white, educated and no I don't judge black people or anyone else on the supposedly less obvious basis the whites do in this film. Why? Because I am intelligent. Peele makes a movie about racism by using a racial stereotype. It is offensive to any truly educated person because it offers up a stereotype of whites as shallow bigots who cannot see beyond the modern zeitgeist social construct. As a white man who has fought tireless against that it rely annoyed me and ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>This movie fails threefold: - 1) It feeds into the American racial divide, especially for the black community, why is irresponsible; 2) It stereotypes white people so reinforces said racial divide; 3) it marginalises those of us who are white and who have worked tirelessly against latent racism.<br/><br/>I have contemplated whether or not Peele making the TSA agent white would have gotten around this problem. I think it would have, because it would provide a contrast to the stereotype. But then, of course, had he done that I have no doubt that some of the many African-Americans lauding this picture would have immediately complained that a white man was depicted as a hero, just as Samuel L Jackson had the audacity to make a bigoted remark about the lead in this picture being a British actor who ""couldn't understand"" the African-American experience. SO I feel that Peele was probably handcuffed, through social pressure, as to the type of movie he could make even if he wanted to.<br/><br/>Perhaps, as a Briton who follows American politics and social feeling, this movie is a great indicator of how the American racial divide is still far from resolved. It is perhaps ironic that the director offers up the idea of white people celebrating black people from afar (in this case Obama), when he makes a movie that suggests his experience with white people is almost inherently racist in some way or another. I find that deeply sad. Sad for the state of American society, Sad that an African American in the modern age cannot offer commentary on racism without promoting a reverse stereotype.<br/><br/>Here's my deal. I'm not interested in liberal or white guilt. I am a human being who happens to have white skin pigmentation. I am no different from a black person in anything other than social construct and different pigmentation. So if you're going to laud Peele for his efforts on this picture, then ask yourself why a movie based around that social construct couldn't at least include a counter balance to highlight he absurdity of racism? But is doesn't. Why? I don't know. Maybe, like I say, Peele was petrified of angering the African American community. Maybe he just doesn't see what he's inadvertently done. I don't know. But one thing is for sure, this movie intentionally or unintentionally stereotypes white Americans, and white privilege or not, when you do that, you just create more divide. I don't think Peele set out do that. But I think for any educated man/woman, that's what he unfortunately offered.<br/><br/>Quite simply, society gets no closer to solving the issue of racism with you stereotype the persecutors. Why? Because you just increase the divide. Is that a message to African-Americans to stay silent? No way!. Just fight the cause without being a mirror for prejudice and division. In my opinion Peele dropped the ball in this regard."

","****Could contain a spoiler**** I wanted to see this movie based on the ""its scary"" ""Its horror"" tag it got, and the praise it also got. The acting was good, the story was also good, though as another reader pointed out, the plot isn't far off The Skeleton Key. The biggest difference being the twist was well done in The Skeleton Key, whereas in this movie, you work it out very early on, like the director wants to tell you early for some reason, and that takes a big shine off the twist for me. Movies like The Sixth Sense really nailed the ""WTF"" factor at the end, this had none of that. The scary portions were few and far between and I like a good scare. I recommend this to people who like a bit of the macabre, but if you want to be truly scared, this is far off the mark."
"The-Last-Prydonian","6","1","4","26 April 2017"," Despite a promising start it's a wasted opportunity at social satire
","It's fairly rare these days that a horror movie get's the kind of critical praise that it receives and ""Get Out"", which marks the directorial debut of Jordan Peele has managed to somehow pull off just that. This having been said, Peele has called his movie a social thriller but let's face facts, it's a Horror movie and a rather mediocre one at that. Starring Daniel Kaluuya, who incidentally I previously know from his role as Tealeaf in the cult British Horror/comedy TV series, ""Psychoville"". The film centres around a young black man who goes to meet the affluent parents of his white girlfriend. Upon meeting the potential husband to be finds something unsettling about the unnatural friendliness of the father, and as the day progresses he begins to learn some disturbing truths by which time it might already be too late.<br/><br/>Although a tad rough around the edges which I could forgive that being that this was the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, who also wrote the screenplay. It still however gets off to a strong start, and there's an intriguing set-up with a potent air of mystery and a quiet unease which is palpably felt early on. It also easy to see shades of Ira Levin's ""The Stepford Wives"" and Kevin Smith's ""Red State"" where I think it's fairly safe to say Peele was influenced by. Serving as a satirical allegory (very much in a similar vein of ""The Stepford Wives"") of post racial tensions in the U.S., any sharp observations it attempts to make end up playing second fiddle to it's horror movie elements. And even then when those start to come to the fore the movie lacks any real tension. I simply didn't feel as if I was on the edge of my seat quite like I was supposed to be.<br/><br/>The occasional humorous moments with the lead character's best friend doesn't really gel with the whole tone of the movie, and it really beings to lose it in the final third where it descends in to sloppily handled clichÃ© ridden fodder. Worse yet, the family are so aloof and cold within the context of how the story plays out to the point that it's laughable. Add to this a tacked on denouement which given that there was an alternate, original ending and it's more than apparent that it's being clumsily shoehorned in.<br/><br/>Despite all this there are some some wonderful performances with both Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener being unnervingly clean-cut and buttoned down parents, with Stephen Root also on top form. The stand-out however is Daniel Kaluuya who makes for a likable and charismatic protagonist, who manages to understatedly invoke the sense of paranoia and threat that he feels. Sadly although not terrible he really deserved better to work with in terms with than what feels like something of a wasted opportunity. As social commentaries go it just doesn't hold entirely together well as it should. Although to be fair this is not the worst attempt at melding social commentary with the Horror genre, with director Brian Yuzna's awful 1989 effort, ""Society"" taking the number one spot. This is the ""Citizen Kane"" of Horror movies in comparison."

"jayjaycee","9","1","5","26 January 2020"," The sinking feeling sets...
","""Get Out"" is a 2017 horror thriller directed by Jordan Peele starring Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams. There have been only a handful of original films in the recent years that have already become sort of modern cult classic and as far as I can tell from all the reactions it received, this thriller definitely is one of them. My parents for example watched it and both of them gave it a perfect score and it made me even more curious. As you may believe it or not, I actually managed to avoid any kind of spoiler since it came out three years ago. So did my brother who I was watching it with and after showing him the summary of the film he genuinely asked ""And where's the horror in it?"" and I couldn't tell. I knew that something would happen, but I had not one single clue. That's why this film hit me in a extraordinary way. In the beginning the whole film appears to be so innocent and literally calm, as it was just the whole ""black man meets the parents of his white girlfriend for the first time"" theme that could not be any more natural. But after the deer was hit by the car, the feature increasingly became more and more unsettling. The score did most of the work and, just like in the best Kubrick's features, began to more and more hypnotize the audience with it's eerie sounds. I think it's also phenomenal how this state of uneasiness is also created from what seems to be an idyllic setting - there's literally nothing horrifying in the first place. It's just the house of a seemingly regular white and wealthy family. So where's the horror? Before it comes to this part, the movie basically depicts a social drama with thriller elements in the first half and all of it is uncomfortable to watch, but in a positive way. It hits at the exact right spots with its extreme awkwardness as it boldly shows that intolerance and reluctance between African-American and Caucasian still exists in our modern society and simultaneously reminds us to show more compassion to everyone and to not judge anyone by their skin colour. I mean, just notice all the black and white contrasts in the background and the reference to Jesse Owens for example. I think Peele successfully reached his goal to raise awareness to this delicate topic, without being too accusatory. After the first hints have been given at times in the first sixty minutes, the second half starts to offer everything it's got. I could tell that the film literally was discomforting to me as I made not a single noise throughout the entire run time, because I felt my heart beating in my chest. It genuinely scared me. What the director created with this was far beyond my imagination. White aristocrats participating in an auction about who will be the next to transfer their existence in the hollow shell of what is left of a once living human being? Just imagine this hell of a twist! In the end it even gave me ""Resident Evil 7"" vibes, the only difference being that that the protagonist has to deal with an upper class maniac family instead of obviously insane and cursed hillbillies. The only thing that has probably cursed them is pure racism and greed for profit, maybe even just pure pleasure. It's perverted and horrendous at the same time and definitely gave me the chills, because the whole conflict is not resolved until the very last few seconds. All in all, this genre shifting gem is a brilliant depiction of what still is one of the greatest problems of the world we we live in and even though it's lead as absurdum in the end, never loses the grip of it's original and realistic massage. Lead by a magnificent Kaluuya (this man's ability to cry!) the film slow but surely descends into pure madness and never fails to scare the audience, may it be the horror or the social criticism. It's a tremendously important film and it's more than deserved that this film won the Academy Award for best original screenplay. This film is a sinking feeling that sets."

They're so many great things about the movie I kinda struggle to find one single issue to not make it a 5 star movie. The acting is phenomenal. The characters are lovely. It has that old fashioned feeling that horror should have. It is funny and intense and it switches tones without it feeling awkward. The humor of the film isn't like quippy or anything like that, it's more like the awkward situation that the main character Chris occurs and how he handles it. And I love that. But besides all of that, the best thing in the film to me was the pacing. Nothing never felt forced, and scenes never dragged. It has a very tight script and because of that I never got bored.

","What is it like to live as a Black person in America? I don't mean African American, I mean Black from whatever cultural background. A lot of people take for granted the experience of being a minority person in a culture that doesn't think of you as honest or competent as someone else because of your race. Those living in the majority races cognizant of this issue overcompensate their guilt for their involuntary perpetration of the status quo by the ignorant majority. Pretending that the minority culture doesn't exist is a form of oppression as sinister as outright discrimination.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" is a movie that understands this American reality and the effect it can have on individuals. The plot can be summarized in one sentence: a white woman brings her black boyfriend home to meet the family. What transpires is a series of tense moments between Chris, the boyfriend, and Rose, the girlfriend's parents and members of the community. Chris immediately notices that there are only a few Black people in this area and none of them act or speak as he expects. There is an excellent contrast between Chris and his friend Rod, a TSA worker, who speak casually and the stiff interactions Chris has with the few Black people at Rose's family estate. It is almost as if Chris is from a different culture and time. Several of the attendees at a party hosted at the house make crude references to Chris's physique and even his artistic ability. The Director, Jordan Peele, even includes an elderly Asian man as one of the gawkers who makes an innocently racist remake to Chris.<br/><br/>Peele enhances the feeling of unease by hsi use of panoramic shots of the family estate and close ups of the Black actor's faces. You can see the emptiness of the area which is usually shown during the day. The film wouldn't be more frightening if it were shot at night; being Black in this space is scary enough. When someone speaks, we often see their eyes twitch as their lips move. It's personalized terror.<br/><br/>The film still had to come out in February and does run out of steam at some point. When you see it, you will know too. The good character interactions are replaced with rather obvious symbolism if you know your history and the usual horror tropes. Some of Peele's influences are readily apparent in these moments. At least Chris gets out alive. Too many Black people in America do not in real life."

"jonathanzapotoczny","10","1","5","3 March 2019"," Get Out
","""Get Out"" an amazing movie showed the brutal truth of racism in America. This movie showing a great example of stereotypes against white and black privileges in which todays day in age has gotten out of hand. Some examples from the film that were spot on was when Dean (the father) was giving the tour around the house and pointed out a picture of his father at the 1936 Olympics in Germany who was an outstanding sprinter who got beat by Jesse Owens, an African American sprinter who faced many racial obstacles during his time fighting for his racial color. I felt as if there were a lot of foreshadowing moments in this film. An example, when Rose and Chris were on there way to the house when a jump scare scene pops when they hit a deer. When Chris goes to check on the deer, he witnessed and heard the last breath of the dying animal from the darkness of the woods which gives the symbol of death. That deer foreshadows when Chris is tied up and there was a stuffed deer hung up on the wall referencing not his physical death but the death of himself about to be stuck in the ""sunken place"". That same deer was placed there during that scene, a perfect example of mise-en-scene, because later we saw how it was used as a weapon towards Dean killing him in order to help Chris to escape from the house. Another example of mise-en-scene is when Chris discovers the red box of pictures of Rose and the previous victims, the two that we saw in the film that were a landscaper and a maid. Red symbolizing that Chris is in a bad place and is about to be killed. This family could easily be compared to the family in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Reason being is that each family member has their different roles in order to accomplish the killing of an individual. Another film it could relate to is the film ""Psycho"", were from the outside they look like an ordinary family but inside each enjoy the nature of killing or in this case hypnotizing. The camera angle, lighting, sound was outstanding in this film. Camera angles were great in the film if it was either from close ups, crane shots, high & low angles but the one shot the audience will remember is the long shot from the sunken place. From the audience's point of view, it felt as if we were sinking with Chris as he was hypnotized. The long shot also shows as if we were being pulled back from inside a television where all we could see was the wife, Missy, setting down her cup and leaning towards the camera. The use of silence gave the audience an adrenaline rush knowing that something was going to happen. An example would be when Chris is exiting the house in the middle of the night for a smoke break but the maid walks across quickly through the hallway in the background, another good jump scare. Another example would be when Chris is in the sunken place, we were able to see his mouth moving but couldn't hear what he was saying. The sound editing was also a key element making this such a great film. The nail scratching on the chair when Chris was tied up gave you goosebumps and the uncomfortable feel like nails on the chalkboard. Jordan Peele did an amazing job as a producer and comedian in this film. Showing examples of racism in this film and an overall good horror/ comedy film."
"eliselrosenberger","10","1","5","2 March 2019"," Everyday horrors can be just as terrifying
","*SPOILER ALERT*
""Get Out"" artfully uses the masked side of day-to-day systemic racism in a post-racial society to create a platform for an excellent and suspenseful horror film. Jordan Peele constructed a film that could be told even without dialogue via its mise-en-scene, intertextuality, and all the different angles and shots that put you in Chris's shoes. Using close ups of the Armitage's help, with huge smiles on their face but tears rolling down their cheeks, visually articulates the suffering minorities go through to please society. The Armitage residence is also not just any house you see in a stereotypic horror film either, but more like the Bates residence in ""Psycho."" This house seems aesthetically normal by appearance, leading you to believe there is nothing wrong or evil contained in the house while making you want to trust this house and this family.
Of course the most brilliant and most well known scene of ""Get Out"" is the beautifully and artistic representation of the unheard voices and opinions of minorities, as Peele depicts: The Sunken Place. This place, of falling into a black-hole and surviving only at the will of others, is literally created using low, high, and eye camera angles and mastered cinematography. This scene shows Chris falling and falling alone in a dark abyss, reaching and grasping to save himself, with only a single sight of light from above showing his white family capturers, depicting the power they hold on Chris.
This film beyond exceeded my expectations as a horror film, including jump scares and ongoing suspension through the unsettling and creepiness of the environment, leaving me holding my breath from beginning to end. This film sets itself aside from other horror films by using the everyday horrors of a racial minorities as the medium to induce horror and suspense to an audience. Of course this film has its shares of weapons, slaughters, and ""the final girl"" (although she is depicted as the monster in this film) themes that it shares with traditional horror films, but it's use of social issues to create a platform to reach that genre is truly fresh than other recent horror films I have seen, setting ""Get out"" in a revisionist genre stage."

There is a reason why some thought this was racist ... towards white people.<br/><br/>Yes I had to laugh about that too! Putting silliness aside, because this can also be considered as dead serious horror. But also as relevant socially speaking. And entertaining. So while the movie delivers stereotypes and plays with them, it also shows things that are lying there - some are in the open others are more hidden. Still racism and discrimination is a thing - why not have ""fun"" depicting it and hopefully learn something from it?"

"Jirorian","10","1","5","13 June 2018"," Fall of the House of Rose
","A reimagination of the African American experience through the guise of a horror story, following all the traditions associated with the genre, that places, arguably for the first time in the history of popular film, the victim and dupe of the monsters as being distinguished by their marginalised status through race. The film takes no shame in its identification with tradition given that it needs the audience to have some sense of familiarity in order for its messages to get across. For example, we know just by seeing the daunting, panning-out scene of Rose's parents' house, isolated in the middle of the forest, what implications are held in store for Chris in regards to the various levels of sanity he will encounter, the role he will play in relation to the people he will encounter, and the foreboding moral decline that awaits him because we have read Edgar Allan Poe. What we don't know, however, is specifically what struggles await him, and what he will need to do to overcome them. It is through this anticipation, one which we have nurtured over the course of all the horror movies we have hitherto watched, that we become most surprised, given that what we expect as being unfamiliar is inevitably familiar to an overwhelmingly uncomfortable degree. This is because as fantastical as the film's premise is, it alludes to a repression that pervaded a large part of American history which we are ultimately forced to recognise within ourselves. The final scene of the film is so effective for this reason, and consequently draws us to think quite deeply about what it is that causes us to react the way we do."

","Director Jordan Peele leaves audiences and critics around the world speechless and mesmerized with his incredibly successful and powerful debut film Get Out. The immaculate horror/thriller comedy is successful in giving viewers a truly unique and horrific experience that goes far beyond typical horror cliches by delving into themes of modern day racism. The plot focuses around a young and ubran, biracial couple of Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), an African American man, and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), a white woman. In the film the couple ventures off on a weekend excursion to visit her parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) Armitage, who have never met Chris and who are also completely unaware of Chris's ethnic background. Chris questions whether Rose's parents will approve of him because of his color, but Rose assures him that his parents are blind to race. When they arrive, Chris quickly picks up on Rose's parents attempts to accommodate Chris's racial background, such as stating that if they could they would vote for Obama for a third term. However, as the weekend advances Chris find himself in some rather disturbing and frightening experiences that makes him question Rose and her family's values and beliefs. When he finally becomes aware of the family's true and deviant intents, Chris decides that in order to survive he needs to Get Out!
Audiences and critics alike were absolutely shocked to learn that the infamously comedic actor Jordan Peele, who has started in television shows and movies such as Key & Peele and Keanu, would be making his directorial debut with a horror movie, a genre which is generally not favored by the film industry. Because of his minimal background with the genre, many doubted that the film would be of any substance and most assumed that it would be a box office flop. To everyone's surprise however, viewers found that the film was loaded with skin-crawling scenes, dark humor, and numerous cryptic messages that relate to society as a whole. Jordan Peele's unique directing style, accompanied by strong cast performances, as well as the film's ability to dive into controversial topics, greatly strengthens the film's reputation as one of the best horror films ever made. 
One of Peele's greatest attributes as a director is his ability to convey strong and important messages within his films through an abundance of small yet important details that strengthen the viewer's understanding of the plot and theme, which in the case of Get Out is modern day racism. Peele's ability to blend and hide important themes and plot points within small details puts directors such as Kubrick to shame. Popular scenes such as the black car scene, the cereal scene, the deer scene, the shotgun scene and the running scene all help to bring the plot together as well as strengthen the film's recurring theme of racism in the twenty first century. Peele was even able to utilize the critically acclaimed song Redbone by rapper Childish Gambino to help foreshadow the events of the film. Another one of Peele's greatest attributes as a director is his ability to create a truly unique and original film that steers away from the overused cliches that are so prevalent in modern horror films. Instead of creating a film that was loaded with cliches such as excessive gore, falling female protagonists and stupid teenagers, Peele focuses on showcasing the true and complex terrors of modern day racism, such as police brutality, injustice in the court system, the erasure of black culture, and the systematic oppression of African Americans in America. Although the plot is a little far fetched, many still find that they are able relate to what Chris feels and goes through over the duration of the film. 
The spectacular performances within this film also contribute to Get Out's reputation as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Daniel Kaluuya's incredible performance gives audiences a believable look into the reality of African American males in modern day America, as well as showcases the recurring oppression that many African Americans face. Throughout the film, audiences feel Chris's genuine sense of caution when visiting Rose's all white family. His performance further communicates how African Americans feel in the presence of police officers and in situations when African Americans are made to feel uncomfortable. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener also believably portray the way in which many modern whites view and treat African Americans. They overemphasize the fact that Chris is black in a failed attempt to make him feel more comfortable, rather than focusing on him as a person. They also utilize stereotypes to generalize the African American race and culture through scenes like the Obama scene and the running scene. These performances give the film a realistic sense by accurately characterizing the hidden racism that is all to prevalent in the country today.
Get Out is one hell of a film that will surely keep viewers on the edge of their seats, and the terror that the audience experiences will surely stay with them far past the end credits. With its sense of dread, terror, comedy, and underlying societal themes, Get Out very well may be one of the greatest horror films ever made."
"lesleyharris30","8","1","5","26 April 2018"," Breaks a Traditional Formula Effortlessly,
","Get Out is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an immensely talented cast. It breaks the boundaries of what we, as an audience, have come to expect from a film under the genre of ""thriller"", raising some sensitive subjects of race and stirring a debate that can be discussed once the film is over. While keeping us in suspense and at the edge of our seats, director Jordan Peele deserves to be applauded for this complicated task, managing to put two things that do not seem like they should go together, and making it work. <br/><br/>The movie did have pacing issues, there were moments throughout where I felt a little jaded from how slow it was all moving, particularly being forty minutes and nothing immensely intense having had happened, it could have moved a little faster, which would have kept me more permanently invested. <br/><br/>The cast is all around terrific, but the biggest praise deservedly goes to Daniel Kaluuya. He embodies the emotion, frustration, fear and confusion of this character with great subtlety and depth, managing to find a great balance between the over the top moments and the more grounded scenes, he deserves all the awards praise he gets for his performance. <br/><br/>Immensely thrilling and different. A refreshing take on the horror genre, I would certainly recommend Get Out to anyone looking for a good one. <br/><br/>
A young African-American is bewildered when he goes to visit his girlfriend's parents for the weekend, getting a lot more than he bargained for. <br/><br/>

I already knew what's going to happen in the movie right after Rosy's mom hypnotized her boyfriend. That's why it felt predictable in any way. The story also reminds me of The Stepford Wives, and this reminder adds to the feeling of 'having seen this type of movie before'. Anyway.

That extremely high rating would place the film amongst the immortals like ""2001 A Space Odyssey,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Schindler's List,"" etc. In reality, ""Get Out"" is nowhere near the same level as those classic movies, not even close. It's a serviceable-enough little horror ditty, but sorry, definitely not an 8.2.<br/><br/>I'm guessing this movie has such a high rating because it was viewed by the same teens and young adults who worship at the alter of ""Unfriended,"" and other films of that ilk. In other words, these youngsters don't know any better, so kudos must go out for the films' producers who were, at least, able to tear these kids away from their smartphones for 90 minutes, a near-impossible feat these days.<br/><br/>There was just too many non-believable aspects to the story that made the movie believable. Hypnotism so strong that it could turn ordinary folks into mindless zombies/sex slaves? Modern day slave auction? The TV in the basement lockup comes on just as the kidnapped dude wakes up. That means the Armitage family must have a video camera on him to notice that. And if so, how come they didn't see him stuffing cotton in his ears from the torn-up armrest?<br/><br/>TSA's know everything? I don't think so. All these black people, missing for ages, state police can't locate them, but a joker of a TSA agent can? And why black people? That bit was never explained in the movie, either. Also, the son must be superhuman. he just had his head bashed in yet, seconds later, is able to leap onto our hero and administer a chokehold. <br/><br/>I give the film credit for one death scene - death by deer antlers.

Little by little though his initial concerns are triggered by events that are difficult to comprehend. Strange occurrences, bizarre people and a growing sense of unease force the man to leave. What transpires are a series of scenes straight out of a nightmare which the unfortunate guy will never forget.

"cherold","10","1","6","29 August 2019"," brilliant suspense thriller that is way too real
","I avoided this brilliant movie for some time simply because people kept referring to it as a horror film, and when I think horror films I think gouged out eyes and chopped off limbs and intestines on the floor. So the first thing I want to say is, this is really more of a suspense movie and there's very little gore.<br/><br/>Once I finally watched it I was blown away. This is one of those times when a movie really is as good as people say. The movie does a beautiful job of oh-so-slowly ramping up the strangeness, letting each event build on the other in order to build something wonderfully convincing. The suspense always builds slowly, but by the end the movie is soooooo intense that, half an hour after watching it, I still feel jittery as hell.<br/><br/>The filmmaking is sparse and economical, telling a lot with every little movement, every shot, every comment. Daniel Kaluuya is pitch perfect in the lead, offering the sort of deep, nuanced performance more common in searing dramas than thrillers.<br/><br/>The story is fascinating and beautifully constructed, with surprises that never come out of left field.<br/><br/>This is also a very political movie. It brought to mind a movie from my youth, The Stepford Wives, which also used suspense to highlight society's dark side. The early parts of the movie are almost a treatise on micro-aggressions, explaining them to white folk like me better than any of the million articles you can read on the subject.<br/><br/>An amazing film from a first-time director. I can't wait to see what Jordan Peele comes up with next."

In terms of the story, I found it quite predictable, and it does seem to drag out the mystery endlessly at the outset when it's quite obvious what's going on.

","There are a lot of movies that describe the black experience in America well. There are none that make you feel it viscerally as effectively as Get Out does. Don't just watch this as a horror movie. It's not what is intended. There is social commentary throughout. What you think are plot holes is your lack of movie comprehension. The movie makes you feel how hyper-aware we are when around groups of white people. The hypnosis is the cultural remains of living in a country where our roots are servitude and oppression - not just oppression of our body but our ego. The sunken place is emotional wound that get passed on from generation to generation. We feel less than, we feel immobilized, it is the culture that has done this to us. Get Out touches on the ugly way casual racism objectifies African Americans. How it otherizes us. When we are the other, what kind of treatment towards us is possible? When we are seen as sexual or athletic props, will we be treated with human dignity? Get Out comments on how white people have used us as parts in their system, in the movie very literally, to better their position but stealing our lives. Beyond all of the on point commentary, it's a beautifully and poignantly shot movie.

","I found this film to be entertaining and thrilling even if fairly predictable. The lead actor who played Chris was by far the best of the cast. His sense of unease about spending the weekend at his white girlfriend's family home at a secluded location, which grew incrementally as events unfolded, was well played. he is an easy protagonist to pull for.<br/><br/>The above is the good part. The bad is that the film was predictable to anyone who has seen The Stepford Wives and to a lesser extent, Rosemary's Baby. As with many of these films of this genre, the plot doesn't really hold together. For example the method by which Chris effects his escape by placing stuffing from the chair he is strapped into into his ears so he could not hear the hypnotic suggestions which kept him compliant. How did he get it into his ears if his hands were bound? That's OK though, the more disturbing thing for me is that if this film was meant to be in part a commentary on race relations and racial stereotypes, was having him brutally kill all of his captors while making his escape the only solution? Don't get me wrong, like everyone else, that felt cathartic to me, but I felt the film veered into Django Unchained territory there."

"Vivkon","7","0","1","22 April 2020"," AMERICAN TRAUMA TURNED INTO THE HORROR
","American Society has undergone certain traumas, racial discrimination being one of them. US racial discrimination has a long history in society and along with its articulation in the law, politics, education and the arts. The movie ""Get Out"" engages and represents the common racial innuendoes which can be experienced in US society even nowadays. The ""Get Out"" looks like a science fiction-drama in the cerebral sorting of people. Several similar points, like a mass brainwashing and ethnic bias, make this movie closer to the public masses that were indoctrinated to hatred in, using similar methods (Holocaust movies, 1984, or The Human Centipede or closed society conspiracy movies.)<br/><br/>In the movie ""Get Out"" the closed society of medical professionals develops the racial theory, in which they exercise white supremacy over black people. African Americans are subject to medical experiments, sexual slavery, and domestic duties. The movie underlines the typical stereotype of African Americans (unable or incapable of mental or intellectual enterprises) and shows how racial microaggression can be multi-faceted. For example, when Dean Armitage, the Caucasian head of this closed club, meets with Chris, the African American boyfriend of Dean's daughter, he (father) denies his own racism by avowing that he supported Obama as the First African American President. It is a typical hook for people who try to refute the racist accusations by declaring that voting for Obama gives immunization from racial discrimination allegations.<br/><br/>Another example of emphasizing the racial stereotypes in the movie is how the guests of ""the symposium"" (in fact - auction) looked at Chris. They looked at him as an object, like goods for sale, not as a person. Guests paid attention only to Chris's physical appearance, not to his personality, his talents as a photographer and etc.<br/><br/>In the ending of movie, the brain of African Americans are just simply removed and trashed in a bin. Metaphorically, the scene of throwing Georgina's scalp in the thrash can symbolizes Dean Armitage's racism theory. They are interested only in the bodies, not in the brain (soul). The racist neuroscientists pay attention to the physical body, not mental capabilities of the brain of African Americans. Moreover, the final scenes reveal that ""crazy brain scholars"" believe the use of the body of an African American can increase their own lifespan.<br/><br/>Thus, the movie allows viewers to extract a number of racial innuendoes. However, all of them can be qualified as verbal and non-verbal. Verbal elements of the movie constitute the bias of white characters against the black people which can be detected directly as racism of the main characters. Non-verbal scenes open the metaphorical level of the expression of racial attitudes of people who exercise their racial prejudice and bias. The movie does not give solutions, but it switches the American problems into the horror genre and focuses viewers to rethink the problem in the thriller framework."

No wonder the main character suspected.
But I liked the little point that almost at the end the girlfriend refers the servants as grandmother and grandfather. So the ""exaggerated acting"" was part of the script if you notice the family and most of the guests are, ""fancy rich people"" talking to correctly.

","Jordan Peele hit the big time with this highly acclaimed and celebrated horror film GET OUT. I saw the movie in theatres when it first came out and while there were certain parts and performances that mightily impressed me, in some cases I wasn't that impressed. In particular, while breakout star Daniel Kaluuya received a well-deserved Best Actor nomination, I also thought that Catherine Keener should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She was intimidating, creepy perfection as the hypnotist mother of the main character's girlfriend, which was a well-played role by Allison Williams. Also, Betty Gabriel was superb as the dazed maid Georgina.<br/><br/>Bradley Whitford was just OK as the ""cool"" Dad character, but every role seems like he's playing the same smarmy jerkish character he's been playing for the last quarter century (and yeah I'm including Josh Lyman!). The hairy son was just a weirdo. But here's my main complaint: sorry, but Rod was a STUPID character and felt very out of place in this movie. I just can't take a guy seriously with his annoying meta commentary and juvenile dialogue. This character was more befitting being on a CW or Disney channel show, not a serious Oscar-nominated big screen film.<br/><br/>While Peele did a great job crafting an interesting horror exercise with an original premise with a few strong performances and tight story, the uneven mixture of serious horror with such a silly side character like Rod almost sunk this movie for me. Also, I don't get what was so special about Peele's script for him to win an Oscar. I'm still perplexed as to how a certified horror masterpiece like The Conjuring got no major award nominations, while this so-so flick was lauded like it was. Get Out is a good movie, but best horror film of the decade? That honor goes to The Conjuring."
"asocialis","8","0","3","8 February 2020"," funny, scary, weird, discrimination and exploitation
","I liked this movie for presenting us in funny, scary, and ironic way the discrimination (racial) and exploitation of people. It has many funny and weird small events in form of odd behaviors which are the best part of the movie. There is also the presence of variety of people, location, police which makes this movie not that boring and empty like some worse others. I also liked the presence of typical modern stuff like girlfriend, friends, smartphone, laptop, cars, jokes, and variety of unique characters, all of which we can associate with real life counterparts of todays modern age. Also I liked that movie is very detailed and graphic. The talk is clear, minimum, and details are easily notced, for example the manners, devices, software, nature, characteristics of characters. Ending is also although not perfectly solved, still interesting and filled with excitement and other feelings. From when I first watched this movie in 2017 and then again in 2020, it did not leave any different impression than the first time. Not perfect, but definitely a higher quality movie, much better than most todays movies which are somehow unclear, blurry, and not understandible. This is one of those movies that give everybody the creeps. Most characters looks so real and genuine, for example the woman psychiatrist looks like typical psychiatrist, hypnotiser, mom, rich woman...guests look like guests...friends like friends.

"amrivas-36924","9","0","3","24 January 2020"," Exceeds Expectations
","While deciding on which movie to watch, I started thinking about movies that it seemed that everyone loved, and after some thinking I came up Jordan Peele's Get Out. Having had high expectations for this movie, I can honestly and happily say that it didn't disappoint one bit. It was every bit of what critics and casuals had said about it and more.<br/><br/>This mixture of a horror, suspense, and thriller movie follows a young couple named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams). Chris, an African American man, was going to meet Rose's all white family, including her neurosurgeon dad, Dean (Bradley Whitford), and her hypnotherapist mom, Missy (Catherine Keener). After the over comforting welcome by Dean and Missy, Chris notices the two African American workers at the house, and their ""strange"" behavior. After a chilling, unplanned, and forced hypnotherapy session at night with Missy, Chris is beginning to get even more freaked out, but hey at least it helped him quit smoking. The next day, after meeting and talking with Rose's extended family, he notices that all they talk about are his genetic traits, and can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. This mix of positive and negative discrimination and stereotypes right to his face leaves him speechless and worried, with Rose seemingly being the only one that genuinely supports him.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele excellently builds up the tension of the movie through what Chris sees and experiences, and builds as much suspense as possible before revealing the truth. Similarly to Karyn Kusama's The Invitation, both films build as much tension and suspense as possible through the suspicious and so called weird actions of the characters, until you can't wait anymore for the big reveal. This masterclass of a thriller movie, combined with a little bit of horror, was fantastic for keeping fans (and me) hooked to the movie, not wanting to miss any of it.<br/><br/>The acting was a huge part of this movie's success. Daniel Kaluuya brilliantly portrays what we would all be feeling in his situation, and makes the movie seem extremely realistic. His acting clearly shows how he gets more and more worried as the weekend progresses. Allison Williams also shows off her acting ability, as she throughout the movie showcased how genuine and supportive she is of Chris. The sound throughout the movie also cleverly showcased the building of the tension and suspense of the movie, building the mood and helping progress the movie's plot along brilliantly.<br/><br/>Peele also combines both the awesomeness of a fantastic thriller and horror movie with talking about prominent racial issues. Rose and her family at first seem absolutely supportive of Chris and his race, with Dean saying that ""he would have voted for Obama for a third term if he could"". However throughout the weekend, the all white family only comments about Chris's race and his genetic traits. This underlying racism that some people say and use is usually hard to portray clearly, but Peele has portrayed it marvelously. Peele has included some stereotypes of both African American and white people, which may or may not be true and anger some people. However, his main message about talking about and showing underlying racism from people who were presumed as not racist was clearly shown, and Peele remarkably combined that powerful message with a stunning movie.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele's Get Out deserves all of the praise that has been said about it. It skillfully talks about a prominent social issue while still providing entertainment to its viewers. Believe me, while watching this movie, you won't want to get out of your seat for anything."

Racism has no color, Mr. Peele. This is a good movie though - has enough twists and turns to keep your interest. Normal Peele stuff, white folks are evil, black folks are victims, cops are mean, etc. This movie was up for Academy awards, Golden Globe awards, and People's Choice awards. Won some.

The following day there was a party there with the presence of a lot of more or less aristocratic guests. However Chris begins to feel that something is wrong with those people and suddenly decides to go back home. Rose reluctantly seems to agree with him. However, after the guests went away the atmosphere changes a lot and what looked like a romantic movie changes into a doleful black one with all the family acting against Chris to do a brain transplant since Rose's father is a neurologic surgeon and uses to do some strange experiences on black men. The movie ends with Chris killing them all and escaping with the help of his friend Rod who was trying to find him and finally succeeded in getting there where he was. A strange story not utterly convincing."

","A film that starts like ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" and suddenly, it turns completely crazy. Imagine the top white middle class in the USA realizing one day or one night that all they want is something only Blacks have, for example, the eyes of a black photographer, and for some white women particularly, some physical attribute or appendage of the Blacks who are supposed to be highly superior as for the same appendices of white males. Yes, it is as gross as that.<br/><br/>So, poor Chris Washington is selected by the daughter of the central white family in this kidnap-hypnotize-brainwash-transplant operation targeting young black males and a few young black females. The rest is nothing bur surgery and some convincing, like the noise of a spoon in a cup of tea that is the hypnotizing fetish used here by a woman who is supposed to be a psychoanalyst of some kind... or other.<br/><br/>These white top middle-class weirdoes just forget one thing: that hypnotizing only works if the target can hear the noise of the spoon on the china. Chris Washington is just funnier and more intelligent than all the other victims: he manages to get some stuffing out of the padding of the armchair in which he is tied up, arms and legs buckled up, and he stuffs his ears with it, quite some contortion I guess, but since his head and torso are not tied up it is just some circus work, and we all know Blacks are good at circus work. And then he can destroy the whole project. The details are funny in many ways and both vicious and absolutely deserved, merited and justified for these modern human pirates and enslavers.<br/><br/>He gets some final help from a friend of his who is a security agent in the local airport, and he leaves the mansion by the beautiful lake burning and everyone in there dead or dying. And that's where the film becomes funny, I mean a real comedy.<br/><br/>It is like some kind of revenge of Blacks against whites. The background is that the present white elite governing the USA are nothing but trying to enslave the Blacks anew by putting them in prison, massively, especially if they are young males, and then by extracting from them what they consider is best and implanting it into white people, including, along the way, some sex slavery for young Black men who become the toys of white women two or three times their age. That is laughable because it is bound to fail sooner or later, first because of global communication, that tells the world every time there is a new black victim on some street at the hands of some police or racist hooligans and fundamentalists. Then these reactionary racists are exposed, condemned and hunted down to the very last one of them.<br/><br/>And they constantly shiver, shudder and quake with fear because they know the Blacks, and the Latino Browns are nearly a majority in the USA and growing, so they will be soon and have the proper figures on their sides, like the Catholics in Northern Ireland. Right now, there are enough progressive whites to make a majority, provided those running on that side of society are open and progressive enough to mobilize these very Blacks and Browns, without frightening away the progressive whites with reforms that are seen as too much or too dangerous. But things are already turning up interesting.<br/><br/>So, let's play poker for 2020 because we, the people who believe in human progress, have some good trump cards in our sleeves, including a whole bunch of aces. But that sure is going to require a lot of heavy bluffing.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
"helencmm","9","0","3","27 December 2019"," Heavily influenced by ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975) and I'm really happy about that...
","When I watched ""Get Out"", I had no idea of ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975) existence. So my first thoughts were ""clever, intelligent, alternate representation of racism, authentic, prototypical, unique"". One day I wanted to watch a high quality classic film, preferably horror. And this is how I found ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975). After watching this film, I started to realise that had many similarities with ""Get Out"". According to the producer of this film, ""The Stepford Wives"" was a big influence for the making of this film.<br/><br/>So my review had to be changed. One of the main ideas, the brainwashing, was the same, but for the different reasons. I appreciated the fact that they used this specific social problem as the main topic of the film (racism) in combination with science, biology, hypnosis etc.<br/><br/>Let's get in the plot. I really liked the fact that we had a really clever protagonist from the beginning of this film. Unfortunately it lacks in many films. I liked how the mystery was unfolding. ""Creepy"" is the suitable word.<br/><br/>Very good performances. Especially doctor and the servant's one. The directing was also very good. But the most important thing was the fact that there are many memorable scenes from this film, that are hard to forget. I don't want to forget.<br/><br/>The gore is mediocre, but is visible mostly at the end of the film. It also contains much agony, which I love and of course it contains some comedic scenes by the protagonist's friend. I really enjoyed watching this film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, is this film authentic? Yes and No. Is there parthenogenesis in art? Not at all. Was this film creative? Way more creative than you think, since it blended many topics into one. It still gives me chills.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","I found this movie helpful for depicting the experience of being black in America in a chilling way.<br/><br/>Classified in various places as either a thriller or a horror movie, ""Get Out"" has reportedly been described a documentary by its director, Jordan Peele. I can see his point.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya turns in a convincingly understated performance as Chris, an African-American man who, against the advice of his best friend ,Rod (Lil Rel Howery), agrees to visit the parents of his white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams).<br/><br/>In a skin-crawling way, we observe here how liberal white folks unconsciously display prejudice in their own peculiar way. (Why does Rose's father -- ""We're huggers"" -- find it necessary to tell Chris he'd have voted for Obama a third time?) For me, it was also uncomfortable as Rose tries to guide the behavior of Chris, as if he isn't capable of making his own choices. This is a rare perspective in our politically correct culture!<br/><br/>Peele is known as a horror-movie fan, and ""Get Out"" references scary classics of the past. The incongruously cheery score that sounds early in the film reminded me of the haunting strains of ""Cannibal Holocaust."" I remembered ""Deliverance"" as Chris ventures into the woods after their car hits a deer. The movie recalls ""Hostel"" when Chris awakens to find himself shackled into a chair. The bizarre auction scene conjures memories of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Stepford Wives.""<br/><br/>The racial politics of this film would have created a sufficient sense of horror, in my view. I was disappointed to see ""Get Out"" veer into conventional slasher territory toward its end. I was also sorry to learn that this movie was constructed with a couple alternative endings. The one I viewed was perfect. When we see flashing lights approach Chris, we brace for hostile stereotyping. One doesn't expect a happy ending, but it does offer a bit of hope."

","Well, those lobotomized critics at Rotten Tomatoes finally got something right for a change in rating the horror/thriller Get Out a 99 (I'd give it 100). It is the SICKEST, HORRIFICALLY HORRIFIC film I've seen in a long time. In fact, I am putting it right now on my sick list of the best horror films for 2017. I'm also adding another word and definition to my personal glossary: Pyschovian - meaning a film is on par with one of the most psychologically horrific thrillers of all time - Alfred Hitchcock's one and only Psycho. This film has surpassed any Jasonian or Krugerian levels and stands alone as a Psychovian film.<br/><br/>Critics should not be giving away the plot and denouement of this film. I implore you NOT to read any one of them. BE SURPRISED! BE SCARED! White knuckle it. Dig your nails into your movie partner's arm (I've still got the scars from my seatmate, but I like that sort of thing). In order to achieve full shocking effect, you MUST hit this film cold - as ice cold as a week-old corpse.<br/><br/>I'd say that this is something of a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner type of film - no spoiler in telling you it's about a white girl who brings home her black boyfriend to meet her upper-crust, snow white family; that's in every trailer. Now don't expect Chris to be anything like Sidney Poitier or Rose's parents to be Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey. And let me tell you Chris, played by an incredibly talented Daniel Kaluuya, and girlfriend Rose, an awesome Allison Williams, are a terrific pair you're rooting for from the start. (Yes, I can be a sap from time to time. Don't hold it against me.) I'm also taking bets that Kaluuya and Williams won't have a moment to rest (that is until they're dead) because they knocked this one out of the ballpark graveyard - they'll be snatched up to star in every film from here to Kingdom Come. As for the 'rents: Catherine Keener as Missy, a mean psychiatrist, and Bradley Whitford as Dean, a neurosurgeon, are two baddies who'll make you itch like you've got head-to-toe poison ivy right from the get go. What is it with these two? And don't get me started on the wackadoodle brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones is as warped as can be). The film lures you like Morpheus from The Matrix down into the perverse rabbit hole of hell where you'll encounter countless twisted racial stereotypes splayed out like 25 feet of eviscerated human intestine.
Hitch could do no better than the likes of the Ripper smooth Jordan Peele in this, his directorial debut. The pace is at a fever pitch throughout - not one dull moment. This film is steeped like too-strong tea in brilliant social commentary - think The Purge franchise. But like James DeMonaco's successful trio, Get Out is still a solid horror genre film, so there are plenty of What the hell is going on? moments as well as the anticipated and well-worn conceit of thinking that the bad people have been successfully dispatched only to see them rise like the Phoenix for a final duel to the death. There is definitely enough red to satisfy gore lovers out there, but far less than the usual shark attack featured in your average slasher film. It's thoughtfully interspersed and packs an axe-wielding wallop.<br/><br/>What makes this film one of the sickest that I've ever seen are the psychological thriller elements. It is a devilishly tasteful witches' brew made up of the diabolic morsels found in classics like The Stepford Wives, Race with the Devil, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers - but that's all I'm going to say. So GET OUT of your house and GET INTO your local theatre and see this film! You'll be thrilled you GOT OUT to experience the brilliant Get Out!!"

"keystrokeharmony","6","0","3","3 July 2019"," A good thriller.
","After seeing the trailer of 'Get Out' and reading it's wikipedia entry, I thought I would be seeing a horror film, but it actually wasn't. There are a few scenes that induced a bit of psychological scare (e.g. the scene, where a man sprinted like a lunatic out of the dark night to the protagonist, just to run past him) and a pinch of splatter/gore (when the neuro surgeon opened the head of a still living elder man). Besides this, there wasn't any more that would get the viewer to feel like watching a proper horror movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that 'Get Out' is a bad movie; it's my fault that I had expected the film to be of the horror genre. There is a lot that gave me the impression of seeing a thriller: e. g. the main character's friend works for the TSA and is therefore obviously quite used to do investigative work as he does in the film to help his friend to get out of his death trap. Even the protagonist himself is pretty curious to find out more about the several strange incidents. He notices plenty of suspicious things, like his phone being unplugged by someone so that its battery is emptied or people saying inappropriate or even brazen things about his pretty hefty afroamerican physique, which he gradually puzzles out to be a threat to his life - just like a detective.
Anyway, it's a good thriller. If you want to see a horror movie, it's probably not what you're looking for."

","So, Jordan Peele, tell me how to categorize this film, so I can accurately rate it... In interviews, you say this film is about ""unconscious white liberal racism""... So, it's political satire? Oh. Well then, that's a pretty harsh take on our society. And, I don't necessarily agree with the sentiment, or think that it's fair depiction of society.<br/><br/>But wait - some of these 'educated white film critics' seem to think that it's a really intelligent horror film, depicting what it ""feels like to be black in white America"". Oh. Well now, that's a different story, isn't it? You see, I can't argue with how you ""feel""... And, as a matter of fact, I can say you used those feelings to make an awesome horror flick. It's a unique tale in a horror genre full of stale and poorly-recycled ideas. And, this is the opinion that won Jordan Peele an Academy Award. Since he didn't give The Oscar back, I guess Mr. Peele is ok with this classification.<br/><br/>Those are all other people's opinions after seeing this film. Since this seems to be a topic that's up for debate, then I guess my opinion means as much here as anyone else. So, I'm gonna call this film what it ACTUALLY is - a 2017 Blacksploitation Horror Film, with no female nudity. So, now that we know how to categorize the film, let's make this a teaching moment - there is a reason that we put gratuitous nudity in horror and blacksploitation films... it makes the other content more palatable.<br/><br/>RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

This is first film by Jordon Peele, but actually his second movie US is best. My suggestion is that you see US instead of Getout.

","An interracial college couple, Chris and Rose, set out to meet Rose's family. Chris an African American, is apprehensive of meeting Rose's family because he is black and sadly, not many white people are accepting of interracial relationship. While at Rose's family's house, Chris experiences an uncomfortable welcome from a family who seemingly is very accepting of the situation. Chris interacts with the family's two black housekeepers, Walter and Georgina. From the moment we meet Walter and Georgina, we can tell something isn't right and they appear to be in some sort of trance, or zombie-like state, but function completely normal. Rose's family holds their annual get together with other people, predominately white, in their community. While Chris' discomfort rises, the family begins to show their true motives behind their community. Chris wants to leave, meanwhile, the community holds a secret auction to sell Chris' body to a member of the community. The goal of Rose's family is to hypnotize Chris so that Rose's father, who is a neurosurgeon, can implant the brain of another white person so that they can use Chris' body to their advantage. Chris manages to escape with the help of his close friend Rod. This film feels like The Stepford Wives with modern elements and modern issues that are addressed.
Get Out is a horror movie that gives satisfaction to those who love a good thrill and deep message for those who enjoy meaningful substance in the film. The theme for getting Out is a focus on ideas and more specifically, a focus on social problems and the truth of human nature. Get Out really hits on race and racism issues that people of color face in America today. Racism isn't always blatant, and, in this case, it comes from the least expected family. Rose comes from a middle-high class white liberal family, appearing to be accepting of her African American boyfriend Chris. However, there is a deeper motive for the Armitage family and their community. They use people of color to preserve the minds of fellow Caucasians by transplanting their brains into the bodies of black people. For some people like Hudson who wanted to use Chris's body because of his ability to see and his photography skills. Then there is Rose's family who use Georgina and Walter to preserve the minds of their family elderly family members and use them as modern-day servants.
Get Out is filled with symbolism that supports the theme of the film and helps tie the story together. When Rose's mother hypnotizes Chris, she refers to his hypnotic state as ""the sunken place"" and this symbolizes the treatment of people of color in America throughout history. Whether its slavery or mass incarceration, people of color have felt powerless and vulnerable just like Chris in the ""sunken place"" state.
For a satirical horror film, this really will put the audience on edge and that is the brilliant work of the editor, Gregory Plotkin. The key to a good horror film is not necessarily the content that is scary but the moments that make the audience ""jump."" The well-timed surprises like when Chris and Rose ran into a deer on the way to Rose's parent's house made for a jolting scene and could take away an audience members breath. The editor liked to build up suspense and make the audience feel like something was going to happen but then use time control to throw the audience off and have the suspenseful moment happen during the least expected times.
Jordan Peele, first time director, put together a wonderful piece of art that catches the essence of multiple themes, including focusing on the truth of human nature, social problems and wrapped together in a horror style package. This horror movie isn't a typical dark and twisted film, it is lighter and more suspenseful, but the evil actions of the characters are what make this film belong in the horror genre."

It in no way should be brought within a best horror film list, however as i said, the director played to the outrage crowd that will give it high ratings as they pander to the racial divisions of society.<br/><br/>The story throughout is intiguing and keeps you watching to the end.

","In the horror and suspense film Get Out Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is taking the next step in his relationship with Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) and taking a weekend trip to meet her parents. Upon their arrival Chris meets Rose's parents Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener) and Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) and notices something off but thinks it's just their way of dealing with Rose's interracial relationship with Chris. Chris soon realizes he was wrong and as the weekend moves on things keep getting stranger and eventually leads to his bad thoughts becoming a reality turning his worst nightmare into a real-life experience.
The movie Get Out will keep you on the edge of your seat just when you thought you had it figured out a plot twist/plot point happens completely changing the direction of the film. When Chris is sitting down with the family and he finally gets to chat with Rose's brother Jeremy Armitage (Caleb Jones) you can see the movie take a big turn for the worst int this scene. The forcefulness that Jeremy shows towards Chris is a big turning point in the film and adds to the theme of the film by creating more suspense. Right after that scene the horror aspect comes into the film when Chris is outside trying to get air and gets spooked by Walter (Marcus Henderson) and returns inside the home to be startled by Missy Armitage. Missy Armitage proceeds to sit Chris down and tricks him into being hypnotized and this is when everything takes a turn for the worst. At this point in the film Chris knows something is not right he just can't put his finger on it. Things keep compiling through out the film leading up to his worst nightmare coming true when trying to leave the house with Rose. In this scene they tie the suspense and horror together by keeping Rose as an innocent person in the film and turning all the other family members against Chris. This doesn't last long as Rose breaks that innocent character identity and reveals her identity as a part of the dysfunctional crazy family. They then proceed to do what they had planned all along with Chris and begin the process of transferring Jim Hudson (Stephen Root) brain particles into Chris's head until at the last minute he figures out how to stop the situation and plans and successfully escapes the hell he had been living all weekend.
The movie Get Out did an awesome job with setting the stage for this film to be not only a suspenseful one but also a horror film. The lighting that they used in the film really helps give off that horror vibe while watching it. When something happens especially to Chris the lighting is always dark and dim making it hard to see anything. As you are trying to focus in on the scene something either pops up or happens making you jump or startled. Another technique they used to help give it that horror sense was the angle of the scenes being filmed. For instance, when Dean is cutting open Jim's head you can't see exactly what he is doing but you know it. Then the blood starts to drip onto the sheet that's separating us from the procedure and you get this gut wrenching feeling overwhelming you. If you have ever seen the movie Hostel you know exactly what I mean as it has the same story line of starting off as a great weekend trip and quickly turning into a complete nightmare. Using the same techniques to give you that suspense/horror feel to the movie. If you are into movie that have lots of plot twist and keep you on the edge of your seat I would highly recommend you see the movie Get Out!"

","Get Out is an extremely powerful, poignant horror movie with some humor. Whatever elements of action or schlock that are present take a backseat to the real human drama that plays out when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his white girlfriend's eccentric family.<br/><br/>The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date, and Caleb Landry Jones in an appropriately, intensely creepy role. But Kaluuya is the star here, and he delivers with zeal a shocking depth and range of emotions. In fact, more often than not its what he doesn't say that delivers the most impact... which is all to say that this masterpiece could not have been accomplished without the masterful direction of Jordan Peele.<br/><br/>Peele builds atmosphere and tension like the Big Bang, dunking you into the mind of the main character while he navigates through very visceral danger.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that sets out to entertain first and foremost with shock and terror, but also with poignant social commentary and real philosophical meat to chew on, Get Out is the movie you need to see. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>This isn't Cabin in the Woods, Peele isn't interested in subverting genre conventions. What he has crafted is entirely original and unique, and thankfully free of clichés or stereotypes.<br/><br/>There are no ""monsters"" here. The real villains are entitlement, egotism, and objectification, and g.d. they are scary!"

"PizzaQueen0712","Null","0","3","2 May 2019"," New Perspective
","I just watched Get Out for the second time. I loved it the first time and my opinion has not changed. In reading negative reviews, it seems that the main issue is the classification of ""horror"". This movie does not fit in any one specific genre. It's not supposed to and it shouldn't have to. It is a combination of elements and that's what makes it special. If you are single-minded you won't get this movie.
The second issue I see is folks calling out the racial aspects of the movie. Again, this movie was not made to cater to the white narrative. I think that it makes a lot of viewers who routinely see white people as the ""good guys"" and saviour of any underdog in a film uncomfortable. Yes, some parts of the movie seem a little ""out there"" but that is consistent with most movies. That's what makes them good. It seems that it would have been better rated if there were no racial aspects in plot and character development but that is not what Peele wanted to portray. He gave us something to think about beyond the regular."

He is aprehensive and we understand and to some extent share his concerns, especially as she seems not to have any similar concerns. This is where we are already sensing something is wrong but when things turn 'weird' at the house we rather relax into the notion that this is going to be a horror story, maybe based on the guy's paranoia. Well, this goes way beyond that into 'Society' and 'Stepford Wives' territory, but always with an element of race. This becomes more and more pronounced until the film is about little else and the audience is set up to cheer the death count (of the white folk).

"alev-41151","9","0","3","4 March 2019"," Movie Overlook
","*SPOILER ALERT* Jordan Peele begins his career in directing by creating one of the best films of the year, tackling multiple societal issues while also giving his audience some laughs and some scares. Get Out strays from the stereotypical horror film by lacking the villainous, scary monster coming from the scary building, woods, etc. Instead it begins with an African-American being the lead character, which is rare when not in an all African-American cast, and the fright of meeting the family of his Caucasian girlfriend. It slowly begins to transition from a regular weekend away into surviving a family of killers and psychopaths. Peele intended the audience to relate to Chris and his fears in every situation with constant close up shots allowing us to feel how uncomfortable he is constantly. It is not just his fears of the crazy family, but societies current awkwardness with interracial couples. Get Out holds a feel of Tobe Hooper with the psychotic killer family seen in Texas Chainsaw Massacre as well as George Romero's Night of the Living Dead feel of entrapment and being stuck in a home.<br/><br/>
Peele takes us through a process where Chris begins to face his biggest fear, his mother's death. Chris looks down on the dying deer after hitting it, resembling a similar situation as his mother's hit-and-run where he was powerless. Later in the film that deer reappears as the roles are reversed and it watches Chris as he is about to die. After hitting the deer, the police was called and the officer asks for the ID of Chris even though he was not driving which is Peele's way of showing society how the law can often prejudice. What might be overlooked in that scene is how Rose stands up for Chris as if the focus is on the racism of the officer, when actually it is so that there was never any evidence that the couple had gone up to the estate. If the incident had been filed and Chris would have gone missing, it would lead the police right to the Armitage's. This is just one example of how so many scenes have a double message behind it. Its constant nondiegetic sounds of screeching horror music and jump scares kept the audience on edge, not sure what exactly is gonna happen next."
"marcusjholley","9","0","3","4 March 2019"," Jordan Peele crushes it in his first film.
","The film highlights many things that are relevant and prominent issues in our society. This is shown through out the whole course of the film. One example is right when they get there Chris gets weird vibes from the servants of the house and their robotic, emotionless faces when speaking to him. Shortly after Chris has been there, he gets to meet all of Rose's parents friends and family members. Two of the most defining scenes in the movie are when Chris is being hypnotized by Missy and she keeps digging in his mind to make him share an emotional connection from when he was a little boy and he starts to cry because he is back in the moment of when his mom died. Then the camera goes back to the extreme close up of his face with a blank stare and tears dripping from his eyes and jaw dropped as Missy says ""Sink"" and he just falls into a pit of hopelessness and he is unable to move. The other scene is when all of the relatives are over and he meets Logan King and the interaction is so odd, plain and emotionless. Later in that same setting, Chris is asked if being an African American in the modern day is a disadvantage or advantage. He ends up passing the question off to Logan and he replies that it has ""for the most part been very good."" Chris rolls his eyes as he nonchalantly pulls out his phone and tries to record his behavior and response but ends up taking a picture with the flash on. Instantly Logan's face goes blank and you see it in his eyes as he almost comes back alive to reality. He instantly looks at Chris as blood is slowly dripping down his face and screams at him to get out. I have seen this scene several times and i still experience chills from head to toe because of the cry for help you hear in his tone of voice is perfect and warns Chris he is in danger. Logan then returns into Missy's office and comes out again emotionless, back stuck in the sunken place. The film does a great job of highlighting prominent societal issues that are present today. This film is a groundbreaking first film for Peele and will be a movie that will be engraved in your head because of how sick and twisted it is. I am excited to see how his future films evolve and turn out."

","I watched this film during my Horror Film course this semester. Prior to the last session, I had no idea what the film was about or even that it was so new.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele takes viewers on an emotional journey in this film. Just as the viewer gets comfortable with the direction of the plot, he throws several twist and turns into the mix to keep things fun and exciting. I would have thought that Jordan Peele writing a horror film would be lead in a more comedic direction with a few small elements of scary. He does the exact opposite!! This film left me guessing and on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Get Out gives the viewer more of a mental scare, as Peele stays away from the typical cheap jump scares you might be expecting. I could watch this film again and again while still finding a different element to ponder and evaluate.<br/><br/>The actors in the film are just amazing; how they can hold their cool in such obscure situations is baffling. The film deserves awards that it did not have the chance to win. Being able to combine horror and comedy in a well-balanced film deserves much more recognition. I would truly like to see another horror film from Jordan Peele, as I feel he has found a way to create a new, more modern horror film.<br/><br/>To anyone who is looking for the psychological thrill, this film will make you feels many uncomfortable things, but it will offer you the opportunity to see the world in a different way and maybe evaluate your past and future."

","**** SPOLIER'S AHEAD ****
Get Out was arguably one of the best films of 2017. This is due to how magnificently it was directed and how artistically all the actors portrayed how racism is deeply ingrained in people. The film was at first painted to be a weekend away for Rose (Allison Williams) and her African American Boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya). On this weekend getaway to Rose's parents' home, Chris quickly realized something was a little off about the family. His suspicions kept growing and growing until he found a box in Rose's old room of all the African American boyfriend's she had had in the past. This is when the film took a turn for the worst and became the most amazingly directed horror film I have ever encountered! Rose's family had captured Chris and were trying to switch his brain with that of an elderly friends so that they could control Chris and use his body. The way that the cast and director executed these following scenes was both artistically beautiful and dictatorially mind blowing. Between director Jordan Peele using many different camera angles such as in scenes like when Chris was hypnotized by Roses mother Missy (Catherine Keener) where Chris was falling into the sunken place. here Peele uses high and low angles to show the dominance of Missy over Chris in this scene and through out the entire movie. Another instance of the amazing artistry going into this film is in the final scenes where Chris is escaping, and all was being revealed to those watching so intently. This section of the film had all rooting for Chris and his escape even though road block after road block were thrown at him. Seeing his escape and his best friend come to the rescue was an amazing ending to a fantastic film. I 100% recommend this film to everyone and will continue doing so until the end of time."

","Get Out is a tremendous film for anyone who is seeing it for the first time, but the amazing part is it's just as good if not better the second time around! More often than not, we as viewers miss elements of the film because we are focused on a different component. Revisiting the movie allowed me to see a lot of the Easter-Eggs I missed the first time around. Additionally, Get Out, hits a 'taboo-topic' that society often has a hard time facing. Jordan Peele masterfully depicts the imbalance in what should be a normal relationship, between a black man (Chris) and a white woman(Rose).
*SPOILER* Early on, we are shown the couple's apartment and we are captivated by a very well kept and stylish apartment, eluding to the fact that the two have a comfortable lifestyle. As Chris and Rose are discussing their plans for the weekend, Chris asks a simple question ""Do your parents know that I'm black?"" Rose admits they do not but goes on to say how progressive they are and that ""if my dad could've voted for Obama for a 3rd term he would've"". Later this exact same expression is uttered by Rose's father (Dean) while he is alone with Chris but instead of reassuring us that he is not a bigot it does the opposite and actually makes Dean come off as disingenuous. However, this is Chris's girlfriend's father, so what can he do except kind of chuckle to himself at the insecure white guy?
Why is this important? Because it isn't really an insecurity; the entire Armitage family actually really do admire blacks. In fact: They are obsessed. The natural abilities that many blacks do possess is inherent and the Armitage's want to inherit those abilities..."
"maazkhan-31222","9","0","3","4 March 2019"," Get Out Review
","WARNING: SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Get Out was like no other movie I have seen before. This is why I think that it is so special and received so much critical acclaim. The beautiful setting and eerie quietness clash together to give you the sense that something is not right.<br/><br/>First, the story line was great for a horror movie, usually horror movies give you a bit of a freight that lasts for a bit but then subsides. Great horror movies are the ones that stay with you for a long time no matter how hard you try and forget about it. I think one of the scariest parts of the movies is when the party of white people are auctioning off Chris. You thought that slavery is abolished and humans have there own free rights but right in front of you an auction for a person is happening, and they are all okay with it. Another thing that I took away from this movie is that fact that no matter how much you know someone, you can never really know who they are or what they are thinking. This is incredibly freighting and is shown in the movie when Chris finds out he is just another guy that Rose has managed to trick. If you are a fan of The Stepford Wives or Rosemarys Baby then you would like this movie due to the fact that Jordan Peele pays some homage to them. From the 'robotic' like brainwashed slaves to the Armitige cult that seem to have no limits. Overall Get Out was not just a great horror film but a great movie in general that is very controversial and thought provoking if you are willing to look deeper."
"matthewtspangler","9","0","3","4 March 2019"," Warning: Spoilers
","!!SPOILER ALERT!!
The movie ""Get Out"" made by the very well-known actor, director, comedian and writer Jordan Peele has to be one of my top three horror movies now after seeing it. The movies cinematography, motifs, jump scares and comedy throughout the movie really drew me in and made it interesting for me. The movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat from the constant horror, but will also have you falling out of your seat from laughter. Jordan Peele does a great job tying in certain motifs throughout the movie, but also leaves room open for your own interpretation. The main motif that is seen throughout the entire movie and is very obvious is modern slavery and racial profiling of African Americans in a society dominated by white people. The main focus of the movie that Jordan Peele was trying to point out to everyone was how African Americans are being exploited and mind controlled for the benefit of elite whites.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we feel bad for what Chris is put and going through. Chris the main character, spends the entire movie surrounded by white people, all of whom we later learn are evil and are attempting to enslave his body. Even the black people Chris meets are already enslaved and are also evil inside. He feels uncomfortable, isn't sure why, and no one empathizes with him about his discomfort. This highlights the effect society, as a whole, has on minorities on a daily basis in a society dominated (numerically and culturally) by white people. The one scene that has everyone talking about the most is when Chris is hypnotized by Rose's mother and Chris falls into another dimension called ""The Sunken Place"". This scene was so clever and artistic based off of the high, low and long shot camera angles that make the audience feel as if they are falling with Chris into a dark, quiet, lonely abyss. All in all this is a movie that I would highly recommend to everyone and Is one that can be watched more than once and still have the same effect the first time watching it had. I would give this movie a rating of 9/10 because there were no flaws that stood out to me and was very surprising to see how successful this movie came out for how short Jordan Peele has been in the director's seat."
"mkgotsch","8","0","3","3 March 2019"," A Tempest in a Teacup - The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste.
","When released in 2017, Jordan Peele's film, Get Out, generated a lot of attention, both positive and negative. For some, Get Out was an instant classic - a multi-genre film that made important observations about the status of racial intolerance in America. For others, Peele's depiction of white America was both formulaic and demeaning. In fact, Peele intended for Get Out to be all of that and more.
The movie appears to be a run-of-the-mill romance where ""boy meets girl"" (BMG). BMG, of course, is a common plot line that can end either happily or sadly - William Shakespeare made it into a tragedy in Romeo and Juliet; Rob Reiner made it into a comedy in When Harry Met Sally; Stanley Kramer made it into a social cometary in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. With Get Out, we begin with uncertainty and end in terror as Peele takes us in a completely unexpected direction. Everything is not as it seems, and we are about to see the mask torn from everyday suburban conventionality.
As the movie begins, Chris and his girlfriend Rose are traveling upstate for a weekend visit with her parents, Missy and Dean Armitage. Echoing Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Chris is concerned that the Armitages will not accept his interracial relationship with their daughter. His concerns seem justified based on their outward pleasantness but obvious nervousness. Besides Chris, there are only three other black people around - two are servants and the other, Dean, is very awkward and odd. Here, Peele evokes the robot-like stiffness of The Stepford Wives - Walter and Georgian are like Stepford servants. As events transpire, Chris - and the audience - discover the disturbing horror that lies beneath the Armitages' outwardly beautiful lake home.
Peele is using the theme of hypnotism throughout the film. Seemingly, in order to cure Chris' smoking habit, Missy hypnotizes Chris by stirring and tapping her teacup. Chris' consciousness is sinking - being oppressed - leaving his physical body under the control of the Armitages. Here, Peele emphasizes the importance of the teacup with a mid-to-low angle, sharp focus shot in which Missy is standing above and controlling both the teacup and Chris.
When Chris takes a photograph, the flash causes Dean to emerge from his trance and he tells Chris to ""get out"" while you still can. We learn that the guests are actually bidding to own Chris' consciousness. In the finale, Chris is able to fight successfully to retain his very existence by breaking both the teacup and its hypnotic power. Yet, we are left to ponder some troubling truths about racism in post-Obama America and the need to get ""woke"" from the hypnotic influences of modern culture."
"alabraham-19969","8","0","3","3 March 2019"," Traditional Meets Innovative
","The feeling of being watched is a classic element in most horror movies but in Get Out (2017), written and directed by Jordan Peele, the audience gets to live vicariously through the main character Chris as he has an intensely different experience meeting his new girlfriend's parents. This film has the classic jump scare elements sprinkled in to the suspense the audience experiences waiting for something triggering to happen to confirm our suspicions about the family. Throughout the film, Peele uses quick cuts and the nondiegetic music of a screeching violin, which is later realized as a leitmotif, to not warn the viewers that there is more going on with this family that we can imagine. We forced to align with Chris and his emotions by not being fully omniscient in many aspects. Even though the viewers see things such as the silent auction, we are unaware of the true meaning of what being bought entails. Each twist and turn of the plot is just as much of a surprise to us as it is to him.
The last few scenes of the movie seem to hone in to the classic horror elements. In addition to the unveiling that Chris' girlfriend is also in on his capture, these scenes are where the blood and killings are displayed in true horror fashion. The blood from the brain surgery in addition to the blood from the killings of the parents, brother, girlfriend, housekeeper and groundskeeper, helps the movie come full circle in ending with the gruesome imagery of a horror movie. This film keeps the audience constantly on the edge of their seat while hoping Chris can find some way out of this monstrous house."
"ggarcia9724","9","0","3","2 March 2019"," The Artistry of Get Out
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>""Get Out"" This award winning film did a great job showing the brutally honest truth of racism in America. This film was one big contradiction. It shows that white privilege is a real life and is happening but at the same time; while also showing that white people are envious of black people because of all the stereotypes. There were many times in the film when someone would hint at their obsession with Chris in being a stereotype of African Americans. For instance, ""black is in fashion"", the athletic ability, genes, etc. Although they love being white it makes you think, is white really the superior race? Dean Armitage had mentioned to Chris about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany where the US track star won gold, not allowing the Aryan race to be superior. This film depicts the courage African Americans must have in order to stand up for themselves and take pride in their culture.
The overall message in this film relates to one of the most real situations happening in America. In addition, when you analyze the film from an artistic viewpoint, you'll understand the film is an award winning film. Every camera angle, sound, lighting, facial expression was done so well in this film. What I thought was truly amazing was the amount of foreshadowing there was. For example, when Chris and Rose are on the was the Armitage household and hit the deer, Chris goes over to see it, which leads to the forest creating a tunnel where it separates the real world (life) to in the darkness of the woods (death). A similar scene is shown during Chris's dream, and finally we are shown what is being foreshadowed. When Chris is hypnotized and falls into the absolute darkness of the ""SUNKEN PLACE"", Chris goes from real life to the darkness of the Sunken Place.
The camera angle used when showing the Sunken Place gives the audience the sense of being in there with Chris. The extreme long shot makes it seem like we have actually sunk down into our minds. The long shot also portrays like we are watching what's happening through the inside of a television set. The close ups of Chris on the chairs while being hypnotized really shows the audience the mental pain and torture he is going through -- eyes bulging, tears flowing, sweat dripping -- we get every detail of what he is going through in these moments.
The sound editing and score of this film is what made the film as suspenseful as it is. The screechy violin gives you the sense of unsettlement, the same as the nails scratching on the chairs almost makes you shiver or cover your ears because of how unsettling it is. The use of silence in the film enhances the creepiness of the film. When Chris goes upstairs to check his phone and the entire party in unison becomes silent. In the Sunken Place, Chris is unable to speak; we see his mouth move but nothing comes out.
The overall message and the artistry of this film was just amazing and being produced by a well known comedian Jordan Peele. He did a wonderful job of creating very real life horror film.

"smbjbmjb","8","0","3","28 February 2019"," A Revisionist View of the Horror/Thriller Genre
","SPOILER ALERT
Everyone's felt like an unwanted outsider at some point in their life. Get Out, directed and written by Jordan Peele, takes this feeling to a whole new level. This horror film seems to stray from the stereotypical horror genre with its distinct lack of creepy monster or dark, foreboding woods. Instead, the audience is treated to the close up shot to give us an understanding of how Chris, the main character, is feeling. We are constantly at Chris's eye level, which allows us to sympathize with his plight. However, Peele ditches the clichÃ©d extreme close up for an unshakeable sensation of being constantly watched. The audience is treated to several jump scares at the beginning to create the overall sense of never quite being alone. Get Out also replaces the overt, thrilling hunting scenes of John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper with the perplexing impression that a noose is tightening around Chris's neck. The nondiegetic music, with its screeching violins and unsettling silence, amps up the uncanny knowledge that Chris is in danger, but the lack of clear violence denies the primitive feelings of prey. To add to the uneasiness, the diegetic sounds of silence and eerie cricket chirps takes the audience at the edge of their seats as they wonder what happens next.
Even though Get Out may seem like just another psychological thriller, it has many characteristics that horror movie enthusiasts expect to see. Even though the audience seems to hold its breath for most of the movie, horror elements start bleed into the movie during the final scenes when Chris is being taken for the final procedure. Sudden cuts from Jeremy to Chris jar the audience out of the sense of security they'd been lulled in. The high angle shot of Jeremy's supposed corpse lets us know who is in control. Suddenly, things move quickly, taking on a more frenzied, horror film feel. We are allowed to sit in suspense as Dean Armitage waits for his son's return. Abruptly, Chris runs him through with a deer trophy and watches him die. After several more frantic fights to the death, Chris finds himself on the road with the female killer. Just like Sally in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Chris was rescued by someone from outside the 'terrible place' and rides away from his nightmare. Overall, the movie was a well-planned trip into the psyche of a hunted man."

Tonally this didn't come across as horror as much as it did a black comedy.<br/><br/>It's a decent premise and that feeling of being the outsider in a group of people pretending to accept you is almost tangible.<br/><br/>Where the comedy comes in is in the behaviour of the other 'ethnic minorities' as they respond to Chris (It's more demented than scary as is Caleb Landry Jones Brad Pitt impersonation), as well as the whole idea behind the story - kind of like a sinister Being John Malkovich (also starring Catherine Keener), which makes sense as upon further reading I have discovered this is the unofficial sequel to BJM.<br/><br/>Still, the film has its moments and you find yourself really rooting for Chris willing him to get the hell out of there.<br/><br/>The film missed a trick by confronting the horrors of racism in an everyday way instead opting for almost cinema of the absurd with more than a few surreal Danny Boylian moments.<br/><br/>Violence as the black man's only method of resolution also seems dubious. Other than that it was an enjoyable popcorn movie. Not sure it was worthy of an Oscar. It wasn't that good."

"auroramartin-29648","10","0","3","16 January 2019"," Get Out Keeps Running To The Top Of The Charts For The Best Original Screenplay
","In the film ""Get Out"" by the director Jordan Peele, he uses different methods throughout the film that bring up the painful history of the racism in America. The actual suspenseful effect that the film had was very powerful, some parts of the movie made me feel like the actions that some of the characters were partaking in were happening to me.
This film is horror/suspense based and it is centered by a interracial couple, the African American male Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), and the female, Rose (Allison Williams). The couple had been dating for over some months now and it was time for Chris to meet Rose's parents. Get out takes you through a various ride of emotions almost feeling like I was connecting to some of the characters at times. Chris had previous worries about his race towards her parents, once they arrived to her parents house and are a bit more settled in, Chris begins to feel more paranoid on what they are hiding from him. As the film goes on in kind of turns into more of a horror film having all of the audience on the edge of their seats.
Jordan Peele uses such a unique way of truly attracting the audience to the film, considering the music as well. The Swahili song that gets recognized throughout the whole film by being in the background keeps an ongoing eerie feeling that something bad is yet to come. Peele does an absolutely outstanding job showing the similarities between all the black characters in the movie at Rose's parents house. In the film the acting is incredible, it almost made me forget who the the actors were because they were playing the part of their characters so well.
One of my favorite parts in the movie shows how I was able to connect to some of the racial stereotypes Chris was facing during a family party at Rose's parents house. At some times Jordan Peele throws in some of his comedic sense of humor at some of the almost screeching horrific parts of the film.
Get Out brings up the sad and hurtful passed of racism but also it connects to the way Chris feels when he is in the sunken place. Because he felt like he had no control over what was going on, same with the racism in the past and how many African Americans were being controlled. This film also connects back to an older suspenseful like horror film called The Shining. Jordan Peele was very inspired by this movie because it gave Get Out more twisted clues at times that no one would notice until the second time they watch it. From the beginning to the end of the movie Peele has everyone on their toes horrified on what's to come. A reference to another director/author that could've been used to make this film would've been Stephen King, just because he makes horror films that include some comedic features that seep through during some of the more suspenseful parts of the film.
Some ways Jordan Peele could've made this movie more prestigious is if he hadn't had the funny black TSA character Rod who is Chris's friend, stop out of the police car to save Chris but instead have actual police officers step out while he is in the middle of trying to save himself from Rose. This change would've made the whole audience stand up in anger and start to yell at the characters to try and help them.
This will forever be one of my recent favorite horror films, it gave me all the emotions one could have within an hour and forty five minutes. Until Jordan Peele comes out with another movie that matches this one it will be on the top of the scale in my mind and in the category of suspenseful films as well. I am pretty positive the whole audience was pleased after watching this incredible film, it was definitely worth the wait and seeing it in the theater! Get Out is highly recommended to watch and then watch it again and notice the little things that show some of the hidden secrets that show what they are hiding at the end."
"MendicuttiD","9","0","3","15 January 2019"," Talking About a Good Thriller.
","It would be the first one to defend films with visual and psychological impact. Whether other critics want to accept it or not, the impact on the senses of the viewer is one of the main reasons why cinema, nowadays, is considered the Seventh Art. The films that move the viewer in deeper ways tend to be those that go down in history and become cult films. Today, the day I write this review, I can say that one of those films competed on the big stage of world cinema in the category of Best Film of 2017. Get Out, directed by Jordan Peele and starring Daniel Kaluuya, presents a story that, as it advances, gets darker and darker, generating depth at a frenetic speed. There are even points in the film that, at least personally, one asks: How did all end up like this? This, more than being a con, proves to be one of the reasons why this production is so amazing.<br/><br/>It should be emphasized that this production does not skimp on symbolism, especially aimed at the marginalization of African-Americans and the control exerted by the higher spheres of power, which in the film is represented as a very powerful group of white people. Somehow, some of the scenes reminded me of some of Malcolm X's discourses about ideological whitening and the need of the African-American to emulate the customs of white people to have a status in society. An example is the attitude of the black slaves, who insist that they do not respond to anyone, that they are cured, that their captors have freed them and a long etcetera. The movie in its narrative suggests a great parallelism to the identity theft committed against the African-American, forced to changing its essence to be a functional part of society, and it can be said that it (the movie) does so in a masterly way.<br/><br/>The house of the Armitage family, along with its guests, is full of clichÃ©s. Customs that are often seen as a characteristic of the white man, where a black person is mentioned that exceeded everyone's expectations, taking as examples Jesse Owens in athletics, Tiger Woods in golf and even Barack Obama winning the presidency of the United States. It reflects a feeling even of envy on the part of the white people, which becomes evident towards the end of the film and in the antagonistic intentions of the family. All of this gathers meaning as time passes, which creates the impression that, at the end of the film, the viewer has seen a puzzle coming together. Very good handling of symbolism, excellent script.<br/><br/>You can see that a fundamental part of the film are those details of tension, suspense and even certain scenes directly targeting a more terrorific path. In this respect, the use of sounds and musical ambience play a key role, which proves to be of high quality in this production. Continuous movements and twists in the plot, which do nothing but create even more visual and psychological impact on the mind of the viewer. I would not be surprised to see someone just watching this movie saying: What did I just saw? It is pleasing to mention however that the above said, in this particular case, adds to the quality of the film instead of taking it away. Very good work by the director and the cast, who proved that they had the exact amount of characters to present the story and that all of them have a degree of depth at least worthy of consideration. Daniel Kaluuya provides a very good performance. However, It was a long shot against Gary Oldman for the 2017 Oscar in this category.<br/><br/>Summing it up, I consider that this film is a perfect combination between the representation of a social stigma and a quality thriller. It is an excellent bet, and had each of its four Oscar nominations and its win as best original screenplay more than well deserved. I highly recommend this film, and I think it will become a movie that will overcome the barriers of time."

"WalkdenEntertainment","9","0","3","10 January 2019"," If You Haven't Seen This Film You Can ""GET OUT""!
","First time director Jordan Peele (as in the one of lead stars from the comedy TV series Key & Peele) brings us a new, fresh and very unexpected film for cinema lovers. Get Out is aimed at the genre of horror and thriller with a little touch of good humor. Get Out tells the story of a young African-American male, ""Chris"", who agrees to finally visit his Caucasian girlfriend's family at their home estate.<br/><br/>Upon arrival everything appears to be what you would expect when meeting a girlfriend's parents. However, within a matter of time...strange things start occurring around the family home. Chris begins to become concerned and curious. And, in order not to spoil the film's plot, this is all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>While watching Get Out I discovered that I was having a really great time. With so many sequels and reboots this year, Get Out felt like I was breathing in clean fresh air. The genre of Horror/Thriller must be very challenging by today's standards to come up with fresh and creative ideas. Considering, as I said above, this is Jordan Peele's 1st official film with him directing, the end results are very good.<br/><br/>Get Out does a fantastic job at keeping the film suspenseful and the viewer hooked until the end credits. At no point did I check my watch because I was bored. I was completely pulled into the film's plot and I wasn't leaving the cinemas until I got answers and explanations for all the strange things Chris was discovering around him.<br/><br/>The film also has an outstanding audio track. The clever use of eerie music throughout will suddenly switch to a well known classic song, letting the audience know that it's ok to have fun with this movie. Jordan Peele's camera work is also something to be praised. The clever use of multiple angles and slow panning is something that I would call ""Hitchcock"" style. Many times throughout the film I was watching something that shocked me or had me in suspense, but no matter what, I couldn't help it but to have a smile on my face too. When I see s scary movie, I am a man who doesn't normally jump out of his seat. But this movie, got me to jump twice (once even yelling at the cinema screen!).<br/><br/>Get Out is a film that Finesse Movie Reviews suggest you shouldn't miss in 2017. I feel it's a film that will really surprise and I recommend this for those who enjoy an interesting story with suspenseful moments. The film does have a couple of faults to be sure, but they are so minor I refuse to talk about them online. I found the film to be unpredictable, but even when I knew something was coming... I was so keen to see it happen as this film had me very Invested in it.<br/><br/>9.1/10

","Where do I begin? Everything worked in this movie flawlessly. Things I thought would be unfunny or stupid worked, such as Ned The Security Guard or simply the ideas of slavery still going on secretly is actually done great. The twists and turns, the family getting killed, the imagery, the creepy moments, a silent auction disguised as playing bingo. IT'S AMAZING AND SOMETIMES HILARIOUS IN THE BEST WAY. There were two scenes where Ned was scared for Chris (the main character) and he complains to the police and it was REALLY DAMN FUNNY. The second scene is when Ned is called by Rose (Chris' girlfriend) and tries to seduce Ned in the most robotic and unsubtle way and it's HILARIOUS. Moments that were scary were actually scary and nerve-racking such as when he's watching the TV while kidnapped or simply becoming hypnotized for the first time. All around, I loved this movie and I'm definitely going to see it again. 10/10."

Such as, having a friend who is not only concerned but investigates and tracks down their friend who hasn't returned from a weekend away to met his new girlfriend's family, is refreshing. I admire the unnerving feeling of racism throughout the film is wonderfully unsettling, that opens up many discussions about what is racism in the 21st century."

Perhaps the film tries very hard to shove down the message down our throats and maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the thrill much. And the climax for me was a bit dull.

"popculturethoughts","10","0","4","24 December 2018"," Pop Culture Thoughts
","Coming seemingly out of nowhere, Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" is likely unprecedented in cinema history: A story excoriating white racism that deals with social issues without succumbing to facile conclusions, written and directed by a black man whose vision is clearly not compromised. But even beyond those distinctions, the movie itself is absolutely fantastic - it's unpredictable without being inscrutable, extraordinarily well acted without histrionics, and benefits from a riveting, pulse-pounding climax. Daniel Kaluuya turns in a knockout performance, with several stand-out scenes where Kaluuya communicates his character's growing suspicions without changing the expression on his face. Ultimately this is one of those few movies where the buzz is more than warranted, with Peele delivering a gut punch of a movie that is sure to be dissected and discussed for decades to come."

","So it feels silly reviewing a movie that everyone has either seen or reviewed but I do these for me so here goes.<br/><br/>;TLDR - Very interesting movie, really makes you think and gets you hooked right in. Lots of feelings of anxiety and confusion. Very well shot and put together feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone with a rather abrupt but solid ending.<br/><br/>I've held off watching Get Out for while now so I figured I should probably get to it. The movie is often listed as a thriller/horror/comedy which seems like the odd mix of genres but the blend works well. The comedy isn't overly there ruining the suspense or terror, it's very well included in the form of 1 character from time to time.<br/><br/>The tension created right off the bat and the awkward feeling of ""something is not right here"" is great and makes you very interested in what is happening/going to happen. About 30 minutes into the movie you start to think ""am I watching a modern episode of The Twilight Zone?"" (How fitting with Jordan Peele being the new host of the show). At first you might feel like the movie is predictable or that you know what's going to happen and in some ways you may be right but there are still some interesting story points that you might not expect. Overall it was very enjoyable very captivating and a pretty fabtastic movie in the end."
"dnabney","10","0","4","5 December 2018"," Great flick
","I really liked this movie. I thought it had a lot to say about current day racism. The white people in this film viewed black people as physically valuable but did not recognize any value in their minds or any other aspect of their beings. The quote ""black is in fashion"" indicates that black people are just a commodity for white people to use - and in this film, they do use them in the extreme.<br/><br/>I loved the ending, I loved the kill scenes, I loved the feeling of being trapped that this movie made me feel. I was able to really sympathize with Chris (as much as a white woman can) and I loved that he felt fleshed out as a character. I liked him as a person, and I felt this made me better able to empathize with him.<br/><br/>This was my second viewing and I have to say I really appreciated the ""something's not right"" hints portrayed by Georgina, Walter, and Logan, as well as the white people in this film, more the second time around. For me, knowing the reason behind the odd behavior made it that much more horrific for me.<br/><br/>My only problems with this film were the use of hypnotism because I just don't buy that it could be that powerful, the use of neurosurgery because there are too many holes there like how were memories and personality transferred in tact to the other person, and I felt the comedic aspect the character Rod brought to the film did not fit in with the overall plot. As much as I appreciate horror comedy, it did not work for me in this particular film."

","It took me almost a year before I started watching this movie. On the surface, it was not the kind of movie that particularly appealed to me, and I've always told myself : it's just an umpteenth story about racism.
And yet, surprise ! It is easy to identify the atmosphere of the film from the very first minutes. What I like about this film is that it is full of small details that feed our understanding of the plot and I find it so ingenious.
Not to mention the acting, which, unsurprisingly, has amazed the audience. We often talk about Daniel Kaluuya's extraordinary performance, but not enough of Allison Williams's. She plays, in my opinion, the darkest character in the film. The moment we discover that in fact she was a villain was truly shocking. I didn't expect this plot twist. This is why I think that the moment when Chris discovers the photos is the best scene, and also one of the best anti-climaxes I've ever witnessed in my entire life.

","Get out. Marketed as a horror but I'd say more psychological thriller with added political and social commentary. 'Tealeaf' from Psychoville plays an African American dating a white middle class American girl. He meets her parents at their house after four months together and they act a bit like David Brent when he's around the black guy in The Office (we voted Obama etc). The humour soon turns to tension as events start to take a turn for the peculiar - particularly amongst the household's black 'servants'. A very original and thoroughly engaging 8 out of ten."

","A serviceable and entertaining horror film with some sinister moments and some funny moments. Very predictable story and events, as the almost immediate awkwardness from the characters gives a lot of the mystery away, but there are still some good clues and a tidy, if somewhat convenient, ending. I think it should have done more with the imagery, psychological mind games and potentially deep-rooted racism aspects of the plot."

"cpowchuk","7","0","1","4 October 2018"," Very similar to a movie called THE SKELETON KEY
","The movie GET OUT was exceptional, incredibly well done. The actors were believable and the story well written. However I can't help but see the similarities to the movie THE SKELETON KEY starring Kate Hudson.
In SKELETON KEY, Kate Hudson plays a woman named Caroline Ellis. Caroline goes to work for an older couple (Violet & Ben) where she discovers voodoo and witch craft are being used. It isn't until the very end - when we discover that the older couple brought Caroline to their home to steal her body and basically the old woman would take over Caroline's body but still be Violet's mind. They use something called hoodoo and Caroline's mind switches to Violets old body and Violet moves into Caroline's young body. The end.
In GET OUT, the story is exactly the same. Rose brings her black boyfriend Chris, to her parents house for the weekend, where several rich (older) whites couples bid at auction to buy the rights to Chris' body. Chris is hypnotized by Rose's mother Missy, with the intent that Rose's father Dean would perform a brain transplant. They had apparently been doing this ""operation"" for some time, at least 12 that we know of. Luckily, Chris figures this out just in time and with some very good luck he manages to kill all 6 people involved and gets away. It is the same story, older people who wanted new young bodies, without giving up their own personalities and past experiences. Both movies are very good, although I liked The Skeleton Key a bit better because I saw that one first. The movie Get Out is excellent."

"emilielovo","7","0","1","3 October 2018"," pretty good
","First of all, i think its reasonable to mention that im white, and i didn't really think it was scary at all (and im terrible with horror usually). however, it sure as hell isnt the comedy some people make it out to be either. this is also one of those things that are each to their own though, so others may find it way more terriying than i did, which i understand.<br/><br/>with that out of the way, i really liked the script, and i thought the concept was incredibly interesting. its one of the most original horror films ive seen in a long while, and the acting was incredible. the editing was great too, although i remember it defintly followed a specific (over exaggerated? but only in a good way) style of acting, which i applaud them for honestly. the reason i didnt really think much of this movie, honestly just comes down to preference.<br/><br/>conclusion: not everyones cup of tea, not really mine either, but i'd still reccomend it, either way its definitely entertaining."
"bloodyhigh","9","0","1","2 October 2018"," Get Out is easily one of the best horror films of 2017.
","TL;DR:
It's not surprise that Get Out shot to the top of the box office when it was released. It's a smart critique of how racism still exists today wrapped up into a modern-day horror masterpiece. Hands down one of my favorite horror movies of 2017.<br/><br/>The LONG version:
Chances are if you're a fan of horror, you've seen most (if not all) of the movies I've reviewed. I don't review first-run movies that are still in theaters. Instead, I stick to movies I'm able to enjoy in the comfort of my own home high as hell. Which reminds me... Before I dive in, I need to disclose one small detail. I enjoy watching movies (especially horror) while high. Apologies in advance to anyone out there who that may offend. That said, it all boils down to harm reduction. Maybe it's just me being overly cautious, but I'm not comfortable getting intoxicated in public, let alone a movie theater. And that goes for alcohol too. I want as much control over my environment as possible when I decide to get baked.<br/><br/>So yeah, that was a long explanation as to why I don't review movies that are still in theaters. But I felt the need since there have been a few requests from people to review flicks that haven't reached home video yet.<br/><br/>Riveting, isn't it?<br/><br/>Which brings me to Get Out - a movie I'm certain every horror fan has already watched. If you haven't, shame on you! But if you've read any of my previous reviews, chances are that's not why you're here. Yes, you've probably seen the movie. The question you have is should you watch it again... stoned? To find out the answer, we must first find out which strain was selected for this particular evening.<br/><br/>It was a Friday night so I decided to change things up with a sativa and grabbed some legendary Sour Diesel. It wouldn't help my insomnia, but it did get my mind and body into a comfortably euphoric state while also easing my joint pain. It didn't produce any couch-lock effects that I appreciate while watching TV, but I was too high to care.<br/><br/>Sour Diesel buds are light green in color with rust colored hairs and packed with frosty trichomes. Just as the name implies, the smell is pungent and heavy on the diesel with a touch of pine. After sparking up the bowl and taking my first rip I was able to appreciate the earthy flavor and smooth inhale. I may have kept the smoke in my lungs for a bit too long because the exhale wasn't as smooth and triggered a pretty intense coughing fit. My lungs tightened up and my head instantly felt like it was 5 pounds heavier. Perfect time to get the movie started!<br/><br/>Get Out is the brainchild of first-time director Jordan Peele and begins innocently enough with a black man walking down a suburban street at night. The sidewalks are empty and only a single car is on the road slowly following the man. When he stops walking, the car stops. When he decides to ""keep on walkin'"" the car begins to follow again. Everyone who's ever walked alone at night can relate to this type of fear and the movie perfectly executes the tension and inner-dialogue going on in his mind. My heart raced as I anxiously watched the scene play out knowing it wasn't going to end well. Of course, there's a good chance my racing heart was a side-effect of the Sour Diesel bombarding my endocannabinoid system, but whatever. The man eventually decides to change course in an attempt to avoid the trailing car. It's no use. A masked assailant sneaks up on the man, chokes him out, then stuffs him into the trunk of the car and drives off. Part of its visceral quality is that it's all presented as a single shot. No cuts. Perfectly choreographed to make you feel like you're right there watching it happen in real time. It's terrifying, it's uncomfortable, and that's how the movie starts! Buckle up, kids. It's going to be a crazy ride!<br/><br/>The movie stars Daniel Kaluuya (Chris) and Allison Williams (Rose) as an interracial couple who's off to meet Rose's parents and spend the weekend at their suburban home. Chris is worried about how Rose's parents will react when they meet him since she's never told them he was black. But Rose assures him that everything will be fine. When they ultimately arrive at the house, everything does appear to be fine... maybe a little too fine. The father, Dean, a doctor (Bradley Whitford) and mother, Missy, a psychiatrist (Catherine Keener) seem like they're the definition of the perfect American marriage. Things get a little odd when their live-in servants, a maid and gardener, are introduced - both of whom are black. It's hard not to immediately think ""slave"". But once again, Rose comes in to ease Chris' worries. She explains that they both cared for her ailing grandparents when they were alive. Once they passed, they were already ""part of the family"" so her parents simply allowed them to stay. Again... maybe a little too nice.<br/><br/>It's no wonder this movie shot to number one in the box office when it was released. It's a smart critique of how racism still exists today wrapped up into a modern-day horror masterpiece. Horror is the mechanism, but exposing how racism still lingers in places you wouldn't expect is the message. Often times the most racist are those who are also the most outwardly ""progressive"". This point is driven home when Rose's father expresses to Chris that he ""would've voted for Obama for a third time if I could"". Maybe it's just me, but that sounds like a bit of overcompensation... almost defensive. He might well have said, ""I have a lot of black friends."" Are either of those phrases outwardly racist? No. But that's the whole point of the movie.<br/><br/>That evening Chris sneaks out for a smoke (he's trying to quit) and witnesses both of the servants acting strange. The gardener sprints around the estate nearly running right into him and the maid appears in a trance-like state staring out her window. When Chris finishes his smoke and returns to the house, Missy spots him and invites him to chat. He sits across from her and Missy begins going to work by first asking if he's comfortable. Then she asks if he smokes in front of her daughter and offers to help him quit through hypnosis. Her questioning becomes more and more personal until she suggests he ""sink into the floor"". And sink he does. The now famous image of Chris paralyzed, horrified, helpless, tears streaming down his face. He falls deep into the ""sunken place"" as he looks through a window into the conscious world. His screams are silent. The whole scene is unnerving. In fact, I'm happy I didn't choose a more psychedelic strain like Gorilla Glue #4 or Blackwater that make me feel like I'm sinking into an underworld. Probably would've been too much for my mind to comprehend. And then just like that, he wakes. Safe in bed he tells himself it was just a nightmare.<br/><br/>This is when Get Out really turns up the heat. The events that unfold continue to heighten and become even more uncomfortable until the terrifying climax when the real motive behind the meet-the-parents weekend getaway is uncovered. If you've seen the movie you're already well aware of the the twists and turns of the final act. If not, you'll thank me later that I didn't spoil anything."

","Finished watching Get Out. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. The movie genuinely kept me guessing and perfectly used suspense to keep me hooked.

","Disclaimer!

Unfortunately quite unscientific when it come to its medical procedures and references to hypnosis.Nevertheless, still a worth watch.

It suck that I already saw some glimpse of Get Out before in movies like You're Next and The Wicker Man but nonetheless it still cool when a first time director with a heavy comedy background made a horror movie that win a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay the award that I think is the hardest to even nominated when Hollywood nowadays suffer from the lack of imagination"

","This film called 'Get Out' did not let us be civil because the plot which we won't let out is unexpected. The Scientist like study performed to 'Get Out' puts us uncomfortably at the edge of our seats. The expression 'Spoilt pride' suits this piece. 
Spoils of this movie are a turn over; being individual rather than objective. The objective truth is the systematic approach to putting us through dangerous attacks of thrilling adventure which goes against visual experience. The experience individually is poor. 
The experience collectively unattractive but the clues don't add because the plot cannot be revealed. The experiment cannot but work though over seas it can be bothering; so goes a hour and another with a mistake costlier than time. Movies which are watched in the second dimension: provoke us to act like at another cinema but work well when seating still.

The special effects used in the ""sunken place"" are like nothing I have ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie. It may not be a perfect movie, but it is perfectly rabid and full of ideas that it is unafraid to throw at the audience, and in a way that is more respectable than being formally perfect.

"Lewis_Heather787","8","0","2","7 June 2018"," Biggest Surprise of 2017
","This film was a huge surprise last year to say the least, what an incredible film that to be honest I though I wasn't going to like in the beginning. However I do feel as if this film was marketed wrong because this film isn't a horror, its a psychological thriller with brilliant twists. <br/><br/>Jordan Peele out of nowhere has given us a film that is truly remarkable and sends a strong message underneath at will appeal to everyone. The directing is very good but then when you find out this is his directorial debut, it is jaw dropping how good this film is. This could be the start of a very interesting and promising directing career. The writing as well is mind numbingly weird, how did he come up with this story it is creepy as hell. I'll get onto the writing achievement a bit more later on in the review. Fantastic work!<br/><br/>The cast are fantastic all across the board, however there are two that standout above the rest. Firstly Daniel Kaluuya, yes at last this man has mean given a big juicy role in a film, for me one of the most underrated actors working today. I am so glad that he was given a chance and my word did he not disappoint. His character is the audiences perspective of the story unfolding in front of us in a way. As soon as the film starts you instantly have a connection to his character and you end up routing for him. The other standout for very different reasons is Allison Williams, she really is the foundation of the film because if her deception doesn't work then the whole film around her will fail. The first time I saw the film, over a year ago now, I was astounded by how I didn't see the character switch from her coming. Williams had portrayed the innocent girlfriend so brilliantly that I believed it and that she as just as innocent and good as Kaluuya. Extremely good acting from both of them. <br/><br/>Small shoutout should go to Lil Rel Howery as ""Rod"", a hilarious character that is a pure joy to watch and actually serves a purpose in the story rather just a funny side character.<br/><br/>The biggest positive I take from the film is the re-watchability of the film. As soon as I saw it the first time I instantly wanted to watch it again because the film would take on a whole new meaning. Character motivations in the beginning mean show much different , now knowing the ending. For instant when ""Chris"" and ""Rose"" get pulled over by the cop, ""Rose"" insists that ""Chris"" doesn't have to show his id. Showing that she is a strong woman standing up for her man against blatant racism. However on second viewing, she is only defending ""Chris"" because she doesn't want any record of both of them together when he eventually gets reported missing. Soooo Good!!<br/><br/>There are big hints at racism/stereotype in the film that is portrayed and handled so perfectly , for example when the party is going an ""Chris"" is going round making small talk with people. At first viewing they all just seem a bit weird but actually there are shaping him up for the auction. The final part I really like that cuts so deep is how ""Chris"" frees himself from the basement, by stuffing seat fluff in his ears. However Im pretty sure I heard Jordan Peele in an interview say that it was actually referencing a black man picking cotton out of the seat to free himself............when I head that my jaw dropped! So unbelievably good !!<br/><br/>Overall this film is 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10 its a really good film that should appeal to everyone, even if you are not a horror fan you should 100% check this out you won't regret it. For me it was the biggest surprise of 2017 because I'm not horror fan myself but I ending up loving the experience. If I was going to give it any negatives I'd say that the pacing here and there is a little off and film does drag a little. All in all I cant wait for what ever Jordan Peele does next!"

This film was riveting from start to finish. It delivers on every promise it makes, it keeps you guessing until the end, it's smart, it's satisfying... it's 10/10 easy."
"courtneypedersen","8","0","1","27 May 2018"," Cerebral Thriller
","Before watching this, I read a lot of the reviews, including the ones that called this movie racist and it almost made me decide not to watch it. However, I enjoyed watching Daniel Kaluuya in Sicario and didn't want to pass up the opportunity to see him give another amazing performance. I'm glad I decided to ignore the detractors and watch this movie. It was one of the most intelligent thrillers I've seen in a long time. Jordan Peele's directing style reminded me a lot of Hitchcock in that the scares and thrills creep up on you and you feel something isn't quite right but you're not sure why. 
This movie is rife with intricate symbolism and I can see why a course was created and inspired by this movie. Being able to see the events unfold through the eyes of the Chris character was, at times, uncomfortable but also enlightening. Towards the end of the movie I was cheering him on as he gave the Armitage family their comeuppance. Do I believe this movie is racist against white people? Not at all. I believe it is using an exaggerated situation to describe how the writer/director feels or has felt through out his life. I think the ultimate demise of the Armitage family is symbolic of his triumphing over the ""Sunken Place"".
I also believe people want to take things at face value and not look below the surface or try to see things from someone else's perspective. If you do not go into this movie with an open mind, you will be cheating yourself out of what is arguably one of the best thrillers."

I was so wrong... By the time we got to the last 3-5 minutes I still got hopes that there will be a big twist some crazy ending, I had multiple theories about how the mom and the deer are somehow connected, that this is all a dream and just a way to cure his addiction or make him get over loosing his mother or whatever, something unexpected that I didn't notice... but no it was a straightforward ""thriller"" with barely any suspense, nothing scary, and nothing unexpected... The acting is the only thing that lifts it up to mediocre without some quite believable performances(though it's not that hard to make this setting creepy or awkward with okay acting) it would be quite below that... I'm really baffled how this got any other nomination from the academy than maybe best actor(and that is a big maybe) ...winning best screenplay? I would laugh if this weren't so sad... I was quite hopeful till the movie ended, but it was ultimately really disappointing."

","An excellent performance by Daniel Kaluuya really carries this film far beyond where it should be. Allison Williams also deserves a mention.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't live up their standards.<br/><br/>A distinctly average script and similar direction from Jordan Peele really scuppers the film, yet it has somehow garnered numerous award nominations and raked in a whole load of money from a tiny budget, so we'll definitely be hearing at lot more from Jordan Peele.<br/><br/>It's one of those films that managed to get word of mouth right, but in the future it won't be regarded as well as it is now.<br/><br/>Hopefully next time the budget will allow for a decent script doctor to whip it into shape."
"littlemankazoo","6","0","1","5 February 2018"," Murky and unfocused in what it wants to say
","I finally managed to sit down and see the film that has had EVERYONE talking for over a year now...and now, I can speak my thoughts regarding it.<br/><br/>To preface, I adore Jordan Peele's work as a writer. If you have not yet seen Key & Peele, I demand you see it. Peele is an excellent comedy writer.<br/><br/>That said...I cannot, for the life of me, say that I see what others have raved about in this film.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele may be an excellent writer, but his direction is honestly lacking in this film. Many of these shots are framed more in-line with a television series, with lighting that looks like it's a comedy, not the horror/thriller it wants so badly to be. The 'scares' lack that staying power that keeps you on-edge. This is a fault in direction, and I honestly can give some leeway for that in that this is his first major film.<br/><br/>That said, his writing lacks the power it needs to send this film chugging along. The screenplay contains borrowed parts from a much better film ('Being John Malkovich'), and any of the points it aims to make regarding race relations and racial tensions, they're either points that have been made before or are too murky and lack that real 'pulp' to make a difference. There was something that Peele clearly wanted to say, but I feel like there wasn't enough clarity to truly deliver on it.<br/><br/>The performances were about as serviceable as any other Blumhouse horror film. They serve the story and the concept well, they invest you enough. I did not see what was so Oscar-worthy regarding Daniel Kaluuya's performance, but that's simply my viewpoint on it.<br/><br/>My biggest issues here, however, come with the aforementioned screenplay. It simply cannot decide WHAT it wants to be, and that's perhaps the greatest flaw this film has.<br/><br/>Does it want to be a horror film and taken seriously? Of course not. There's a scene where Jeffrey Dahmer and what he did with human heads is discussed in a sexual manner. Does this want to be a dark comedy? Hardly. There's not enough moments of levity beyond the main protagonist's friend to give us an idea of that tone. Does this film want to be a biting commentary on racism and current-day race politics?<br/><br/>Honestly, I can't even be sure there. Much of this film's commentary on race feels either done-before or unfocused. We only get concepts as deep as echoes of slavery and stereotype. Why not talk about the double-standards of race and race relations in this modern era? Why not talk about the alarming way culture will occasionally assure itself racism is 'over' and is no longer an issue in this day and age? There are just so many things a concept like this COULD have said, but I find myself reaching conclusions that I have already reached with past films, while Jordan Peele paints them as novel and new concepts in this film.<br/><br/>My issues extend to further things beyond just the execution of its commentary, however. There are plot holes within the film that I simply cannot excuse. I cannot divulge them here, but there were points where I had to verbally ask myself 'Wait, how...?', which does not bode well for a film. To go further, the screenplay finds itself in the land of conventions by its 3rd act, and a few questionable choices by its characters lead me to ponder the film world's logic.<br/><br/>All of this said...I appreciated that a film like this could be made in the first place. Its concept, borrowed as it is, is a WEIRD one, and I appreciate that it isn't a tired, worn-out film plot that I have seen thousands of times before. I'd rather have a film I've seen once before than a hundred.<br/><br/>To further move off that, while I did critique the cinematography, there are some beautiful gems of shots tucked-away in this film. Particularly in the 3rd act, when the lighting and sets turn dream-like and we get a world that looks far more interesting than its first two-thirds.<br/><br/>In the end, after months and months of hearing about this film and keeping myself fresh and ready to give it a run...in the end, it's really nothing I haven't seen before. There are better horror films. There are better dark comedies. There are better films tackling race. There are better-directed films. There are better-acted films.<br/><br/>Aside from its tense soundtrack, a few beautiful shots, and a sense of originality that is lacking in today's mainstream film world, I really cannot say I am with the hype train on this one, but I absolutely recommend you check it out. Maybe you'll see something I missed~"
"mgruebel","7","0","1","3 February 2018"," Good fun, but not Oscar material
","""Get out"" is a well-crafted little thriller, with just the right balance between dead pan humor, poking fun at stereotypes - like ""blacks stalking whites in bad neighborhoods"" being reversed, ""TSA is less competent than police"" being reversed, and so forth. There's even some mild horror action at the end.<br/><br/>The premise is well-designed, as black dude Chris and his all-too-perfect white girlfriend meet her mom and dad, who show a little too much concern for his health. Little does Chris know that among the party guests at the parent's secluded estate, the one old blind guy who seems like an OK chap has designs on Chris' body and eyes. Chris is increasingly clued in that something very fishy is going on, with mom hypnotizing him, dad a weird brain surgeon, and the black groundskeeper, the black maid and a black party guest behaving oddly like white folks.<br/><br/>Never mind that Chris' buddy, who works for the TSA, is smelling the roses when they chat on the cell phone, and tells Chris to get the hell outta there. It's too late when Chris finally discovers a shoebox with photos of his girlfriend and a string of previous black suitors, all gone missing.<br/><br/>From this point on, the horror chapter of the script ensues, and it dips into the usual pitfalls of horror flicks, making ""Get Out"" not even remotely worthy of Oscar consideration. Why for example would Chris' girlfriend string him along when he finally tries to ""Get Out,"" instead of mom just immediately invoking her well-established hypnotic control over him? They needlessly endanger the good health of Chris' body, and they do want it in good health! But the scriptwriters wanted the ""nice character who seemingly supports the hero and goes 'bad' on him last"" horror clichÃ© in the film. There are many such class-B horror movie artifices towards the end.<br/><br/>The films lacks the cleverness of Hitchcock thrillers, the outrageousness of a Peter Jackson horror flick, but it has humor, and is well-staged to the bitter end, despite being fairly predictable about two-thirds of the way through. Thus it deserves a good chuckle, and provides a satisfying one-time view with some good surprises - That's worth a 7/10."

","For a new director, Peele debuts well, very well actually. I loved the acting, the lead, David Kaluuya did it for me. Allison Williams also did good. I mean the theme of the movie was quiet clear from the start and so you would follow in hopes of a rewarding resolution. My major setback was the finishing, i recall checking time left on the movie around when Chris wanted to leave because he had found them out, and i knew they where going to have to rush the ending. I was left unsatisfied to say the least. I enjoyed the fact that Peele wrapped what could have been a gruesome horror movie into something more subtle like a white girl taking home a black boyfriend but expected a more involving intense finishing. i wanted my WHY answered, why they did what they did, what was the essence to them, what was the essence even to us. For some reason i wanted to know they (white family) had regretted their actions but of course we are not given that luxury since Chris murders them all before any of them could share a dialogue. And where did Lil Rel come from, all of a sudden he gets a police car and appears just when all has ended, come on, too safe and too cliche for me."

"ritera1","3","0","2","22 December 2017"," Although well directed and acted, that doesn't matter if the
","Reveal isn't solid. And it wasn't.<br/><br/>(I should preface this with me being a white man in his 50, albeit a ultra liberal.)<br/><br/>And with this, it's all about just waiting around for the reveal. It was paced and acted well but pedestrian in the writing and character development.<br/><br/>And why? Why all this front-end crap for something that could have been done with a simple kidnapping? It was just an extended creepfest without the slightest sense of purpose in the end (except the very vague ""auction"").<br/><br/>You know. A kidnapping. Like they had at the beginning of the film. Why was it so important to string out the middle act if that was a clear and very easy option?<br/><br/>And in that, it made no sense. Not even economic sense. If there were so many potential ""customers"" at the party, why not just kidnap and make more money?<br/><br/>Why would the daughter Rose go through what was apparently four months of a relationship with the lead Chris just to have him as fodder for the psychotic white doctor and, conveniently, the psychotic family members? Kidnapping would have done the same. It was the height of sociopathic for the whole family being that she was constantly having sex with men she didn't care for.<br/><br/>And the other glaring omission. Why him? He was a good guy, sure. But like the other example of someone taking over a young man's body, the character of the person being invaded made no difference. It was never defined (nor attempted) why Chris was ""special."" And if it did, why would anyone choose to take over the body of a smoker?<br/><br/>Additionally, the mechanics of Rose having all these relationships would call for her to have contact with men that lived a safe distance from each other to avoid detection. Thus, more reason to just kidnap.<br/><br/>The element of social media would greatly increase leaving evidence behind in the form of photos of the men with Rose.<br/><br/>I finally realized that the day party to observe Chris was an auction for his body. Not like it could have been more vague. But even still the whole procedure was about transferring conscious and nothing about the character of the victim. Even the desire to have Chris' ""eyes"" made no sense as his eyes would not have given the recipient any creative advantage. Just rhetoric that sounded good.<br/><br/>It was about youth and vitality, which played into the fears of the perspective black audience, but I didn't buy that old whites would want to be transferred into such (without explanation that a film did not have latitude for). There were too many societal and personal blocks to white people consistently wanting to take over the bodies of blacks.<br/><br/>Grandma's and grampa's ""act"" was vastly played up as a cheap device to create suspicion and likely bore no relevance to the characters displayed in the ""holding cell"" video. The one instance we saw grampa in the video in the end was no explanation of their erratic behavior. Quite the opposite.<br/><br/>Chris' cell phone cut out when talking with his best friend. Was suggested that it was just the battery, but nothing suggested the battery was low.<br/><br/>And the elements of the finale were just plain dumb:<br/><br/>So Chris' attention is unavoidably directed toward a small closet with the door open. He HAD TO LOOK INSIDE! (Suggesting that it was left there to be found.) In it, there is a red box with all the photos of the other black men that Rose had lured to their demise. Looked great but...why was it there other than to quickly clarify a story element? None. Absolutely none.<br/><br/>I don't think you could hook up video to such an old television in the ""holding cell.""<br/><br/>The cotton in the ears was clever but why did he remove such other than to clarify the cotton was there? That's to say they didn't have continual video surveillance (although with the intercom that was stated), being that they started the videos when Chris woke up.<br/><br/>The operating room was the most unsanitary one in recent film memory. A box full of medical knives in a red felt-lined box looks good, but hardly realistic.<br/><br/>What was the procedure? Was there a device in the white patient's head that collected the conscious, which then was transferred into the black person's brain? Very vague and never defined. Not even cursory.<br/><br/>Seems very premature for Chris to kill the father other than the opportunity of violence.<br/><br/>Despite the many deleted scenes on the DVD extras, they never explained how the best friend found Chris. But probably something very simple related to his cell phone that the ""bad guys"" didn't think about.<br/><br/>And what was made of Chris' smoking? Zero. Zilch.<br/><br/>But in the end, they did extremely well vs. the budget, which negates anything I have to say. But for me it failed creatively and analytically in the execution."

","This movie kept you going with intrigue as to what was up exactly -- clearly something beyond merely a black boyfriend visiting white family. The main actor was very good, and it is unfortunate he's found himself in this movie that then resolves its mystery by turning into a cheap, error-filled slasher-type film. Errors such as -- when Chris (star) dispenses with attacking brother by smashing his skull so that brother immediately bleeds out profusely from the head on the floor, guess what? Brother soon after -- surprise! -- attacks him again, with no sign of blood or injury. Cheap. The whole operating room scene really made little to no sense, just added some creepiness (father didn't even stay sterile) and the whole film degenerated so entirely into a feeble, predictable horror attempt that I had to force myself to finish the last third because it was all so predictable and gruesome and boring.

I, personally, did not find any of these qualities to the extent that others are praising it for.<br/><br/>As written in the title, it's a well made movie with quality acting and natural dialog which sets it apart from the rest of the cliché-ridden horror movies, but the plot, to me, held very little to no surprises.<br/><br/>As soon as I saw the black servants of the house acting weird and then learning that the mother can hypnotize people with such ease, the dots were connected and it became obvious that they have done something to them and are also planning to do something to Chris too.<br/><br/>One of the main elements of the plot, the fact that the family was stealing black people's bodies and transplanting their brains, although not obvious from the get go, had almost no impact, simply because it was already apparent that the family were involved in some kind of wrongdoing. It could've been about black magic, or organ harvesting, etc. and it would've still ended up pretty much the same with the same effect.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, I actually expected a plot twist of some kind, perhaps Chris imagining all this, or at least imagining his escape, or even more radical, revealing that the black servants were actually the villains and controlling the family, but none came.<br/><br/>Good movie but just above average. Worth a watch."

","Personally i think the whole racial think did not have a reason to be in this movie cause for me it seems by trying giving the we are all the same people actually focuses on the differences of the racial culture... In general ""Skeleton key"" did better the same general plot but it was an OK movie for me with great imagery all in all I am glad I saw it"
"reginagazr","7","0","2","20 June 2017"," Good, but overrated
","I watched ""Get Out"" with extremely high expectations. I really wanted to love this movie, unfortunately it did not happen. Maybe it was the average cinematography, or the sometimes enjoyable, sometimes over the top sidekick, maybe it was the Microsoft participation that looked like sponsorship, maybe I should've stayed after the credits. <br/><br/>Although I liked the speech it portrays throughout the film and is, in general terms, and original premise, I do feel like the film relies too much on the music to create the tension and set the tone, and that's a major inconvenient, at least for my personal taste. <br/><br/>Get out is a good film, but does exhibit some flaws i was not warned about by the critics."
"Wizard-8","Null","0","2","3 June 2017"," Not bad, though a bit overrated
","With so many critics giving this movie great reviews, I knew I had to eventually give it a look for myself. Though after watching it, I am not sure why it got as much fuss as it did. Don't get me wrong, I am glad I watched it, since it does have some genuine merit. Writer and director Jordan Peele does manage to capture the feeling of racial tensions in America quite well; while people may appear to be accepting, there is often still some uneasiness. He also gets good performances out of the no-name cast and makes the movie look good despite a pittance of a budget. As for horror scares and tension, there are also some effective stabs in this area. However, you'll have to wait a long time for the central character to really find himself in trouble. At 104 minutes in length, the movie is somewhat too long and stretched out. While the movie never gets to be boring, there's a significant amount of footage that could have been eliminated, which would have speeded up the pace significantly. Yes, watch the movie, but wait until you are in a more patient mood."
"schrifthsteller","6","0","2","2 June 2017"," Dirty topic meets clean filmmaking
","GET OUT manages to create a clean story line which works on at least three layers at the same time: The manifest, the obvious layer on the surface allowing you to get the what the ""-effect just before the final act when the latent layer, the what-they-were-really-thinking-layer, gets revealed. And I think it's quite clear that their is a third, thematic layer, dealing with how deep racism sticks within the - what? soul? cultural memory? genetic code? - of these people. And it works as a cinematic experience: it's shocking, it's funny, it's ugly, there is suspense, there are well composed, symbolic pictures, clean again, with no grain and with a well figured out, mostly warm color concept. Still I wasn't very exited when I left the theater and I don't know really why. Was it the acting? No, especially Daniel Kaluuya did an impressing job. The lack of originality? No, there are references to other movies, of course, images one to one resembling the bubble with the Tree of life in space in THE FOUNTAIN, only here it sinks down, while there it's raising, but the idea to show racism as horror within the codes of the genre is actually quite unique and quite brilliant. Is it because it all nevertheless feels too constructed to touch my feelings? Yeah, I think that might be the point. The topic is dirty, but the filmmaking is just way too clean."

","Get Out is at its best when it is busy tightening the screws around its audience, who are shifting uncomfortably around in their seats as black protagonist Chris Washington is assaulted by a barrage of micro-aggressions from his girlfriend's family. She's Allison Williams as the courageous Rose Armitage, treading through racial boundaries and taboos to find love. She also constantly finds herself apologising for the way in her parents and sibling welcome Chris into the family, fetishising his race and proudly brandishing their token Armitage minority like a shiny black trophy. Rose isn't just looking past skin colour, but actively calling out these incidents on behalf of her boyfriend, defending his man while flashing a smile so dazzling she must have stepped straight out of a Colgate commercial. A little too perfect. <br/><br/>Scarier than the expected spikes in the soundtrack and the blank smiles of the black servants are the trenches that Chris must navigate in his introduction to the Armitage estate. Peele closely tiptoes the line between satire and reality here, accompanied by the sheer ease in which Daniel Kaluuya slips into a role that he seems to have lived his entire lifetime; expected sighs, a narrowing of the eyes at every other inappropriate comment, a shake of the head after the moment is briefly disarmed. This constant unease and discomfort is more alarming than the film's clichéd 'gotcha' horror scares, especially coming from the well-worn performances of Whitford and Keener, who do a better job of hiding their sinister intentions than the help, and a ratty brother who looks Chris up and down like a specimen in a lab. Even when these are obviously signposted (""I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could"") they retain their sharpness like a gut punch; it's racial prejudice rebranded as simpering patronisation. <br/><br/>The villains of the film aren't right-wing Nazis or hardcore racists, but white liberals who think themselves gracious by welcoming minorities into their household, patting them on the back and calling them ""my man"" once too many times. Peele is taking aim at a uniquely intriguing clique here, painting a sleek, pristine portrait of a dreamy, post-racial America that is conveniently situated within an upper-class mansion, tucked away in some quiet, idyllic forest. His intentions are fascinating and sobering all at once, but the overall message is wrapped up in a rather clumsy, obvious metaphor that uses tired horror conventions to ramp up anxiety levels. Peele came from skit comedy, and it shows; the film's premise could be one of his older five minute sketches, of white liberals so obsessed with overcompensating for the past that they are literally snatching up the bodies of these fine black specimens and immortalising themselves within them. They worship their newfound vessel, parade his physical talents for all to see, slap the cigarette out of his hands, and arrive in an ominous procession to bid for the rights to claim him. <br/><br/>While Peele establishes a valid target in the first half of the movie, the second veers into a sort of cheap, exploitation territory where we are actively cheering for each posh cult member Chris offs in his bid for freedom. It grafts deeper dichotomies through scenes such as where the white-robed Rose sips milk and googles (sorry, bings) top NCCA prospects with a blank stare, or through the character of Rod, the polar opposite of the genteel black boyfriend in Chris, a loudmouth caricature of a ghetto TSA agent who does the digging into the Armitage conspiracy (he's no longer the target of 'random' spot checks, but rather on the other side of them, exposing lies). These characterisations are low-hanging fruit disguised as complex attitudes, and although we applaud as Rod steps out of the car to save the day, what do we really learn from this? That his concerns were correct all along, and that black men should stay away from dating white women altogether? There's more alarming authenticity packed into that split second of dread that Chris and the entire audience register as the sirens roll up to the scene of a black man strangling a white woman than there is in the rest of the film. To actually have a cop (or, if he was really subtle about it, the same cop from the deer encounter) emerge from the car and clasp Chris in handcuffs would be bludgeoning the point in, yet prove a whole lot more. But Rod takes us back to square one. His fears have been validated."

","This movie was bizarre, freaky, weird, twisted, insane. The first hour was great but after that it went downhill and left you puzzled and dumbstruck - thinking what on earth is going on? The acting and filming was good. The music was weird. Is it a Horror, Thriller and/or Comedy? The adjectives in the first line are suiting."
"cjbad-48614","5","0","4","6 May 2017"," A horror theme to tie it all together
","It was well done, well shot, had all the elements of a slightly entertaining formatted Hollywood movie. There was some suspense. I guess there were some quasi ethnic themes and the horror bit was necessary to tie it all together. Acting was good. <br/><br/>Mainly I'm using IMDb to keep track of my own thoughts so that in my declining prime I forget a few past movies nights and accidentally rewatch some uninspiring movies. Wouldn't watch this a second time although had an entertained 90 minutes in the theatre. They all laughed at the wrong bits, I think a lot of people thought it was a comedy because of Peele the director."
"Prismark10","5","0","4","23 April 2017"," Do The Rock Steady
","Get Out is a satirical horror film. In some ways it reminded me of the remake of The Stepford Wives.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris Washington who is on a weekend visit to the parents of his white girlfriend Rose. (Allison Williams). Her father is a neurosurgeon and her mother is a hypnotherapist.<br/><br/>The family come across as an inclusive affluent liberal family who welcome this young black man. Chris however feels perturbed, even suspicious especially as he believes he has been hypnotised by Rose's mother.<br/><br/>At a family garden party Chris finds that their friends and neighbours although welcoming also take an unusual interest in him. Something is not right and even Rose might be complicit to whatever is going on.<br/><br/>The film directed by Jordan Peele is actually very slow to get going but does leave you intrigued as to how it will all turn out, even hinting that what is going on might all be in Chris's mind. British actor Daniel Kaluuya has a wide eyed look of a lamb being led to slaughter. Comic relief is provided by his best buddy Rod, a TSA agent who finds incidents of young black men who have disappeared and forms a bizarre theory.<br/><br/>Like a lot of horror films, much of it in retrospect does not make too much sense."
"michos-48660","7","0","5","28 March 2017"," A skeptical view of GET OUT
","The second I walked out of the theater, i was certain of one thing. Get out is a very modern and unusual Horror movie which worths its ticket. With a great,dark atmosphere and some really interesting and thrilling interpretation. HOWEVER. I firmly see a great disadvantage that prevents our movie from being truly remarkable, and that is the final outcome.Although the movie build a GREAT stressing-in a good way- and thrilling atmosphere blessed with nice comic relieves, as the movie goes on and the excpectations rise, the fall from grace is dramatic, as the stress transform to laughter at certain moments and makes the final scenes look rather funny than thrilling. However, i recommend the film and acknowledge that it plays with the viewer's psychology in an interesting way,despite the mediocre end and purpose.Furthermore that is the opinion of a person who looks twice as he returns home due to some scenes....."
"LanceStudsteele","Null","0","5","25 March 2017"," What, no chainsaw?
","In a thriller that was inspired by horror movies that Jordan Peele has viewed over the course of his lifetime, there are a number of classic/cliché horror genre references - by design (Jordan Peele stated as much in interviews). One such allusion is the man with the ax - which he uses to split firewood. I thought it would've been an interesting scene for the same groundskeeper to come up unseen behind the protagonist, Chris, as he is walking silently through the woods; turn on the chainsaw, thereby startling Chris and the audience; then casually mention, as he cuts a dead tree into pieces that he will later ""process"" by splitting it into firewood, something like, ""With a little effort and know-how, this decrepit old thing can be repurposed and made useful""."
