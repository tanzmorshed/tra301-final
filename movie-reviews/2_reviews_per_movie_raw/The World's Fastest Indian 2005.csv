","Anthony Hopkins is simply astounding. The man can disappear inside of characters so diverse and capture you so completely, that you have to wonder if his well of talent has a bottom.<br/><br/>This film is at turns charming, bawdy, fascinating, riveting, nerve wracking, hilarious, heartwarming and heartbreaking. As Burt Munro -- an aging New Zealand man losing his hearing, short on money, living in a shed surrounded by weeds, considered a lovable if eccentric oddball by all who know him except one small boy, and obsessed with making a 45 year old motorcycle capable of breaking the land speed record on the Bonneville Salt Flats -- Hopkins takes us along for the ride every minute of this movie. The fact that this film is based on the true story of Burt Munro makes it all the more captivating, but a lesser actor than Hopkins might very well have lost us along the way. It is no wonder that the children of the real-life Burt Munro were moved to tears by Hopkins' portrayal.<br/><br/>There's a clever ongoing bit about the taste of Burt's hot tea, and you will also wonder a bit about how his lemonade might taste. Every scene is a jewel in this movie, and the cumulative effect proves that extraordinary films do not have to cost bazillions of dollars and take two years of computer-generated special effects to WOW their audience.<br/><br/>Burt is challenged by every imaginable obstacle standing between him and his speed dream: his failing heart may give out any minute, the journey around the world to transport the 1920 Indian motorcycle to the USA seems insurmountable, he has no machine shop or whiz-bang tools and equipment to work his engineering miracles, etc. What he DOES have is an indomitable spirit that will never, ever stop trying. Whether he's battling young ruffians who diss his ancient motorcycle or banking, bureaucrats and red tape, he is a wrinkled but worthy warrior.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is as beautiful and bizarre as it gets, and the audience becomes inordinately fond and just about every one of them except for a nasty foreign cabdriver (Carlos Lacamara), but hey, somebody had to be disliked. Great actors in small roles abound, including Diane Ladd as Ada, a frontier gal that's been lonely a while, Saginaw Grant as Jake, an ""Indian"" with a really distasteful solution to Burt's prostate problems, and Paul Rodriguez as Fernando, a human and humane used car salesman. Perhaps the best scene -- and heart -- stealer is Chris Williams as Tina, a cross-dressing front desk night clerk at a fleabag hooker hotel. You gotta love him. Or her, as the case may be. Stellar performance, and Hopkins' Burt treats Tina with such dignity it defines friendship.<br/><br/>Don't miss this fine, fine film. And if there is justice in the boffo box office world, The World's Fastest Indian will be a true Oscar contender in 2006."

","It's a good thing I took my wife, because as all men know the only way not to cry is to look over at your wife/girlfriend and make fun of them for crying.<br/><br/>Seriously, I am a motorcycle aficionado but I truly think this movie transcends that. It's not a ""guy's film"" at all but a serious look at the life of a man that was average by his own reckoning - by ours he's a hero. When you find yourself looking at that and saying ""I would have quit"" and it was only the beginning of the movie, well, that's some tough stock Burt Munro came from.<br/><br/>And it's not tedious, not an uphill struggle all the way against insurmountable odds, none of those clichés. It's a great movie about a real guy and I can't imagine someone watching it and not being entertained, moved, and frankly, impressed."
"DaRitz","10","130","140","25 January 2006"," A non-mushy feel-good movie
","Seeing the movie ""The World's Fastest Indian"" reminded me why I go see movies. I average about one every two weeks, and this was one of those rare movies that actually made me feel *happy* afterward.<br/><br/>The main character, New Zealander Bill Munroe as played by Anthony Hopkins, is a true man's man. He has spent his entire adult life tinkering with his streamlined motorcycle, a 1920 Indian (hence the title.) Now in his 60's in the year 1963, he wants to realize his life's dream of taking it halfway around the world to the Bonneville Salt Flats Test Track in Utah, the only place where he can find out how fast it will actually go.<br/><br/>The movie pulls off two often-used themes, The Long Journey and Overcoming Adversity, without a hint of phoniness or melodrama. The Long Journey from New Zealand to Utah takes up most of the movie, with Munroe scrounging up travel money, working off part of his passage on a dilapidated freighter, and the long, event-filled drive from the California coast to Utah in an old used car. Overcoming Adversity is portrayed in two ways: by Munroe's awesome mechanical genius as shown by his ability to fashion spare parts out of almost anything and to improvise a la MacGyver, and in his charm and likability when confronted with more human obstacles. Indeed, one of the movie's chief strengths was the character's ability to make friends easily under any situation, with a cast of colorful supporting characters who wonderfully complemented Hopkins' acting.<br/><br/>After finally reaching the test track, the movie's focus shifts from the acting to the cinematography and drama. The dozens of colorful cars, motorcycles, and drivers' outfits contrast strikingly with the blinding white of the salt flats and the mountainous backdrop. And when Munroe finally gets the chance to make his test run, two questions come to mind. How fast can he go? More importantly, will the 64-year-old man and the 43-year-old patched-up bike hold together under the strain?<br/><br/>After seeing the movie and while still in my euphoric state, my skeptical mind wondered how much of it was actually true. I did a little research, and the portrayal of this amazing man seems to be true enough. Go see this movie; if you do, you'll leave the theater feeling good, and perhaps even a little inspired."

","I was lucky enough to see this film on a Qantas flight from LA to Melbourne early in December. My expectation was a low budget, low brow, attempt at making a motorsport film. I was truly blown away by what I saw. Anthony Hopkins deserves an Academy Award for the understated performance of Bert Munro. Always polite, and always focused Bert's dream get embedded in your heart and becomes your dream as well. The journey becomes the story with the characters he meets along the way getting obsessed with his vision as well. The scenes at The Bonneville Salt Flats are stunning and picturesque. I was left with a smile I couldn't get off my face and a tear in my eye. A simple film with a simple premise becomes my ""Best Of"" pick for 2005."
"cmaryon","8","199","219","24 October 2005"," Surprising gem
","I saw this film on a plane - I know, I know, the worst place to see any kind of film - and thought I would just fall asleep as I didn't expect it to catch my interest enough to put up with the bad audio and small screens. In any case I dislike feel-good movies, and all the Kiwi-innovator stuff makes me cringe, Kiwis don't have the monopoly on being resourceful. And I'd never heard of Burt Munro. So I was surprised to find within a few minutes I was entranced.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins has made a brilliant job of the role, his accent wasn't too bad, and I loved the way he said ""Invercarrrrrrgill"". Hopkins' talent really shone - without him saying a word or changing his expression, you just knew how Burt felt when confronted by an apparently insurmountable obstacle (I won't spoil it) and his placid acceptance of the inevitable falls, tumbles and injuries told you that for Burt these were a fact of life. The other cast were also flawless, for me there wasn't a weak point in any of the acting. The humour was delivered in the main by Hopkins and with the lightest possible touch. The cinematography was beautiful and conveyed the journey from long quiet light of Munro's idealism in Invercargill, murky 'orribleness of the necessary evil of passing through LA and laying your dream on the line in the harsh open glare of Utah.<br/><br/>Hopkins has done a few of these slightly-disreputable, love-em-when-you-get-to-know-em characters but this is the best. And I'm not a motorcycle fan, and no Kiwi-made-good fan, but I will confess to a tear (almost) at the end when the text came up about Burt's unbeaten record.<br/><br/>If you watch this film at home you won't want to be disturbed by other people talking - you'll want to catch every word, every nuance."
"clarkesta","10","110","121","3 January 2006"," A beautifully simple tale with great vibes and no villains.
","All I knew about this movie going in was that it was the life story of an Ivan Mauger-type motorcyclist whom I'd never heard of; that he was a Southlander; and that Anthony Hopkins was playing the chap - complete with a rolled rrrr's Southland accent. I came away with a feeling similar to when I first saw ""Tucker the man & his dream"" and ""Cool runnings"" - A genuine feeling of euphoria that someone whom I ordinarily would have little particular interest in, has accomplished a dream. Roger Donaldson has created a rare cinematic masterpiece with ""The world's fastest Indian"" - he has crafted a feel-good movie which achieves a ""Field of dreams"" emotional level with a climax which is deliberately low-key and in keeping with the subject matter. Despite the fact that Burt Munro's efforts set an as-yet unbeaten world record, he was a humble bloke who just went back to his shed at the end of the day to tinker. I loved this movie because it tells a straight-forward tale of someone so fixed on his dream that anyone he comes into contact with simply can't help but do what they can to help him. There are no villains in this movie - except bad luck and circumstance. And the way Munro overcomes adversity is incredibly charming, and an inspiration to anyone. Sir Anthony Hopkins is incredible, as usual. There aren't many actors who could pull off the Antipodean twang and the Southland R-rolling to boot! But Hopkins carries it off almost impeccably. The shimmering cinematography on the Bonneville salt flats is another highlight of this masterpiece, and I think I'm going to have to see it again before it winds up its run at my local cinema to fully appreciate it! (The first time I was too caught up in the agony of Burt's struggle!) This truly is a great flick. Probably not an Oscar winner, but for me, ""World's fastest Indian"" belongs alongside the aforementioned ""Tucker,"" etc. There's probably not much point in releasing it in the United States - it's not their kind of feel-good movie. But I sure hope Donaldson takes it to Cannes...the Europeans should like it as much as ""Whale rider."""
"notallowedtohug","10","171","191","18 November 2005"," Blatantly Kiwi, surprisingly Universal
","'The World's Fastest Indian' is a unique movie that not only provides a film that New Zealanders anywhere can be most proud of, while at the same time contemplating universal themes that everyone outside the borders of the country can relate to.<br/><br/>The film contains that familiar 'Number 8 fencing wire' mentality that resonates throughout New Zealand society - and also echoes those tropes of masculinity that are so prominent within the National cinema: Burt tinkers with his 1920 Indian Motorcycle with the most unexpected results, using common household objects; he travels to the Bonneville Saltflats in Utah alone, getting by on his wit; and has that dry sense of humour that is familiar around these parts. It also contains the familiar 'man Alone' motif, but in a foreign country, and also touches on that other image of New Zealand men tinkering in their sheds. The film is, what I would call, blatantly Kiwi.<br/><br/>Wider themes that surface are of isolation, alienation, and beating the odds to achieve your dream. What I can definitely say about 'The World's Fastest Indian', is that it's very refreshing - this is no typical underdog story; it's a story that proves that you're never too old to follow through with a dream you've had for years. It was great to have a protagonist that was older than the usual one in contemporary movies, and seemed to give the film more of an anchoring in reality. It makes it far more easier to believe in the story and it's motivations, and heightens the sense of isolation one sometimes goes through when following your heart.<br/><br/>Sir Anthony Hopkins does an amazing job as Burt Munro - the New Zealand accent is impeccable, aside from one or two vowel sounds. His subtleties communicate an intense psychological battle and determination to get the chance to achieve his dream, and his typical sense of humour is wonderful. I'm not sure how accurate this portrayal of Burt Munro is, but the screen character is engaging and pulls the audience in for a solid 2 hours as we watch Burt battle with his demons, and the lack of people's belief in his achieving his goal.<br/><br/>All in all, 'The World's Fastest Indian' is a fantastic film that New Zealanders can be proud of, soaked with Kiwi humour and a character that will remind a lot of us of our grandfathers and that older generation that never complained and got on with life, no matter what they were up against. For international audiences, it's a wonderful underdog story about an older man who had never given up on getting his chance to achieve his dream.<br/><br/>'The World's Fastest Indian' is a fantastic film, and will inspire anyone who gets the chance to see it. Roger Donaldson continues his fine tradition of great movies, and all Kiwis should hold him up to the same heights as they do that other Jackson fulla!"
"johnkeedwell","9","165","186","3 January 2006"," Kiwi Bert and his motorsiccle
","I took a look at this film with a slightly wary eye, the title being rather ambiguous and misleading initially. I almost passed it by to watch one of the many screener DVD's I had to view. for possible inclusion in the BAFTA awards. I presumed it was about a runner or maybe an Indian astronaut, possibly. I had no idea initially the ""Indian"" referred to a great American motorcycle,rather than a particular type of human.I am so glad I wasn't thrown by the title, and started watching. There unfolded a most delightful story about Bert, an instantly rather charming eccentric old character (superbly played by Anthony Hopkins), who built an old 1920's motorcycle in his garden shed. He then attempts to break the world-land speed record on a machine designed to originally travel about 90mph. The plot develops into a most charming and beautiful story of Bert's determination to get to the race event and the journey is as much of the story as the event itself. Obviously I shall not divulge the result or the events that happen, suffice it to say that Bert becomes an instantly likable character by everyone he meets. Bert's charm shines through and he takes everyone he meets at face value and welcomes all with a smile and a shake of the hand. He meets various ""characters"" along the way who he befriends like long-lost friends,which is a fresh in these days of prejudice and alienation. This was a very innocent time in 1967 for a New Zealander going to America, and there is one of the films most delightful and charming moments when Bert realises all is not quite what it seems when he meets one certain character......... MAKE SURE YOU SEE THIS FILM, it will have you laughing, crying and will uplift you, which is quite uncommon in these days in the movies of blood, killing, violence and savagery. I would be very surprised if Anthony is not at least nominated for his starring role as Bert. Lovely film which needs a different title to me, but then again ""it does what it says on the tin"", as they say. Go and see it. Great"

","A true story with a nice mix of emotion and motorcycles.<br/><br/>At a sneak preview of this movie in Burt Munro 's hometown - Invercargill, I noticed at the end that many of the men had moist eyes -not that the film is weepy or sycophantic in any way - it's simply inspirational. <br/><br/>The hero/underdog here is a social misfit, a self-confessed dirty old man but a lovable one. He loves the ladies and he loves speeding on his vintage Indian Scout ""modified somewhat"" along the open beach of Invercargill in Southern New Zealand. Beach bike racers still contest the Burt Munro Trophy on Oreti beach.<br/><br/>Burt's 1967 record at Bonneville still stands. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins manages the problematic Kiwi accent well to deliver a touching, funny and realistic depiction of Burt in his quest to be the fastest thing on two wheels. Sir Anthony said that it's the best thing he's ever done and it's hard to disagree based on his laconic and lovable portrayal.<br/><br/>Outstanding cameos by the likes of Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd simply add depth and verisimilitude to the film. Tim Shadbolt, well he definitely acted in the film...<br/><br/>Complete and convincing performances that warm the heart and show true humanity shining through. <br/><br/>The cinematography is clear and precise, the action scenes are mercifully free of special effects and Burt's kiwi innovation and guile win the day. <br/><br/>A new classic from Roger Donaldson."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Roger Donaldson has been very prolific in his Hollywood career creating mostly slick, ho-hum projects such as ""The Recruit"", ""Thirteen Days"", ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Cocktail"". Although there is a touch of sap in this one, Donaldson turns on the charm for the fascinating tale of Burt Munro, the New Zealander who shocked the world with his speed records in the 1960's.<br/><br/>Playing a bit like a motorized ""Hidalgo"", the film captures your heart and imagination thanks in large part to the amazing journey of this spirited man and the terrific performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins. Making his way half way around the world with almost no money to his name, Munro realizes a life long dream of running his hand-built 1920 Indian ""motor-sickle"" at the Salt Flats of Bonneville in Utah. his journey and openness introduce him to so many people along the way. His warm heart and courage just will these folks to help him out. Everyone wants ol' Burt to make it.<br/><br/>While you may think to yourself this is just a light-hearted Hollywood feel-good film, just remember the man and the story are real. Donaldson and Hopkins worked together over 20 years ago in ""The Bounty"" and have another very interesting project under way now with ""Papa"" - a biopic on Ernest Hemingway. Three supporting performances really stand out: Diane Ladd, (comedian) Paul Rodriguez and Christopher Lawford (Peter's son) as Jim Moffit. Donaldson, in a nice touch, also spreads in a few appearances of the guys from the high speed world.<br/><br/>This is one you can take the family to and almost everyone will enjoy the story, journey and spirit of Burt Munro. And believe me when I say, you will never look at Lemon trees the same again!!"

","I am not a frequent movie goer, but when I saw the previews on TV I decided to go to the movie because there was a clip showing the Bonneville Salt Flats. I have spent a lot of time there as my recently deceased brother and my son both hold records on the flats. I went with absolutely no expectations other than to see the flats. I knew nothing about the movie. It was an incredible experience for me. The cinematography and the acting was excellent, but it is the content that makes the movie. Because of my association with the racers and their love of speed, I know how real this movie portrayed what they do and why they race. The racers and the officials were very real. This movie is absolutely RIGHT ON. It really hit home for me and was very emotional in places because it was so close to my heart. It is a must see and I have been telling all my friends. The message it leaves is very important and also helps me to deal with sons still pushing the edge. p.s. I read another comment saying this is no ""chic""film. I am a chic."
"leelacat","Null","13","13","15 April 2006"," World's Fastest Indian is a little gem!
","I must admit, on this particular day I was dragged to the cinema with no prior knowledge of the characters, plot and had no awareness of the historical basis upon which the film is based. After a minute or so, I realized my partner (a fairly new motorcycle rider himself, making me a motorcycle widow of course) had lured me into a film about motorbikes. I rolled my eyes at him, yawned and prepared for the worst ...<br/><br/>What I got instead was the best film I've seen for quite some time.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins totally blew me away. His accent was really very strong (it should be noted that the Invercargil accent is pretty distinct from the rest of the South Island of NZ) and he managed to maintain the audience's interest though some pretty dialogue-heavy scenes. All of the supporting characters did a brilliant job defining a diverse physical and emotional landscape for the protagonist. The cinematography was economical and meaningful and assisted the humorous moments beautifully. The story unfolded very nicely and - thanks to some great editing - the small moments of tension were plentiful and kept the story moving along nicely.<br/><br/>With all the cynicism and politics in contemporary cinema, it is so refreshing to see a film that is very pure, that speaks volumes about kindness and passion and friendship without saying anything at all. This film didn't try to make any big statements, there were no lengthy diatribes about 'acceptance' and 'tolerance', and I loved that.<br/><br/>I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face. I'm so glad I was dragged along for the ride."

","A friend and I went to see this movie with some trepidation as neither of us wanted to see some boy-toy rubbish about piston rods. But the IMDb reviews were so good that we decided to take a chance. We were both so glad we did! Not only is this movie entertaining from start to finish, but it features one of Anthony Hopkins greatest ever performances (which is saying something) and was laugh-out-loud funny to boot! Hopkins depiction of Munro was immaculate. the movie left me wishing I'd known the man, and Hopkins perfectly captures the unpretentious, friendly character of many New Zealanders which made Munro an innocent abroad when he took his bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats. I wondered how Roger Donaldson was going to make this movie interesting, but it's really gripping throughout. Munro's character has a lot to do with it, but it's also more of a road movie than a film about motorcycling. Munro's journey from his garden shed to the record books is a delight and an inspiration. There are some terrifically funny lines in this film which emerge simply from Munro's down- to-earth character. The audience we saw it with was really amused. We didn't expect it to be so funny. As usual, the only downside is that this film doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. If I hadn't seen the IMDb reviews and just returned from a trip to NZ myself, I would have missed the best movie of the year so far. All involved with the making of this film deserve the highest praise."

","Truly hidden treasure. Movie was playing at an obscure art theater in Pittsburgh, a friend saw it and told me about it since he knew I like bikes and have just recently returned from a very eventful bike trip in Nevada following a dream in the desert. Just like Burt. On a motorcycle. There is something absolutely magic about motorcycles, the desert, helpful strangers and nasty cops, last minute solutions and dreams. Most of all dreams. The kind that inspire anyone that crosses the dreamer's path. <br/><br/>Well, the movie is not accurate in every detail but it's such an inspirational story I would recommend it to anyone that likes the classic underdog scenario. And this one is set in the Salt Flats desert! With Anthony Hopkins! And motorcycles! Great set, great story, great acting, great everything! I am SO surprised this movie is so unknown!"

","I'm a geezer now, as was Bert Munro during the period this film depicts, but when he was setting the records at Bonneville, I was a very young, and very broke, motorcycle racer. I even had the honor of meeting Bert briefly when he was in California.<br/><br/>But that's not what this review is about. It's about the absolutely amazing attention to detail in the film. Munro's bike, the shop, the tools, the cobbled-together machinery, the low-tech transportation, ... all dead on the money in authenticity. The entire film is like a string of old racing photographs, come to life.<br/><br/>Anyone interested in what really went on back then, before full-ride sponsorships and corporate super-events became the norm, should see this film. Even the audio is authentic. When Mickey Thompson's 4-engined, 32-cylinder ""Challenger"" rolls off on a land speed run, that's the actual sound of the original runs you hear in the background.<br/><br/>I have to admit that when a replica of Dr. Nathan Ostich's ""Flying Caduceus"" rolled by in one scene, I got a bit of a lump in my throat, remembering those who died in their attempts to ""be the fastest"". Despite the light-hearted goofiness shown in the film, never forget that these people were deadly serious about a seriously deadly sport. Land Speed Record racers were a special, if slightly odd, bunch. Even those of us who raced ""normal"" events were a bit in awe of the ""LSR people."" <br/><br/>As someone else mentioned, there are a few corny scenes early in the film that might make the purists wince a bit, but the payoff is worth it. Anyone who lived through those times will instantly recognize the slightly over-bearing track officials, and the (fortunately) loose attitudes towards rules-bending.<br/><br/>All in all, this film perfectly captures a time and an attitude that we will never see again. Racing is definitely safer now, but we're only having one-tenth of the fun and satisfaction Munro experienced, way back when."

","I used to own a gas station in a small town in West Texas right where the Hill Country ends and the desert starts. On a bright Summer day a rider on an old BMW rolled up to my pumps. Being a motorcycle rider myself I walked out to greet him.<br/><br/>As I approached, and greeted him, he held up a gloved hand. He slowly stretched it out and flexed his fingers and then did this with his other hand and then slowly, with a little bit of difficulty pulled off his helmet. His head had a shock of snow white hair. He had a white beard and eyes that were a stunning shade of sky blue. His smile belied not only and easy friendship but an experienced wit. Looped around his head was a clear thin plastic hose that ran down into a small tank bag to an oxygen tank.<br/><br/>He told me he was 82 years old and had been riding motorcycles for 60 years. His old BMW had 200,000 miles on it and he had ridden it in 20 countries on 5 continents. He said he had been diagnosed with cancer and had outlived his doctor's prediction of his demise by two months so far. He had been on the motorcycle since the day of his doctor's prognosis and would continue until he died, which he admitted would not be long. There was not a single inkling of sadness in his eyes. Just merriment and passion. This old man was doing what he loved and was going to go out on his terms after living an amazing and enviable life.<br/><br/>I imagined, time and time again, what having such passion for something could be like. I love my bikes. I am passionate about my occasional days at the track, but it does not match what I saw in that old rider that day.<br/><br/>Then I saw Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Munro and it became so clear. I wonder if that old man ever watched ""The World's Fastest Indian."" If he had, it would have spoken directly to his soul as it did to mine.<br/><br/>This movie had such heart. A story about the triumph of the human spirit. Only ""Rocky"" comes to mind as a movie with such a soul. I recommend this picture to everyone I talk movies with."

","Wow, we just saw the film last night, what a wonderful depiction of a great life and a true character! Our local 'arthouse' theater was showing the film, only 2 nights (part of a film festival - sold out both shows). We expected the crowd to be full of kindred old-bike souls, but found ourselves surrounded by yuppie young'uns with no connection to motorcycling.<br/><br/>I was very interested to see how they would respond to the film. From the first line, they laughed, then thoroughly enjoyed it to the end - even applauding as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from the movie  since usually anything involving motorcycles on film just makes me grit my teeth in frustration at the sheer ignorance of the directors/producers.<br/><br/>This movie was completely opposite. Not only did it do a wonderful job at depicting the bikes and riders JUST RIGHT, it also did something wonderful  it made even the non-riders in the crowd feel (just a little bit) what it's like to ride a fast bike. The sheer joy of speed, with your body inches off the ground, and nothing protecting you but your own skill and the quality of the machine you've built.<br/><br/>Also, having toured the back roads from California/Oregon through Utah quite often, the landscape and regional town shots really made me want to get on my bike and run through there again  right now! Taking backroads, you can find those little cafes in tiny towns that time forgot  it's one of my favorite reasons to ride.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was perfect  played the part perfectly and was supported expertly by an exceptional cast of characters. Seeing some of the old legends of the sand (like The Redhead, and its owner) was just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I can't wait to see it again."

","What a great film. A real sleeper, one has to wonder why it didn't make more money? Actually that makes me like it even more, and I can't help feeling Roger Donaldson's underdog Bert Munro character tells us something of Donaldson's own journey through life.<br/><br/>Anyway on to the film.<br/><br/>There is more soul in this films two hours, than in the last two (maybe 10) years of Hollywood flicks. No one gets killed, no one gets shot or shot at, virtually every character is so memorable, and yet totally believable, not to mention so well played.<br/><br/>I'm wondering where all these great actors have been hiding. (more about this later)<br/><br/>Special effects are exactly what they need to be, not Hollywood overblown, just totally transparent. Anyone who has ever raced a machine right on the limit, or rather not knowing where the limit is, will be in awe of how they captured those moments in the film, that rush, blur, and vibration that seems part of you, to the extreme your very eyeballs vibrate in your own head, blurring even further.<br/><br/>More than one scene left me wondering just where the world has gone wrong today, and long for those days, when people were still people, and prepared to make an effort to help a total stranger, so obviously out of his element in a far off land. I haven't been to Utah, but I hope there are still people there today, like they were in the 60's<br/><br/>Another appealing asset, is a total lack of Hollywood marketing hype, and no need to suspend your disbelief.. (as they so love to say)<br/><br/>No, this is a REAL film, about a real guy. I can't help wonder, if the Hollywood marketing bods, missed the point totally, After all dealing with reality is not a strong point in marketing circles ;-)<br/><br/>Speaking of missing reality, that reminds me. MPAA, Rated PG-13 for brief language, drug use and a sexual reference. Who are you kidding? DRUG USE! Your all fired! I'm sorry but I don't believe even the bureaucrats at the DEA, have listed ""ground up dog's balls"", Or medically prescribed Nitroglycerine tablets, (used since the early 1900's to this very day) It's only just a little over ONE hundred years of history guys. I guess you don't get out much.<br/><br/>Well what else can you say about Sir Anthony? Sir Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, as I think most will agree, And this film proves that yet again, in a not at all typical role for him. His chameleon like skills put him right in time and place and character. I'm not quite convinced with his Southland accent, which is not quite flat enough IMHO, but all same, it's a good attempt, probably better than mine, (and I'm a Kiwi) Regardless, he captures that ""I can do that"" Kiwi attitude so well, and delivery is timed to perfection.<br/><br/>Christopher Lawford playing Jim Moffat is SUCH a standout too. From his first scene, the moment he climbs out of his car, you KNOW he's a speed freak. He has that laid back Southern California poise, tan and smile, with his 1000-mile stare. I was racking my memory to recall a 1960's racer of that name, before realising the character he plays is a composite of several real racers. Absolutely convincing!<br/><br/>Bruce Greenwood plays a more minor role, but nails it also. I loved the scene when he first meets Munro, and can't tell what to make of him, What a classic.<br/><br/>Speaking of classics, Chris Williams, Tina character is hilarious. Especially in the scenes where she tags along with Munro, and the reactions to the bizarre duo.<br/><br/>Finally Jessica Cauffiel. What a darling. A sweet 60's belle, with a heart and smile bigger than a mountain. She totally steals more than one scene from Sir Anthony.<br/><br/>It is a very rare film indeed that can appeal to men and women, boys and girls of all ages, after all everyone has their dreams and ambitions, and asks ""what if"", even though we so often forget them as we get older, being reminded of them by a film is no bad thing, and it bonds with you along the way. Yet it takes it's time, and tells the tale with a deliberate style, and finesse. Like this film Munro was a larger than life character, who REALLY did things in HIS time.<br/><br/>This is a feel-good film, about humanity, spirit, and passion for life, and living your dreams, whatever your age."

It touched me emotionally in a way i haven't been touched since i was a very young boy and saw rocky1 (young boys tend to love that movie). The characters are so funny and they all have a little weird side to them that is lovable, this amazing story with a fantastic end put a smile on my face for more then a day when i finished watching it, i couldn't believe it.I thought i never would see a film in my life again that would actually go straight into top 3 all time films ever without a doubt, i thought i had seen it all, boy was i wrong!.Anthony Hopkins character is impossible not to fall completely in love with right away, he is lovable, weird, funny, completely ignorant, totally stubborn, has a goal and a will to follow his dream.he fits the role of the weird kind man that lives down the street so perfectly and so realistic that it becomes completely obvious that this is a true story, its just too good not to be.For everyone: I recommend this movie with total conviction.I Challenge you to say you do not love this movie, i honestly can't see how anyone can not love this movie....It is in my opinion the best film ever made."
"Philby-3","8","7","7","14 April 2006"," A decent tribute
","Invercargill, New Zealand, is noted for being the country's southernmost city and for having the least hours of sunshine and the most number of rain days of any NZ large town. It is also famous for being the home town of a gritty old codger called Burt Munroe who set a number of world motor cycle speed records (one of which still stands) in the 1960s at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, riding a 1920 Indian Scout motor cycle.<br/><br/>Roger Donaldson, one of the midwives to the renaissance of the Kiwi film industry in the 1980s (""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Smash Palace"") and latterly Hollywood director (""Thirteen Days""), made ""Offerings to the God of Speed"" a documentary on Burt in 1972, when he was still alive. This dramatization of the same story  little man triumphs though sheer grit and determination  is a triumph for his star. Anthony Hopkins is good at quirky curmudgeons but here he manages to exude a little homespun charm as well. His Burt has the happy knack of getting people to help him rather than shaft him. Officialdom melts at his approach and he is even attractive to the ladies, as Burt would have put it. It's Tony Hopkin's film and he carries it off in fine style. I'm not sure about the accent which is more northern British than southern NZ but it hardly matters as the Americans in the film can scarcely understand it anyway.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were all adequate and Aaron Murphy as Tom the kid from next door was actually able to steal some scenes. I also noticed an old acquaintance in a minor role as Frank the bike club president - Tim Shadbolt, student radical of the late 60s and now mayor of Invercargill. Burt had no money but he did get community support at various times, so Invercargillians can take some pride in his achievements.<br/><br/>Which brings me to what I think is the hole in this account. The Indian motorcycle, which was a light machine used for dispatch and scout work in World War One, had a top speed, according to the makers, of 57 mph. It had a V-2 cylinder block design and a decent capacity of just under 1000cc. Burt was a backyard mechanic who constantly tinkered with it, even casting his own pistons, which blew with monotonous regularity. Somehow he got the thing to exceed 200mph. No doubt the streamlining helped, but he must have modified the original design radically. Donaldson presents this without any explanation. Maybe Burt wouldn't tell him, or maybe Donaldson thought too much tech stuff would put the punters off. It wouldn't have taken much to explain it.<br/><br/>As others have said, this is very much a ""feel-good"" movie and I think, as an ex-resident of NZ, evocative of some of the more admirable aspects of the NZ character  the optimism, the friendliness, the capacity for improvisation and the willingness to rise to a challenge, and even occasionally to take risks. Burt had a lot in common with those pioneer settlers from Scotland who arrived in Southland 100 years earlier and founded Invercargill, a place the Maori sensibly regarded as a trifle too chilly to actually live in (though they visited for the oysters and muttonbirds). But he also had some home-grown attributes as well. ."
"pedigrees-1","10","7","7","21 March 2006"," Tribute to grass roots genius.
","Anyone who has ever dedicated himself to anything has to love Burt Munro, his quest for speed and this movie. I read elsewhere that, in one 10 year stretch, Munro worked 16 hours a day with the afternoon off each Christmas. That will surely qualify as dedication. Anthony Hopkins portrayed the NZ aspect of the character brilliantly as I have been there and seen the frankness with which problems are dispatched. For example: ""Screw it!"" in response to the problem with asbestos protection. It is only fitting the 1000 cc land record has survived nearly 40 years. Congrats and gratitude to all involved for the existence of this movie. It is a marvelous story depicting how much can be achieved with ingenuity coupled with modest means. It is a must see!"

","It is refreshing to see what a film maker can do when he dispenses with car chases, gunfire, fiery explosions, and cartoon- like digital effects and returns to that one core value-- quality and talent. Anthony Hopkins scores a tour de force with his portrayal of Burt Munro; it is like watching a master at his craft. His looking through his old family photo album with the young boy ""...here's Ernie, there's my Mum....they're all gone now.."" is as moving a scene as the one in Honkeytonk Man where John McIntire talks to his grandson about what it was like in the Oklahoma Land Rush of his youth. Subtle, underplayed, but filled with deep emotion. This isn't a ""motorcycle movie""; it's simply a kind and gentle tale that inspires dreams. A thoroughly enjoyable film. As Burt says when he finally sets foot on the salt of Bonneville, ""...big things happen here...this is Holy ground, Mate!"""
"markpnz","10","7","7","6 February 2006"," Great Film! Highly recommended.
","We very much enjoyed this film, even though we had to watch it on a small screen in a relatively obscure theater. The true story of a New Zealand hero is a classic and deserved a great film. Here we have it. With minimal pretension and just the right combination of drama and laugh-out loud comedic relief, this film entertains on every level. One can't help but fall in love with the legend that is Burt Munro, and be inspired by his legacy of tenacity and endurance. Although the story is of a New Zealander in the 1960s, the journey Munro takes is universal. His determination to live his dream is a theme everyone can understand. I thoroughly recommend this film to all ages and walks of life - there's something in this film for everyone."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","14","16","8 August 2007"," The Story Of Burt Munro, An Amazing Man
","This was an interesting story of an older, poor guy traveling all the wayfrom New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah to try to set a world speed record on his motorcycle. With Anthony Hopkins playing that man, ""Burt Munro,"" you know it's not some hokey little B-film. It's also based on real-life character who did this back in 1969.<br/><br/>This film reminded me of ""The Straight Story,"" starring Richard Farnsworth. That dealt with an old man taking a long tractor ride across the state of Iowa to see his dying brother. It featured a bunch of nice characters he met along his journey. This is much the same as we witness Munro's encounters with a variety of people in the United States. Like ""The Straight Story,"" all the people are good people and help our man. That's nice to see.<br/><br/>Once he finally gets to the Salt Flats, however, his problems are far from over as he is unable to meet any of the minimum safety standards. It appears he made his trip for nothing, but, you'll see what happens if you view this movie.<br/><br/>New Zealanders say Hopkins did them proud, too, and they would know if he did a good job or not playing a man from their area of the world, whether he sounded and acted realistically. They say he did.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first 35 minutes of this story the most. Maybe because that's the most innocent part of the film and features a young boy who looks up to Burt and encourages him when few others are willing to do so. <br/><br/>It's when Munro reaches America where the ""nice, clean family film"" goes south a bit. He hooks up with transvestites, one-night stands, profanes here and there and the PC angle gets a little overplayed. However, despite making America look a little too weird, everything is done is a tasteful way and it still was a wonderful story. It has to be an inspiration for older folks who might think life's challenges are over once they hit a certain age. Not so, as Mr. Munro shows us in this inspiring, well-photographed film.<br/><br/>This certainly is quite an unknown movie for one which has such a famous actor in the starring role. It's well worth your time, though, to check out."
"raylb50","9","6","6","3 February 2008"," Great true-life story about a wonderful character.
","My daughter urged me to watch this film after she & her partner had seen it. Some few months later I did so. It was all she said it was. One of the loveliest films you will ever watch, it's based on the true-life story of New Zealander Bert Munro, who spends years rebuilding an Indian motorbike & takes it to Salt Lake Flats in Utah, in an effort to beat the land speed record. Bert's charming naivety & amiable, easy going manner captures the hearts of all he came across on his journey. The type of human being you would expect to meet in Utopia, Bert is a wonderful character. Anthony Hopkins is outstanding in this so feel-good film. It makes one take stock of how we view life & treat other people, makes you feel very humble to have known Bert, albeit on a film screen & only for 90 or so minutes. Wish that we were all like Bert, what a nicer place Earth would be."

","The World's Fastest Indian I had read about this movie about 4 months back when it was released in Amsterdam. I did not see that movie at that time. After that the movie was running in other cities in Holland, where I could not go to see it. So when I got to see this movie in the North West Airlines while traveling from Amsterdam to Sydney  I did not miss this opportunity.<br/><br/>At the prime age of 70 this multi talented actor, director, composer, writer, and producer does not stop amazing you with his talent. I am talking of Sir Anthony Hopkins. He plays the role of Burt Munro  a real life old character who took part in World War I, and is staying in eastern corner of a peaceful town in New Zealand. His passion in life is his old Indian motorcycle of 1920s that he is innovating to participate in the American speed racing. The year is 1967, and the story is about Munro's weird ways and eccentric character; his journey from New Zealand to USA and his charm with which he wins hearts of people to give him help and a way to stubbornly participate in the motor speeding event. The movie culminates in an unbelievable thrilling exciting finish.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins plays this memorable role with ease. The role is so alive that it inspires all of us even in the most painful moments of his old life. When we see him suffering from weak old legs, persisting heart ailments, and breathlessness and sagging body  Munro remains natural and at ease without bothering about such things  rather keeping his focus on the event.<br/><br/>There are many different characters who meet Munro along the way to reach the event location - who laugh and doubt at his dream. Each sub-plot of different characters is presented with exact length without making any portions of the film boring.<br/><br/>I liked the cinematography - some shots and photography are very well executed. Sadly Anthony Hopkins has not been nominated for any ""Best Actor"" category in any awards.<br/><br/>Just a few trivia - the director  Roger Donalson - made his debut as a director in a TV series for the same story in 1971, where he played Burt Munro's old character at his prime age of 26. It has been 37 years since then and 16 movies later the Roger at the old of 62 requests 70 years old Anthony Hopkins to make this character immortal on screen  and does he succeed? Yes he does.<br/><br/>Last note for our readers  the actual record set up by Burt Munro in 1967 of racing at more than 200 Kms per hour speed by a less than 1000 cc bike still remains unbroken till date after 30 years  and that too Burt Munro used 1920 bike model and he was 58 years old when he set that record.<br/><br/>Is not this absolutely amazing and inspiring? Thanks Roger Donalson for bringing back to life Burt Monro through Sir Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>(Star 7 out of 10)"
"conlaw","10","5","5","29 January 2006"," Hopkins gives a knockout performance!
","Forget Hannibal Lector. Anthony Hopkins playing Burt Munro becomes the character. He is crusty but lovable. Hopkins and the rest of the cast take us on a road trip spanning New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and the audience can experience the entire ride and the intriguing characters that we meet along the way.<br/><br/>This is a movie of one man's passion and his quest for immortality. Think of Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" but with lots of characters.<br/><br/>The writing is so good that there is not a dull minute in the film.

The dialog and interplay of the characters is rich and utterly believable. The fact that someone so unknown to the general public has such a rich story waiting to be told is such a great unexpected gift.

","I thought was a very good movie and I'll readily admit that a few scenes got me a bit misty eyed. Hopkins, as always, did an excellent job portraying the character of Burt Munro. The directing was great as well. If I had one complaint it would be that there was not enough automotive eye candy. I thought it could have been a just few minutes longer and they could have used the time to pan the camera down the length of that motorcycle at least once. This was a movie about a guy with a passion for motorcycles and the biggest share of their audience will be guys that share that same passion...and they want to see that motorcycle. They also could have given Burt/Hopkins some dialog where he explained some of the modifications that made a 45mph motorcycle go 200+mph. And a few close ups of those beautiful Brit bikes on the beach would have been nice. Plus the cars at Bonneville. About 15 more minutes would have made it an even better movie for me."

","I first saw the movie Worlds Fastest Indian in a small ski-resort community high in the Colorado mountains (Breckenridge) that is predominantly inhabited by 'tree-huggers' and self-proclaimed environmentalists. I would judge the community in general to be the furthest thing from motor sports enthusiasts that one could imagine. I viewed the movie in a small public theatre with about 100 seats. Surprisingly, it was filled to capacity. When the movie ended, the ENTIRE audience stood up and applauded! I am 72-years old and I can not remember seeing this happen with any other movie in my life!<br/><br/>I subsequently bought the DVD and show it to my friends, family and grandchildren often."
"magoo992","10","4","4","5 February 2006"," Great little movie.
","This isn't a movie in the Hollywood mold, so if you want frenetic action and state of the art special effects, forget it. Its a heart-warming true tale of one of those actual characters we sadly come across only occasionally in life these days.<br/><br/>One of the genre of New Zealand real life, quietly heroic movies we're getting to like, this tale of achievement against the odds nails the traditional kiwi 'can do' spirit of invention and the minimization out of existence of obstacles. It also portrays a delightful, almost quaint by today's standards, spirit of true sportsmanship among American speed racers.<br/><br/>Being a kiwi, I'm no doubt a little biased, but I don't think anyone with a heart could help but thoroughly enjoy this great little movie. Maybe its a predictable midlife reaction, but I left the theater after this movie a little more determined to pursue a dream or two of my own, however small they may be by comparison."
"howard.schumann","8","8","10","13 March 2006"," Excellent family entertainment
","I'm not usually drawn to ""feel-good"" entertainment, not because I like to feel bad but because so often these films are pedestrian, manipulative, and without charm. Anthony Hopkins' performance, however, as Burt Munro in Roger Donaldson's The World's Fastest Indian lifts the film to a different level and, though we may have seen movies in this genre many times before, the result is irresistible. For those who never heard of Burt Munro, he was the eccentric 68-year old New Zealand cyclist who set the land speed record at Bonneville Flats, Utah of 201 mph in 1967, a record that still stands today. The World's Fastest Indian is not only good family entertainment (perish the thought), but has a spiritual message about the power of intention to create support in our life.<br/><br/>Hopkins portrays Munro as a charming rogue whose greatest asset was his enthusiasm and determination. Munro dreamed about being able to compete in a race to determine the world's fastest motorcycle for twenty-five years and the film chronicles his unrelenting pursuit of that goal. Hopkins turns in one of his best performances in years, captivating us with his Kiwi accent and his sly laugh, the personification of the ordinary man fighting the system for overdo recognition. His instrument of choice was a modified 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle that he spent his years in Invercargill, New Zealand tinkering with and honing to perfection. The cycle had been scraped together with hinges from a kitchen door and a cork from a whiskey bottle and with the tread of its tires carefully sliced off with a knife it hardly looked like it could go around the block much less set a speed record.<br/><br/>When we first meet Burt, he is an old man who lives alone and regularly comes into conflict with his neighbors for racing his motorcycle engine in the early morning and totally neglecting the condition of his lawn. His best friend is the neighbor's little boy (Aaron Murphy), a captivating redhead, who is fascinated with the ancient machine and loves to talk with Burt about his plans for the big race. Suffering from money problems as well as heart and prostrate trouble, neither Munro nor the old Indian Scout bike seem to be in any shape for an arduous journey, let alone to race for a record. Thanks to the help of a local club and a friendly bank, however, he is able to raise enough to cover most of the trip but has to pay his passage over by working aboard ship as a cook and dishwasher.<br/><br/>Once in America, Burt meets some ""colorful"" characters and here the film sags a bit with some well-worn stereotypes. In Hollywood, he is assisted by a transvestite hotel clerk (Chris Williams), a Hispanic used car salesman (Paul Rodriguez), and, along the road, a soldier on leave from Vietnam, a native Indian who has the right cure for his prostate problem, and a widow (Diane Ladd) who has the right cure for his nighttime urges. Donaldson also depicts cops who graciously do not cite him for speeding on a vehicle without license plates. When Burt gets to Bonneville, he must use all the power of his strong intention even to qualify as he failed to pre-register and his cycle does not meet minimum technical standards. Another savior comes to his aid here as an American racer played by Chris Lawford, the lookalike son of actor Peter Lawford, pulls his weight with the officials and Munro is allowed to compete. Even though we know the outcome, the racing sequences at Bonneville are exhilarating.<br/><br/>While The World's Fastest Indian sounds like a typical formula exercise of the underdog fighting for glory against heavy obstacles, the film is too smart, the people too real, and Hopkins too charming to fall into that trap. The film promotes some very welcome ideas: that the power of our intention can transform our life, that there may be some goodness still left in people, and that old age can be a time of possibility, not a time to throw in the towel. This is a warm, charming, and yes, I'll say the ""s"" word, sentimental film that will not appeal to the action-oriented multiplex crowd or those who find it chic to be cynical, but may appeal to those who simply enjoy well made entertainment that actually delivers on its promise of making us feel good. Kudos to Donaldson, Hopkins, and, of course, to Burt Munro."

","It seems many viewers avoided this film when it was in the theaters because the title was confusing and not representative of the story. The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins was the lead actor should have been a signal of sorts, but it took the release of the DVD for this viewer to reluctantly rent the film when other possibilities were low. Big Mistake! This is one of the more genuinely fine films about the idomitability of the human spirit that has been released in some time.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, the 'Indian' of the title has nothing to do with the heritage of the character Burt Munro, a 67 year old odd but generously kind New Zealander whose lifelong passion is to race his 1923 'Indian motorbike' in the Bonneville Salt Flats Races in America. Burt lives for his dreams and despite the fact that his idiosyncrasies befuddle his neighbors and townsfolk (with the except of the little boy Tom next door who idolizes him), he manages to make everyone with whom he comes into contact admire, and yes, love him. Using his own skills he brings his old motorbike to the point that he can enter the race in the States and with the financial help of his friends he manages to board a ship with his bike and sail to America. In the US he is a fish out of water and must adjust to the city life and attitudes of the Americans, but eventually, through his innate charm and dedication to his dream, he does manage against all odds and, with the help of many American new friends, enter the race to break the world's record for speed on a motorbike.<br/><br/>Hopkins owns the role of Burt and despite his not always on target New Zealand accent he manages to deliver surely one of his most endearing portrayals of his rich career. His encounters with Tom, with a feisty widow Ada (Diane Ladd), with a fine old wise Indian man, and with a transsexual motel clerk Tina (Chris Williams), to name only a few of the superb supporting cast - are the epitome of underplayed fine acting and engender so much warmth that tears of happiness just can't be avoided. Writer and director Roger Donaldson deserves a standing ovation for this small, sensitive, gentle, understated tale that demonstrates so well how being true to your visions and your dreams can overcome almost any obstacle. A deeply touching and completely entertaining movie. Highly Recommended for all audiences. This is one to Buy! Grady Harp"

I'm puzzled why it is in such limited release; here in western Canada, it's on ONE screen in Vancouver, and that's it for the western provinces. Likewise, one screen in Ontario (Toronto). What the hell is wrong with the movie industry that a film like this is sent, virtually, direct to home video.

","""Spoiler"" noted only because I may reveal surprises.<br/><br/>Unlike some reviewers I AM a motorcycle fan, but that isn't a requirement for the enjoyment of this film. TWFI goes far beyond merely showing the life of a gearhead, with a clear, compassionate display of human dedication and perseverance. The fact that it also manages to show accurately the behavior of a man whose life is centered around machinery is icing on the cake for me. Example: Burt trimming his toenails with a sanding attachment on a drill motor. That is exactly the sort of solution a man like him would've found for a grooming challenge. Example: trimming the weeds in the yard by dousing them with gasoline and lighting them. Again, very true-to-life. <br/><br/>The production of the movie also showed a real commitment to accuracy and excellence. According to the review in Motorcycle Consumer News, the junk lying around Burt's shop was the real Burt Munro's actual junk, including melted pistons and blown cylinders ruined during his development of the Indian's engine. Also, even more amazingly, the cars on the salt at Bonneville were not copies, not period-correct restorations, but THE ACTUAL vehicles which were there when Burt Munro ran. How the producers were able to persuade the museums in which those beauties normally reside to allow them to return to the abrasive, corrosive environment of a salt flat is beyond my imagination. I just know that they bring an air of reality to this film which one doesn't see often in modern films. I think that even viewers who couldn't tell a piston from a pinto pony will still feel the reality of the environments shown in this film, will ""get the vibe,"" so to speak. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is, as ever, brilliant. There are other actors who could've done a good job of portraying Burt Munro, but there is no one who could have done it better. Actors of his caliber don't go to work with the thought that someone will award them a gold statue for their work, but it will be a shame if he is not nominated for every possible award for this role. TWFI is the kind of subtle, quiet film which sometimes escapes the notice of award-givers; I hope it gets noticed."

","""The World's Fastest Indian"" is based on the true life story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins) a man who is in love with speed. Set in New Zealand during the 1960's this movie follows Burt as he builds and repairs his old 1920's Indian Motorcycle. One day Burt faints and is rushed to the hospital where he is put on pills and is told that he is dying. Burt then follows his dream by going half way across the world to Salt Lake City, Utah to compete in the Bonneville motorcycle competition where he wants to race his Indian motorcycle and break the national land speed record. A real life underdog story ensues <br/><br/>What a great movie! Is what I said to myself as I walked about of the theater tonight after watching ""The World's Fastest Indian."" This movie is not only about a true underdog but also rather inspiring. This movie reminds people to follow your dreams and always believe in yourself even when majority of people think your going to fail. This movie which is based on true events is a remarkable film about a man who just never stopped no matter what obstacles got in his way. This is a powerful film that we see too few of in my opinion.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is just terrific as the good spirited Burt Munro. Anthony Hopkins should have gotten an Oscar Nomination for his performance here. I really think the academy overlooked this film because it was definitely worthy of some attention just for Hopkins performance alone. The whole supporting cast was also great. There are to many smaller roles to name but all did a fine job with the part they were given to play. Great acting jobs all around.<br/><br/>This film is director and writer Roger Donaldson's best work to date. He has been doing films for some time now and has directed films like ""Dante's Peak"" and ""The Recruit"" but none have the greatness that this film delivers. The character development and production values are excellent and Donaldson does a great job capturing Burt's happiness and struggles. I think this movie could really make Donaldson a well known director in Hollywood.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want a movie that is smart and interesting see this film. If you want to see some great performances along with a great screenplay see this film. This movie is truly a great depiction of an ordinary man who does extraordinary things in order to follow his dreams and live life to the fullest. The movie is definitely a feel good movie that will make its audience think and ask question ""When will I follow my dream?"" The performance by Anthony Hopkins is worth the price of admission alone but then when you add on the great screenplay and good supporting roles well you got a film that I feel we see to few of. I highly recommend this movie to those who like well made movies that have substance.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is a 8/10"

This movie does not contain any of the special effects, profanity or nudity that has become too common in movie choices today. What it does contain is superb acting and scenes that make you laugh one minute and get your eyes to well up the next minute.<br/><br/>Hopkins delivers a performance that enables the viewer to fully understand what Burt Munroe was doing his entire life, striving to live out a dream. When asked asked if he is afraid of dying on the bike he replies ""I live more in 5 minutes on my motorcycle than many people live in a lifetime"".<br/><br/>That is what the movie is all about."

","While I was aware of the land speed record established by Bert Munro, I was not prepared for his personal Odyssey. His work at Bonneville, as I now realize, stands tall in a world of giants - Vale Bert! This film was a beautifully shot, well directed overview of the man and his eccentric story. The fluffy bits may or may not be accurate to the real story, and I can understand that Scripting People and Directors may require the ""human Interest"" to be ramped up... but in this film it is obvious, and gentle - not exploitative in my opinion. The film moves well, and the treatment of the story is calm and 'small-world' in style. I was delighted; we laughed at some comic moments and we came to understand some of Bert's classically Kiwi personality. Hopkins (and this is not a criticism, just a minor dead note) struggles with his character's accent throughout, but unless one is Kiwi it may not be noticeable. Hopkins wanted this role, and I can see why. Purity of motive, simplicity of character - actors must get tired of working in the neurotic, hyperbolic, sometimes pathetic and finally dishonest world of Hollywood Cinema.... This film goes a different path, and deserves it's audience. Trolls who need ""action"" and cretins who live in the ""American Pie"" world need not apply. This is cinema."

Ultimately one of the most uplifting movies I have had the pleasure to watch more than once and each time feels like the first time.<br/><br/>It really pulls you in and you become invested in the character Anthony Hopkins is portraying. <br/><br/>Also loosely based on part of the life of Burt Munro.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"JamesHitchcock","8","2","2","12 April 2013"," The Kiwi Underdog
","Despite the title of this film, its hero, Burt Munro, is not an Indian, in either the sense of ""American Indian"" or that of ""native of India"". He is in fact a New Zealander; the title relates to his Indian Scout motorcycle. The story is set in the early 1960s, and Munro is a motorcycle enthusiast from Invercargill, New Zealand. His great ambition is to take part in the Bonneville Speed Week with his almost equally elderly motorbike, which dates back to 1920. He travels by cargo ship to Los Angeles with his beloved bike, then rides it all the way to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.<br/><br/>Burt Munro was a real person, and seems to have been a rather more serious and dedicated individual than the character portrayed in this film, an elderly eccentric in fading health who is obsessed with motorbikes and whose lifetime ambition is to compete at Bonneville once before he dies. The central part of the film, dealing with his journey from Los Angeles to Utah, takes on something of the character of an epic road-movie as Burt overcomes the many obstacles which stand is his way with the assistance of the colourful characters he meets- a transvestite named Tina, a Native American and a woman named Ada who briefly becomes his lover. When he gets to Bonneville he is barred from competing by race officials, partly because he has not registered for the competition in advance and partly because his ancient bike fails to meet contemporary safety standards. Eventually he is allowed to make a timed run, something presented as an act of compassion towards an old man and his dream. <br/><br/>Although there are numerous exceptions, such as his Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"", many of Anthony Hopkins's best performances have come in films where he has played real historical individuals, such as Dr Treves in ""The Elephant Man"", Captain Bligh in ""The Bounty"", Frank Doel in ""84 Charing Cross Road"", C.S. Lewis in ""Shadowlands"", John Quincy Adams in ""Amistad"" and Alfred Hitchcock in the recent ""Hitchcock"". ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is another to add to this list. <br/><br/>The real Munro, in fact, raced at Bonneville on a number of occasions and set numerous land speed records for motorcycles, one of which still stands to this day. It is therefore hard to imagine him being quite as amateurish and ill-prepared as Hopkins's character. And yet Hopkins's interpretation of the role is one of the factors- indeed, possibly the most important factor- which make this film such a success. His Munro is an often-difficult but lovable old man who arouses admiration because of his innocent self-belief, his determination and his refusal to take ""no"" for an answer, especially in his dealings with American bureaucracy. <br/><br/>The film was a big success at the New Zealand box-office; Munro is something of a folk hero in his native country, and director Roger Donaldson, himself a New Zealander, had long cherished the ambition of making a film about him. (Donaldson had earlier directed Hopkins in ""The Bounty""). Perhaps the reason for the film's success that it encapsulates the way New Zealanders think about themselves; a small country of only some four million inhabitants, they have nevertheless achieved considerable success in the sporting arena (particularly in rugby union), and this film celebrates another Kiwi underdog taking on a bigger nation at their own game and beating them. 8/10"

","Blue-collared New Zealander Burt Munro has one dream; to go fast. Obsessed with his dream to break land-speed records, Burt wakes up every morning before dawn to customize his 1920 606cc Indian Scout to the dismay of his neighbors. Not getting any younger, Burt decides to follow his dream and endure a long harsh pilgrimage to the Bonneville salt flats of Utah.<br/><br/>Based on a true story ""World's Fastest Indian"" has become a labor of love for director Roger Donaldson who had been working on and off on the project for 20 years. Donaldson even directed a TV documentary on the same subject in 1971. His passion for his subject is the engine that drives this beautifully shot film. He seems to have tremendous respect and fondness for the Invercargill legend avoiding simple generalizations.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Burt Munro is arguably the best performance of his career. Burt comes off as a gruff but good-natured backyard eccentric; a big fish who has gotten too big for his pond and despite setbacks, aims to prove he's anything but ordinary. Burt setbacks however are ordinary in a good sense. Ones that we all have experienced: lack of money, mechanical and transportation issues, entrenched bureaucracy, they're all frustratingly there impeding Burt from succeeding in his goal. Burt however handles them with a dose of chipper can-do helping others along the way including a cynical transvestite (Chris Williams), a struggling used car salesman (Paul Rodriguez) and a lonely widow (Diane Ladd).<br/><br/>Ultimately what comes across the screen is a small quiet film about a larger than life figure. Not quite a motorcycle movie or a biographical melodrama, ""World's Fastest Indian"" totes the line being equally satisfying for both motorheads and the average moviegoer.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","An elderly man restores an old motor - cycle and takes it halfway round the world to ride it on Bonneville Salt Flats. This is the story of an obsession eventually realised by 63 year - old heart patient Burt Munro.Stubborn,ornery,bloody - minded,call him what you will,he was a man of no small courage,fully aware of the risks involved in pushing himself and his machine to the limit. He makes an epic journey across America towing his ""Indian"" behind a clapped - out old clunker,encountering a full and varied selection of the population en route,giving them the benefit of his wisdom whether they want it or not. From black ladyboy(there couldn't have been many of them to the pound in 1962 even in Hollywood) to Native American to lonely widow to hitch - hiking serviceman on leave from Vietnam,Burt gets to meet a suspiciously ""Cross Section of America"" cornucopia of citizens of this strange land. Gruff but kindly,he's not too happy at being mistaken for a Brit,but New Zealanders were rare visitors to the U.S. back in those days. In fact the inference is many Americans had never heard of it. As Munro,Mr Anthony Hopkins gives a performance of quiet charm with reserves of strength that are brought to the fore just when required. It is a complete contrast to some of his flashy scenery - chewing roles that have bought him the time to appear in movies like ""The World's fastest Indian""which seem to have little general appeal. Not a financial success,it is well worth seeking out and a worthy introduction to N.Z. Cinema to a wider public."
"MBunge","6","2","2","3 August 2010"," A good family movie, give or take some septuagenarian sex
","A charming but perhaps a bit too long road picture, The World's Fastest Indian tells the true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a New Zealand man who spent 25 years dreaming of a chance to go faster than any man ever had. He wants to take his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle and race it during Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and he's not going to let being 30 years older than every other racer there or living on the New Zealand equivalent of Social Security stop him.<br/><br/>Munro is what you could call an old duffer. He doesn't have a house but sleeps on a cot in a tool shed. He never mows his lawn, gets fresh eggs from his chicken coop and pees on his lemon tree every morning. Everybody in his small home town likes him, especially the boy who lives next door and hangs around as Burt constantly works on his cycle. The 1960s New Zealand of Burt Munro is very much like we used to think of small town Iowa before it started to die out, a nice place of nice people who are nice to each other. The town even tries to raise money to help Burt afford his trip to America, but he eventually has to mortgage his property to pay for it.<br/><br/>Once in the U.S., Burt has to make his way from the California coast to Utah. His travels lead him to meet a transvestite hotel clerk, a Mexican used car salesmen, an Indian who helps him after he breaks down on the side of the road and a woman who gives him her bed to sleep in. And while Burt is a kind and decent fellow, you can sense that people respond to him because of his quiet sense of purpose.<br/><br/>Like all great quests, there are obstacles in his way. Accidents and regulations and police officers and a bit of a heart condition. No problem is ever too terrible or too threatening, though. And unlike many movie quests, but just like most real life journeys, Burt doesn't get through it on his own. Without the help and goodwill of the people he meets, Burt would never get a chance to see just how fast his old motorcycle could go.<br/><br/>This is a charming and decidedly uncynical film, highlighted by Hopkins' performance. This isn't the sort of character most would associate him with. Burt Munro is a simple and earthy man whose life is enveloped by his desire for speed. As a young man, he might have been a bit difficult to deal with but age has tempered him and stripped him of the ego that might have sharpened his eccentricities to an edge. His desire to race isn't a compulsion. It's a spot on the horizon he'd just like to reach.<br/><br/>Normally, The World's Fastest Indian would be considered a family film. And, outside of Burt getting lucky a couple of times, it fits into that categoryso, depending on your attitude toward septuagenarian promiscuity, this might be a wonderful movie for parents and kids to watch together. This is a pleasant story that believes people are basically good and that success is achieved through the consideration of others. There are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours."

","The usual pattern of online reviews is followed here it seems. First we get a flush of people who love the film and then a few who don't and seem to delight in telling us. Some of the more recent poor reviews leave me a little confused – can you really be that impervious to a good film, or perhaps you think yourself more sophisticated than the rest of us for making disparaging remarks of that which others enjoy? The film is a delight and works on many levels. The acting and story are superb and it deserves those first gushing reviews. It receives criticism for being slow, it isn't, its subtle, there is a big difference. Also - guys, it is based on a true story, so criticising it for the turn of events depicted is pointless. I only got round to watching it very recently, hoping it would be an antidote from the crash and burn pyrotechnic antics of mainstream Hollywood. It is much more than that.

","This movie seems, at first glance, to be over the top. In truth the real story of Burt Munro is actually just as fantastic as this movie. Burt was, to say the least, an eccentric from the starting line. The fact that this man was most likely a genius in the field of motorcycle design is always over looked. In most things I've read about Burt he's given an almost ""idiot-savant"" portrayal. But Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays both Burt's eccentric nature,determination and genius with equal skill. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did but it was worth my time. The story of Burt Munro and his Indian is a love story of unusual dimensions as it is the story of a mans love for a dream and his determination to achieve it. Hopkins gives Burt a infectious charm that lures all around him into sharing his dream. while I cannot say that Burt was like this in real life.

","The world's fastest Indian is simple enough to sum up never give up on your dreams. Even if there is road blocks put in your path.

His dream is to race his 1924 Harley Davidson Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville salt flats or as he puts it it's sacred ground, hallow ground. Perhaps no one understands this better then Roger Donaldson who also had a dream and a vision in bringing Munro's story to the screen and in doing so brought to life one of the most inspiration movies I have ever seen. The talent behind this movie was white hot and it hit each and every button they were aiming for. Was it worth watching Yes. Will this movie stay with you long after you see it yes.

","Hopkins is outstanding in this true-life tale of Kiwi Bill Munro who sets out to break the land speed record in the twilight of his life. That Bill Munro's tale was little known outside his native Invercargill is a tragedy for the man but a boon for film-goers, keeping the dramatic tension at a peak throughout. Will he make it to Speed Week? Will he be allowed to race? Will his heart hold out? Will he survive? The film is upbeat and feel-good without ever being sentimental or manipulative. Cynics will say Munro comes over as Forrest Gump meets Crocodile Dundee, that the plot is cookie-cutter from Straight Story or Broken Flowers. Ignore them, these people are doomed to unhappiness. Supported by a host of on-form character actors, Hopkins gives a lifetime best performance in a film that is inspirational in both film-making and life-affirming terms. Budding actors should study the scenes where Hopkins talks about the early demise of his twin brother, and what it means to him to finally see the salt flats. You will come away from this film feeling joyous."

When he gets there he must fight another battle and again his honest nature triumphs over everything that is thrown at him.<br/><br/>I really loved this Movie and would recommend it to anyone.

This film is not simply a chronical of one of the world's forgotten characters, but a story of passion and dedication.<br/><br/>It is inspirational, and Mr. Hopkins positively shines in his interpretation of this man.<br/><br/>The story starts in the 1950's (or before) and immediately fascinates with an urban portrait of a dedicatated, mechanically-minded, and very average grandfatherly single chap whose one ambition is to make his Indian motorcycle go faster. He is occasionally the subject of ridicule and pity in his home town, but he is never fazed.<br/><br/>I can say no more other than 'see this film'.

","The Worlds Fastest Indian is probably the best feel good movie i have ever seen. I truly believe it is one of the best independent films of the last ten years.<br/><br/>What TWFI real appeal is that it is not really a story about a motorbike rider at all. I mean sure, dumb petrol heads (including my ex-flatmate) will probably love this movie, for its exciting scenes where Bert breaks the world record. But really, the actual breaking of the record itself is only a small part of the movies appeal.<br/><br/>What is much more presence are the common themes of triumph over adversity, of the underdog winning out, of a man from a small country, (The mighty NZ) coming to the 'big smoke' to make his fortune and succeding. Indeed this story has some relevance to New Zealands proud sporting history, as while Munro was breaking this record, athletes such as Peter Snell, Murray Halberg, Bill Baillie and of course the great Colin Meads were firmly establishing New Zealand as a strong sporting nation.<br/><br/>The humour in this film is a pleasant surprise. All of the jokes contain an element of wit to them, unlike so many other films that come these days (hollowood obvisouly0. Although i like the American Pie films, they kick-started a host of toilet-humour movies which have become tiresome and unfunny. But this film has clever humour to go with a simply, yet effective plot. The 'lemon-tree' running joke is particularly humorous.<br/><br/>The accurate portray of New Zealand in the 1960s is very evident, and the community spirit of the town in getting behind Bert is also brilliantly scripted. I also enjoyed the different people that Bert met whilst in American, particularly Native American Jake and the transsexual. The fact that Bert does not judge these people on their appearance alone is very enduring ( although I would have to say this has changed somewhat in New Zealand now days.) In the 1960s, New Zealand was naive to the world in many ways. Nowdays, we are one of the worlds most travelled people due to our isolation and rebellion nature. People like Bert and Peter Snell were pioneers of the travel bug for the average new Zealander.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Hopkins was magnificent. he should have gotta an Oscar nomination. if Keisha ""I'm pregnant at 16"" Castle-Hughes can get one for Whale Rider, then Hopkins was clearly robbed, and it is only his previous success that denied him a nomination in my opinion. Hopkins is able to nail the difficulty Invercargill accent ( the only real provincial different in accents in New Zealand) superbly. He really makes this film what it is. Jim ( Berts fellow competitor in Utah)also puts in a quality performance, as do the girls who support Bert. Finally, the little boy whose name i have forgotten really adds well to the cast, bringing back childhood memories for everyone i am sure.<br/><br/>Overall I Cant say enough good things about this film. Im hopelessly biased, but if you are an American or European out there who doesn't rate New Zealand films, i would honestly recommend this one. It will have you feeling happy the entire movie and will confirm your faith in the kind spirit of the human race."

","Take 1 part Crocadile Dundee, 2 parts Oscar Madison, 1 part McGuiver and you have the raunchy old biker character Hopkins created to approximate Burt Munro...a 68 year old pensioner from Kiwi land that set the world speed record in the 1000cc motorcycle class.<br/><br/>Burt Munro lives in his garage, fills his tea pot with quench water from his forge and urinates on his lemon trees ( best fertilizer you can give 'em)...but the ladies seem to take to his free and easy life style and Hopkins/Burt seems to have no effort charming bunk mates....he even charms the cross dressing desk clerk at his Hollywood motel.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is spent with Hopkins developing and personifying Burt's character and playing his rustic stoicism and mellow temperament against life's hard knocks, modern times and some pretty bizarre Hollywood denizens and the pursuit of his dreams of speed....and this works because you are kept enthralled with his hapless journey to the ""holy ground""...the salt flats of Bonneville not realizing 2 hrs have shot by.<br/><br/>The final stages of the movie involve Burt's endearing himself to the<br/><br/>""kids"" competing for the Bonneville speed crown and having the rules bent so he can make his famous run on the flats.<br/><br/>If you ride motorcycles and don't usually like motorcycle movies ( like me), this one is for you....actually this is a great old fashioned success-against-all-odds movie that entertains, makes you laugh and also reflect. Hopkins shines in characterizing the resilient grease monkey Burt Munro and there is enough action, comedy and pathos to keep a broad audience absorbed in Burt's quest.<br/><br/>Probably the most enjoyable movie I saw this year. Donaldson has a sleeper on his hands with this fine effort. You can tell that the director had a passion for telling Burt's tale. It comes through strong in the small details that make this movie so believable and the characters so real. Too bad it was so poorly promoted. I don't understand how such a great film got 3rd rate distribution and promotion...methinks some politics are at work...shame, everyone should see this one it's a classic."
"balong9","10","2","2","26 February 2006"," Very entertaining
","I was only partially looking forward to this movie. I thought it would be mostly about motorcycle racing and his various attempts at breaking the land speed record but I love Anthony Hopkins and my husband was really looking forward to it so off we went. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. What a wonderful story. I was so glad that a big part of the movie was his journey and the characters he met. The scenes that involved the racing were equally as entertaining. He was such a likable person and so entertaining. I was never bored during this movie and found myself wanting more when it ended. I, too, believe Anthony Hopkins should be nominated for an Oscar. I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD."
"lonebison","10","2","2","24 February 2006"," Why a limited release?
","This movie is one of the best 'feel good movies' I've seen in a long time, yet it is almost impossible to find playing anywhere, and that pisses me off! They ran a trailer for it during the SuperBowl which is not cheap, but only released it in just a little over 100 screens across the country! What is wrong with these people? <br/><br/>I know a lot of people who want to see it, but are having the same problem as everyone else. I called my folks who live near Sacremento, Ca., and they haven't been able to find it anywhere close to them. I've seen it twice and know they would love it, and want them to see it, but with the pathetic distribution, that looks doubtful until it comes out on DVD. <br/><br/>I realize the studio or movie may not have a 'King Kong' budget, but why would you spend $25 million on a movie and then only put in out in such tiny quantity?"
"michael-carmody","7","2","2","19 February 2006"," This year's two-wheeled, 200 mph feel-good story!
","I just saw this movie earlier this evening and have to say I enjoyed it. The parking lot at the theater was quite crowded for a Sunday matinÃ©e, and I joked that all the bikers in town must have come out...then, once inside, I ran into one of the local Harley-Davidson shop owners! Turns out I was right!<br/><br/>Anyway, the story told in the movie is inspirational and heartwarming, though formulaic and rife with factual inaccuracies. For instance, the movie depicts a number of incidents taking place on Munro's first trip to America, when in actuality they happened on subsequent trips. In the film, Munro speaks of a twin brother killed in an accident; the real Munro's twin was a sister who died at birth.<br/><br/>None of this, in the end, takes anything away from the very real accomplishments of the very real Burt Munro.<br/><br/>The cinematography throughout was beautiful, saturated with the colors of the 1960s. The scenes of ""Speed Week"" at Bonneville Salt Flats were particularly lovely. Hot rod nerds will drool themselves dry watching the classic iron roll by in these shots. The costumes are spot-on for the era, too.<br/><br/>I found the percussive, repetitive music score a bit distracting, personally. It sounded like the score for ""American Beauty: Down Under"" (the production was based in New Zealand, so maybe that's where the flavor came from). I got used to it, though.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is really great in this role. He reminded me of a few old grease-stained geezers that have crossed my own path over the years. This role is diametrically opposed to characters like Hannibal Lecter and Richard Nixon, and it really gives Hopkins a chance to step into a benign skin and own it. He was totally believable, even when the forced dramatic license of the film was not.<br/><br/>This is the type of flick that might well appeal to both men and women; it's got an iron-balled hero on a motorcycle, but it's also a testament to the indomitable human spirit. I saw it on a date, and we both had a swell time.<br/><br/>Just my $.02."
"Movieguy_blogs_com","10","2","2","10 February 2006"," I would compare it to 'The Right Stuff' meets 'Hidalgo'.
","In 'The World's Fastest Indian' Anthony Hopkins plays Burt Munro, a retired motorcycle enthusiast from New Zealand who dreams of becoming the fastest man alive. He wants to go the Bonneville Salt Flats and see how fast his bike will really go. When he finds out he has a heart condition, he becomes more determined to fulfill his dream before it is too late.<br/><br/>This is probably the best movie I have seen thus far this year. Sir Anthony Hopkins make this movie believable and worth watching. Along with Hopkins performance, the movie itself is very authentic. A complete replica of Munro's bike was built and used in the film. Also, many of the props used belonged to Munro including some of Hopkins' wardrobe. I would compare it to 'The Right Stuff' meets 'Hidalgo'.<br/><br/>If this movie had not opened so early in the year, I would think it would be an Oscar contender. I will keep my fingers crossed."
"ncrouch-1","10","2","2","5 February 2006"," I highly recommend this one.
","This was a great ""feel good"" movie, which I haven't seen in a long time. Mr. Hopkins is obviously proud of this movie and should be - it was a very fun night. His love of the character that Bert Monro truly was, is captured in this movie. It makes me want to know more about this man from New Zealand. You couldn't help but pull for this character. Bert had such a positive view of life that is lost in this age. It was very refreshing to see something original in amongst so many remakes and sequels. Hopkins should have been in the Oscar nominations, but I don't understand why this reached the Oscar voting window so late. I would think that the release of a movie revolves around what an Oscar nomination can do for profits."
"Mountain-Storm","10","2","2","27 January 2006"," Awesome
","I loved this movie. It was wonderfully filmed and the story kept me entranced from beginning to end. The storyline at first appears quirky and in some respects the movie seems to be much ado about nothing. After thinking about the movie after viewing, the enormity of what Burt Munroe achieved sinks it. This is a story of a dream, of determination, of vision and of the human spirit. Anthony Hopkins was superb, I don't think many actors could of pulled it off like he did. One of my favorite films in the last 12 months. MAKE SURE YOU SEE THIS MOVIE if you want something different from Hollywoods blood and guts routine, it a delight."
"cet-2","10","9","16","24 October 2005"," Really enjoyed it
","This is much more than a bike film. Its about a guys journey to achieve something, basically leaving ones mark on this planet. An entertaining film with humor and a lot of detail in terms of the original setting worked through. Which as an ex neighbor of the old codger received some scrutiny. There is much more to Burts life than shown on the film but the essence is there and a flavor of the guys skill is seen in the casting of his own pistons. The film crafts in nicely the guys passion and determination which is what the films about. As a consequence the film is very appealing to a wide audience. My 90 year old aunt was rapt with it... as well as the grand children. The film stays away from sleaze and smut and excessive stunts. The fact is Burt had many pile ups in his life and there could have been a number shown, but that wasn't the main story. The film is a story of working towards ones goals and ultimately achieving them. This journey should be appealing to all ages because we all need goals in our own lives. I would highly recommend it as being suitable family viewing."

","In all respects this is a wonderful film. The story is great, the acting is great its hard to pick faults.<br/><br/>The main character played by Anthony Hopkins overcomes many obstacles on his way to breaking the world land speed record.

","I've seen this movie once - and I definitely plan to see it again and again and again. It is just a brilliant movie about how an ordinary guy lived his dreams and made them real. Burt is SO passionate about what he is doing and not letting anything stop him. I came out of the movie feeling that I could put an equivalent amount of energy into the things that I am passionate about that I too could achieve my dreams! It is the ultimate feel good movie AND it is based on a true story! A number of liberties may have been taken with timing of some of the events and some of the characters along the way - but from all accounts it is a fairly good representation of Burt Munro. You don't have to be a petrol-head or into motorbikes to enjoy this movie - my eleven year old niece and my 73 year old mother enjoyed it equally as much!"
"largelyhappy","9","11","22","23 October 2005"," Burt Munro, a great Kiwi
","I went to see this movie not only with someone who knew Burt's family but whose mother also used to ride an Indian! Burt rode an Indian Scout, she rode and Indian Chief bike and never aspired to break records but we had some expectations (and criticism at the ready) when we walked into the cinema, not least of which was 'why didn't they pick a Kiwi actor for this role?'<br/><br/>We walked out having seen a slice of life as we knew it and with cheers on our lips for a good old Kiwi bloke who loved speed, loved the ladies and showed what it was like to dream dreams.<br/><br/>We wondered how Anthony Hopkins would tackle the difficult Kiwi accent, most actors end up sounding like Aussies, which is a totally different accent but he managed it just fine, even with a slight Scottish burr which many Southlanders have.<br/><br/>He's an absolute master, an expert in his field - as Burt was in his and Mr Hopkins' understated rendition (how did he know we Kiwi's are so laid back about our achievements?) was first class, so we felt the casting director was justified after all!<br/><br/>In spite of what the world believes, WE Kiwis were the first to fly more than 1km - Richard Pearse flew almost a year before the Wright Bross. WE split the atom and we've been first past the post in many other technological and scientific achievements...we just don't crow about it and this film exactly captured the way someone like Burt Munro broke records which haven't been bettered 40 years on and yet is relatively unknown, even in Aotearoa. (Incidentally, Hopkins/Burt said 'Aotearoa' wrong in the movie, but many New Zealanders do that anyway so it was probably an accurate mistake!)<br/><br/>Not only did Anthony Hopkins do a darned good job for us in portraying an innovative Kiwi, he captured the spirit as well.<br/><br/>A wonderful movie, inspiration and superbly low-key."
"jimhills","10","3","4","7 June 2006"," Best Movie of 2006
","www.kajatm.com Finally after consecutive week of seeing Good Night and Good Luck and Firewall and I got to see a movie that was worth the admission. A movie that had a good story line. A movie that had good acting. And a movie that I would recommend to anyone of any age. Unlike Katie Holmes' parents, this movie did not disappoint me.<br/><br/>The World's Fastest Indian is based on the true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a guy from New Zealand that is obsessed with getting to the United States so he can drive his custom made Indian Motor cycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The movie really focuses on the adversity Burt Munro had to overcome to get to the US to achieve his dream. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, like usual, in the lead role of Burt Munro and really demonstrates how Munro was an individual from a generation that was kind and courteous, a generation that was considerate of others and a generations that knew if you treated people with respect that you'd get a lot farther than being a prick. People of today can learn a lot from Burt Munro.<br/><br/>It is going to be a sad day when Anthony Hopkins dies and can no longer bring us great performances like this one. He has been good for so long that I think we often take his acting ability for granted. He does such a great job of portraying Munro that you eventually forget that you are watching Anthony Hopkins on screen and you start to believe that you are watching the true life story of Munro. Anthony Hopkins is what every actor in Hollywood should try to strive for with their career. He doesn't play himself; he plays an accurate representation of the characters that are put before him unlike some actors in Hollywood, Harrison Ford I am looking in your direction.<br/><br/>I really cannot say enough about this movie. It gives me faith in Hollywood that there are still directors out there that can make movies that are original, that have good acting and actually have a storyline that you give two shits about. As far as I am concerned directors like Roger Donaldson and Jerry Bruckheimer can keep making movies that are based on true stories because they are far more interesting than the ""Blockbusters"" that get put out every year. The fact that the World Fastest Indian hasn't gotten a lot of hubbub in advertisements or that it isn't playing at some of the biggest theaters in South Eastern Wisconsin speaks volumes of how the movie viewing public has been brainwashed into thinking what should be a good movie.<br/><br/>At this point of the year, The World's Fastest Indian is my pick for Picture of the Year. I know it is a little early but I have confidence that this movie will survive until the next nominations. I will be very surprised if Anthony Hopkins doesn't get nominated for Best Actor and wins that category but then again I am never surprised what the ""Academy"" does anymore. This movie doesn't have political undertones, it doesn't have two dudes humping each other on screen and it doesn't have some unbelievable thing that happens on screen that only a computer could generate. So maybe I should retract my previous statement that this is going to be nominated for picture of the year because it doesn't fall under the Academy's new definition of what a best picture should be.<br/><br/>Overall this was a very good viewing experience for me. If you have the opportunity and if you can find it playing at a theater near you I would recommend taking the time to see this cinematic master piece. But then again, what do I know?"
"Jimi-Bigbear","10","3","4","25 March 2006"," The virtue of friendliness
","Hopkins was delightful as Burt Munro, a lovable eccentric with a dream, whose mastery of the human virtues of friendliness, one-pointedness, and non-judgmental, open hearted acceptance of everyone he meets on his adventure, wins him the support of Nature that he needs to fulfill his 25 year desire. A wonderful story, masterfully told, and Kiwi Jon Clarke's assessment notwithstanding, we ""yanks"" loved it here in the states. My wife and I haven't been down under to beautiful New Zealand yet, but I have stood on the salt flats of the once great Lake Bonneville, and feel this is as much an American story as it is a Kiwi's. In fact it's a human feel good movie that can't be contained by any nation's borders."
"jacksteeley","7","3","4","26 January 2006"," Enjoyable movie
","Saw this at a sneak preview last night. Overall I enjoyed it, and it held my interest, even though I did not know much about Bert Munro before seeing the movie. I have since read a little bit of his story and the man was even more fascinating than the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was a little slow paced at the beginning, and could have used a little editing to speed things up in places. It is clear that his success came from his mechanical genius, his determination, and from the help of the many friends that he made during his life. That came through in the movie and made me curious about the man behind the movie.<br/><br/>There were a few factual errors, at least according to some other material that I read. Some of the things that the movie has happen during Bert's run at the Salt Flats in Utah did not actually happen that first year, but happened during some of his subsequent visits. Laying the bike down at the end of the run, having his goggles torn off by the wind, and breaking 200 mph, all happened in later years, not that first year. It did make for a more interesting movie to have that ""out of time"" however."

I hope this gets as much attention as that did. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is funny and unique in this movie, his acting is meticulous. Cool script and direction by Roger Donaldson, who usually does big blockbusters."

","The World's Fastest Indian is the best movie I've seen in years. Anthony Hopkins is terrific in this role, I think it's his best performance since Shadowlands. He morphs into Burt Munro completely, he's sweet, charismatic, tenacious, focused, very funny, (his comedic timing is perfect) and even masters the Kiwi accent. We saw this at a film festival, and everyone was laughing so hard that we actually missed some lines. It's a very uplifting, inspiring, good feeling movie and everyone loved it. In fact, the audience clapped vigorously at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins always manages to inhibit his characters, as he does in this movie, but he also uses his talents to nail the accent, and even his appearance seems different. You've never seen him this funny and likable before. He becomes Burt Munro in every respect, and the audience is won over in the first few minutes of the film - just like Burt wins everyone he meets on the way to his quest for the land speed record for his Indian motorcycle. Go see it you'll be glad you did, I was. In fact, I can't wait to see it again!"

","Such a great story, interesting fellow. You'd think (truth being stranger than fiction) that telling the story straight could work. These days, though, nothing is ever quite enough. Escalation is like a new religion to movie makers, it seems. The writers / producers didn't trust their material, so they huffed and they puffed and they blew their movie right away. Nothing wrong with the acting, here. Hopkins, as others have said, is terrific, and the supporting cast as well -- but. (SPOILER WARNING) When a person with such perfect engine smarts puts a wheel on his trailer that (naturally!!!!) falls off at highway speed, dumping his 25 years of effort all over the asphalt (without significant damage!!!)-- well, this is just crap Hollywood. When someone with so many decades of riding experience practically falls off his bike every single d___n time he starts moving, when he crashes at Bonneville at extreme speed -- we don't know just how fast, but let's say way over 80 -- and gets not even a visible scratch, when he does all this at a rather advanced age, somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 years -- well. As if breaking all these speed records with a heart condition at his (or any) age isn't enough, he is portrayed acting like a nitwit -- it's disgusting, it's pandering. Get those movie makers out of Burt's way, please."
"wymanvic","8","5","10","4 December 2005"," Anthony Hopkins deserves, at least, an academy award nomination for this performance.
","Seen in a NZ cinema and twice on flight from Auckland to LAX! Why delay until 2006 the US release of this wonderful film? Anthony Hopkins deserves a Best Actor Academy Nomination for his performance. Some may quibble, but, in my opinion, he perfectly captures the Kiwi spirit. The trip from New Zealand to Los Angeles to Bonneville is like a modern version of 'The Canterbury Tales'. It is a series of vignettes illustrating slices of life in New Zealand, at sea and in the USA. These may not portray life in the 1950s very well, but they are certainly relevant today. We can all forgive the artistic license. These scenes carry the film with humor, pathos and passion. A big Hurrah(!) for Hopkins, Roger Donaldson the filmmaker and the entire crew."

The photography as well as the period documentation was superb. I think this film would appeal to all types of people, women, men, and kids. The overall theme is universal. It is an uplifting story told with humor and love for the character. There are some good moral lessons here. Treat others with respect and you will get it in return.

This was not one of those movies. Having seen Sir Anthony Hopkins in so many other movies, I thought it might be hard trying to associate him with such a kiwi role, but he did a fantastic job, as did the other cast members. At the heart of this great movie though, was insightful direction and writing from Roger Donaldson.<br/><br/>I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are in need of a bit of a lift.

","WARNING SPOILERS: I heard so much about The World's Fastest Indian for so long and waited for its premiere in New Zealand, and it was definitely worth the wait.. being a keen New Zealander from the part of the country Bert Munro came from, it brought a tear to the eye seeing all the familiar Kiwi sights, i.e. the Bank of New Zealand, Catlins beach and those type of houses that you usually see in the deep South - Dunedin, Invercargill.. but most of all, it's the familiar Kiwi ingenuity which is the main theme of the movie, e.g. the Indian motorbike wrapped in bed sheets which prob saved it after the wooden box it came in got wrecked en-route to America, or the asbestos ripped from Bert's mattress to protect Bert's leg from Indian's muffler? only Kiwis could ever think of such innovation.. Hopkins was enjoyable as Bert Munro and while he couldn't maintain the Kiwi accent, i think he was still believable as a Kiwi - most Kiwis still have the English/Scottish accent even after several generations.. a great movie.. while it prob isn't Oscar material, but watch this as a proud Kiwi or if ya into underdog tales.."

This film is a remarkable tale of humanity and courage of a simple man who travelled so far to achieve his dream using a sled he worked on for many years. Anthony Hopkins does a stunning job and gives one of his finest performances as the record breaker who dared to dream. His journey is beautiful and the humanity of those he met is quite admirable. This was a true feel good movie as it had a very pleasant and happy ending for the late Burt Munro who broke many records. It had a beautiful message that you should always cultivate your goals and never lose heart no matter how old you are. The location and scenes of the Bonneville Salt Flats were a treat to watch.

Here this character was never trying to beg for mercy though there were many 'rules' against him(or his age). <br/><br/>The movie gives motivation. No doubt. But it has multiple dimension in my view. The obvious one is the determination of a slow aged man to be the fastest with with under 1000cc machine. In a scene a taxi driver asks 'Are you a deaf?""... ""Oh Yea..deaf too! Please repeat"". Without writing a spoiler, I can only quote this much for revealing( or exaggerating?!) the attitude of the character. That's about man. But the machine, 'Indian', has got a lot of points to tell. That touched my engineering mind. It was just an old bike with 57miles/h speed when it was born. When she got aged, she started to fly. how? That is engineering. even her center of gravity has been customized. she gets shoe polish to glitter her black tyres.... Guys, don't waste time by reading the reviews... ! just watch it. there are a lot of dimensions to think and inspire. At the end only I and Avantika(my daughter) came to know that it is based on a true story.

","I had in the past an old motorbike, not an Indian though, but this is not the reason for me writing this review.<br/><br/>First of all, I would watch this movie again and again, and I would feel the tears in my eyes every single time. This movie definitely helped me to move a step forward in being more human.<br/><br/>It's not a movie about old people, or about motorcycles. It's about dreams, about the meaning of life, about what makes us humans. There's nothing wrong in having a dream, but it's wrong to stop fighting to achieve that dream. That will be the best lesson we can learn from here.<br/><br/>Second of all, Anthony Hopkins was perfect for this role and he played it flawlessly. He was able to transfer all the emotions, the thrill, the sadness and happiness in my heart. The determination of his character, the way he's telling the stories, are absolutely fabulous.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie having expectations from it, but watch it with your heart and your mind opened.

I have paid $15.00 bucks at the box office only to view movies that put me to sleep in less than 20 minutes. Sir Anthony Hopkins once again was the perfect choice to play the main character Burt Munro. If only we could all have the drive and that never give up never give in attitude that Burt Munro shows us.

Great movie!...I recommend it to everyone! One of the many exciting scenes that I talk about is the race he had with a bunch of ""hells' angels types. They got off the line with no problem and figured the race was theirs....Burt got his usual push start, and eventually went by them like they were standing still.

","The Worlds Fastest Indian is a wonderful story. It captures some excellent racing photography out in the Bonneville Salt Flats while keeping a high interest level and empathy for the main character Burt Monroe, a true life enthusiast played chipper by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins turns in the kind of performance we expect. His character is full of life and humor taking setbacks in stride and not shy about calling on others for help. There's a nice character setup of him in a town in New Zealand before his adventure begins trying gather himself and preserve his adventurous spirit. Along the way supporting cast members to a good job, and the production does a good job of keeping settings looking like the 1960s. The finale sequence is captures the excitement and expansiveness of the events. Music throughout support decently. Well worth a watch."

","If only more men were like Burt Munro, I don't know how many liberties the director and Anthony Hopkins took with the performance but if even a little bit of it is accurate the world is a better place for men like Munro. Hopkins once again gives a masterful performance that made me love the character for the opening minutes. Every time someone or something would set him back it was a s frustrating and heartbreaking to me as it was to Munro. I guess that's what makes Hopkins such a great actor, that the same man was Hannibal Lector makes it even more impressive. The story itself is amazing and inspirational, and had me cheering him on by the end. The only thing I have to complain about is the supporting cast, I felt they all gave about average performances, nothing stand out. But I wonder if that is because of Hopkins being so damn good that he overshadows everyone else. I think we could all take a lesson from the character of Burt Munro in this film, about how to treat others and how to live life."
"Vic_max","Null","1","1","13 January 2008"," A slow, thoughtful character drama ...
","Anthony Hopkins is easy and pleasant to watch in this movie. However, it takes a take a while for the story to start building interest. It's mostly a lot of talking and the movie proceeds at its own slow pace.<br/><br/>The story is inspired by the real person ""Burt Munro"". The movie is about a 67 year old, generally-poor motorcycle rider in late 1950s New Zealand. He wants to set a speed record with his old, streamlined Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The story is about his journey to get to the Flats.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on his charming personality and interactions with people. However, it is slow and is not really clear (during the movie) whether he is trying to set a personal record or a world record. He is in fact trying to set a world record that for ""sub 1000cc"" motorcycles. <br/><br/>It would have been helpful to know this during the movie, as well as what point the record would be broken. Things were happening in the movie - and I didn't know what to make of them because there was not enough information.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an action/adventure movie about breaking speed records, look elsewhere. However, if you are interested in a decent character drama with a pleasant cast of characters and don't care about understanding the ""speed record"" aspect, this could be a decent choice."
"heroineworshipper","10","1","1","20 November 2007"," Obviously not American but excellent story
","Americans would have just bought the motorcycle from China and paid a Mexican to ride it. No wonder this movie was never a hit in old U. Know. Where.. Fabricating pistons from molten metal, stripping tire treads with a kitchen knife, trying to break speed records for 1000cc motorcycles, it's definitely New Zealand material. It takes a certain mentality to relate to it.<br/><br/>Definitely refreshing to hear Anthony Hopkins speak something other than British, but the real Burt was much skinnier. There's no way Anthony Hopkins could have fit on that motorcycle or gotten over 55mph. You would think in this age of premium value for visual continuity, the critics would have picked up on that one.<br/><br/>The story is definitely not 100% factual. Burt visited Bonneville many years before the ride depicted in the movie. Wish the ending had more punch instead of fizzling out, but all you have to do is stop watching it before the ending to get the same effect."

","What a heart-warming, life-assuring and valuable film. It left me feeling utterly privileged to have met Burt Munro. The film leaves you a much wiser person. This is how films should be. It is about one man's determination, hand in hand with his Scout Indian motorcycle. An incredible portrayal of a single man, and in actual fact, equally as much a portrayal of a single motorcycle. To me the Scout Indian motorcycle is personified and is as much a personality as Burt Munro is. They feed each other with their strengths; they are each other's oxygen and are inseparable. I see these two as a parallel being dependent on each other, where they both take a similar course. I.e. by starting out younger then growing older with the necessary repairs that take place during the process of aging and pursuing a goal.<br/><br/>Unorthodoxy is a key word  Burt's personality is unorthodox, the bike is unorthodox and Burt's methods of repairing his cycle are unorthodox. The culture shock aspect of the film, namely the contrasts between New Zealand and USA are hilarious, and remind me of the culture shock aspect in the film Crocodile Dundee.<br/><br/>There is a long ""string of pearls"" to describe Burt. He is unpretentious, unprejudiced, moral, authentic, true to himself, a fatalist, an individual, a super enthusiast, charming, inquisitive, has a colourful personality, can laugh things off oozing wisdom as opposed to naivety, has an appreciative sense of humour, can at any time maintain his equilibrium, lives his passion but most of all I loved how he won everyone's heart. With his charm and nonchalance he got himself out of every, and I mean every, predicament, trial and tribulation he came across, and believe me there were many.<br/><br/>His life wisdom, philosophy and passion show us resources we can personally learn a lot from. For instance Burt's quote: ""You live more in five minutes on this bike than others do in a lifetime"". He teaches us how to make a dream come true without exploiting others in the process. He is such an excellent example of a person having faith in and respecting himself, as well as others and the World.<br/><br/>The neighbour's son Tom is a lucky boy to have had him as a mentor and model. I couldn't help wondering how the real Tom has benefited from having known the real Burt Munro. The real Tom as well as Aaron Murphy, who plays the role of Tom. What a privilege for the real Tom to have personally known this man, but also Aaron Murphy having gotten to know Burt Munro indirectly with Anthony Hopkins' vivid portrayal of this man. It must have almost felt like ""the real thing""."

"extravaluejotter","8","1","1","28 December 2006"," A Real Boy's Own Adventure Tale
","My only criticism of ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is the usual one for films ""based on"" true events. Roger Donaldson's screenplay buggers up the chronology of Burt Munro's speed career at Bonneville, borrowing from various incidents over a period of years to make up a good story. I'm sure that Donaldson has exaggerated or made up what happened away from the Utah salt flats as well, but the film is still a credible tribute to a little-known hero from New Zealand. Burt Munro was a DIY engineer and biker whose 1921 Indian motorcycle still holds a speed record that he set in 1967. Not bad for a vintage bike, fettled by a guy who made all the tuning parts in his shed.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is on superb form as Burt Munro and is well supported by the rest of the cast. This is very much Hopkins' movie and he shines in the role. <br/><br/>A special mention goes to the film's special effects team for their work on recreating Munro's high speed runs on his venerable Indian bike. There is a real feeling of speed in these sequences and I was genuinely thrilled by them. <br/><br/>Forget my criticism about its historical accuracy and watch this film. If you're not smiling by the end, there's no hope for you."

","Look back over the career of Anthony Hopkins in IMDb and marvel at the list of characters he has portrayed - such famous and infamous, real and fictional personalities as (in no particular order) Quasimodo, Richard Nixon, Adolf Hitler, Professor van Helsing, Abel Magwitch, Guy Burgess and of course, Hannibal Lecter. There are literally countless others too. Is it any wonder that he is in the pantheon of character actors? In this film, Hopkins portrays another actual person, Burt Munro, an eccentric New Zealand mechanic with a dream to race his Indian motorcycle on the salt flats of Bonneville in Utah, USA.<br/><br/>Director Roger Donaldson takes his audience from sleepy Invercargill at the very south of New Zealand to Speed Week at Bonneville, where everybody and his Indian has arrived to see if they can set some sort of speed record. The early part of the journey is a little too slow for my liking, watching a 68 year-old Burt tangle with bikie gangs, transvestites, thieves and even a couple of sexual conquests thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>The real action starts when Burt arrives in Bonneville. He is penniless, has no support team and nowhere to stay. His bike was made in the 1920s and is the laughing-stock of the speed freaks who have gathered there. He hasn't even pre-registered to race his cycle, and the race officials want to turn him away.<br/><br/>Through the film, Hopkins develops an amiable, persistent, inventive elderly larrikin from Down Under as Burt Munro. He provides a more than passable Southland Kiwi accent, and a genuine wide-eyed wonderment at eventually finding himself at Bonneville, the place he has been dreaming of for 25 years.<br/><br/>The script has some schmaltzy but heart-warming moments, as well as quirky humour which mainly revolves around Burt's eccentricities (watch out for him trimming his toenails with an angle-grinder) and predictable racing action.<br/><br/>The main character is thoughtfully drawn by Hopkins, and while it may not become his greatest ever accomplishment, there is more than enough in this film to enjoy."

"TxMike","Null","1","1","1 August 2006"," The (mostly) true story of Burt Munro and his fastest Indian motorcycle.
","Burt Munro was a real New Zealander born in 1899, and grew up liking motorcycles and racing them successfully. In 1921 he bought a new Indian motorcycle, a 600 cc bike with rather basic technology that had a top speed of maybe 55 mph. But Burt loved to tinker, and over the years he owned it he kept making changes to give the bike a higher top speed. While still running in New Zealand in the 1950s had gotten up into the 130s. By the time he went over 200 miles per hour at Utah Salt Flats during Speed Week, the little 600 cc engine with side valves had grown to almost 1000 cc with modern overhead cams and state of the art innards.<br/><br/>This movie, starring Anthony Hopkins as Burt Munro, expands on one particular slice of Munro's life - 1962 when he first packaged up his Indian and worked his way to California as a cook on a cargo ship. Totally unprepared for what faced him in the USA, the film shows how he used his charm and ingenuity to get a car, build a trailer, and haul his Indian to Utah. But he neglected a minor detail -- you had to pre-register to make a speed run. For Burt Munro, just another minor obstacle to work around.<br/><br/>The movie takes license with chronology. In the movie he goes over 200 miles per hour on his very first trip when, in fact, he didn't get that fast until several years and several trips later. I suspect other facts were combined or compressed to allow an interesting movie in under 2 hours.<br/><br/>But overall it is a superb movie, more about Burt Munro the man than about the Indian and how fast it could go. Anthony Hopkins was of similar age as Burt Munro in the 1960s, and does a super job in this movie. The DVD has some interesting extras including quite a bit of footage of the real Burt Munro in his 60s or 70s.<br/><br/>Sept 2012 edit: Just watched it again after 6 years, I enjoyed it as much the second time. Very good movie."
"MrVibrating","9","1","1","24 July 2006"," The best feel-good movie of the 00s.
","Feel-good movies very often turn preachy, unbelievable or simply annoying. The great movie Rainman has one moment when it really balances on the edge of ""too much""; when Raymond lets his head hang on Tom Cruises after the hearing. Maybe it's in our nature; we cannot really believe that everything ends well with no-one getting killed or hurt in some way.<br/><br/>That's why World's Fastest Indian is such an achievement. It is a biopic, but it contains basically no huge obstacles and dangers for our hero to pass. There's no-one tragically getting killed or dying for the sake of the plot, there's no villain or nemesis, basically none of the elements most movies have today to create an exciting story.<br/><br/>What we do have is Anthony Hopkins in a role so far away from Hannibal he's forever on my list of really great actors. He's charming, he's a rascal, he's the kind of guy you'd want as a grandpa. On his trip he shows that a kind word and a smile get's you a lot further than threats of lawsuits or violence. It all feels realistic and Hopkins character is never naive; he simply knows that being himself is the right way. Few movies can boast such a happy and constructive view without the hero seeming super-naturally friendly and trusting.<br/><br/>Acting is wonderful throughout the movie. Cinematography is great, from the dunes of New Zeeland beaches to the salt flats in Nevada, it's a beautiful movie to watch. The dialog's snappy and takes you for a linguistic tour from under down under to the real hicksvilles of Amurica. The event the movie's based on, the big race, is also a nice piece of movie-making.<br/><br/>In closing, I recommend this movie to basically everyone. It'll melt a big chunk of cynicism out of you, and we all need that these days."
"Rave-Reviewer","7","1","1","6 June 2006"," Some slow reels about fast wheels
","Whatever image comes to mind on reading the title of this film, know that the 'Indian' is an extraordinarily designed motorcycle of the 1920s, emanating from Springfield, Mass. With its body mouldings and low-slung position for the driver it resembles more a coffin on wheels than a conventional bike, and it occupies the mythic sort of ground one equates with such screen antecedents as Herbie the VW beetle, Indiana Jones's whip or, more obscurely, James Caan's sidearm in El Dorado: old-fashioned and crude it may appear, but we know in the audience that it's going to wipe the board. It is, I suppose, a character in the film on the same footing as its enthusiastic and loving owner, Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins). Set in the early 60s, the film tells of Munro's realization of his long-held ambition to attend Speed Week on the Bonneville salt flats, Death Valley, and see what his bike can really do when it is opened up. Naturally there is no end of obstacles that attend this quixotic mission, and naturally no one (except us) expects him to set a new world record. Writer/director Roger Donaldson, returning to New Zealand after a patchy career in Hollywood, sets a leisurely pace, clearly relishing a project close to his heart, while Hopkins, a well publicized solo driver and appreciator of wide open spaces, throws himself into the role: he cries, he dances for joy, he gives off that shout of a laugh that he has, he does everything except master the New Zealand accent (which slips at times into Cockney or Welsh). Whether he is melting down old parts to make new pistons for his bike, filing down his toenails with a power tool or overcoming prostate problems by washing down ground dog's bones (an Indian, as in Native American, remedy he tries in desperation), we believe in this chap and his overriding passion, his willingness to live in a garage and burn the skin of his calf to fulfil a dream. Probably we've all met someone like him; secretly we would like to be him. Of course before he can overcome prostate and heart problems, financial difficulties, a fragile, temperamental, not to mention unsafe, motorcycle, and general ignorance of the North American way of doing things, he must first convince an awful lot of people that he is actually a good egg. And if I had one criticism of the film it would be the finely stacked odds that determine how most of the time the people he meets are sympathetic to his cause, prepared to go the extra yard for him and, in the women's case, take him to their hearts. Some of us like our 'feelgood' messages a little less candy-wrapped than here, but nevertheless the image of Munro hurtling across the floor of Death Valley at approaching 200mph is one that will be with me for a long time, and that's because, like him, we've been made to earn it."
"steve_collier21","8","1","1","27 March 2006"," Steers clear of excessive sentimentality
","This was a moving story, which resonates with one's sense of growing older and of pursuing a goal against apparently long odds. It was reminiscent of another good film, the ""Straight Story,"" similar in that an old codger is mechanically adept enough to permit him to fulfil a long-held dream in spite of the apparent handicaps of his immediate environment.<br/><br/>It took quite some while for me to get used to Hopkins' New Zealand accent. I couldn't say whether it accurate or not, but it sounded more like Gloucestershire to me. Maybe he has actually aged a lot since the last film I saw of his? He played a very convincing old fella who knows how to do what he needs to do to achieve his ambition (several times, we are told in the closing credits). The community where he lives is ultimately supportive, and the era is beautifully recreated visually.<br/><br/>The film ended rather abruptly, but with the benefit that the time available for excessive mawkishness and sentimentality was restricted"

","The movie name is funny but the quality of the work by Anthony Hopkins is as expected from a legend. An inspirational story, this one is a must watch. He is old, fat and poor, yet he lives only to pursue his dream. Scenes of interaction with his neighbor's son, scenes where he is ridiculed for his dream and scenes where his charm wins over people whom he interacts with in America are some of the highlights of the movie. He is 70 and there is no one who can match his screen presence. The movie could have been a notch better had they shown some moments in the life of Burt Munro at a younger age. But then again, who do you get to play a young Anthony Hopkins. Overall it's a nicely shot movie with an inspiring story and a heart warming performance by Anthony Hopkins."
"xehod","8","1","1","17 March 2006"," Inspiring underdog adventure... Highly recommended
","It appears for director Roger Donaldson the key to success is to work with Anthony Hopkins. The World's Fastest Indian was their second collaboration after Hopkins starred in the wonderful 1984 movie The Bounty (with Mel Gibson). And let me say, this movie is a real treat.<br/><br/>The story is based of the true story of an aging (and ailing) New Zealander named Burt Munro. Hopkins does a captivating job portraying Munro as an eccentric man obsessed with nothing but taking his 45 year old Indian motorcycle to the Bonneville Salt Flats in the US to an annual racing event. Over the years he has tinkered with the motorcycle, pouring his own metal parts for the engine and shaving the treads off the old tires to make them 'run better in high velocity'. Munro is certainly a man who lives and breaths racing and seems determined above all else to achieve his goal.<br/><br/>The movie follows his adventures from trying to raise enough money to make the trip, to his being forced to be a cook on the ship to get to America. He meets many friends along the way and has many setbacks. But what is so charming is his undying determination and blind optimism. He never once loses faith and by the end of the movie, you will come to really feel for the man.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.

","It hasn't been released in Australia as yet, however I had the fortune to be in New Zealand in December last year and watched this movie on the qantas plane on the way home. My Mother and Father had watched the movie while we were in NZ and I had wanted to see it on the big screen while I was there. Unfortunately I ran out of time and thought I'd have to wait until it was released in Aussie. I couldn't believe my luck when it appeared on the Airplane movie feature. I really enjoyed the movie and I guess I might be biased because my father is the president of our cities Restored Motorcyle club and I've been around old bikes and the characters that ride and restore them all my life. My father especially was so taken with this film, his club has organised the pre-release screening at the local cinema and they are volunteering a few Indians to the cinema to promote the movie. If the lady that wrote the above comment reads this, I can guarantee you that a group of vintage / restored motorcycle club men and women would love to hear more about Bert and your husbands friendship with him. Let me know if you'd welcome any communication."

Its about this old guy who has spent years rebuilding this old bike called an Indian and before he dies its his wish to see how fast he can get this bike to go. So he travels all the way from New Zealander to Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats in America which is where they have these official speed trials every year and enters his bike after it is initial deemed unsafe. But after some wangling he gets it in and breaks the land-speed world record and it is a true story which you would never believe because the guy was so poor he lived in a shed and he was up against these professional racing teams.

"majic-5","8","1","1","4 March 2006"," Speed, charm, and glee
","Few actors/actresses can consistently disappear into their characters. Anthony Hopkins, who plays Munro, is one of them. In fact, the only times I've been truly disappointed with Hopkins is when he plays someone normal, like an FBI agent (Bad Company) or a kindly old man (Hearts in Atlantis). Make him a psychotic ventriloquist (Magic), an eccentric painter (Surviving Picasso), a paranoid president (Nixon) or a cannibal (Silence of the Lambs), and he's riveting. It's on the strength of Hopkins' characterization of the quirky, obsessed, yet down-to-earth Munro that this film succeeds. This is a movie with heart and charm. It makes you feel good about our species without getting overly sentimental  a rare feat.<br/><br/>Munro is the type of guy that Americans lionize: the entrepreneur, the engineer, the man who sticks with his vision, year after year, in the face of ridicule. Yet few Americans would put up with Munro's flip side: engine tests at the crack of dawn, any day of the week; an unkempt yard made of weeds and grass gone to seed; only a basic grasp of the social graces. Luckily for the audience, Munro's neighbors are fairly tolerant of Burt.<br/><br/>In addition to being about Burt's mission, the movie is also about Burt's marvelous road trip to Bonneville. Funded by his community, Burt sets gamely off on his journey without a firm grasp of American import regulations, American culture, and the rules of Bonneville's ""Speed Week."" Unburdened by these constraints, Burt solves one challenge after another  mechanical, social, and financial  as they come, with resourcefulness and grace.<br/><br/>The scenes at the Bonneville Salt Flats make this movie worth seeing in the theater. I can't imagine getting the same sensation of speed and accompanying adrenaline rush from even a 54-inch screen.<br/><br/>Hopkins has said that this film is it's the best thing he's ever done, and while I could quibble, I couldn't argue with the grin on my face and euphoria inside as I left the theater."
"Chris_Docker","7","1","1","28 February 2006"," Comfort & speed
","Souping up his handmade speed racer motorbike, Anthony Hopkins (playing an aging Burt Munro) sets about making a land speed record in the 1960s. This gently-paced movie radiates charm throughout and picks up tension in the final race at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. Hopkins seems authentic as a New Zealander, and the script gives him plenty of room to crack typical Kiwi jokes. Sets have been lovingly re-created and the culture clash when he comes to America comes across well. Given the paucity of strong elderly icons in cinema, this one does well. It's a movie that, if it doesn't exactly blow your socks off, is one you can curl up for and enjoy with the whole family. Let me just get my cocoa . . ."

Years ago he did a Aussie film, The Efficiency Expert (had a different name in Australia), and I loved his character.<br/><br/>Was shocked to see a trailer for the movie during the Super Bowl. They must have blown the budget because I have not seen any other ads on TV. I hope word of mouth is happening for this wonderful movie. You don't have to be a motorcycle nut to enjoy this film, it's just a great underdog story.<br/><br/>I read on this site that someone questioned Americans being so nice to a stranger, but remember this was back in the 60's and if you've ever met a New Zealander you can't help but like them. Wonderful, warm and friendly people. I'd take one home any day! Gather your friends and family and go to this movie, especially anyone 60 or older."

Anyone ever hear of anyone melting aluminum and casting their own pistons? I hadn't until the movie - and apparently it is all true.<br/><br/>He reminded me a bit of the Christopher Lloyd character (Dr. Brown) in the Back to the Future series - coming up with simple solutions to complex problems and the solutions coming from places no one had thought of before.<br/><br/>Well, in fact, I knew a fellow a bit like Burt - from England - who was an extraordinary mechanic - but even he didn't make his own pistons.<br/><br/>One other thing - when Burt gets to Long Beach (did he really sail across the Pacific on a ship that small?) - anyway he reminded me a bit of the Paul Hogan character in Crocodile Dundee - naive but kind to the ""city slickers"" but they still don't ""pull the wool over his eyes"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed the photography of the Salt Flats - the sunrise picture - and the ""vintage"" vehicles there - including Mickey Thompson's...<br/><br/>Someone mentioned that this was a ""chick flick for guys"" - I can say that both genders should enjoy it.<br/><br/>Bill"
"wkushner","9","1","1","20 February 2006"," Hopkins' greatest performance in years
","This film is about the story of Burt Munro, who has dreamed of going to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah to test how fast his 1920 motorcycle would go. He ended up setting a new land speed record. This movie is basically the Anthony Hopkins show and it is his best performance since ""Hearts in Atlantis."" He has always played these guys who are repressed and evil (and he's played them well), but this guy is more happy go lucky and follows through on his dreams. Hopkins should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance, but he didn't. Roger Donaldson directed Tony in ""The Bounty"" in 1984 and Tony did not work well with him. This time, though, it works and clicks. The guy knew the real Munro and actually did a documentary on him before he died. You could tell that Donaldson and Hopkins worked well together to create a good story. And that's what this film is about. It's a great story with a great actor in it. See this movie!!!"
"rpawliko","8","1","1","20 February 2006"," Cudos to Anthony Hopkins
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it was pretty much all Anthony Hopkins. A wonderful characterization of a classic character - the old eccentric, nearing the sunset of his life, get's one last chance to realize his dream, and through shear tenacity, and a bit of ingenuity, he triumphs.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but think of my father and the men of his generation (the WWII vets). A shade tree mechanic, my father seemed like he could fix damn near anything with a pocket knife, some wire, a curse, and a prayer.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie, there are some moments that I felt the script writer doing a bit too much ""emotional button pushing"", when there was no need. In the end, I wanted to know a few more details (for example, what was the speed record that was set?), and the movie ends just to a little too quick for my taste. I wanted just a couple more minutes with the character - but it's always better to leave the audience wanting more than overwork the material.<br/><br/>A good story, well told, with a great lead actor. Everyone was smiling when we left the theater. Pay the ticket, get your popcorn, and settle back for a very entertaining couple of hours."
"devilducatigirl","8","1","1","20 February 2006"," Time to worship the speed gods
","This film is an ode to those who worship the motorcycle gods. A man's undying dedication to his motorcycle, provides a great tribute to those of us devoted to being on two wheels. The film is a good window into the kindness of people and those who help us along our path to greatness. I think this film really hits a note on never giving up on what you love and portrays the independent character of motorcyclists. The people are interesting and colorful along the way. The movie is a true feel good movie, which is nice in the environment of all the violent and very heavy topics that have appeared. It's a good break from the troubles of the world and shows that the little guy can come out ahead; the dark horse can win and so on. Anthony Hopkins is great as the eccentric New Zealander, Burt Munro. He sort of reminds you of curmudgeon grandfather or the crazy and fun older uncle that got you into dirt bikes. The film is worth seeing and it's great to see films on the motorcycle theme and the hardcore dedication of bikers everywhere."
"steve-2590","8","1","1","15 February 2006"," Very entertaining
","I was attracted to this film because my cousin had an Indian motorcycle and I have a '66 BSA. I like old bikes and old bike stories, so my wife and I decided to ""have a go at it"".<br/><br/>From the start, one knew that the old codger, Burt Munro, played by Anthony Hopkins, had something going for him. Why else would he fire up his racing motorcycle at 3 AM and, apparently uncaring, rev it up and up and up, much to his neighbors' chagrin. As the plot develops, however, you are pulled in, through his understated style, to caring about his character very much. His interaction with the young neighbor boy is especially good and reminded me of the way my grandfather treated me...a mixture of love and disdain.<br/><br/>Rather than going through the entire plot line, though, let me just say that this is the first movie in many years in which I haven't been the only person laughing out loud, cheering and applauding at the end. Most of those who were in our viewing really got into it. It was fun! The movie was really quite wonderful and my wife and I have been talking about it ever since. During the racing scenes, I had to keep reminding myself to breathe. It was very exciting!<br/><br/>All in all, I think it's a great movie, but probably one that will not receive much critical acclaim...not enough sex and violence for critics' palates, I suppose."

","I saw this film last night and am still thinking about it. I have no idea why this movie was not heavily advertised and why Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Burt Munro did not gather Oscar buzz. The movie was well written and beautifully directed. The scenes that take place on the Bonniville Salt Flats are especially striking-the bright colors of the speed vehicles (including the Indian) set against the ubiquitous white salt. I can't recommend this movie enough. Anthony Hopkins performance was so mesmerizing, so real, that I almost forgot I was watching and actor play Burt Munro - as his portrayal encompasses every little detail, from being hard of hearing to his stammering, scanning speech. Wow. After a year characterized by high budget, outlandish, risqué, and boring cinema (it's no surprise box office numbers are down) this movie was a refreshing sojourn."
"zenflydad","9","1","1","3 February 2006"," A ""Must See"" Film for Anyone who Enjoys Real Life Drama
","I was first alerted to this film by a piece written in the January issue of Cycle World magazine by Editor-in-Chief, David Edwards. In it he describes his experience of talking his wife into going to the Hollywood premiere. She was reluctant until learning that Sir Anthony ""Hannibal The Cannibal"" Hopkins, not only starred in the film, but also would be in attendance at the gala. Intrigued by any main stream film that has at its core some correlation with one of my favorite passions, tantalized by the prospect of someone of Hopkin's stature lending his considerable talent to the project, and ""hooked"" by learning that the subject of this film was a real-life countryman of mine (I am originally from Taumarunui, New Zealand), I immediately put ""The World's Fastest Indian"" on the top of my ""Must See"" list. Last night, I got my opportunity. A local Portland motorcycle club with their own Bonneville Salt Flats aspirations (their project streamliner was on display down in front of the seating area in the theater) hosted a Special Benefit screening at a local theater last night for a highly partisan crowd of the fans of two-wheeled transport. Many of these riders were either wearing their leathers, or carrying helmets into the theater. I even met a fellow Kiwi inside who hailed from Nelson (on NZ's South Island)! We are everywhere! I was accompanied by a long time female friend who had also gone with me to that wonderful South American ""road movie"" about Che Guevarra's life changing trip with his friend on an old battered Norton motorcycle, ""The Motorcycle Diaries."" So how did this movie stack up? In a word, ""wonderful!"" Anthony Hopkins' performance is magnificent; the story of an eccentric back yard tinkerer and his obsessive quest to run a collection of cobbled together bits and pieces of mostly fabricated disparate parts into a record challenging two wheeled rocket nothing short of mesmerizing; and his quixotic adventures with the characters he meets along the the long road to Bonneville from halfway around the world completely takes the viewer in. By the time Munro arrives at the fabled locus of Speed and anoints it by peeing on the salt...we are at last where we all want to be: with Burt Munro and his amazing Indian motorcycle. I won't tell you anything more, except...see this movie! Oh...and take your wife, or your girlfriend. She will love it!"

"jandcmcq","1","9","31","1 July 2008"," Crocodile Dundee Meets Eddie the Eagle in Utah
","As quite an avid fan of Anthony Hopkin's work this film descends to many surprising lows for me like: <br/><br/>1. It must be the worst film he has ever appeared in.<br/><br/>2. It has to be his most awful attempt at an accent which I believe was supposed to be New Zealand (but sounded like a cross between Yorkshire, Australian, Cornish and a bit of his natural tongue - Welsh). OK, Burt Munro also had a funny accent but hardly any-one knows that so why not keep it simple and don't confuse the audience.<br/><br/>3. I know biographies are normally as dull as dishwater but this is the corniest and most predictable plot (if you could say there was a plot) I have ever seen in movies. Just about every scene is as subtle as Crocodile Dundee in New York or Eddie the Eagle on the ski slopes. Mr Director, you do not have to ram the points you are trying to make down the viewer's throat  try reading Jane Austen. I am sure that we could have us worked out Burt Munro's character without the ""Wiggles"" type scenes spelling it out for us time after time after time after time.<br/><br/>4. I am giving this movie one star purely for the dedication of the petrol heads at Utah in the final scenes when the action actually woke you up and made you take some notice. I am sorry but if director Roger Donaldson worked with Anthony Hopkins on ""The Bounty"" in 1984 he hasn't learned one tenth of what his Captain Bligh has."

","I had the distinct pleasure of seeing this movie last night and will say that it is the best movie I've seen this year, and I've seen an awful lot of movies this year. Hopefully come Oscar season the Academy will not only reward Anthony Hopkins for his fantastic performance but also the filmmakers for making such a quality picture. This is a movie that really can appeal to anyone, and I'd imagine it would be only the coldest, most soulless person out there who wouldn't be touched by this story. It is the true life story of Burt Munro's fulfillment of his life-long desire to travel from the southern tip of New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah to speed test his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle just to see how fast he could get it to go. He really was a guy who came out of left field and astounded everyone around him with what he accomplished, and it is a truly incredible story that makes for a fantastic movie. If you're looking for something to entertain you and lift your spirits, this is the movie for you. And even though it is much in the same vein as virtually any ""underdog"" feature, it manages to avoid feeling manipulative at all because of how earnest it is, just like Burt Munro.<br/><br/>Peter Hallinan stated his displeasure with the fact that only people from ""down under"" had commented on this movie, and I wanted to say that is because the movie is a long way from being released here in the US. They will run it in a few theaters for a week in mid-December, but it won't actually get full release here until February of 2006. I plan to go back and see it when it does open because I enjoyed it so much, and also so I can contribute to the film's box office and do my small part to make it a success because I feel it deserves it."

Everyone know the immortal Dr Lecter yet you can watch Hopkins playing the amiable Burt Munro without thoughts of The Lambs ever crossing your mind.

I cry like a little boy every time I watch Field of Dreams, I'm inspired every time Rocky beats Apollo Creed, and so on. The funny thing is, none of these movies are in my film library which boasts over 500 titles. This realization dawned on me after I finished watching 2005's The World's Fastest Indian, a flawed but inspiring telling of the incredible true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins).<br/><br/>Munro was a 68 year old New Zealander who ventured by sea to the USA with the goal of setting a land speed record on his antique Indian motorcycle. Many of the clichÃ©s characteristic of underdog stories are in place (too old, too poor, too many odds stacked against, etc.), yet despite the all-too-familiar aspects present in WFI, it works exceptionally well. While WFI might be open to criticism for not setting Munro up against more dire obstacles on his journey, the obstacles present take on a less conventional role of being used to not only show the resilience of the human spirit, but also how charitable our fellow men/women are towards people who dare to dream big. Munro was an inspiring man and what makes his story worth telling isn't just what he does to inspire, it's what others do for him as a result of being inspired by Munro.<br/><br/>Without being overly sentimental, WFI celebrates ingenuity, determination and most of all, human compassion towards one's neighbor. What exactly it was about WFI that hadn't inspired me to see it before remains a question as unanswerable as why I don't have any other inspiring underdog stories in my movie library. Perhaps I'm a little embarrassed to admit I'm a sucker for less than perfect films that make me cry like a little boy. Waaaaaaah!"

","The true story of Burt Monro, a man who travels to America from New Zealand to attempt to break the fastest speed record on his 1920's Indian motorcycle.<br/><br/>What can you say about Anthony Hopkins? The man is simply indescribable. If you have ever seen Silence of the Lambs, you wouldn't believe it was the same actor starring as Burt Monro in this 2005 picture. Hopkins captures the essence of a man who changed the speeding of all motorcycles in the 60's. Hopkins swift and charming elegance is exquisite in capturing Monro's personality and to this day, I am still baffled as to why Hopkins wasn't at least Oscar nominated performance.<br/><br/>Though Hopkins is exceptional in the central role, the star of this picture is Monro. This man went through hell and back and defied all odds to reach his destination. The sheer determination to do what you've wanted for your entire life is a true testament to the human spirit and is beautifully moving. The fact that Monro kept pushing despite his drawbacks makes him a real life hero and a man anyone in the world can look up to.<br/><br/>Based on Monro's life story, director Donaldson is able to create that realism to bring the story to life. Fast and smart shots are used for the riding sequences, encoded with some wonderful music makes some heart warming memorable moments. There isn't as much bike riding as many hoped for, but when there is, it is heart stopping excitement, The screenplay is very concise and contains all the important information to achieve the ultimate effect in helping achieve and recognizing Monro's passage and achievements.<br/><br/>There are many twists and turns in the narrative, executed in a strong realistic effect to gain the ultimate shock, brining the viewer to reality. The drama and use of everyday issues brings us into the picture and we can identify with the central character.<br/><br/>There is a consistent likability about this film as well as the strong realistic drama. Humour is encoded to create light hearted moments, such as burning lawns, peeing on lemon trees and arguing with cab drivers. A smile will be planted on your face whenever you see Hopkins on screen with a complete stranger.<br/><br/>Hopkins performance is one of the finest of his career with an elegant charm in a well written plot which is significantly important to any one who abides by rules"

","After the comments that were circulating on the internet a year or so ago (inaccuracies etc.) I passed on this title, but after learning that The Bank Job was directed by Roger Donaldson I decided that The World's Fastest Indian was worth checking out.<br/><br/>I have to hand it to Donaldson he does know how to put an entertaining film together, and in the case of this film the less you know about it before seeing it the better. I was surprised to learn that it was a low budget film but from the cast, 60's setting and cinematography you wouldn't know it. There was no denouement though which was a mistake in my opinion (Donaldson says this was to avoid sentimentality but it seems more like he had to keep the film under 2 hours), it's the only departure from the otherwise fine storytelling on display throughout.<br/><br/>Regarding Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Burt Munro, I saw the 1971 documentary on the DVD and apart from a lack of physical similarity, he portrays Munro as borderline autistic whereas the real Munro came across as a tinkerer, someone with callouses on his hands who spent all of his time doing practical tasks (like a farmer, say).<br/><br/>I think what I will take away from the film will be the sequences shot on the Bonneville Salt Flats (the mountainous setting looks great) and Munro's achievement in building an extremely fast machine on a New Zealand pensioner's salary. It is deflating somewhat to learn that Munro was a frequent traveller to the USA (he visited ten times) and only started competing there when a local time trial held on a public road in Christchurch was discontinued.<br/><br/>Like I said the less you know about the film beforehand the better and even if it is loosely based on real events it's still a good film starring the dependable Anthony Hopkins."
"MartinHafer","8","0","0","25 December 2007"," For a little film, it's quite engaging
","This is not the sort of film you'd expect from Anthony Hopkins. First, the aging British actors plays a New Zealander and second, he's a fearless speed demon with his heavily modified motorcycle! This is about as far from REMAINS OF THE DAY or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as you can get and it was nice to see Hopkins (who was pushing 70) try such an unusual role in an independent picture.<br/><br/>Despite the title, the movie is not about people from India or American Indians--or even people from Indiana or Indianapolis! The ""Indian"" in the title is a reference to the defunct Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Plant and its cycles of the first half of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>The story is a basically true story (with a few changes and omissions) of how New Zealander Burt Munro was able to get his heavily modified motorcycle to the Bonneville Salt Flats and set land speed records for a 1000cc motorcycle--even though by this point he was in his 60s.<br/><br/>The story unfolds very slowly--something that might annoy younger and action-oriented audiences. Instead of focusing just on the record-breaking attempt, much of the movie is a ""road film""--as Hopkins comes to America and slowly makes his way to Utah. Along the way, he meets a lot of odd characters, though the oddest one is probably Munro himself! In many ways, its reminiscent of THE STRAIGHT STORY and other slice of life films--one where characters and their quirks are more the story than their actual deeds. As a result of the style, it almost feels as if you are a passenger on Munro's journey as opposed to you seeing a movie.<br/><br/>By the way, like almost every bio-pic, this one twists the real story just a bit--consolidating some events, omitting many (Munro was a father and grandfather--while in the movie, he seems to be all alone) and intensifying the drama.

","I was afraid of this film somehow, afraid of a tough disappointment. Then I watched it finally and, much to my surprise, got really nice two hours.<br/><br/>Dr. Lecter brings his best form, the side characters are cute, speed of the passing events is just perfect, one does not get bored at all.<br/><br/>The only thing which made me a bit confused is the reconciliation of the senile grandpa with the guy who taps every single old chick on the way. I mean I do not doubt his inner youth (who else would go for 300 km/h at the age of 68?! - as a funny remark, Burt in '67 and Hopkins at the time the movie was shot were of the same age), but still, sometimes I didn't feel the strongest coherence between these two personalities. Maybe a Gemini? Anyway.<br/><br/>The other interesting phenomenon is the helpfulness of every single person on the way. I was waiting for a punch, some difficulties, but didn't get much more than the wheel of the trailer flies away and the housing of the rocket gets dirty. Oh, God. Dunno, I've never been to Utah, but those parts of the World I visited so far didn't show a complete agreement with this picture... It's true that in the sixties everyone might have been on an acid trip and I was not even in the plan yet.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good road movie (reminds me pretty much of The Straight Story) with low mistakes, I can only advise to everyone.

The character he plays is totally convincing, a somewhat lovable eccentric, who devotes his time to building and perfecting this Indian ""motorsiccle"" (as he calls it). Part of the enjoyment is seeing him meeting various people along the way, some who want to help him, others who want to make things difficult. But he overcomes them with his Invercargill charms.

","""The World's Fastest Indian"" has two main characters: A man and a motorcycle. If Burt Munro - the eccentric New Zealander for whom the movie is about - had been the actor in this saga, I believe he would have insisted that his motorcycle get top billing.<br/><br/>One man's improbable, unyielding quest to accomplish his dream is at the heart of this heartwarming film. Burt Munro was a real person and the events of the movie are based on real events (with a few liberties taken). Briefly, the backyard tinkerer living near the bottom of the world set out to set the land speed record with a 45-year-old motorcycle held together by things such as a door hinge and a cork.<br/><br/>I, of course, have never met Burt, but watching Anthony Hopkins absorb his life makes me feel that I know him as well as his friends, neighbors and fans across the world did.<br/><br/>Hopkins is perfect as the 68-year-old coot who charms his way through life simply by being himself. People are enamored of him; the man seems to be totally without guile.<br/><br/>Though some may liken this to a fish-out-of-water tale such as Crocodile Dundee, that is an unfair comparison. Burt is out of his element in the United States, yes, but he is also a bit out of place in his Down Under hometown. He may be an eccentric of sorts, but he is impossible to dislike.<br/><br/>I admit: I have a weak spot for uplifting movies about real people doing extraordinary things.

""Inspiring"" might be the most appropriate word to describe this beautiful story, where Anthony Hopkins really shines and gives so much depth to his interesting character. Roger Donaldson's direction is elegant and effective, but never calls attention to itself. The story, plotted out as a road-movie, is filled with charming moments and fine dialog.

The casting could not have been better, being an Anthony Hopkins fan, I feel no one else could have as effectively played the starring role. Most of the movie deals with cultural nuances and the nontraditional life of Burt Munro (and to some degree his dead brother Ernie of all names). Burt is a single minded man's man, and he will not accept defeat in any form.

","The World's Fastest Indian is a slice-of-life biopic with elements of road movie about Burt Munro, a New Zealander who travels to Utah in order to break a speed record on his motorcycle called Indian. I usually disapprove of predictable biopics of which the main purpose is to glorify the main character. However, The World's Fastest Indian achieves a level of which other biopics' creators can only dream (I'm thinking about Ron Howard among others right now). Namely, this movie has a charm and wonderful message that age really doesn't matter when you have a passion for anything you adore. Burt Munro is depicted as a saintly, spotless old man who delights every person he meets with grace. In this respect the film resembles Lynch's The Straight Story. I would lie if I wrote that naivety of Donaldson's movie didn't annoy me at times, but through most of the flick I support Munro in his road to success. The credit for this goes to Sir Anthony Hopkins whose amazing performance in this flick is one of the best in his career and in 2005. The cinematography and dessert scenery are delightful. In addition, thanks to good-natured tone the film has a bit fairylike character and funny moments, which I enjoyed. All in all, not only motorcycle fans will adore this picture. Thumbs up."
"nycritic","10","0","0","9 August 2006"," A Remarkable Man: Burt Munro
","There comes a time when an actor who has been known for giving performance after performance that has gone into the levels of classic acting, chooses a project that is smaller, less showy, but equally (or even more) rewarding than if he were involved in an Award-studded affair. Sir Anthony Hopkins is one of those rare actors, who throughout his celebrated, nearly 40 years in the business, has given so many indelible characterizations -- particularly come the Nineties when he immortalized himself as Hannibal Lecter -- that now, as an older man, he's chosen this unassuming story of an equally unassuming man much stronger than what he initially appears.<br/><br/>Burt Munro wouldn't be the type of man you would consider pleasant to be around with. Living in Invercargill, New Zealand, he's fooled around with his favorite motorcycle, whom he's dubbed the Indian (hence the title of the movie), for the past 40 odd-years or so, and has a heart condition that might make you wonder if he weren't better off taking a break. Of course, that is something he won't settle for, and later in the story one man calls him the most determined person he's ever seen. That this minor character does so a world away in Bonneville, and that Munro has gone through a wallop of misadventures just to get there and race his bike, speaks pages about the man.<br/><br/>Much of Munro's life can be researched through the Internet, which makes this a de-facto biopic of a remarkable old fellow, soft spoken, a little dotty, who clearly loves his bike and on his way to race it meets the most interesting variety of characters this way of Weirdsville. Hopkins is the perfect actor to play Munro because he essentially sheds any vestige of his personality and literally becomes this dizzy old man who has a dream and follows it. He's given some pretty extraordinary support by Chris Williams as a transvestite named Tina Washington, Diane Ladd as a widow, Saginaw Grant as an Indian who helps him along the way, Christopher Lawford as a man who somehow believes Munro is the real thing (despite his clear dependence on heart medication), Patrick Flueger as a soldier who shares some stories with Munro, and little Aaron Murphy who plays Tom, the neighbor's son, who might as well be a surrogate boy to Munro. Bruce Greenwood, Paul Rodriguez, and Jessica Cauffiel have small parts which round up the cast.<br/><br/>THE WORLD'S FASTEST Indian is a beautiful movie that went unnoticed (as many high-quality films do when released in limited movie screens) earlier this year, but deserves to be seen and enjoyed for its honesty. Some of the vignettes seem a little too much for the viewer who wants Munro to get to his final destination and make magic with the force of speed, but when you have a project you believe in -- as Munro did, with his precious bike -- you wind up with a end result that is transcendental from its material. Roger Donaldson clearly believes in this man, and has brought forth a truly moving story."

Anthony Hopkins plays Mr. Monroe in what I feel is one of his best roles to date on the big screen. His character in this film is a real gem and his story should leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches film to enjoy themselves. Doubly so if you also happen to be a motorcycle enthusiast, or ( as I have ), spent countless greasy, oily, hours wrenching on motorcycles. I immediately felt connected to this man's story and his amazing accomplishments on this motorcycle.<br/><br/>Above all else, this is a story of an era long gone in this world.

No computers, no C&C mills, no 6 figure engineers to consult, just a few simple tools, a passion and a brilliant mind working theories on what would make something work faster and stronger.<br/><br/>It is men like Burt Monroe that brought us into the modern mechanical world, and in his case the last great work of an age long gone.<br/><br/>Rest in peace old Burt - may your record continue stand!"

","This was a very very entertaining movie that kept you on the edge of your seat during many parts. After we were about half-way into it, I said it was an almost identical plot to ""Schultze Gets The Blues."" (2003). I guess you would call this a ""Quest Movie."" Both men (Burt Munroe and Schultze) are ""foreigners"" (New Zealand and Germany) going to the United States to chase a dream (motorcycle racing and Cajun music). Munroe does have to travel a greater distance than Schultze does. Both men are older and unmarried. They have spent much time thinking about taking their passions to America. Their neighbors/friends like them and overlook their obsessions and quirks because they are generally mild mannered men and good hard working people. They (the neighbors and friends) realize that these men won't be happy until their Quest is over. So they rally around them (literally and figuratively speaking) and send them off because with the men being rather seasoned in age, they might only get one chance at doing this. Both Munroe and Schultze have language difficulties, Schulze obviously having the greatest since he speaks only German. But Munroe has his own, even though he speaks English. I won't say any more than this, but if you watch the two movies you will see the striking similarities. While I am on the subject, I can't think of any female ""Quest"" movies like this, since women in society aren't usually encouraged to traipse across the continent, and the oceans in search of themselves.

","The World's Fastest Indian is NOT a Native American. I was naive enough (when I first saw the title) to believe this might be about that. Oh well. Even so, I wasn't disappointed. Indeed, I was educated. Never having heard of the astounding accomplishment of this aged New Zealander, I now feel honored to have been privy to a man of unique stamina and determination.<br/><br/>Burt Monro is this manone of indeterminate age but obviously old enough to collect his pensionand has been working on his 1920 Indian motorcycle for four decades. His goal is to make it go faster ...and faster ...and faster. But his methods appear substandard. He works (and lives) in a shed without appropriate casting material. His gas cap is a whiskey cork, his brakes non-existent. But Burt has a dream. He wants to set a land-speed record in Bonneville, Utah at the salt flats. Thus our journey begins. But getting from New Zealand to the U.S. is costly and Burt doesn't have much money. So we watch him struggle with finances and dilapidated equipment in order to make his dream a reality. Once in the States, Burt befriends everyone he meets with his easy-going manner and his dogged determination. He runs into crooked car salesmen and horny older women (Burt is somewhat of a ""hound-dog"" himself). But through it all, regardless of where he stops, he has the underlying need to keep moving toward Bonneville. And, finally, he makes it there ...only to be told that he should've registered months ago and can't participate in the speed ceremonies. Crushed beyond words, Burt musters the support of the local speed freaks and finally gets his day on the salt.<br/><br/>And, much to the surprise of the officials (who thought he'd crash and burn or maybe hit 100 miles per hour), Burt accomplishes the impossible: a new land speed record! At one point, his Little-Indian-That-Could went over 200 mph! This is an extremely entertaining film for two basic reasons. First is because it's a human interest story that everyone can identify with: going after your dreams regardless of what others say or how old you are. The second is because of Sir Anthony Hopkins. His performance was the fuel that drove this film. His mannerisms and accent fit Burt Monro's to a tee (you'll discover this if you watch a few of the DVD's extra features).<br/><br/>There were a few blips and bumps in the film (the rapid telling of a relationship with a woman in the U.S. which felt forced for time, etc.), but these were easily overlooked by Mr. Hopkins performance and the incredible story. My hat's off to director Roger Donaldson. His passion for Mr. Monro (and this material) shone through like sun on a silver platter. Nicely done!"

","I first heard of ""The World's Fastest Indian"" from movie trailer websites. I watched the trailer and it caught my attention and mentioned someone named Burt Munro. Who was Burt Munro? A short search later I found a movie that I had to see. That being said, I had built up expectations of what I would see, and thankfully they were all surpassed.<br/><br/>There are not many films out there without ""a bad guy."" This film managed to capture the pure essence of one's dreams, goals, and personal fulfillments. Despite everything thrown at him by the system, Burt Munro through pluck, grace, humor, and hospitality, managed to accomplish his life's dreams. God, how many of us yearn for such a thing to happen to us in life? This is not a film of major action, of special effects, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. It does, however, capture the human spirit and the will for achievement. Rather than turn him away and ignore him, fellow men stop to help an old man and his rickety looking motorcycle. Why? What gain is there for them in terms of physicality? Well, thankfully there was an age when people helped people for the desire to see someone's dreams become a reality, as opposed to helping someone out of personal gain.<br/><br/>The world needs more men like Burt Munro. I'd like to think you will agree after watching an award-winning performance (IMO) by Sir Anthony Hopkins."

","What a great story! Anthony Hopkins does such a tremendous job creating a character that is more likable than any I have seen in a very long time. I was extremely entertained, and just amazed with Burt's friendly personality. I didn't expect this movie to be so good, and my expectations were pleasantly surpassed. I just wish that this film was marketed better. I'd like to have seen more exposure, because I think a lot of people are missing out on this great film. I think it clearly deserved more Oscar consideration as well, for not only Anthony Hopkins, but also for the film itself. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great story that will really warm your heart."

","Lovers of motorcycles and those who haven't ridden yet will thoroughly enjoy this excellent story. Cast with actors whose love for the project shines through every scene, embracing their roles.<br/><br/>Truly, Burt Munro is a lovable character, a human who just seems to love life and who approaches each day with belief in the goodness of people and the greatness of accomplishment, small to large.<br/><br/>This is a movie to watch with your family and friends. It is filled with exhibits of true friendship and honour. It shows meaningful examples of how 'little things' and small achievements have great affect. There are many reminders of the fact that though we live on a planet, sharing space with so much hate, there are, indeed, many wonderful humans out there.<br/><br/>And the best example of friendship shown is the one we see coming from a child, Burt's neighbor in New Zealand, who comes over through a break in the fence. We can learn a lot about love and decency from the pure hearts of children. This is something that Burt always knew.<br/><br/>My husband and I enjoyed a DVD version which included a documentary starring the real Burt, and discovered how faithful the adaptation of his character was portrayed in this superb movie.<br/><br/>Definitely a worthwhile addition to your collection."

","After watching this movie, I'm not sure if Roger Donaldson was deliberately placing scenes in this movie to make me worried something was going to go totally wrong, or if I was just being overly paranoid due to Hollywood making drama wrenched movies.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahoy: When he's racing at the beginning I thought he was going to have a broken leg when he wrecked his bike.<br/><br/>When he set his brush in front of his shed on fire, I thought he was going to set his shed on fire.<br/><br/>When he arrives to the states, I thought the customs agents were going to deny him entry into the country.<br/><br/>When he went to the hotel and put his money belt under the mattress, I thought the maid was going to steal it.<br/><br/>When he went to get his bike, I thought it was going to be crushed. And I also thought the customs agents were going to be to blame.<br/><br/>I thought the transvestite at the hotel was going to be a jerk. I thought the cops that questioned him were going to be jerks. When he lost the wheel to his trailer I thought that was the end for him. When he made it to the salt flats I didn't think he was going to get to race.<br/><br/>I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GONNA BREAK THE RECORD!!!!!!!!! This movie really restored a little chunk of humanity and goodness into my heart. Every time a nice exchange happened between two human beings (especially the police), I smiled. It was from cheek to cheek. It wasn't something that has happened, well, since I think 'Forest Gump' came out.<br/><br/>I'm of the belief that this was done deliberately by Roger Donaldson and I applaud him for that. He made a wonderful movie that can not only be admired by New Zealanders, but by everyone."

","You'll come across so many positive superlatives when reading pretty much any review of this movie. I saw it in the cinema as soon as it came out, and couldn't wait to own a copy. I admit to owning a motorbike, but in truth the bike part of the film is almost incidental; the story is really about a great man, with the kind of will to succeed that perhaps we all wish we could muster. As with all the best movies, it is alternately funny, sad, exhilarating, scary, but always moving and entertaining. Often these days labeling a film as ""family friendly"" can be warning of a mediocre or boring experience, but not with this one. Despite a couple of moderately adult situations, I'd have no hesitation in allowing kids to see it. The theme, the perseverance, the kindness and strength of character displayed, all have much to teach younger viewers - and older ones too!"

","This is a first-rate feel-good movie that entertains, whether or not one is a motorcycle enthusiast. If you're looking for a well-crafted film that's not offensive, but light-hearted and uplifting, this is one ""sleeper"" of a film that fits the bill. It's a shame that it wasn't promoted more aggressively. The story line is taken from the history of New Zealand's Burt Munro, who, in 1967 set a world record land-speed record for streamlined motorcycles...a record that still stands. Courage, persistence, and tenacity win over skepticism and doubt, proving once again that, regardless of age, those who think outside the box are often those who become innovators and trailblazers. In his own way, Burt Munro was years ahead of his time. If only I could use a few nitroglycerin pills (for angina)in my personal auto or motorcycle, perhaps I, too, could make it to my destination in record time! Burt Munro was such a thinker. He took what life threw at him (an ailing cardiovascular system), and used it to make new discoveries with regard to the workings of the internal combustion engine. Talk about optimism! Mr. Munro offers us all a lesson in life. My only other thought is why Sir Anthony Hopkins didn't accept a role such as Mr. Munro before the Hannibal character. The former brings honor to humanity, while the latter disgraces it."
"EUyeshima","7","0","0","15 June 2006"," Hopkins in Peak Form as New Zealand's Legendary Speed Demon
","This 2005 film directed and written by Roger Donaldson is quite a charmer, a true family film with a genuinely heroic protagonist in a compelling story of triumph against the odds. Motorcycle enthusiast Burt Munro has fascinated Donaldson since he made a documentary about the New Zealand folk hero in 1973, ""Offerings to the Gods of Speed"", which is an invaluable extra in the 2006 DVD package. I can see why as this unassuming eccentric with MacGyver-level ingenuity is such a likable codger with his singular purpose of racing his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle during ""Speed Week"" on the pitch white desolation of the Bonneville Speedway.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Anthony Hopkins brings a great deal of heart to Munro and portrays this unique personality with economy and dexterity, even though his Munro-mimicking mumbled tones can make him hard to understand at times. The film follows his journey from Invercargill at the southern tip of New Zealand through the urban jungle of Hollywood to the wide expanses of the salt flats in Utah. It feels like four films combined into one with the first part establishing Munro's eccentricities and local celebrity relative to a watchful boy who lives next door and idolizes the old man. When Munro makes it to California, it becomes a bit like ""Crocodile Dundee"" or any fish-out-of-water comedy with Munro surviving by his wits in spite of his inbred trust in people. The third part is a more standard road movie that echoes ""Transamerica"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" for the stereotypical characters Munro runs into en route to Bonneville.<br/><br/>The fourth and final part of the film is the best, as it converts into a Rocky-like episode in Munro's challenging quest to compete and his ultimate victory. Donaldson makes the four sections feel relatively seamless, though I feel he could have edited the second and third parts more given how the pacing starts to lag. There are also some contrived plot elements that could have been jettisoned entirely like the youthful motorcycle gang who switch from threatening hooligans to Munro's financial supporters or the sequence with Diane Ladd as a woman who shares his bed for a night. Other than the Vietnam War soldier talking positively about Agent Orange, the movie actually romanticizes the U.S. of the 1960's in a way that's quite refreshing.<br/><br/>The race sequences near the end of the picture are powerfully executed. But it's really Hopkins who completely inhabits Munro and makes the whole movie work emotionally, and to his immense credit, he does it with a minimum of fuss. The DVD package is chock full of extras all due to the fact that Donaldson has so much passion about his subject. Beyond his original 1973 half-hour documentary on Munro, he lends expert commentary on an alternate track and is also the chief participant in the extensive 45-minute making-of featurette. There are also four deleted scenes plus a brief musical travelogue of New Zealand's Southland. The movie's theatrical run was shamefully limited last December, so hopefully the DVD package will give the movie the greater audience it deserves."

Roger Donaldson has been working on this movie for over 25 years so for him to get the project done,he can already die happy. It made no money in the box office but he doesn't care.<br/><br/>The movie is about an old man played by Anthony Hopkins that wanted to take his dream into reality. That is to have the world's fastest Indian (motorcycle). His own believer was the little boy next door and all the people he met in America rangeing from a used car salesman to a drag queen! Everyone he met had the hearts touched by the gentle old man.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was just amazing. Constantly asking the question ""What"" to everyone he met because of his hard hearing.<br/><br/>The movie had its few flaws such as when you fall off a motorcycle going over 150mph you will get more than a simple bruise but who cares. Other people criticize that the movie is off target from the events shown in the movie. Again who cares! Its a movie, not a documentary. Watch Domino! Anyways I believe this movie had a lot of heart and it wasn't just a typical go after your dreams type of movie. It had a lot more.

","If you go to a lot of movies, often you'll see the same preview over and over, and sometimes get so tired of it that you avoid the actual film when it's released because you're sick to death of the trailer. But one preview that made me happy every time I saw it was the U.S. trailer for The World's Fastest Indian, which starts off with the adrenaline pumping power chords of the Cult playing ""Wolf Child"" over a succession of quick cut racing imagesa customized 1920s Indian motorcycle shooting across the desert, down a two lane highway with a squad car chasing it, outrunning a biker gang at the beach, Anthony Hopkins skidding at high speed across the ground after wiping out and screaming defiantly the whole timethen switches to the revved up police siren guitar wail of the Clash doing ""Police On My Back,"" and you think, man, this is going to be a cool flick about a hell bent for leather old dude giving the young hot shots what for. But when you see the film, there's no Cult or Clash on the soundtrack, and Anthony Hopkins' character, Burt Munroa real life New Zealand racing legendturns out not to be some fired up old geezer, but rather a polite, mild mannered old guy with health problems due to angina who likes to tinker with his motorcycle and is determined to get to America to participate in the Bonneville time trials before he gets too old and infirm to make the trip. Most of the suspense of the movie comes not from whether he'll set the land speed record, but from whether he'll run out of money or keel over dead from a heart attack before he even gets there. The movie is mostly about how Munro makes it from New Zealand to America on nothing but a few bucks and a gentle, sweet disposition that charms everyone he encounters along the way, including a horny widowed Dianne Ladd in a lovely cameo. Truly a great feel good movie that's never saccharine or phony. The filmmaker previously directed a documentary about Burt Munro, and his love for the story shows in every frame."

","Hopkins performance is outstanding. I forgot he was Anthony Hopkins almost immediately. Everything about the movie was predictable but the storytelling was so rich and emotional that I didn't mind a bit. We all hear about amazing people who over come tremendous obstacles to do amazing things, this story is about an eccentric but mostly ordinary person who does some pretty difficult things. Subtly he endears people to himself; they in turn help him accomplish his high but ultimately realistic goals. By drawing people kindly into his dreams he is able to do a lot with limited resources. And everyone involved feels invested in his accomplishments. In the end it is not Burt who is learning what Burt and his motorcycle can do but everyone around him who sees what they might be able to do. On the negative side Hopkins's performance is so good that at times the others around him seemed bland and shallow by comparison. The gratuitous sexual encounters seemed more or less pointless. No bountiful romance or highly impacting relationship here just little sexual romps to show his already obvious humanity. I like sex just as much as the next guy most of us know that there are lonely people out there. I also found the commentary on the war thrown into the movie to be laborious and contrived. There was no need to somehow find a way to squeeze a lot of social commentary in to this very good movie and the movie ultimately suffers for it. A little more work and this movie could have been a 9 or a 10. Still there is much to recommend it and I would suggest it without hesitation. It's not a chick flick or a guy flick but more a family feel good film. There is some minor language but the sex is not very racy at all. Hope you enjoy it."

Last night I read all the comments for this movie and I thought the Kiwi ones were particularly good. The guy from Dunedan who was impressed by Anthony Hopkins ability to imitate the south island's unusual, vaguely Scotish accent and the other commentator who observed how Hopkins had avoided the all to frequently made mistake of using an Australian rather than New Zealand accent.<br/><br/>The commentators praise for Hopkins was more than justified-he embodied Burt Munro as much as a viewer unconnected with the actual people could judge. Again commentators have written that the Munro's family left the theater with tear filled eyes-a true comment about Hopkin's portrayal of Munro.<br/><br/>The movie was a story based on fact but nonetheless a story. People have criticised the scenes in American with the ""cardboard"" characters but I found them fascinating and having experience in the States I know that those characters play the exact roles that Donaldson gave them. I have encountered at different times virtually all those characters in nearly the same places as was depicted. To say they were cut-outs trivializes their existence and shows the superficiality of the observer.<br/><br/>To sum up, the movie is as great as so many people have said.

","As a motorcyclist and classic motorcycle fan, I thought this would be the best film ever, but there are several elements missing. Firstly, there is no antagonist. This gives the film a feeling that it meanders and drifts. Consequently, the film feels like two separate films spliced together. The first film feels like a road movie, and second a sports movie. Donaldson really needed to decide which it was going to be. Other than a slightly ropey plot development, the acting is superb, the characters well-rounded and developed and the photography excellent. My only other major gripe is Burt doesn't seem to spend enough time on the bike. There are two major characters in this film: Burt and the Indian motorcycle and the film doesn't really do the Indian justice.

Based on a true (motorcykle) story, yeah, but even those who are not interested in bikes or any kind of sport records will probably love this movie: Not a romantic comedy but an extremely entertaining drama, starring world class screenplay all over the line."

","Anthony Hopkins plays his part so well,you think he is going to die before he sets the world record. Everything in the movie is so believable it seems as though Burt is directing it from above. Although this movie is about getting the land speed record for the class of motorbike or as Burt says motorcicle(sic),it is far more about a man with a dream which he is determined to fulfil. Every character is cast well. I especially liked the Indian man. The movie gives a view of a time When people respected and helped each other and gave their time willingly.Something sadly laking today. Hopkins deserves all the awards going!"

When I walked out of the cinema I must say I was surprised and in a good way. This is a beautiful story of an old man fulfilling his childhood dream, Anthony Hopkins delivers a great job portraying Burt Munroe, a almost childish old man who makes friends with everyone he meats on his journey to Utah. Although this is a drama movie it has it bits of humor which lightens up the movie, but it isn't that much that it looks silly. All the supporting actors also deliver a great job. This movie is a great change from all those political thrillers and violence packed action movies, it's a beautiful story about an old man fulfilling his dream, a true gem of a movie."

","This is a film that will be played and repeated on t.v.for many years. I cannot think of a film that has portrayed such an array of emotions throughout the whole film. It is a brilliantly written emotional roller coaster of a film, portraying how ones outward positiveness (mixed on this occasion with true naivety, humour and determination)can win over almost anyone, from anywhere and how one should follow their dream if it means that much to them to the exclusion of all others. At one stage I was not sure whether the tears in my eyes (which occurred more than any other film that I have seen) were through joy, happiness, sadness or humour. During one scene I have never laughed as much since watching Faulty Towers series for the first time when it was first televised! The down to earth dialogue between all the different variety of characters from many walks of life, was only superseded (for me that is) by the array of classic cars seen in a few of the scenes. As a confidence coach this film would be a priceless piece of material. My wife really did not want to see it but her first words afterwards were ""absolutely brilliant"" and I could not agree more and I cannot wait to take my 15 year old daughter and some other friends."

","Excellent movie, a must see for any motorcycle enthusiast. If you have no interest in the sport you will find this movie entertaining for its human qualities. It was about a motorcyclist, and it wasn't. It was a human interest story, it was inspirational. Anthony Hopkins was perfect for this role. Can't imagine who else could have played it. It was well rounded, plenty serious yet lots of hearty laughs, and I'll admit to teary eyes. But most of all, you could really get onto the movie, the story line, and premise. Only once toward the end did I turn to my companion to comment that what had happened was unrealistic (I won't give anything way). Otherwise, it was easy to be swept into the story and root for the hero."
"kcirtap89","10","0","0","26 February 2006"," A new favorite
","The Worlds Fastest Indian may never be on my list of greatest movies, but it went on my list of favorites after about the first 10 minutes. I'll save the great list for Citizen Kane, the Godfather and other aristocrats. The favorite list is for ""real"" movies, like Some Like It Hot and Breaking Away, and now The Worlds Fastest Indian.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was superb. I forced myself back to reality at one moment, and tried to envision Hannibal Lecter or Richard Nixon. They were nowhere in the theater. It was just Burt Munro, and like everyone he met in the film, I was his new best friend. The supporting cast was just that, there to move the story and bring out the best in Hopkins. They were a perfect gathering of veteran and new talent, each ideally cast. Aaron Murphy as Tom in particular was a spot on casting call.<br/><br/>Here's a movie with little swearing, no violence, and no bad guy. It doesn't rely on special effects or CGI. The plot is driven by motorcycles and going fast, but that's not at all what the movie is about. It doesn't get into pistons and valves, and the words horsepower and torque are never uttered. It's about a man who has the perfect storm of a goal, a can-do attitude and unyielding determination. You can't not like the guy.<br/><br/>That said, if you're a motorsports fan you'll find even more to like. If you're a motorcycle buff, even more, and if you're a classic motorcycle enthusiast, there's a scene on a New Zealand beach that will give you goose bumps. <br/><br/>A more ambitious opening and marketing should have made this movie far more noticed, and would have undoubtedly garnered Hopkins an Oscar or other award nomination. It's not a blockbuster and it's not an art-house gem, and in a way it's almost fitting that this movie remains a semi-secret, hidden beneath the shadow of the politically driven films that dominate this year. I just hope it makes enough money to encourage the studios to keep making these good, character driven tales that completely absorb the viewer for a couple of hours. <br/><br/>The 2005 season will be remembered for the Academy Award nominated bunch, and blockbusters like Star Wars Episode III and The Wedding Crashers. But one day, years from now, when someone asks what my favorite movie is, this will be one of first that comes to mind."

","I viewed the Indin TV trailer with skepticism as so many of his recent movies have been ruined either by Hollywood or his silly ""famous' co-stars. I searched every cinema listing around Marietta GA and could find no mention of it. I did a Google on it and found it hidden away in an obscure cinema complex. I was so lucky to get to see it. There were five of us at the screening. This simple story must have been a delight for Anthony Hopkins to make. At times, I fully expected his character to be subjected to some nastiness by the natives, but his genuine human appeal won each and everyone over good or bad alike, and I was proud of them all. I laughed and cried for him. I loved the freshness of the supporting actors. It was a treat for me. Thank you Anthony."
"jdesando","Null","0","0","13 February 2006"," Hopkins worth every million he makes
","""I might be a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid."" Burt Munro <br/><br/>Most seniors Bert Munro's age are worried if the government will revoke their drivers' licenses. Burt Munro's biggest concern was how to get himself and his 1920 Indian Motorcycle from New Zealand to Utah's salt flats for the world land speed competition. That he gets there in 1967 and sets a record yet to be broken, over 200 mile per hour, is a fact most viewers know before the film starts, thanks to The World's Fastest Indian publicity at the recent Super Bowl and general knowledge about the ""best's"" in history with this one a least known entry.<br/><br/>Director Roger Donaldson's challenge, then, is to make Burt's character believable, lovable, and vulnerable to achieve a dramatic effect strong enough to overcome the lost surprise hook so necessary for most adventure stories. So he hires A-list actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, who is worth every million he makes by making us love his absent-minded, strong-willed racer with an accent seemingly perfect for a character not from London but from down under. Only David Lynch's ""Straight Story"" could compete for pulling a winner film out of an old man's random encounters on a slow-moving road trip.<br/><br/>Hopkins eschews flourishes of emotion and language to draw the audience into Burt's world of home-made pistons, pissing in the garden, and old-fogy lovemaking cradled in homespun aphorisms and clichés to be enjoyed from an historical overachiever who has lived more fully than almost anyone else he meets. Hopkins plays Burt loopy but brilliant and old but ambitious. Damned if Hopkins doesn't make an essentially slow picaresque seem just as fast as the record looming over Bonneville Salt Flats.<br/><br/>The film's disadvantage is that this down home wisdom and semi-eccentric behavior sometimes seem contrived and at other times a little banal. Lucky for everyone Hopkins' blue eyes are never dull nor is his instinct to make Munro interesting even if he were not. Overall the film is successful in showing that breaking the rules should be on everyone's to-do list, especially if adventure appears an appropriate antidote to the weight of time, whose daily dose of reality seems to neuter most of the aging population.<br/><br/>""Be wise with speed; A fool at forty is a fool indeed.""

This movie has inspired me as i am a Bonneville racer at heart and has motivated to pursue my dreams (since i was younger to go to the Saltflats). I have been in the last several years working on a twin engine motorcycle to race at the salt flats and basically following how B. Munro pursued his dream. I am 50 yrs old and am pleased to know that i am able to pursue my dream. I can not hardly wait for this movie to come out on DVD with behind the scenes so i can watch it over and over again and see what Anthony Hopkins has to say and why he was interested in this movie in particular and his ventures during the film making and why this movie was chosen to be filmed currently.

"mwvachon","10","0","0","3 February 2006"," World's Fastest Smile
","Don't let the title fool you, this movie might have been aptly titled, 'The World's Fastest Smile'. Being somewhat of a motorcycle nut myself, I was expecting a full-on, wrench turning, 2-wheeled indulgence type film. Sure there was a bit of mechanical intrigue along the way, but this was really a pure human interest-type story  and I still enjoyed every minute of it.<br/><br/>Hats off to Rodger Donaldson for bringing to light the wonderful adventures of Burt Munro, the New Zealander with a big dream. Rather than do a 'Hollywood' type biopic, Mr. Donaldson presents us with a warts-n-all depiction of Burt (played by Anthony Hopkins). All at once Mr. Munro is frail and indefatigable, innocent and coy, annoying and charming. Careful not to paint this person as a Don Quixote, the director has managed to convey his lead character as someone with near impossible dreams, but also someone who has the perseverance and knowledge to obtain them and surprise all whom dare doubt.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is wonderful to look at, but leaves you wanting a bit more. I would like to have seen a bit more of the picturesque Invercargill that Burt claimed to be the prettiest spot in the world. Also it would have been interesting to see a bit more of how Burt got on with his ship mates during the journey to the States. Having said that, the movie does roll right along, and there is nary a point when the storyline appears to bog down.<br/><br/>I'm sure, because the film is somewhat historical, there are some who will identify some errors or gaffes; but the story transcends any of that. I did wonder why one State Police car was 5 years old and in a later scene another State Police car used is actually a 1962 model (year the story takes place)  but it was of no consequence. It was great to see all the vintage iron, though, especially the various record seeking models at the Bonneville Flats.<br/><br/>As I said, the film could have easily been named 'The World's Fastest Smile', because Sir Anthony Hopkins has done such a great job in portraying the lead character and winning us all over with his boyish charm. The other supporting actors and actresses are also good, but they can't compete with Burt/Anthony in the same scene. One real standout is Aaron Murphy, as Sam, the young boy from next door with parents that obviously disapprove of his association with Burt. The exchanges between them are a sort of mirror for Burt  a way for us to see how the childlike side of this character compares to an actual youth.<br/><br/>This may be a film about a motorcycle, but it's a rare film that has something for everyone. If you enjoy a movie that will make you smile and tug on your heartstrings, this is a must-see!"

","I wanted so much to like this movie, but it just got to be too much to bear. ""Crazy but Sweet"" Burt gets on your nerves after the first 10 minutes and it becomes a challenge to grit it through the hackneyed situations and corny dialogue.<br/><br/>The gratuitous menagerie of ""California Flakes"" that Burt encounters on his trip to the USA is also way over the top.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie got any stars at all was that the motorcycle scenes are above average, though the manipulation of the film speed is pretty irritating.<br/><br/>Sorry, but this turns out to be a big yawn."
"noralee","6","3","8","23 February 2006"," Hopkins is Charming in Thin Story of An Obsessive Quest
","""World's Fastest Indian"" is a fairly charming road movie, but, even as based on a true character, Anthony Hopkins's obsessive Mr. Magoo wears thin. <br/><br/>As a straightforward story of the eccentric retiree Burt Munro who from faraway New Zealand dreams of breaking a speed record in Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats with the titular home-jiggered motorcycle that he entertainingly fixes like McGyver's mechanic, the film lacks the poignancy or self-reflection of ""The Straight Story"". Hopkins in a promotional interview noted how Munro's obsessions had driven off friends and family, but we get little sense of those conflicts other than neighborhood annoyance at his messy lawn. <br/><br/>The opening scenes at his home base have the feel of 1960's authenticity. He takes wry note of what others view as symbols of mortality that he has avoided - graves, war, the flu pandemic, cigarette smoking, etc. -- but he sees all that as proof of his luck.<br/><br/>Even if true (and I haven't seen director Roger Donaldson's documentary this is based on), he seeks his fortune by meeting up with a rainbow too full of too colorful characters -- roustabouts, a Hollywood transvestite, a real Indian in Nevada, a soldier on leave from spraying Agent Orange in Viet Nam (a sweet Patrick Flueger), a randy widow (Diane Ladd unusually over the top) among other older women repetitively giving him the eye and more, a Latino car dealer (Paul Rodriguez in a non-comic role), before reaching fellow speed junkies gathering for ""Speed Week."" Yeah we get that he was dependent on the kindness of strangers. <br/><br/>Hopkins keeps his character consistent throughout, from the accent to the partial deafness, childlike trust and compulsive focus on details. It is nice to see that he can do a regular guy and not just ego-maniacal geniuses, presidents, dictators, emperors, murderers, etc., and without hiding behind make-up or costumes.<br/><br/>The cinematography by David Gribble of his highway journey from the California docks to an Utah we haven't seen in films before is lovely. The speeding scenes are fun roller coaster rides."

","I saw the movie at a special screening. I loved it. It was a great story about a man who never let go of his dream. The only thing that I didn't like was the ending. The entire movie was building to this great event. But when the event finally came, it wasn't depicted as a anything super special. Maybe I'm the type of movie buff that likes heroic events to take place with ""Feel Good Music"", loud cheering, high fives, hugs and maybe even some tears of joy. I was kind of bummed when none of these took place. Burt achieved his goal and nothing happens. The next thing you know, he's back in New Zealand. I guess its not a big deal, but thats the only thing I didn't like. I would recommend that anyone see it. Its still a wonderful story."
"dwconnl","3","6","22","18 September 2006"," Hopkins meets the Hallmark Channel
","Anthony Hopkins is, in ""Indian"" simply a great actor in a mediocre film. I don't understand how they talked him into it, but there he is. Though the role surely didn't tax him, without him, ""Indian"" would sink from mediocre to trite. <br/><br/>The story follows Bert Munro, a 70-ish character from New Zealand who lives in a squalid shed, has no life outside his obsession with his 40-year old motorcycle, rarely washes, and rails against smoking and drinking at every opportunity. Of course, the whole town adores Ol' Bert and every old woman he meets just can't wait to bed him. Sure.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure if we're supposed to notice that Ol' Bert is a walking disaster zone. Strangers have to continually intercede to protect him from his own foolish and dangerous decisions. When he finally bumbles his way to the Salt Flats, he remains true to form and relies on sympathy to get him past the safety rules. If they'd have put thick glasses on Hopkins, they could have titled it ""Mr. Magoo's World Speed Record"". That the Kiwi crackpot actually made some speed records somewhat diminishes my respect for the endeavor. <br/><br/>The movie is slow and quite two dimensional considering its 2+ hour length. Movies this corny usually have furry stars. Visually, its on par with made-for TV stuff. The bonus material has a brief tourist promo on New Zealand that's visually far better than anything in the movie. Hopkins is the only positive, but he could've done this one in his sleep. On second thought, he did. His name, however, undoubtedly provided cover for many to heap undeserved praise on this thoroughly forgettable two hours. Somebody should check their passports."

","This is not just another sports film. The World's Fastest Indian, starred by Anthony Hopkins, contains subtle emotion from the main character, Burt Munro, with honest and hidden emotion that never pretends to be something it isn't. That's what makes this movie so good; most films tend to breakdown into faked hysterics, but this gem actually knows real emotion to carry audiences with them. The film contains some extremely tense moments as well as a subtle yet realistic performance by Anthony Hopkins who remains completely convincing throughout the film and who remains never falling out of the character he is playing. The film also contains some good cinematography, good editing to subtly transition the scenes together and a direction cleverly controlled by the right hands, Roger Donaldson's. I suggest you give this a watch!"

The great thing about this movie is that the dramatization contains a whole bunch of funny quirks here and there that this movie should also be considered as a comedy genre too. This movie also shows us about culture clashes and shocks, and how we should be facing them accordingly. Hopkins really acted nicely. He gets into his character well. Seeing his role as having quite a hearing loss, I personally quite accepted that this is what Hopkins' current mental health state until I remembered that he acted out in contrary in his role in Meet Joe Black."
"peter-pg-goh","9","1","2","15 January 2012"," How to make friends and influence people
","Great movie. Loved the fact it was based on a true story. I think it makes films so much more amazing if they are. It seems to me that the role of the film maker, in this circumstance, is to communicate what actually happened to their audience. And in this case this film manages to achieve this. I love the way the main character's sheer determination and will is so heavily offset by his ineptitude, bad health and lack of money. This makes Burts journey (literally in this case) even more colossal. Of course, all of this makes for thrilling watching as I was always left in suspense as to whether he will 'make it'. In this case 'making it' is setting a land speed record. Although it's not something that I care anything about, because Burt (the main character) does (well done Antony Hopkins for portrait this so vividly) and because he obsesses about it as a viewer I cared about it....or about him I should say. Having said how inept and under prepared Burt is, it is obvious that his major strength comes from his confidence. The way that he interacts with the strangers is compelling and straight forward. He manages to make friends and influence people without really trying. I think I would feel apologetic in asking for the help he wanted. I think this characters outlook is to say 'why would you not help'. I don't know whether I am reading too much into it. Maybe his outlook is I want this thing so badly I don't understand why I should have to apologise for it. Either reading is probably valid, though I like the first one better. Why doesn't this get a 10 then? Well bad kiwi accent aside, and apart from the fact the humour, although on paper, very funny, lacked certain punch, I felt as though this film was missing something profound about it. I don't know whether it is my pre-disposition to want something profound in a 'based on a true story' drama. Honestly, I don't think it is. I think any film (be it action or comedy or whatever) must have this for me to reach a 10. It must have something that resonates something very deeply in me. I thought it had touches of this. Still 9 is a pretty good score right?"

","It's been a while since I've seen a Reader's Digest, but I remember one of its standard features, ""My Most Unforgettable Character."" The hero of The Worlds Fastest Indian would most certainly be topic of that feature. Burt Munro was certainly a ""character"" and is a New Zealand legend.<br/><br/>The film is a dramatization of several months in the late 1960's of his extraordinary life in which he traveled to the Bonneville Salt Flats in order to attempt setting a land speed record for his 1920 Indian motorcycle.<br/><br/>We begin by seeing Burt - played by Anthony Hopkins - working in his workshop on parts for his beloved Indian and soon discover that his workshop is actually his home - a shed on a suburban lot covered with overgrown weeds. The appearance of his shed and lot - plus the noise he makes at all hours with his motorcycle - are somewhat of an annoyance to his neighbor, but we soon learn that he appears to be universally liked in his community.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins gives a more than excellent performance in portraying this man obsessed with his dream yet thoroughly likable, somewhat innocent, and a little more than randy. Yes, he basically is ""a dirty old man"" but totally lovable in that guise.<br/><br/>In addition to Hopkins' endearing representation, the whole movie has an easy feel of an earlier, more innocent time. All of the people that Burt meets in his quest are people we would also enjoy meeting. This makes the whole movie a viewing of easy pleasure.<br/><br/>On the DVD, you are also treated to a lengthy documentary about the real Burt. Both the documentary and the film are a labor of love for director, Roger Donaldson, and that love shines on the screen."

","Tuesday January 10, 7:00pm The Harvard Exit, Seattle Thursday February 2, 7:00pm The Uptown Theater, Seattle<br/><br/>Take a little Cervantes, throw in some Monster Garage, add an afternoon tea break and you've got Burt Munro. He's a sweet old motorhead with a heart condition, who mows his lawn with gasoline and a lit match. Sir Anthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as the Kiwi curmudgeon who dreams of taking his ancient drag bike half way around the world to Speed Week on Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. ""The World's Fastest Indian"" chronicles the true story of Munro's impossible 1967 journey. He manages to avoid one disaster after another while endearing himself to a colorful menagerie of characters he meets along the way. The twenties era Indian Motorcycle is a work of art and the high speed film effects on the salt flats are wonderful. ""This guy is the real thing!"" Anyone with a jones for vintage motorcycles and lost causes will love this reckless and happy little film."

","I saw this at Cinema Sundays at the Charles in Baltimore.<br/><br/>The host, Jonathan Palevsky, actually arranged to have three Indian motorcycles in the theater for us to check out! And their owners were there to talk about them. Really cool! I enjoyed it a lot. Good acting, not overdone. Beautiful cinematography, just exquisite. Neat characters. Exciting story.<br/><br/>Parts of the film feel artificial -- the disclaimer says that although the film is based on real events, some characters are made up, some are composites, and some events are - I believe the word used is: ""fictionalized."" There are definitely times when you think, 'yeah, uh, huh, riiight."" Still, really exciting, good story. I suspect kids would like it, maybe eight and up, maybe 10. Or it might not grab kids until early teens, I'm not sure. But it's suitable for them - at least I'd have taken my kid to it when she was eight.<br/><br/>I hope word of mouth is good to this picture. I think motorheads are going to dig the heck out of this picture, if they see it (the ones at Cinema Sundays seemed to), and I think effete intellectual snobs will like it too (*I* did!!). I said about ""The Greatest Game Ever Played,"" ""It's a chick flick - but it's about GOLF!"" :O) Same with WFI. As it says in the trailer: based on one hell of a true story."

","I saw this on a plane, and even though it was on that little screen, this film has left me feeling glad I saw it. Antony Hopkins is great as Burt, who has to battle a lot of things to pursue his dream of racing at Bonneville. The film has many positives, showing Burt to have been an open-minded, easygoing guy. There are some funny scenes and some classic one-liners of the sort a guy like Burt would use. There were a few good laughs and a few touching moments. I reckon everybody would get something from this film. It's great to see something that's not full of violence or mean-spirited people. When it comes out here I might even go and see it on the big screen. There are some cool cars and scenery (and sounds) for folk that like drag racing and just general mechanically cool stuff going on. Excellent movie!"

","""The World's Fastest Indian"" tells a great true story, Burt Munro's epic journey from small-town old kook to record-beating hero. It's just a pity that, unlike its hero, who displays grit, imagination, and originality, this film rides a long highway of often cringe-inducing clichés. Right from the word go, we have such standard feel-good movie touches as the adorable little boy who assists, the nasty neighbors who harass, the wise old Indian man who gives Burt a good-luck charm, chirping American gals cheering him on, and, worst of all, the cute and friendly transvestite who aids our hero. On cue, Burt develops a heart condition for pathos. On cue, Burt drives on the wrong side of the road for big laughs. He even sets fire to his lawn just to prove what a grand old eccentric guy he is.<br/><br/>Scene after scene in Roger Donaldson's script presents a stock character type, an anachronism, a self-contorting attempt to please the audience, or Anthony Hopkins drawling on with some tinned old codger rumination or dirty talk. Hopkins' accent wanders all the way from Wales to Wellington and over to Long John Silver, even as he gives the part his best and carries the film along on his back. It's a pity the film progresses so unimaginitively, because Donaldson is a good image-maker and the climactic scenes are extremely well-done. It's a crowd-pleaser, but it pleases the crowd with a bunch of tricks they've seen too many times before. This racer stalls at the starting line. Send it to the junk yard."

","Every once in a while, a movie comes along which the general public seems to just adore, lapping up every second of it, which, when I see it... I simply cannot understand the draw, nor how the average viewer could find anything to appreciate in such a mess of a movie. The World's Fastest Indian seems to be one of the above, and it seems undeniable that I am in the strong minority here, but it is beyond me how so many viewers could take so strongly to such a trite, clichéd, rambling mess of a film. <br/><br/>While it's true that the story of New Zealander Burt Monroe is without a doubt an incredibly impressive tale of inspiration and hope, his movie incarnation does him no justice whatsoever, as it seems nothing more than a great story hiding within a terrible movie. Director Roger Donaldson has tied together a remarkably disjointed film, stretching out barely and hour and a half worth of plot material over two hours in length, sloshing on every possible cliché all the while. There are so many scenes which seem thrown in simply for the purpose of adding more running time to the movie, (is a scene with Munroe taking a transvestite out to lunch really necessary in furthering the storyline?) or giving Anthony Hopkins yet another chance to show how charming and affable Monroe really was. At first this is tolerable, but after about 20 minutes of thrown in pointless scenes, this plot padding really starts to grate on the viewer's nerves. And it is irresistible to point out the irony of a movie based around speed being so slow moving and anti-climatic. <br/><br/>Such irritation is strongly contributed to by the simply banal musical score, which plays upon literally almost every single movie music cliché in a particularly tasteless fashion, sounding almost like a bad Disney animated movie score. Why on earth Donaldson would choose such a turgid composer for his film is beyond conventions of logic, but it seems simply yet another terrible lapse in judgement. It goes without saying that Donaldson's screenplay is also a trite, painfully conventional piece of work, so straightforward and formulaic it could be churned up by most screenwriters in their sleep. It's also a shame that such beautiful scenery is wasted by the bland and uninspired cinematography, which seems determined to capture as little of the astonishing landscapes as possible, opting instead for more and more shots of Hopkins grimacing on his bike. For a director with such well known past credentials, it would seem Donaldson needs to take a trip back to film school to learn how to make an entertaining movie yet again. <br/><br/>While Hopkins is the film's indisputable highlight, even he fails to live up to the hype surrounding his performance, including his own overzealous declaration of his performance as Munroe being ""the best piece of work I've ever done"". While his Munroe is a charming and affable fellow, a welcome break in character for Hopkins, Donaldson's idea of building a compelling character seems to be relying on Hopkins making the same cutesy mannerisms over and over again. (yes it is funny and charming the first time he doesn't hear what somebody says, or does something oddball and likable, but after the 30th time this is less endearing) A strong performance, yes, but in terms of being enough to carry an otherwise very weak film... not in the least. <br/><br/>While The World's Fastest Indian was likely meant to be a heartwarming tale of hope and dedication, it's extremely difficult not to choke on the tirades of sap or stumble over every single Hollywood cliché which is revisited in the tale. While Hopkins gives an indisputably charming and likable performance, it is nowhere near enough to resurrect a film which has so little merit of any sort keeping it going. The irony of a movie dedicated to speed being so slow moving itself is one of the painfully few bits of merit to be found in this horrifyingly conventional interpretation of one of the true stories which should in all fairness have translated well into a film. The story deserved a far better telling than this. <br/><br/>-4/10"

Anthony Hopkins never seemed to me to be anyone other than A Hopkins with a very dodgy accent and the other characters seemed totally predictable(and pointless).

A selection of characters dragged in for no reason..literally dragged,in the case of the transvestite.An older women apparently finding him irresistible and with woeful lines to mouth, in fact the whole script was cringe-worthy.There was never any doubt that good old Burt was going to have his attempt at Bonneville..the scenes at the salt flats being the only interesting thing about the film.

Boring, slow, and way too long (2 hours). I'm not sure how much of the story was real, but the befriending of the transvestite seemed way over the top and tacked on. And aside from Hopkins, the acting was horrible...almost too painful to watch at times. I don't know whether to blame the supporting cast or the screenplay, but it was BAD (it's funny how you don't really notice good acting...only bad acting).<br/><br/>The scenes at Bonneville at the end of the movie are the only redeeming factor in this movie, but not worth sitting through the first hour and a half."

","This is the typical example of an average movie where everything is as academic as you could get. Indeed the story of this motorcycle and speed aficionado is depicted in a completely vapid and predictable way, with no originally or passion whatsoever, and with the use of cringeworthy grandiloquent violins that cheaply try to arouse the viewer's emotions. Granted, nothing is fundamentally bad in this movie, everything is just average. Anthony Hopkins who usually does a good job seemed as uninspired as Roger Donaldson, whose approach clearly lacked grip and was overly sugarcoated, the epic biopic turning into a dreadfully banal TV movie."

","A surprisingly good film, though I wish Anthony Hopkins would either stay away from doing accents altogether, or learn to do them properly. He sounded more like a Dorset farmer than a New Zealand Farmer. That said, it was a heart warmingly original film that showed humanity at it's best, which is something that can only be portrayed in fact-based dramas. The peripheral characters were allowed to be virtuous, despite being shown sometimes as obnoxious or obstinate. The triteness of some characters i found to be acceptable as they saved time on being a brief overview of the culture shock. I didn't particularly like the style of acting of Anthony Hopkins as it seemed he was doing a Robert Duvall impersonation, which i think Robert Duvall would have done better (referring to the laughs he does after most sentences to show his happy-go-lucky nature)."

","To Go Faster: that was the single-minded purpose of Herbert J. ""Burt"" Munro (1899  1978), whose life story was an ""inspirational movie"" just waiting to happen.<br/><br/>The tagline boasts, ""based on one hell of a true story,"" justifiably it would seem, as Munro  a fearless, free-spirited New Zealand rider who broke land speed records in his 60s - was one hell of a character.<br/><br/>*The World's Fastest Indian* is the quixotic tale of Munro's first trek from his provincial home town of Invercargill, New Zealand, to Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats, to tilt at the land speed record in what he hopes will become The World's Fastest Indian  his modified 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle. Reading like the archetypal Hollywood tearjerker, it is fortunate that archives of Munro interviews and riding footage still exists, to corroborate that his tale was indeed a real life template for underdog movies.<br/><br/>As with any ""true"" story, director-writer Roger Donaldson (whose resumé is a laundry list of recognizable films: The Bounty, No Way Out, Cocktail, Species, Dante's Peak) composites events and characters to squeeze Munro's storied life into 127 minutes of fish out of water hell on wheels. Lifting many of the anecdotes and dialog from Munro himself (from a documentary Donaldson directed in 1973, which appears on the DVD: *Offerings to the God of Speed*), Donaldson admits to Munro's legend blurring over the years, ""There were many stories that I'd heard that just could not have been true and then there were stories that I knew to be true that were hard to believe."" <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, as Munro, gives a startling performance (for his utter divergence from all things Hannibal or Uptight Butler), paying supreme tribute to Munro by burying himself in a role which is part absent-minded professor, part master mechanic, all nutjob  the type of guy who, when told to mow his thigh-high lawn, torches it with gasoline, not through any malice, but with an ingenuousness that would somehow endear him to all he came in contact with.<br/><br/>The able supporting cast reads like a B-Actor cameo call: Chris Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Paul Rodriguez, Christopher Lawford, and notable appearances by Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd, to further the fact that ""dirty old men need love too."" <br/><br/>Accompanied by the Indian he worked on for decades like a lover, Munro's quest would see him paying his way across the Pacific as cook onboard a tramp steamer, using a log as a wheel when the desert highway claims his makeshift trailer, choking down a Native American's gift of powdered dog's balls for his prostate, stealing petrol from the official race supply, letting his tailpipe char his calf during a record attempt rather than stopping, battling his own ailing heart, butting heads with regulation-raunchy officials and  the most horrible trial of all  spending two nights in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Was Munro such a yokel that, instead of finding a hotel in Long Beach (where he would pick up his bike from Customs the next day), he would rather trek all the way north into Hollywood for the night just to ""see film stars""? Apparently so. With scenes that read like a clunky *Crocodile Dundee*, Munro winds up at the Flamingo Sunset hotel, promptly getting ripped off by a fake flower-girl, propositioned by an old hooker and meeting a transvestite within the space of two minutes. (When I first moved to Hollywood, it took me three whole months to get taken by a small-time hustler, propositioned by a skanky hooker and befriend a she-male.) <br/><br/>Cutting down on the weight of his bike - and against all regulations - Munro saw no need even for brakes (""I'm planning on going, not stopping"") or a parachute (""I'm not planning on bailing out""). From the poverty-stricken, ascetic life he led, it was no wonder he was eternally ready to die with his boots on. If Munro had nothing else, he had balls. And plenty of 'em. Which accounts for his simple philosophy, ""You live more in five minutes on a bike like this going flat out than some people live in a lifetime."" And also accounts for the trail of bodacious, wrinkled squeeze he left in his wake (Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd).<br/><br/>For those who believe in planetary alignments and other such nonsense, the whole solar system must have conspired to aid Burt Munro in those days leading to the 1962 Bonneville Speed Week, as fortuitous event after fortuitous event nudges him towards his goal, everyone's heart melting over Burt's cause (from competitors to race officials alike), creating a syrupy Disney contagion that seems non-believable at times, but which must have some basis in reality, as the shattered records are testament to this broke, obsessive, neighborhood nuisance becoming a living legend.<br/><br/>Some of Munro's land speed records still stand to this day.<br/><br/>It's a sobering thought that there must be thousands of fanatical old tinkerers out there who obsess over seemingly ridiculous, esoteric pastimes, any of which, with the right set of circumstances, could land them in history books.<br/><br/>Burt Munro just happened to be the wrong man in the right place at the fastest time.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"

Simply never a dull moment with another outstanding portrayal by Anthony Hopkins. Let's face it, old geezers are seldom as interesting in movies as the young; but the audience is totally sucked into old Bert's never-quit plan to finish his life only after his life's greatest goal is made into reality. It does not take $150 million to make a good movie, and Indian never for a second looks like a cheap film. Compare that to New Zealand's most awful contribution to film-making, Peter Jackson, who spent 100 times the cost of this fine film to create a dreadful silly ""remake"" of King Kong. May Roger Donaldson be praised and may we never forget Jackson's kindergarten-like squandering of $150 million of ticket-buyer's money -- simply to create a mess."

","In my opinion, the generous viewers who gave this film top marks believe that engine works on bathos. No: engines work on highly explosive fuel mixture and expertise, none of it visible here. Munro is described as a god old-timer with a bee in his bonnet and some back-in-the-woods good sens. Why do scriptwriters believe that the public is a technical moron in this technical world? Why is it all right to show the highly technical way Audrey Hepburn learns to break an egg in ""Sabrina"" (1954), and unacceptable to explain a minimum of how to lower a center of gravity, and what's a fuel blend (even Schwarzenegger shows how to blend explosives in The 6th Day)? Viewers are indeed supposed to have a heart, but they are not necessarily brain-dead.

","These are the kind of films I like, an eccentric lead character to take you through an uplifting and feel-good journey, and it is story that really happened, from director Roger Donaldson (Species, Dante's Peak, The Bank Job). Basically Burt Munro (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is the ageing pensioner from New Zealand who has been dreaming for twenty five years about taking his motorcycle, an ""Indian"", to the salt flats of Bonneville, Utah and breaking a land speed record. So, when heart disease threatens his life, he mortgages his house to get the money he needs to travel to Los Angeles, he gets the Indian through customs, and one in America he buys an old car and begins his journey. Along the way, stopping for food and mending the motorcycle when damaged and for improvements, he meets and charms many people with his open and direct friendliness, and some of these people seem just as unusual as him. They include the foreign car salesman Fernando (Rat Race's Paul Rodriguez), transvestite Tina (Chris Williams) who helps run a brothel he stays in, Native American Jake (Saginaw Grant) who gives him natural medicine to help his prostate problems, elderly Ada (Diane Ladd) who helps him repair the racer and becomes his lover, and young Air Force pilot Rusty (Patrick Flueger) from Vietnam he gives a ride to. Burt finally reaches the salt flats, greeted by fellow racer Jim Moffet (Christopher Lawford), but it looks like for a while he may not be able to run as he did not register three months ago, and they inspect his vehicle thinking that it is not safe enough, having no parachute, no proper breaks, and no heat resistant clothing. They also worry that his health is a problem for him, but all his new friends help him stand against the organisers, and they do decide to bend the rules to let him have what might be his last opportunity. He successfully clocks a new record speed on his recorded run, and Burt returns home to keep improving his Indian to run another nine times, setting numerous more records, one still unbeaten in the present day. Also starring Iain Rea as George, Tessa Mitchell as Sarah, Aaron Murphy as Tom, Tim Shadbolt as Frank, Annie Whittle as Fran, Bruce Greenwood as Jerry and Road Trip's Jessica Cauffiel as Wendy. Hopkins is wonderful, it is his finest performance since The Silence of the Lambs, he is just the lovable eccentric who makes everyone feel good, the audience included, and you really get into the story, with the interesting characters in his road trip, and of course you hope he achieves what he wants to, a great and highly watchable heartwarming adventure based on a true story. Very good!"

There are such men though I don't doubt they'll be kept as far away from the limelight as they can.<br/><br/>I'd always thought there was something slightly wrong with Hopkins in the Zorro movies. He just doesn't seem athletic enough though otherwise he seems a clever choice. But in this movie, I was so taken with Mr. Hopkins' ability to breathe a unique life into the role of Burt Munro that I immediately wondered why I hadn't seen this level of dazzling brilliance before. Could it be that Mr. Hopkins is only recently in his prime? I don't really know but I do know I wouldn't hesitate recommending this wonderful movie to anyone -- man, woman and child. I know the type in real life. Someone capable of tinkering away in his garage making something beautiful out of an old heap. Such people exist and deserve to be immortalized in their own right. But this is also a movie about a man with an indomitably sunny disposition who somehow manages to have his way in a world usually obsessed with exclusion and propriety. We can only hope that the real Burt Munro was as winning a fellow as Mr. Hopkins portrays because I'd hate to think he didn't deserve this very effecting homage."

","Anthony Hopkins said that this character 'Burt Munro' was his all time favorite to play. and it shows. i was absolutely entranced by him.<br/><br/>Not only was i entranced by his performance but by the refreshing style of the movie, the characters, the sentiment.<br/><br/>i have to say a big thank you to the film makers of this movie - the directors vision made real, the producers too.<br/><br/>its so rare to see a movie that is worth every cent it cost to make and much much more.<br/><br/>i hope this is just the beginning of some great films to be produced.<br/><br/>i would love to see tom cruise play a gay man i think that would be - interesting and totally scary for him as he seems so controlled in his movie choices- the last great movie and performance for tom - le stat in interview with a vampire."

","Very good acting from Hopkins and the New Zealanders. Americans were too hammy I thought.<br/><br/>Thought they could have made a bit more of the story and I agree with another who posted here that the film should have given us more of an insight into Burt's love of machinery. You got the sense they were too afraid to go far into the nuts and bolts of the bike for fear of boring people but I think that was a mistake.<br/><br/>Do you get the sense I was disappointed? Well, yes. But I went in with quite high expectations for this film and when that happens I'm usually let down somewhat."
